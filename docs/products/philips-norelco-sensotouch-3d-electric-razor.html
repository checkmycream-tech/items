            <li>It does a very good, almost excellent job on my cheeks</li>
            <li>While the aesthetics of this 1250x/40 is very pleasant, its day-by-day use is impractical.</li>
            <li>It did not do a very good job.</li>
            <li>But, the 3D and the Panasonic are also very good shavers and will get the job done.</li>

            <li>also price was very good, 50 $ discount.</li>
            <li>Very good razor.</li>
            <li>The product works very good also.</li>
            <li>also if I could do it again I would go ahead and upgrade to the package that comes with the cleaner as cleaning it manually can be a chore and not do very good job.  </li>
            <li>fastest  best shave I have ever experienced.</li>

            <li>He loved it!</li>
            <li>I paid a lot for this hoping for a good Razor!</li>

            <li>The razor was great for my beard, but Norelco changed the replacement head from RQ12 to RQ12+.  </li>
            <li>Great job</li>

            <li>Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I shave every couple of days and this shaver works great in shower with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I am quite happy.</li>
            <li>Great razor</li>
            <li>The trimmer isn&#x27;t all that great, but the floating head shaver is great in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor.</li>
            <li>just anywhere, it had great reviews, but reading two exclusivamentes where one said that he was shaving with razor and test this</li>
            <li>It really is great.  </li>
            <li>Great with or without form.</li>

            <li>The shaver works great.</li>
            <li>Great company to buy from.</li>
            <li>Its really great, it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>This was honestly the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Nice price, excellent shaver .&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Not at all happy with this razor.  </li>
            <li>Great shave with this razor.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Very nice shaver.</li>
            <li>Very handy for travel, no need to pack a razor and gel / cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Build quality - all are very nicely put together.</li>
            <li>A very nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A very nice bonus.    </li>
            <li>Pull the one piece triplehead unit off the charged up Norelco shaver and hold the triplehead unit under very warm running water from the showerhead for a couple seconds.</li>
            <li>I find it is very nice.</li>
            <li>very nice slim body</li>
            <li>Works very nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is still very easy to clean--a very nice gift for that guy!</li>
            <li>It does a nice close shave (not as close as a blade, but very good).  </li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I have been a norelco tripple header user for more than 30 years and this 1250x/40 3d shaver is the best i have.  </li>
            <li>Even a $25 stand-alone trimmer would be better than the best built-in trimmer you can find out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>and I am very impressed and satisfied.</li>
            <li>I STILL think it is a great shaver, the way it shaves in really good and efficient.</li>
            <li>Razor does nice job!</li>
            <li>love it,  works wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied, a product of excellent quality.</li>
            <li>If you liked this review, please mark it as helpful!</li>
            <li>I was expecting to be blown away by a great shaver and wasn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s still good.  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the way the Norelco worked with just water, but i found it was much better when using some shaving cream</li>
            <li>i AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE SHAVER, IT SHAVES A LOT BETTER.</li>
            <li>I love it and have had some of the best shaves ever.</li>
            <li>Best shave ever after many years of non rated shavers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice shave!</li>
            <li>,I am very happy now as its very light and shave smoothly,also its good value for money here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>my boyfriend might love that!!! :)</li>
            <li>The shaver fits perfectly in the hand and has a good feel to it, it feels like some thought was put into it&#x27;s design and top quality materials were used in the manufacturing process.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant.</li>
            <li>Easily the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Top-notch design and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable to shave and very good</li>
            <li>He said it is very good, very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I tried a Norelco Spectra and loved it.</li>
            <li>I settled on the Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d shaver because the descriptions of what it could do design wise was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t describe how impressive it is to have an electric razor that doesn&#x27;t sound like a weed whacker.</li>
            <li>However, this was a good exception to the rule.      </li>
            <li>And not as good, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>So that means you are spending $70 a year to use this shaver at the optimum performance.</li>
            <li>And I loved the price Amazon had.</li>
            <li>I have always used Norelco Shavers with good results,until now.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic takes about 4 min for a good shave; the Braun clocks in at about 5</li>
            <li>(It feels good going over my bony knees, also)  </li>
            <li>At Christmastime, I decided to check out reviews for the razors to find that Philips were a good buy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my 1250X for about 2 months, and I&#x27;m delighted with it.</li>
            <li>I received a sensor touch razor as a gift and loved it.</li>
            <li>Norelco seemed like a good brand</li>
            <li>but I it just wasn&#x27;t a good machine for me.</li>
            <li>hey, still a good product.</li>
            <li>My Father received it and has had nothing but good things to say.</li>
            <li>This Shaver Provides a superior shave-</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>sometimes it&#x27;s a good idea to throw caution to the wind</li>
            <li>The Jet system will also lubricate and charge the shaver as well, so it&#x27;s a good buy if you can keep it in one place - traveling with it</li>
            <li>After a couple days of shaving to get my face acclimated to the shaver, I was very happy with how smooth my face was.  </li>
            <li>I gave it one more try with the 3d model which impressed me immediately with the greatly reduced noise and the more effortless shaving.</li>
            <li>I loved this razor.</li>
            <li>just avery good razor</li>
            <li>it is superior to the Braun 7 which is heavier and slower.    </li>
            <li>Every usersaid that it is good and work well.</li>
            <li>have used a Braun electrical shaver for years, a good and reliable shaver.  </li>
            <li>a good gift for your loved ones.</li>
            <li>Also Amazon&#x27;s price is good.</li>
            <li>It was a good shave, but it required work.</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t giving me a good shave.</li>
            <li>Without shaving cream, it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job at all, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what was surprising to me.</li>
            <li>I got this Philips Norelco Shaver with a good price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It keeps its charge fairly well&lt;</li>
            <li>so I decided this would be a good idea for him.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor a year ago to replace a Norelco 8020X which I loved.</li>
            <li>It did a good job shaving</li>
            <li>The ease of cleaning was good as well.  </li>
            <li>Good razor.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t the closet electric razor I have ever used but the quality and feel of the shave makes it a good purchase.</li>
            <li>The RQ12 (replacement) razor heads are good but pricey.</li>
            <li>loved it.</li>
            <li>If you can afford one, it&#x27;s definitely a good investment.  </li>
            <li>It also does not appear to be good for razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I do not have to go over and over areas and contort to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>I also have problems with ingrown hairs but razor still works good with that too.</li>
            <li>philips seems to have good customer care</li>
            <li>amazed AND delighted.</li>
            <li>Not as good as a blade</li>
            <li>The Norelco bests it in every way except for the electronic display and battery life, which are superior on the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Good close shave.</li>
            <li>this deal it is your good</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>the after Christmas looked for sales, did my homework, found the BEST electric razor available.  </li>
            <li>Because of the flaw this razor has never been any good as a travel razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The truth is, the $30 razor I carry with me on trips shaves just as good as this thing does.</li>
            <li>Philips is always good.</li>
            <li>Great battery life, nice design.  </li>
            <li>But its good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use this while plugged in to charge and the sideburn trimmer is not as good.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed at how smooth it glides on my skin and how it got to every size of hair.</li>
            <li>The model I was using had 4 years of good service</li>
            <li>The GOOD news:</li>
            <li>Yes, it looks good.  </li>
            <li>The heads cut well, I think just as good as the 8150.  </li>
            <li>My husband loved this shaver now</li>
            <li>The Norelco Sensotouch 3D model 1250x is a good shaver.</li>
            <li>Good things about the shaver</li>
            <li>battery life is good, with one charge giving me two weeks, with one 2-5min shave per day.</li>
            <li>Philips/Norelco recommends using for three weeks - without using another shaver - as a fair test.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I cannot complain - as it is superior to the Braun - without a doubt.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve never tried an electric, this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li>But my farther bought one of these and said it&#x27;s really good.  </li>
            <li>Shave wise</li>
            <li>Good battery life</li>
            <li>Fits good in the hand&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trimmer is not as good as my cheaper Norelco, but as others have said, I didn&#x27;t buy it for the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Good price for this electric razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit pricy, (almost $200), but it is of good quality.</li>
            <li>The  outsiade  pack  is  good  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t come with all the bells and whistles as the superior models, but it works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li>I think that this is a good shaver and competitively priced.</li>
            <li>it does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li>After using this shaver for about three weeks I find it to be nearly as good as the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a good product, improved but not change in the shaving sensation.</li>
            <li>This razor does a good job shaving close without tugging.  </li>
            <li>Philips product quality is good.</li>
            <li>I find it to be vastly superior to any type of liquid pre electric shave formulation or shave cream.  </li>
            <li>I was paying good money for what seemed to be a minuscule bottle of baby oil.  </li>
            <li>The razor looks good, but thats about all it does good.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>Good battery life between charges.  </li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>My husband, who has used electric razors for years, absolutely loved this razor.  </li>
            <li>Norelco had been good to me</li>
            <li>like the trimmer option too and used it around the side burns and did a good job</li>
            <li>This is a good shaver.</li>
            <li>Clean up is a awesome.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this razor is how you clean it.</li>
            <li>The merchants who use Amazon to sell their products will give you exceptional service.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is best described as adequate.  </li>
            <li>Received this product quickly and everything was perfect.</li>
            <li>I have never been impressed with those as the screens wear out quickly leading to a lot of cuts and irritation.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product!thanks!&lt;br /&gt;i love it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product!thanks!&lt;br /&gt;i love it!</li>
            <li>Great razor,  Very smooth.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very good &amp; smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I still love it, still get great battery life out of it: I could count the number of times I&#x27;ve charged it probably with one hand.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the 1250, works like a champ.</li>
            <li>I am so very glad that I decided to upgrade to this razor.  </li>
            <li>I would be happy to trade it for the top of the line</li>
            <li>Being able to rinse it in the sink was also welcome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the shaves the 1250x/40</li>
            <li>He is very satisfied with this and says anyone who is on the fence should get it.</li>
            <li>I am happy to provide answers about the shaver and my experience, so feel free to ask any questions you may have!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This is the best electric shave I have ever had and worth every penny (or dollar).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Braun also comes with a neat form fit plastic case and a cleaning brush, thus, making it an ideal travel mate for business trips.</li>

            <li>I loved this razor when I first got it - best electric</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great razor, but I like the feel of the Arcitec model better.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Great product, I like it and brought 3 more for family and friends as gift.</li>
            <li>a great combination of a $50 off offer from Amazon and another coupon for $30 off from the manufacturer, it made the decision more</li>
            <li>I am very pleased, and although I cannot speak of the durability quite yet, I believe and hold faith that this razor will continue to give me the convenient, close shave I have been used to for years.</li>
            <li>i was very pleased.</li>
            <li>really nice shaver and good value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a good razor but didn&#x27;t get the stubble as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Shaver is a good shaver, its nice to shave in shower</li>
            <li>Called customer service, they sent one right away, alright awesome.</li>
            <li>But right now it is excellent.</li>
            <li>Very good; significant improvement in comfort and shaving efficiency.  </li>
            <li>This shaver got top reviews from Consumer Reports and deserves them; its a VERY nice machine.</li>
            <li>For the most part,it does do a good job shaving and is a good buy.</li>
            <li>Well, I was pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li>Notwithstanding excellent customer service, I never received my first package by FedEx.</li>
            <li>i was pretty impressed with the product.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think you can get a better razor around this price range, Try it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>but after my first shave I was really impressed.  </li>
            <li>OK, hello..!?</li>
            <li>The first two times I charged it on a perfectly level granite counter, it fell off.</li>
            <li>This shaver without a doubt gives me the best shave that I have ever received from an electric razor, and I look forward to many, many more</li>
            <li>I love this razor!</li>
            <li>The unit comes with excellent instructions that indicate that the shaver should be washed with hot water after each use and that no blotting of the shaver head is allowed for fear of lint getting into the shaver head.</li>
            <li>Love using it in the shower !  </li>
            <li>guy who knows how to use an electric razor will love this one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed after just one shave.</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li>I was so glad to see this razor was made in the Netherlands!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good shave and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Has a built in trimmer, very nice and easy to use.       </li>
            <li>I returned the Razor to Amazon after 3 weeks of use, the return was very easy, was very pleased with Amazon&#x27;s customer service.    </li>
            <li>I love this razor, because it is very light but works great.</li>

            <li>the difference is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>Its a really great shaver and is comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>Amazing shave.</li>
            <li>THE DIFFERENCE IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Amazing razor for the price.</li>
            <li>My face felt amazing.</li>
            <li>Great smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The battery just goes and goes and goes, amazing.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing shaver through and through...</li>
            <li>It is also extremely light weight and not bulky fits great in the hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek and comfortable and can give you a great close shave.</li>
            <li>I had bought this while it was on sale and being that it was reasonably priced, it was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller for the great product!</li>
            <li>I have completed the 21 day test and am thrilled.</li>
            <li>Got my Grandson the Philips Norelco 1250x/40 Shaver from Amazon for Christmas, and he&#x27;s thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice looking and it shaves well.  </li>
            <li>after reading so many good things about it</li>
            <li>This shaver works awesome, putting this shaver to maximum pressure having to shave a complete head at once it shows how good</li>
            <li>... nice.</li>
            <li>The best part about the razor though, is how easy it is to clean.  </li>
            <li>My brother had a Norelco and I tried it and liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>This Product is wonderfull in what it means packaging, materials, and shape, but my boyfried isn&#x60;t so thrilled about the way it shaves...</li>
            <li>Nice shaver while it worked.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this shaver for more than 6 months now, I found that quality of the shave is not as good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for years, and this is a nice one.</li>
            <li>The electric shave rolls the skin up and forces the hairs into the blade, which then slices it off nicely without any pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One nice feature I have noticed about the Phillips/Norelco shavers is that none of them have ever grabbed or pulled the hair on my face.</li>
            <li>This one is their top of the line rotary shaver, so I figured it would be a good test.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I received it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent razor and very amazed by its quality shave.  </li>
            <li>it might make a nice decoration in a fish tank or as a paper weight.</li>
            <li>Once you are comfortable with the pattern you get the best smooth close shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m commenting on my own review to update somethings about the razor.</li>
            <li>Well in my defense, I am sure the razors 10 years ago were not as good as this one.</li>
            <li>/ whistles would be nice</li>
            <li>I have been using this razor for just a month now and really loving the results.  </li>
            <li>The pros are that it gives a nice looking shave on my face.</li>
            <li>Time for an upgrade and liked the reviews I had read about the Senso Touch, so I purchased one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice razor, no question.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice razor, as I said, but if I had it to do over again I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it.  </li>
            <li>It works and it does a nice job of it.</li>
            <li>I think this was almost top of the line when I bought it, and I got a good promotional price.  </li>
            <li>It gives him a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>nice design.</li>
            <li>I just upgraded to the senso touch and am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;ve really got to give razors a shot and see which one works best for you.  </li>
            <li>I was using a norelco 8160xl which I liked.</li>
            <li>nice otherwise...</li>
            <li>It was a very close shave and the best part</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would be nice if they mention that this info is not for this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I asked how can Norelco not have there own product in stock.</li>
            <li>A case is provided for the shaver which would be handy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you can&#x27;t beat the price - thanks Phillips great product!!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-looks nice, and battery lasts me about a week without charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lock which is nice for packing it away</li>
            <li>he used his dads now has his own and is happywith it</li>
            <li>Cute and looks good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Norelco did do a fine job of designing the stand in a manner that the shaver will slide through a hole in the bottom of the stand and be cradled very nicely.</li>
            <li>I very rarely give reviews on products unless they leave a great impression on me.  </li>
            <li>Its really easy to clean too so to some up, I Love It!!!</li>
            <li>The Norelco power indicator is very nice, an it is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice looking, smooth electric razor.</li>
            <li>It has good battery life and gives a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful shavor.my friend love it very much.</li>
            <li>The 3D senso touch is awesome, quick, easy to clean, provides a great shave.</li>
            <li>After having a noisy Braun shaver that shed all the hairs to the floor or bathroom sink, it was very refreshing to have a quieter shaver that held the hairs more effectively than the Braun.</li>
            <li>My first experienced was surprising.</li>
            <li>I have used this razor for more than a month now and am very satisfied with it and the shave it gives.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is very powerful, and quick -- took about 2.5 minutes to get a perfect shave, and that&#x27;s even around the edges of my beard.  </li>
            <li>I then run the opened up triplehead unit under the running very warm water from the showerhead to throughly clean out the cut hair and shaving cream holder as well as the rotary razors.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, the shave was very nice and clean.</li>
            <li>This seller is excellent, and the products are brand new.  </li>
            <li>I was considering the purchase of a new razor when I saw a consumer review on the evening news where they rated this razor the best of the group they tested.  </li>
            <li>only good thing about these philips-norelco razors is they give a really excellent shave..</li>
            <li>Received the product quickly and for a great price.  </li>
            <li>Grab design is good, and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>the next best thing or as good as shaving with a disposable razor, thinking about getting another one for my vehicle</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy and convenient to use.</li>

            <li>As others have mentioned, clean-up is always very easy.</li>
            <li>It recharges very easy, although if I traveled I may not like the charging stand</li>
            <li>is very easy.</li>
            <li>He tried it out and from the first day he loved it!</li>
            <li>The shave was equally as impressive and easy as the first shave.</li>
            <li>I am retired and did not shave every day but this razor has gotten better and better and now gives an exceptional shave</li>
            <li>This shaver is very light weight, easy to grip &amp; feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>As a Norelco user for years this is by far the best razor.  </li>
            <li>This model is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with this so far.</li>
            <li>Among the 7 or 8 razors I&#x27;ve tried out this year, the Norelco 1250 is by far the best for how close of a shave it gives me.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic cleaning station is OK, but is louder, takes longer, and the water-based cleaning solution is not as effective.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best of the lot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice to be able to rinse it out after using.</li>
            <li>It arrived a day early in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>It has a good heft in your hands and will feel comfortable when you are shaving your face.&lt;br</li>

            <li>but by far, this is the best Norelco I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best Norelco I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Another nice feature that your wife will love, is that the stubble stays inside the heads.</li>
            <li>it would be best if it was not needed and  one could charge the razor with just the cord as my old Norelco could be.  </li>
            <li>how good my shave is that I ask my girlfriend to feel my face to see how smooth it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electric razors for over 20 years - this, by far, is the best.  </li>
            <li>At this point I am able to use the razor for two or three weeks before charging, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>The SencoTouch is, by far, the best shaver I have used.</li>
            <li>(Quite honestly, I spend at most 1/2 the time shaving with the sensotouch as with the series 7)</li>
            <li>but this is the best  so far.  </li>
            <li>I own this electric razor, but was a die-hard fan of blade shaving most of my life.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this razor suits me perfectly.    </li>

            <li>The new razor is great and I am sure I&#x27;ll get many years of great service.</li>
            <li>The Panny works best with a very thin layer of gel-type cream; the 3D works best with a heavier lather (I got good results with Edge).</li>

            <li>It shaves very clean and nice.</li>
            <li>The product information says that the redesigned head is superior but, based on the reviews, I don&#x27;t think so, so I would buy the original if I could, but I cannot.  </li>

            <li>The design is intelligent and the pivoting heads provide a smooth and comfortable experience.  </li>
            <li>The most amazing thing to me is the noise level, or better stated the lack of noise.  </li>
            <li>If you shave against the grain with a blade, a light touch, and good beard prep, you may get closer, but at the cost of considerably more irritation.</li>
            <li>nice razor, replaced my norelco 8850 from 11+yrs of service, this thing has more flexibility to contour the face, does even better in shaving</li>

            <li>this is a very important category.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>I have learned a very important lesson...</li>

            <li>I have experienced no skin irritation while shaving, and the shaver is very easy and quick to clean after shaving.  </li>
            <li>He uses it every day and has made several comments about how wonderful it is (better shave, close cut, no tugging or pulling, great charge life, comfortable to use, easy to clean and my favorite so quite!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, easy to use and feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a fine razor, well balanced, nice &#x27;touch.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Is very good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After looking at the makes and models of shavers on display in the stores I shop at, I cruised the internet and did more research on shavers.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Norelco for the design and rebate, and to Amazon.com for the great price opportunity.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this razor</li>
            <li>Unless you plan to use this thing for 5 or more years, and spend 20 minutes each time you want to fully shave your face, you will regret buying it.</li>
            <li>Its simply the best electric razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>But he&#x27;s more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>It works way better, it&#x27;s smoother and cuts closer.</li>
            <li>Holds charge for many shaves.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Simply put, this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li>It couldn&#x27;t be easier or more efficient.</li>
            <li>Also love the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof .</li>
            <li>e had in many years</li>
            <li>So glad I bought it for him.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelcos for many years.  </li>
            <li>On the Speed-XL, the lip around the edge of the head housing seems to better setup the hairs for shaving as you move the razor across your skin.  </li>
            <li>Also brings up reliability concerns for how many times the head assembly coupling can be pulled apart and reinserted without wearing out.</li>
            <li>Generally OK for both.  </li>
            <li>If sleek styling is your top priority, go for it.  </li>
            <li>If practicality and shaving are your top priorities, try another razor.</li>
            <li>Which is better: rotary or foil  2.</li>
            <li>Should i buy a low cost product as trial or go for the best option  3.</li>
            <li>The shaving takes time, more than a manual shave.</li>
            <li>I am sure you have read the sales pitch:</li>
            <li>The charging station and remaining power readout are outstanding.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is the included \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; isn&#x27;t the greatest, but I have a beard/trim razor for that functionality anyway, so that doesn&#x27;t affect me.    </li>
            <li>Hope it gets better.    </li>
            <li>plus I still get a closer shave with a top of the line razor cartridge.</li>
            <li>And I love the close shave of these blades.</li>
            <li>The Braun feels the most substantial; the 3D feels the most \\&quot;plasticy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, the 3D did a better job on the neck and jaw line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I reviewed the Alphagel if you want more info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the cleaning station from Braun.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>MORE SHAVING BUMPS (aka ingrown</li>
            <li>Better shaving that</li>
            <li>Better shaving that way.    </li>
            <li>i hope that his face will accomodate with the shaver and will be ok.</li>
            <li>Many years ago I used a Norelco rotary razor.</li>
            <li>It was okay, but the cleaning was a chore.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.     </li>
            <li>This razor provides a nice smooth shave that lasts for days.  </li>
            <li>The instruction manual is entertaining.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I decided to try these out.</li>
            <li>Imagine how many people will greet him today with a horrified look and ask, \\&quot;what happened to your face?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Had a Braum before but this works much better for me.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping that it would be an improvement on my cheaper Braun electric razor that I bought many years ago.</li>
            <li>In my opinion a manual razor does a better job.</li>
            <li>and they all wanted 200 dollars or more.</li>
            <li>All of my family members love touching my face with this shaver - before, my wife would complain that my face would be scratchy unless I used a razor to manually shave close to my skin</li>
            <li>It runs well with water - I was able to use it in the shower and was able to grip the razor without qualms.</li>
            <li>might be a greater burden.</li>
            <li>Compare it to a shaver that costs $75 or $90 dollars, and you&#x27;re still spending $60 more on a shaver.</li>
            <li>My beard is somewhat coarse and this shaver just works best for me this way.</li>
            <li>I was in love with this shaver for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>This was my best affair in shaving ever, but we won&#x27;t be getting back together...</li>
            <li>The shave is very close and feels great.  </li>
            <li>This is the most efficient shaver that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could have done better.</li>
            <li>My son had much better results.  </li>
            <li>The pivoting head on the razor is the best thing about the razor and is a lot better than my son&#x27;s earlier version.</li>
            <li>Electric Razor was the inability of being able to achieve results around my neck and jawline.</li>
            <li>It is the best, lightest and quietest electric shaver that I have used.(I have owned about 8 Norelcos in the last 30 years.)</li>
            <li>No electric shaver is able to cut the hair below the skin like a blade razor.</li>
            <li>If shaving ever irritates your skin you&#x27;re going to love this shaver.</li>
            <li>Make sure it irrigates well while drying out.</li>
            <li>i saw so many review about that.</li>
            <li>However, the Norelco GyroFlex 3D Shaver is a better shaver.  </li>
            <li>Although it takes several weeks to retrain the wiskers, the end result is an excellent shave.  </li>
            <li>more than most people as I also shave my head every morning.  </li>
            <li>If you want the top of the line this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I started shaving in the shower with foam...</li>
            <li>PROS  - best shave of all shavers I&#x27;ve owned, including several Norelcos.</li>
            <li>I use it with water and cream, and it&#x27;s better than shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably not a problem for most users and it didn&#x27;t stop me from giving it five stars.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver, I,ve been using Norelco shavers for many years ,always just wore them out from so much use.</li>
            <li>appealing appearance.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my choice.</li>
            <li>This would make it better  for travel than with its bulky charging stand.  </li>
            <li>His charge lasted about 2 weeks or more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s when I saw the Norelco 1250x/40 rotary shaver and thought I&#x27;d give it a try and see if rotary shavers were any better than foil ones.</li>
            <li>the shaving cream, I was able to shave in just 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually thinking this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>And if they designed it so that it protruded more than it does now, I think more people would have a problem with that.</li>
            <li>But yes, having a corded feature would be much more welcomed.</li>
            <li>and there is one more thing to talk about.</li>
            <li>Shaving cream is a lot better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed this shaver for 5 years, and just bought it again for my whiskered twin teenagers.</li>
            <li>The problem of charging still remains, if you are traveling for more than a week you have to bring the charging stand along.  </li>
            <li>I have had many electric razors in my 70+ years</li>
            <li>I have shaved using a fusion razor for many years, I have never been a believer of electric shavers.</li>
            <li>If you had money to spend and had to pick one I like the rotary razor in Norelco(Braun is a lot more in cost).  </li>
            <li>5/15/2011 - Still love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Keep a cheap disposable razor handy to touch up your sideburns.    </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it for the shave and rue the day you met the built-in trimmer.</li>
            <li>With my receipt, he was able to promptly get a replacement.</li>
            <li>He is pleased with the product .    </li>
            <li>I can shave my entire face and neck in 45 seconds and get the best shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Had Norelco razors for many years and decided to try a foil electric a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better at getting stray longer hairs in areas</li>
            <li>A manual razor against the grain will provide the closest shave, but also the most discomfort.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco also doesn&#x27;t spill as many clippings while you are shaving, but still can spill some.  </li>
            <li>So if this is the best overall shaver I have used, why just 3 stars?  </li>
            <li>B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]I love my phillips shaver</li>
            <li>The sleek style had me thinking this razor would be mostly form over function</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s refreshing to see quality craftsmanship.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I opted for the \\&quot;bare-bones\\&quot; model as my counter space is sparce</li>
            <li>This razor must be cleaned more often.  </li>
            <li>I am now able to shave on the go, and I no longer have the shaving irritation as I had before.  </li>
            <li>and I think this one is better.  </li>
            <li>I checked out the Wahl offerings that are supposed to be much better for bumps, but decided not to go that route.  </li>
            <li>However, it does a much better job.  </li>
            <li>It does get better with time.</li>
            <li>The more you use it the better.</li>
            <li>I am sure it&#x27;s because I still need to wait the 21 day period.   </li>
            <li>Worlds going to end this year :)</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that i can get out the shower, slap some shaving cream on and shave with the razor.</li>
            <li>but this gets most of them, not all but most.</li>
            <li>I have suffered with razor burn for many years</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d never be able to get a &#x27;close&#x27; shave without the penalty of razor burns.</li>
            <li>I am sure as I continue using this razor</li>
            <li>I have always used Norelco razors and usually love them.  </li>
            <li>ok, i meter the charger and its producing about 16 VDC as required..</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO, i suppose the point here is this thing about the battery not being able to take being in the charger..</li>
            <li>so I started researching the top electric shavers.</li>
            <li>After getting the braun home I was in love with its build quality.</li>
            <li>After a week of shaving I had got better with controlling the razor but shaving took quite a while</li>
            <li>I went out and bought the Norelco sensotouch 3d to compare and the results are interesting.</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s more, there is virtually no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I love reading product reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have used an electric razor exclusively for many years, and have tried many.  </li>
            <li>And I love the way the trimmer slides out with the push of a lever.  </li>
            <li>There are much better choices then this.</li>
            <li>To put a number, I think it&#x27;s about 30-40% better in this regard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>The wiz kids at Philips need to take physics 101 and learn a bit more about something called gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to go back to a rotary style and I am very happy I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric razors for many years.</li>
            <li>I now use my electric razor more than my safety razor.  </li>
            <li>I thought that was OK.</li>
            <li>I really love this razor.</li>
            <li>You will feel it bite the stubble and remove it; I achieve better results without a mirror because I concentrate on the feel.</li>
            <li>They keep getting better.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and most times its for two weeks or more.  </li>
            <li>My recommendation is BUY this razor and put up with the charger until they make a more compact or travel charger.</li>
            <li>It does what it is supposed to and more.</li>
            <li>OK... I have used Norelco Shavers for years...</li>
            <li>glad I waited) and shaved with it this morning...</li>
            <li>thanks Norelco for another great shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li>Perfect to shave short beards.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>If you have the money, buy the best - no need to skimp on a daily thing like this.  </li>
            <li>This one seems to require use of a pre-shave more than the others have.  </li>
            <li>Not as close as a shave with a razor, but more convenient.</li>
            <li>The trimmer on the brauns is much better than this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this overall.  </li>
            <li>I feel for it after a couple shaves and love it.</li>
            <li>I will say this is the Best Norelco I have owned in the last 48 years of using Norelco!!!!</li>
            <li>If you buy be sure to use a pre shave product, like Lectric Shave, to halo lubricate your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used many electric shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Second electric, and the best shave I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my friend and he thought it was cute and better than any shaver that he used before.</li>
            <li>I currently own four norelco razors, all of which are readily available for convenient use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that this is the one I use the most which speaks for itself.  </li>
            <li>Philips could’ve done a better job with the charger.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best razor I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>My husband has shaved his head for more than 45 years.  </li>
            <li>For many years now he has been using the Norelco 7310XL.  </li>
            <li>look and feel, looks stylish</li>
            <li>than most electric shavers&lt;br /&gt;*Quiet</li>
            <li>This razor doesn&#x27;t do any better job of shaving than my cheaper one I had for many years(20</li>
            <li>/&gt;Caution it doesn&#x27;t work on a stubble more than 3 to 5 days old.&lt;br</li>
            <li>too many passes on my neckline with this razor.</li>
            <li>You can pass over your stubble multiple times, almost nothing best shaved.</li>
            <li>The precision trimmer on the backside works okay, but it makes no sense to buy something</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>And I had to figure out 1) which pre-shave to use and 2) which aftershave lotion worked best, and 3) how to use an electric shaver, especially which directions to shave and</li>
            <li>With a manual razor, I couldn&#x27;t shave more than once in 24 hours, and I always skipped a day whenever I could.</li>
            <li>No charging stand or cord is needed unless gone for more than about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>To speed the drying of the skin and beard, many men use an alcohol-based pre-shave lotion.</li>
            <li>Alcohol works for most guys, but my face didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with Norelco electric shavers forever, more than 50 years.  </li>
            <li>what more could I ask for.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I upgraded.</li>
            <li>The electric shaver in question excels in most of these areas:    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried shaving with a Gillet Fusion straigh razor, it irritated my neck area more than any of the electric razors.    </li>
            <li>The head seems to countor to my face better than the LA-93K but from a performance stand point</li>
            <li>I tried the shaver with shaving lotion, worked great, glided and really seemed to limit the irriation.  </li>
            <li>I would rate it slightly better than my XL, It runs quite and gives a closer shave.</li>
            <li>Or even better...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li>This razor is fabulous!</li>
            <li>and I check reviews to get the highest rated each time.&lt;br /&gt;Tried the latest Braun, Panasonic</li>
            <li>It does not require more than a couple of passes over each area for a close shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>shave is okay</li>
            <li>Really pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the expense because of its superior performance</li>
            <li>The Panasonic top of the line shaver was much better</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and I was not at all pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>, I tried the top of the line Remington and Braun electric razors, and now the Norelco Sensotouch 3 D.</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I did.     </li>
            <li>It also gives a much better shave.</li>
            <li>I leant it to my dad to try and now he wants to buy one lol.</li>
            <li>Got this one yesterday and love it..</li>
            <li>Have had many year of experience with the Norelco brand shavers and have been satisfied with their peformance.</li>
            <li>Though this really shouldn&#x27;t matter, this has to be one of the most attractive shavers Norelco has ever designed.</li>
            <li>My dad said it was mostly plastic and not metal.  </li>
            <li>He says it is better but thinks these razors are not the quality they were years ago.</li>
            <li>I decided to go ahead and get the top of the line 3D shaver and give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It has been many years since i used a philishave.</li>
            <li>If I follow the advise and toss my SensoTouch 3D in the bag including charger I still wont be able to charge it since their is no way to plug the charger into the razor.</li>
            <li>I would sure suggest any one to try 3D one.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace an aging Norelco Speed 8150XL shaver that I&#x27;ve had for many years now.  </li>
            <li>the replacements heads cost 169.00 + shipping, more than I paid for the razor itself...</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Very happy with purchase for it does what is intended - give a terrific shave.</li>
            <li>I alway purchase the top model.</li>
            <li>So I purchased the 1250x 3d model because they said it did a better job on the neck hairs.  </li>
            <li>Philips rotary head shaver and decided I wanted the more flexible</li>
            <li>I tried it with shaving cream and it was interesting</li>
            <li>but I cannot say it was any better</li>
            <li>glad</li>
            <li>If you like the stubble look this is for you,or if your a female perfect for your legs.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I found the three top of the line electric shavers - Braun Series 7, Panasonic es-la63, and Phillips Norelco 3D -  to be so similar as to recommend any of them as excellent shavers, but each has its strengths and weaknesses.</li>
            <li>Still, a sleeping spouse nearby will appreciate you using the Norelco most.    </li>
            <li>He claims of all the shavers he&#x27;s bought, this one is his favorite.</li>
            <li>That being said, I think that most $50 electric shavers will provide a better shave than this fancy GyroFlex gimmick.</li>
            <li>but it the latest thing Norelco has to offer.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best, sleek design, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is an excellent shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The separate floating blades seem to make it work better and easier than the locked in blades found on most electric razors.</li>
            <li>Could not have asked for a better experience with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The shave is inadequate in many ways.</li>
            <li>areas did require more than one pass</li>
            <li>I am buying one for myself soon too :)</li>
            <li>But that is what I love about it...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>but I felt I got a better shave with the 2d</li>
            <li>After four days I couldn&#x27;t take it any more and returned the machine.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco for many, many years.</li>
            <li>Have been using the Philips Norelco 1250 for about 2 months and have been pleased with the quality and closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shaver for 1 and 1/2 months and love it.</li>
            <li>I used a braun for 8 years and was satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was so glad I did my homework.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you would be pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want or need the self-cleaning model which adds more cost and accessories.</li>
            <li>Shaves nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The most I hoped for was perhaps a suggestion of things I could try that would fix the problem.  </li>
            <li>I just need to be more carefull.</li>
            <li>So why is it better?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ideally I would love a shaver that didn&#x27;t shave so close to the skin level and had a feature that could change how close you&#x27;d like to shave.</li>
            <li>I did not have the best experience on my second call.</li>
            <li>These shavers are much more of a precision instrument,which rewards you with a wonderful shave,if properly maintained.</li>
            <li>could) say this about any razor, but I truly love this Norelco 1250x.  </li>
            <li>2 models up you get about 20% more battery life which is not a substantial difference</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many of the $40 to $60 Norelco shavers over the years, and they&#x27;ve always gotten the job done.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the ArciTec model i had.</li>
            <li>Most of them have been Phillips Norelco, None of them shave as well as a blade type shaver.  </li>
            <li>This razor is unquestionably the most efficient electric razor that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>and I have owned many of them.</li>
            <li>The floating heads follow the contours of my face better than any shaver I&#x27;ve had before (about 6 of them over 40 years).</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I mostly shaved with it</li>
            <li>For upwards of $200, I would expect more from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>unplugged my SensoTouch and stored it safely into my bottom drawer for hibernation.</li>
            <li>they all love it as well.</li>
            <li>Made a mistake that I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;After ordering so many electronic shavers I reached conclusion that nothing beats Gillette.</li>
            <li>Wish I could say it was just the blades dulling out and not being able to find replacement blades.</li>
            <li>And in that regard, it&#x27;s top notch.</li>
            <li>better than a blade.</li>
            <li>I have had this razor for about a month now, and really love it.</li>
            <li>It would have given the razor more portability.</li>
            <li>The most gental and smoothest shave from an electric</li>
            <li>This razor is so much better than its predecessors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>This electric razor is amazingly quite and it feels really smooth on my face when I shave.  </li>
            <li>He never complains about shaving any more.</li>
            <li>I love the moving heads that help catch all the hairs on your chin, neck and under the chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shaved in the shower, so I did not expect much more for an electronic I exposed to the water about 500 times.</li>
            <li>Top Rated</li>
            <li>its great and does a wonderfull job shave very closely as goor as razor blad and no skin aerations .&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>I Have used Norelco Razor&#x27;s for over 35 years bought this one to replace one I have owned for more than 10 years</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t quibble over this, act to get one today, this razor is truly outstanding.</li>
            <li>I recommended to many of my friends to buy it.</li>
            <li>Uses is most of the time.</li>
            <li>I used it about once a week, used a blade razor most of the time.</li>
            <li>AS IT&#x27;S JUST OKAY.  </li>
            <li>(I was looking for more of a beard trimmer, which this is not).</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit is very easy to clean and the display makes it very easy to tell what the battery level is.  </li>
            <li>Shaves great, easy to hold, easy to clean and has a pretty good charge time.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth yet powerful shaving!!</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a more comfortable shave than the older models and it has very good battery life before it needs to be recharged.  </li>
            <li>Gets a very close smooth shave!!!</li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer works fine and the unit itself is very easy to hold while in operation.</li>
            <li>The product is very nice, and the express is so fast.</li>
            <li>You get wonderful clean and soft skin.</li>
            <li>I know it costs more, but it&#x27;s so SO worth it!!</li>
            <li>It makes for a very close, comfortable shave, is easy to clean, has great battery life, and is fairly compact.</li>
            <li>Being able to wash them out with water is good, but it requires HOT water.  </li>
            <li>particular model is a great value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy that I paid a little more because this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>give it 5 stars but the high price keeps me from doing so.......even though it&#x27;s a great shaver I do think it&#x27;s overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this shaver, you will be happy with it.</li>
            <li>I was trying to make the switch because I liked the idea of being able to shave on the way to work, but this razor doesn&#x27;t do an adequate job.</li>
            <li>Bought this product, I began to use it, use them very smoothly, very clean shaving, I will come to choose this product.</li>
            <li>The feel of the razor in the hand is very comfortable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>And one more thing, it is so easy to clean, just rinse it under warm tap water</li>
            <li>The Sensotouch is pretty good.</li>
            <li>If you are willing to spend the money, any one of these would be a good choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are willing to spend the money, any one of these would be a good choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>understand that it can take time (2-4 weeks) for an Electric Razor to start showing good results and I was expecting a crappy first shave.</li>
            <li>This was also the first Norelco shaver that provided good results from day one.</li>
            <li>This norelco works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I got a pretty good deal with my Amazon Rewards cash.</li>
            <li>life is pretty good on this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit&#x27;s battery is of good quality, and the unit itself feels pretty</li>
            <li>Far and away the best part of the experience is the ability to easily shave my neck, which gets as full a beard as my face.  </li>
            <li>Is very nice, comfortable, International brands,Cheap,  good value,&lt;br /&gt;Is very nice, comfortable, International brands,Cheap,  good value,&lt;br /&gt;Is very nice, comfortable, International brands,Cheap,  good value,</li>
            <li>looks so cool to me! :)</li>
            <li>Gets a pretty great shave on the cheeks and mustache, except for right at the jaw line, it takes more effort and often there is more stubble there,</li>
            <li>with the lower-end single-head Norelcos, it&#x27;s easy to dab a towel after washing to get most of the water and facilitate drying.  </li>
            <li>The package is ok, The speed is very quickly</li>
            <li>I love that it has an easy grip too.</li>
            <li>The whole head moves around which is good for your wrist but again is more of a \\&quot;gimmick\\&quot; than anything</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fantastic thing about this razor is that it has a voltage function that allows you to convert from 110 to 240 volts AC which is perfect for international travels.</li>
            <li>Better shave, quieter, and definitely more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Great shave, fast, comfortable,</li>
            <li>Its very easy to clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;Manual cleaning - both the Panasonic and 3D are very easy to clean manually.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean under the tap by flipping up the three heads, then shake the water out and put it on the charger.     </li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s does the job (eventually), and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The razor is very easy to clean by rinsing in the sink after each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave, and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Smooth close shave, very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine most of the time</li>
            <li>I have always prided myself with a close clean shave,but do not want the fuss of shaving with a blade!</li>
            <li>Excellent shaver, better than the other 7000 or 8000 philips series shavers I had.  </li>
            <li>Very nice on phone but replacement handles are backordered without a projected date for manufacturing new ones.  </li>
            <li>Gave me a nice smooth and clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Norelcos are quiet to begin with but this unit is exceptional and the shave was superior to any electric that I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Overall it is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li>Plus it looks pretty sleek and sexy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a purely functional point of view; you can depend on this razor to give you a brilliant, comfortable shave, every time.</li>
            <li>The shave is as good as any Norelco shaver, but it is much easier to clean and maintain!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit is very comfortable in the hand, light and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>The one benefit of the top model that I do miss is the accurate display of remaining shaves.</li>
            <li>It has not been better than a cheap plastic disposable.</li>
            <li>But remember if its an important occasion you may be better off using the manual blades</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall feel - for me, the Braun feels the most comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Not horrible, but not all that comfortable</li>
            <li>The 3D does a pretty good job, but my face does not feel as smooth as with the others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very happy with that outcome even though I hadn&#x27;t expected it.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with that outcome even though I hadn&#x27;t expected it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to many smooth shaves.</li>
            <li>This will give the closest &amp; most comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>It is the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  </li>
            <li>I have primarily shaved with a safety razor for most of my life.</li>
            <li>My face was noticeably smoother, and I was happy for the $150 or so that I paid for it so far.  </li>
            <li>AWESOME money well spent</li>
            <li>Since there are already many detailed reviews, this one will focus on performance and value.  </li>
            <li>The ability to shave wet makes this my best shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Compared to my Arcitec it gives a quieter and more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The replacement cutters are also more easily available than those for the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get something that provided a smoother, more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>So many of their models have two toned designs that just look cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now had the shaver two weeks and am convinced there is nothing better available.</li>
            <li>No instructions, and, most important, no charging stand or cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I find it is the closest most comfortable alternative in electric</li>
            <li>The shave was more comfortable for me than the LA-93K but not drastically differet.    </li>
            <li>This razor is quieter &amp; more comfortable than my Norelco 7775X.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the razor features a worldwide voltage function that adjusts automatically from 100 volts to 240 volts AC, making the SensoTouch 3D ideal for international travel\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>On top of that from day one it has been comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The wet-shaving Panasonic and Norelco are the most comfortable of all if you want to put up with the oil/gel prep and clean-up time.    </li>
            <li>My cheap Norelco razor for $39.95 has a much better clipping device than this pricy 1250x/40.  </li>
            <li>important - get the most out of your</li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable and close shaving electric razor that I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I started using an electric razor about 15 years ago when I had decided that it was a more civilized way to shave.  </li>
            <li>Lifelong Norelco user -- SensoTouch 3D provides THE best Norelco shave I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li>and it was the most smooth shaving experience I&#x27;d ever had.  </li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s light and cute.</li>
            <li>: do you have to spend this much to get a good shave from an electric shaver?</li>
            <li>He says its EXTREMELY comfortable when used with the appropriate electric shaving gel and feels much more comfortable about shaving now.</li>
            <li>I think if you shave your whole face this will be a good shaver still.</li>
            <li>the trimmers not to good, but you dont really need it.  </li>
            <li>has good battery life, and recharges fast....</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, the travel case is something good to have.</li>
            <li>Really does a good job and so easy to clean!</li>
            <li>There were a couple of minor, but very nice touches that I really liked.</li>
            <li>can honestly say this latest shaver is a positive continuation in Norelco product development .</li>
            <li>It cuts soft and is a very very nice gift.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with how quick (very important to me - no need to go over a spot a hundred times; no stray hairs), comfortable, and close the shave was.  </li>
            <li>I get why they did it that way, just not the most user friendly for travel.</li>
            <li>but it looks cool!   </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love the series 7, thats why I bought it first; but in the end, for the money, the Norelco sensotouch 3d does win out.</li>
            <li>Light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a long time , nice charger stand.&lt;br /&gt;Shaver holds a great charge I have been keeping track</li>
            <li>I do recommend the 3D model due to its movement in 3 planes, which results in excellent conformation to the contours of your face.</li>
            <li>It needed to be replaced a full 7 months before the supposed life of the head!</li>
            <li>AT FULL PRICE !</li>
            <li>When I read the other reviews on this shaver I figured it had to be great!</li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>To see the charge level indicator, you have to look fast when you turn the shaver off, and not in a bright light.</li>
            <li>And I love the water clean</li>
            <li>Sleek design making it easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li>Easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy as well.  </li>

            <li>Easy on the face.</li>
            <li>He was amazed at how much more it shaved off and what a clean shave</li>
            <li>and you need to clean the shaver every time you use it or even more hair falls out.</li>
            <li>Cleans easy.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than just buying a year&#x27;s worth of top of the line razor cartridges each year.    </li>
            <li>Easy to care for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Charging is very quick, but you must use the charger stand, no corded shaving capabilities with this.  </li>
            <li>very quick charging, and it can lasts for lots of shaves.             </li>
            <li>And I love how easy it is to clean.  </li>

            <li>The heads conform to the face easily and it does not irritate the skin, even under the neck.</li>

            <li>The GyroFlex 3D makes it easy to get all of the contours of your face.</li>
            <li>One of my biggest complaints about the Panasonic was that the head lock mechanism broke easily after a couple of months.</li>
            <li>The razor fits easily into the hand and while running the SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver is quieter than the unit it replaces.  </li>

            <li>Shaver washes easily and quickly (about 15 seconds); no need for the jet clean system, but it might be a nice luxury.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was better then my last one, and the battery life is great.  </li>
            <li>Easily done, keeps your blades sharper longer and is also waterproof.</li>
            <li>v easy to clean..just rinse and done</li>
            <li>There are still some areas that just don&#x27;t get shaved easily.</li>
            <li>I also like being able to clean with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>there were no nicks, no misses and the shaver cleaned easily.  </li>
            <li>Does anyone have any ideas regarding an easy fix?</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Cleaning and charging are easy tasks.  </li>
            <li>AND IT&#x27;S EASY TO CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li>I like the easy water cleanout of the heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important, It is so cheap, it is priced  385-626 U.S. dollars in China.</li>
            <li>Cleans easily with water.</li>
            <li>main problem I had with my Braun series 5 foil shaver was that it took about 10 to 12 minutes to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>If you can afford it, I would strongly suggest this shaver.</li>
            <li>I replaced the head after a year and then after 2 years then I guess the motor slowed or the battery wasn&#x27;t as strong</li>
            <li>It is a fairly high quality shaver that gives me a good shave.</li>
            <li>good shaver, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Norelco SensoTouch 3D to anyone looking for a good razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the high quality shave, and the good service</li>
            <li>the most important is you will get a perfect shave even the little stubble will be shaved</li>
            <li>If the heads are getting warm or hot, you&#x27;re pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>If the heads are getting warm or hot, you&#x27;re pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>You almost aren&#x27;t sure if it is running at full speed</li>
            <li>Do not pay full price for this razor, there are better ones out there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it.&lt;br /&gt;it can work 2week that you charge it full once</li>
            <li>The Braun was not a bad shaver, just nothing better to justify the ongoing costs.</li>
            <li>More importantly the gf approves of the clean shave instead of prickly stubble or ruffian appearance.  </li>
            <li>and it is as good as new.</li>
            <li>It works like a finely engineered machine.</li>
            <li>This item works fine as a shaver.  </li>
            <li>Amazon handled the transaction just fine, it&#x27;s Philips Norelco that is at fault.  </li>
            <li>It was working fine yesterday, and now it won&#x27;t turn on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Once your face adjusts, the 1250x does a fine job, though not as close as a blade, so 4 stars for the shaver</li>
            <li>But this is the first time with 3D electric, which is great - very close to skin.</li>
            <li>once my face and beard became accustomed to it, it worked fine..</li>
            <li>This shaver is the best, smooth, clean shave, easy to use, after a few weeks I can give a better review, but I could not wait to get this out there.</li>
            <li>find the stand and the charging to be fine.</li>
            <li>Portability... Fine and sturdy for travel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s talc based, which is fine for me.</li>
            <li>For me, CeraVe and Lubriderm work fine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me a perfect shave but closer to perfection than the others with less irritation.  </li>
            <li>and it does fine without having to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li>If I forget to shave the fine hairs were not getting trimmed</li>
            <li>etc then itl work just fine.</li>
            <li>Razor works fine.</li>
            <li>Smooth, never pulls and cleans so easily by just rinsing heads.  </li>
            <li>At home this is fine but to travel it is too bulky.</li>
            <li>The carrying case works fine but will not hold the charging cord so shove the cord in a bag or something you won&#x27;t need it often anyway.</li>
            <li>Shaving is easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Never has one shaved as comfortably, closely and easily as does this.</li>
            <li>The Razor shave the best of all the ones I have had Previously though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are so many contours to a human face and this razor with its exceptional technology is able to meld, fold, bend, curve to make this happen.</li>
            <li>WOW, what a pleasant surprise and experience.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not shave quite as close as a manual razor but way more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy the special cleaner as it is really easy to just clean it with water from the tap.</li>
            <li>Because of the limited charge and need for a charging stand, this might not be the ideal traveling companion for road warriors, but otherwise I would give this shaver my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li>Took my chances and bought it, i was quite happy with the product during the first two months, however it started to \\&quot;not turn on\\&quot;, at first i thought it was the batteries, but after 1 or 2 weeks the razon stopped working at all even after a full night charge.  </li>
            <li>Battery  life is great as well,charge quick and the display is clear.</li>
            <li>easy to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I went shopping for a replacement head, and the price was astronomical for the original equipment kind - almost as much as the shaver cost!  </li>
            <li>how it&#x27;s felt when my bf used it but its like a lovely gift on valentine&#x27;s day so far, and im sure that any bf would like it!</li>
            <li>It is light weight, easy to grip, quiet, gives a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the Norelco, it shaves very close, and very quickly.</li>
            <li>If you have a light beard with fine hair</li>
            <li>Thank you VERY much!!</li>
            <li>CS was willing to send me a new one, again, however after pondering it I ending up just going to Target and picking up a NEW one for the peace of mind of it - even though I ended up spending about $40 more, lol!</li>
            <li>Shaver gives a comfortable shave and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Light, quiet, no pull and it gives me a great shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pivoting head is amazingly comfortable, and it&#x27;s easy to clean...</li>
            <li>this item has been a huge improvement for my father.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to be able to plug the charging cord directly into the razor.</li>
            <li>A month later, I (and my wife) am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall great shaver...</li>
            <li>The battery charge lasts two weeks and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The Gillete just wasn&#x27;t giving me a comfortable shave</li>
            <li>And of course the girlfriend approved, so it was definitely a great purchase, no buyers remorse possible.   </li>
            <li>Faster, closer shave and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Toward the end of November last year I saw an electric shaver (another brand) on sale for what looked like a great price.</li>

            <li>Its easy to clean</li>

            <li>He&#x27;s always bought cheap shavers and they always irritated his skin and never got a close shave.</li>
            <li>It was smooth and no pulling at all.</li>
            <li>It was easy to rinse and to clean.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to clean because you can run the head under running water.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>However, if its an important occasion, you probably want to dig out the manual blades  </li>

            <li>I have been using this razor for a few months and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even bother with the cheap cream at the store that has alcohol in it.</li>
            <li>Lower-end models such as the Braun Series 5, the 7000 and 8000 Norelco series and the Panasonic ArcIV are great shavers.</li>
            <li>Plus, replacement heads are easily available and often discounted (as are the cleaning cartridges).</li>

            <li>Gives a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to shave with over the chin and cheek bones.  </li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s been almost 6 months, and still shaving bump (ingrown hairs) free.  </li>

            <li>The blades are secure and don&#x27;t seem to be in danger of falling out.</li>
            <li>It is now my primary shaver.  </li>

            <li>However, wet-lathered shaving requires light pressure and fewer passes to achieve a close shave.</li>

            <li>is easy to clean and charge and    5.</li>
            <li>You would think I was trying to cut copper wire by the sound it made every time the clipper hit a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The weight of it is surprisingly light and the body is made of plastic</li>
            <li>so it feels a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>The razor provided a smooth shave</li>
            <li>It is so quite and smooth</li>
            <li>It has three levels, light, medium, and intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>it is as smooth a shave as my gillette pro glide fusion razor.  </li>
            <li>I have a light beard</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just the fact of electric razors as a whole, but I kind of miss the feeling of a close shave.</li>
            <li>so I use the shaving foam to get a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as comfortably as the series 7</li>

            <li>Mistake to have gotten, the replacement blades I would give a -5 if it were available.  </li>
            <li>However, now it won&#x27;t fit in it&#x27;s pouch nor make contact with the charging nubs.</li>

            <li>this razor performed as advertised, delivering a smooth and thorough shave.  </li>
            <li>It was speedy, no chafing, felt smooth when finished.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light weight and slim design.</li>
            <li>Since I got it for 99.99, I would say that it was worth it, though I would hesitate to spend more for it.</li>
            <li>Important note</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and holds a great charge.  </li>
            <li>Smooth face comfort.</li>
            <li>The clean up of the shaver was easy as could be.</li>
            <li>He uses it every day and complain how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>but none have given me the close comfortable shave that this one has.</li>
            <li>It arrived by Fed Ex in just a few days and it works perfectly.  </li>

            <li>After several months of use, he said it is a great razor compared to what he used before.</li>
            <li>It was absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s easily justified IMO.</li>
            <li>If that feature isn&#x27;t that important to you</li>
            <li>Yet it&#x27;s as smooth and comfortable as one could hope for.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>Shaving has never been so smooth and convenient.</li>
            <li>The unit is extremely quiet and of great design.</li>
            <li>I thought my old razor was good</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>(I had to use my old Braun shaver because of its superior trimmer).</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave are fairly close together in my opinion, but the Braun takes a lot more strokes to get the same effect.  </li>
            <li>My 9160 had a good independent head system, but the 3d gyro is better.  </li>
            <li>Particularly, a good choice if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The only real drawback has been the beard trimmer which is subpar at best</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as good as my old razor</li>
            <li>After using a variety of Norelcos since the early 1970&#x27;s, I can state unequivocally that this is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li>So far, good wet/foam shave.  </li>
            <li>Good razer doesn&#x27;t pull hairs like my old one.</li>
            <li>i have to say that this razor is superior in comfort but not too convinced if it provides a better overall shave.</li>
            <li>Purchased this product for my 85 year old father &amp; he has loved it.  </li>
            <li>It was a good shaver, but I FINALLY couldn&#x27;t find any more shave lotion to go with it.  </li>
            <li>Getting into my 30&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been looking for a real shaving saver since I am growing more hair than ever :)</li>
            <li>it was very good quality and packaged well, it was a present and it arrived right on time</li>
            <li>Having purchased this product just over a year ago, the &amp;#34;replace head&amp;#34; light is flashing, which is fine, but the problem is that the original head is no longer available and have been replaced by &amp;#34;RQ12+&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I see people mentioning the &#x27;give your skin a month to get used to it&#x27; - I had no skin issues moving form the older one to this one, it just works a lot better!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to shave right up to my side burns &amp; mustache without that dreaded \\&quot;ooops\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>That really adds up over the lifetime of this shaver!!!</li>
            <li>First, and I can&#x27;t understand why I have not seen this problem listed before, for any of the SensoTouch models; the stubble does not stay in the shaver!!</li>
            <li>) Run very warm water from the showhead unto my facial hair for a minute or so.</li>
            <li>very powerful electric razor,just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>Philips quickly sent me out a new shaver as it was under warranty, so good service.  </li>
            <li>and it takes fewer passes through the same area to get a clean shave thus greatly reducing the amount of time it takes to shave.</li>
            <li>It is great on the chin where you will have difficulty with a flat head.</li>
            <li>Might as well enjoy how rich people shave and brush their teeth</li>
            <li>Overall a great shaver that gets the job done right!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time user of electric shavers and I&#x27;m happy so far,  </li>
            <li>More importantly it has been a breeze to use,it&#x27;s well made and cleans easily and quickly under hot running water.</li>
            <li>It got my face clean and smooth with just one or two passes.</li>
            <li>with Jet Clean System, Frustration Free Packaging]]</li>
            <li>clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Light and cuts clean, flexible.</li>
            <li>The Phillips/Norelco 1250X40 is a quick and easy shave system.</li>
            <li>It looks cool and easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>, that is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it really is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>It fits the hand easily and shaves quickly.</li>
            <li>This is actually my first time using a electric razor, and i love it so much!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, nice cleean shave.</li>
            <li>I used Phillips before ,then BRAUN and was very happy with both,BRAUN left the cosy sporty shape and new design is too bulky</li>
            <li>The clean up process is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>only good thing about this shaver is the easy cleaning unfolding piece for the razor and the battery</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super easy to clean (i didnt buy the one with the jet stream cleaning system as 1.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to rinse out &amp; clean too.</li>
            <li>I love the design, the easy cleaning, and the job it does on the rest of my face, but the neck - not so much.</li>
            <li>The pop up heads make it quick and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Good price compared to Australian Retail prices, great delivery time from amazon - only took a week for it to be delivered to Australia.</li>
            <li>Originally, I had a Phillips Norelco 7130 shaver which has 3 heads</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vibration on my original Norelco was like holding a jet engine.</li>
            <li>The original replacement head was the RQ12.</li>
            <li>That being said, as cleaning the razor manually was fairly straightforward</li>
            <li>originally gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>original review follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The original shaver head RQ12 had been replaced by RQ12</li>
            <li>But the razor burn is pretty severe, much more than I get with foil shavers.</li>
            <li>I have been using Philips for long time, which I was always happy with philips product.</li>
            <li>As someone who can afford better (yet is pretty thrifty), the SensoTouch 3D does everything I hoped it would</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first electric razor, and I really love it.</li>
            <li>My beard grows in all different directions, and shaving with a manual razor requires more than one pass in different directions to obtain the perfect shave.</li>
            <li>When it came time to replace my latest Lawnboy, I decided to take a closer look at the higher end offerings.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, the shave is close, fast and remarkably smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the Braun Series 7 - 720S which I tried first but returned.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t tug when my scruff is long which is great.</li>
            <li>Philips has a stated 2 year warrantee but customer service said it is from the &amp;#34;date of manufacture&amp;#34; unless you can produce the original receipt, regardless of whether or not you&#x27;ve registered the product online, which I did.  </li>
            <li>this shaver is great on long hair.  </li>
            <li>K - I read the reviews on Amazon as was extremely excited to give the razor a shot.  </li>
            <li>I dropped my original and water shorted it out.  </li>
            <li>As usual excellent service delivered to Australia in a week.</li>
            <li>It has cool lights and electronic light display.</li>
            <li>I used Norelco SmartTouch-XL 9160XL for 5 years and did not feel significant difference between them except that</li>
            <li>I love my first time ever electric razor.. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li>I would dare to say that the shave i got was even closer than the kind i normally get from the Gillete Fusion</li>
            <li>You do not get a better razor when you buy the higher end models.  </li>
            <li>First time i paid more than $50 for a norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Wont</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Try it and you will not disappointed</li>
            <li>and I was pretty much satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this razor thus far (over 30</li>
            <li>, I found the original heads on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have tried to get this razor to tug after 3-4 days growth, but it just cuts right thru smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li>I have had 3 and while all were good, was willing to look at much higher price if the performance was right.  </li>
            <li>did try the shaving creme with the shave and it woked alright and being able to us a hot towel was comfortable but doesn&#x27;t make for a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very good, very like, the next opportunity will come to buy!</li>
            <li>The trimmer is also better designed and more effective on the side burns as well as other stay hairs on the ears, etc.   </li>
            <li>I bought two razors are Philips, a 1150 and a 1250.As a New Year gift for my friends, they liked.</li>
            <li>All you have to do to clean</li>
            <li>First let me say this shaver is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Clean up is a breeze.  </li>
            <li>B003V37Z9W Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; just hold it under the faucet and let the water wash it clean.  </li>
            <li>The Braun \\&quot;3\\&quot; series with the \\&quot;clean and renew\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t come close to the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>clean up&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I clean it every two or three shaves.  </li>
            <li>Be prepared to have a disposable just to shape and clean up your sideburns.  </li>
            <li>It literally takes about 20 seconds to clean this after each shave.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s clean.  </li>
            <li>Its great for dry</li>
            <li>The Norelco is quieter and more comfortable as the 63 while shaving my beard much faster.</li>
            <li>far I am more pleased with the Norelco than any shaver I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so who needs to clean it every time.  </li>
            <li>come on, it takes 2 seconds to manually clean it).  </li>
            <li>to clean.</li>
            <li>The razor provides a clean shave</li>
            <li>and it just does not cut well or give clean lines.</li>
            <li>I like the ease of cleaning - image using water to clean an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I replaced the RQ12 head once and clean it with water every time I use it</li>
            <li>It is well ballanced and a snap to clean.</li>
            <li>short, this is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>,powerful, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It even shaves cleanly along the beard line without pulling any hairs from the beard.  </li>
            <li>You must clean it after each use.</li>
            <li>Manually, the Norelco is easiest to clean and you can duplicate the auto clean by pouring some of its [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>B002DHVAZW Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution]] in a dish or mug and whirring the shaver in it for 30 seconds after shaving.</li>
            <li>In order to have a clean shave, the Panasonic design needs to you pay attention to where and the movement to shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Can clean by running water over the heads</li>
            <li>if your buying to take on trips or for in the car to clean up before work..date..</li>
            <li>It truly cuts almost as clean as a hand razor.  </li>
            <li>bought this to replace a near top of the line braun and think this is better</li>
            <li>The shave you get is not as smooth a blade can produce, but the cut is good enough to look clean shaven.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make a particularly clean cut for sideburns.</li>
            <li>Must clean each unit separately after every shave as there is no room for cut hair to accumulate.</li>
            <li>get me wrong, I was happy with the older model, but when my family gave me this razor as a gift, I was very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I was hoping that the 3D Senso Touch model, at twice the price of the HS8420, would give at least as good a shave and hopefully superior shave.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco 3D razor gives a good save while not irritating skin much  </li>
            <li>Every product I have purchased has been exactly what I expected and the review systems has always lead me to making intelligent and safe purchases.</li>
            <li>, I have a light beard at best, and it took twice as long to get it knocked out as it does with a 13 year old</li>
            <li>It looks cool, but my old Norelco felt better in my hand, more control.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s replacing my old Phillips Norelco and it does a much better job!</li>
            <li>My shave yesterday was as good as the first shave I had with the device when it was brand new.</li>
            <li>Battery live is pretty good - you can probably get 10+ shaves in before having to re-charge.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a long time to get one of these new philips Norelco and when I was about to order from elsewhere, i found the best deal on amazon and went for it.</li>
            <li>It felt very smooth to the touch, and it was very soothing.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight and gives a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It does a great job dry and wet is just great.</li>
            <li>I did significant research really trying to find something better than a Norelco.  </li>
            <li>had it for more than a month now, only used it in dry mode but works perfectly..</li>
            <li>my new shaver in about a week, brand new out of the box, works great.</li>
            <li>Arcitec, which had a special price offer, when I bought this one.</li>
            <li>I did this and received an E-Mail saying so and a special code that I could order supplies for my shaver on line for a 10% discount.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t show any place where to enter my special code.  </li>
            <li>Also it leaves alot of hair no matter how many times i go over a certain spot it just doesnt get all the hair.</li>
            <li>bought this one on a special.</li>
            <li>It sure was painless, and easy to fix, should have my new shaver in 7 to 10 business days.</li>
            <li>It gets two stars because it charges quickly and is easy to clean, but it does not give me a clean, easy shave, so it&#x27;s really 1 star of performance and two of convenience.</li>
            <li>Does a great job, particularly compared to the old Norelco it replaced.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to order this razor because I had never had an electric one before and always wanted one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially effective in the hard to shave areas at the interface of my moustache and my nose.</li>
            <li>There is just nothing overly impressive about the build quality that I feel justifies the high price unless you must have the wet shave ability.  </li>
            <li>If you get too aggressive you can get redness, but for normal use this is much more comfortable than blade shaving.  </li>
            <li>Pretty easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is bye far the best razor I have ever used, would not even think about buying one of those $60.00 ones ever again, I just can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to get one,</li>
            <li>basically good, but I wish there was a bigger trimmer</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t give it up for 10 years worth of free power glides or something.</li>
            <li>A overall really good razor.</li>
            <li>It is very quiet and easy to clean up since it allows for rinsing under warm water.</li>
            <li>, they were all good, but when the last one I had started to die, I thought, for some reason, to try out a Braun.  </li>
            <li>Both provided close shaves, with the Panny a bit more gentle than the 3D.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, you have to learn how to use an electric razor properly to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, you have to learn how to use an electric razor properly to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Personally I get a shave that is as good as a blade when I use shaving cream with it.</li>
            <li>so you are always at a full charge when you pick it up.</li>
            <li>virtually full charged 24/7 even after a 10 minute shave.</li>
            <li>However any of the top line shavers made by Panasonic, Braun or Phillips/Norelco will come very close.</li>
            <li>All of these negatives are acceptable to me, since it does give me such a good shave.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bite, pull or irritate and it still gives a clean, quick shave.  </li>
            <li>I must admit the heads are kind of funky on the Norelco, so I am concerned how it will travel, but as far as the shave</li>
            <li>Many thanks,    </li>
            <li>However if you want a really close shave, as I do, you do have to go over your skin one or more times, but this is no problem&lt;</li>
            <li>The Norelco is still not as good as a regular blade razor.</li>
            <li>If you need to shave 1-2 times a day and your super hairy I might recommend the Jet Clean never used it</li>
            <li>The stand is a bit unbalanced, but does not take up a lot of real estate on your counter top either.</li>
            <li>Overall I have found this to be a good product.</li>
            <li>, this product is true winner and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quiet and feels good on the face.  </li>
            <li>but good enough</li>
            <li>I finally got a good razor that will take my fuzz</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have paid full price for it.  </li>
            <li>One of the others is more comfortable to use, but this one does a better job of shaving, especially if I have missed a day or two of shaving.  </li>
            <li>Love this Razer very close to shaving as close as a blade.</li>
            <li>So over the course of my life the shavers have kept me whole and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this shaver, if U can afford it :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true what they say - it may take a couple of weeks for your face to adjust and for you to figure out what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>
            <li>had I paid the full price though.</li>
            <li>Shave seems a bit closer and is much quicker, more efficient.</li>
            <li>and when you need to replace the blades.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not true.</li>
            <li>The style was good for this razor but the shave was inconsistant and we needed to use a regular razor what a disaapointment.</li>
            <li>have used it with foam and it glides really well and maybe does a slightly better job, if not taking a bit</li>
            <li>Pro: The only really good thing about the 1255x is the noise:</li>
            <li>I judged the 1255x could not get as good as the Braun Series 5 with such a test, so I quit.  </li>
            <li>Pros - still sleek and quiet, does a good job on cheeks.</li>
            <li>Looks cool  </li>
            <li>It provides a quick and clean shave.  </li>
            <li>if you are one that needs a very close shave, the razor is better.</li>
            <li>Sensotouch 3d does a good enough job, but if I was going to buy another electric razor</li>
            <li>I am very well satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Gave to my son for Christmas and he can&#x27;t say enough good about the ease and comfort of this razor.</li>
            <li>A full charge does take just about an hour as described in the manual.</li>
            <li>Good present for father&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li>I get about 15+ shaves per full charge.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even tell that the razor is on or maybe I have a really noisy exhaust :)</li>
            <li>I gave this razor a good review initially, but after using it for over a year I have downgraded my rating because it does not work well shaving the hair below my chin.  </li>
            <li>he just lifted the whole top and empty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really has enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Overall, this shaver was a good purchase and exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li>had my eye on this model for quite awhile, but just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend so much while not being sure I would even like</li>
            <li>I got this shaver at costco for $115 after mail-in-rebate which is a pretty sweet deal considering that the shaver itself is worth more than that</li>
            <li>/&gt;The battery lasted a full calendar week of use for me, and I also had the trimmer attachment to trim my goatee, which I did once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>dry-shave with this unit, and many people are amazed at the hairlength, which is very comparable to blade</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gives a close shave, looks cool</li>
            <li>so not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The beard trimmer part is not bad, either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really as bad as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>This razor is not bad.</li>
            <li>thoughts are this: it&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not for</li>
            <li>Have been using this new electric shaver - Philips Norelco 1250x/40 senso touch for about a month and find it excellent so far, easy to use and easy to clean, do not like the recommended frequent change of blades,feel it is a large added cost factor.</li>
            <li>Ever Very fast shave Cleans easy too</li>
            <li>face ends up much smoother with less work, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It shaves closer, feels   more natural, cleans easily.</li>
            <li>This really seems like a great razor and, from most of the other reviews, it would seem to be.</li>
            <li>This is the best shaver Philips makes, the 1290x and other similar model costs more, because of the cleaning station and longer battery life.</li>
            <li>This shaver has a quick 1 hour to full charge feature.</li>
            <li>the charging stand is pretty easy to topple over.</li>
            <li>The detachable head is extremely easy to clean and really does come out clean when you are done, no place for the hairs to hide so to speak  5 Out of 5    </li>
            <li>I have had many electric shavers and always had to resort to the blade razors to make sure it left my face clean.</li>
            <li>The shave feels very smooth and close, maybe not as close as a razor but way more convenient if you shave on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>However after many years &amp; many different shavers I find this to be true.</li>
            <li>After reading all the other great reviews of this shaver, I couldnt wait to get it</li>
            <li>Knowing he would not spend this type of money of himself I went out on a limb and bought it after reading the other great reviews.</li>
            <li>If Philips made the original head available for purchase too (at a reasonable price), then fair enough.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to find the website and very quickly I had selected the live chat option and was explaining my issue with a customer service rep.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, I just run it under some hot water and it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, well packed.</li>
            <li>It was quick and painless.</li>
            <li>It is very compact and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Some quick tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some quick tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it irritates my neck even more than a regular razor because I have to go over the area so many times.</li>
            <li>Fast, comfortable, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>he can just rinse by running water after each use, convenient and quick.             </li>
            <li>Of course, electric shavers do not shave as close as a blade and if going out at night, have to give a quick touch-up.</li>
            <li>I got this razor at Walmart for $80+tax because it was on super clearance for some reason</li>
            <li>We got it in the mail quickly</li>
            <li>try it and you will never experience such a delightful shaving experience especially when you use a foam shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Super close, zero irritation.  </li>
            <li>Norelco is as extraordinarily close as the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Purchased phillips norelco before heading to Afghanistan for the second time the razor has held up through the entire deployment and still works great to this day!</li>
            <li>But the Norelco gives a closer, more comfortable shave by far.  </li>
            <li>but you get used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li>This can give you a quick painless shave, or if you stretch you skin and push aggressively, can get you as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>And that for me is the main disadvantage of the razor; while the Advantage 7735X shaves closely, without lotion, and even better with it, without some sort of moisturizer</li>
            <li>Each time I use this, I keep thinking to return it because of the time it takes but the convenience and ability to shave quickly if I want seems to outweigh the negatives.</li>
            <li>I love this because I can use it in so many different ways.  </li>
            <li>Shaving often is not only ok, but is even better with an electric.</li>
            <li>Quick charging, efficient.</li>
            <li>I really like how easy the blades are to clean.  </li>
            <li>I thought that was adequate for a higher-end razer.</li>
            <li>and I think that I&#x27;m now ready to provide an accurate and detailed review.    </li>
            <li>He likes the fact that it can be cleaned under running water, recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>My friend think that it is worthy to recommend to them.</li>
            <li>Shaves super close.  </li>
            <li>Quick charging&lt;br</li>
            <li>I came from about 20 years of using Panasonics and find that the Norelco 1240/50 to be a worthy successor.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal Norelco user for years.  </li>
            <li>Charges quickly</li>
            <li>After contemplating, I decide to just go ahead and write a quick description of my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a good shaver - not great, but good.</li>
            <li>I have used norelco razors for many many years and never had any complaints until the last two razors I have Purchased.  </li>
            <li>It handles curves and the soft skin of my neck very easily.  </li>
            <li>I was actually so impressed, I went back onto amazon and purchased the Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro.</li>
            <li>Overall, an amazingly close and comfortable shave, and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>With each time that I have used this razor, the cuts have been consistent and still just as smooth.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;WOW; from the very first shave I was rapt.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t provide reviews for items that I purchase, however this time I am so satisfied with this razor that I will break with that policy.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stylish (so what), easy to clean, shaves like a charm, and is SO QUIET!!!  </li>
            <li>It felt so smooth and really close to a blade shave!</li>
            <li>However, it does do its primary purpose of shaving the face pretty well.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve all lasted a long time and done a good</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco wet shavers for a good 10 years; the last one I bought and am still using is the model HS8420 (probably now obsolete) which gives me a reasonably good shave for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I loved the long ago day when the Wilkinson Sword blades came out.  </li>
            <li>Not so good for long ones.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used norelco, but recently read that foil razors are better for sensitive skin and tried one that was good.  </li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for many years, most have been good, but not great.</li>
            <li>Now, if the replacement heads are easy to obtain I will certainly have a keeper..</li>
            <li>Simply flip up the heads &amp; run warm water over them &amp; they come completely clean.</li>
            <li>Other positives is that the shaver is very easy to hold with a very light weight.</li>
            <li>He is completely satisfied with this new Norelco 1250X/40 Sense Touch 3D and uses it every day.</li>
            <li>With increasing frequency, these electric shaver companies release a new product, coming up with increasingly enticing words that turn out to be more hype than substance.    </li>
            <li>After reading more reviews on the new electric Norelco rotary shavers I decided to purchase the Philips Norelco triple head 1250x.</li>
            <li>It just took too many passes even after a new blade</li>
            <li>This new 3D series, IS better.</li>
            <li>This new style is much better, it hasn&#x27;t happened yet.</li>
            <li>They shipped me a new handle, now after two more years the unit still runs but will not charge.  </li>
            <li>do I want a better shave, or just a new novelty?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some Cons: the new one cuts just as close but takes more &amp;#34;strokes&amp;#34; over an area to get there, so a shave takes about 25% longer.</li>
            <li>NOW, it seems that Philips Marketing have nothing better to do than to come up with new names for a product that they already shipped.  </li>
            <li>In fact I still use it, after, the new unit to finish many shaves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite, smooth, comfortable, painless and best of all, it really give you a very close shave, even at the hard to get spots.  </li>
            <li>The 3D flex inward/outward blade head is cool and is responsible for the comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Because of this I experienced slight irritation along the neck...</li>
            <li>reviews were good, if not better than the Arcitec, and it was a better price.  </li>
            <li>Foil shavers have been pretty good for me, and the last one I had was the Braun series 5 foil shaver.</li>
            <li>overall a pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li>Loved my first one, second one didn&#x27;t hold up as well</li>
            <li>easy to use and fast charging.</li>
            <li>the Norelco is comparatively quieter; it&#x27;s easier to clean (which becomes even more important when traveling); and it&#x27;s smaller than the Braun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-- Fast, easy, and often...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shave the neck and sensitive areas first, while the shaver isn&#x27;t too warm.</li>
            <li>Still cuts really close and is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>new 3D razor is much more comfortable and does the job significantly faster than the older models.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean, easy to charge, holds charge very well and for numerous shaves.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how other brand works but the performance of this razor is amazing!</li>
            <li>but I dont really care because of the speed at which you can have a shave with this thing!!</li>
            <li>went and got the whole dame set!!  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver, so i don&#x27;t have a reference to compare with, but I really amazed how good this shaver is, as I have a sensitive skin and this shaver did not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>The last innovative Norelco I had purchased was not as  good as the more conventional one before.</li>
            <li>design is impressive and a complete departure from previous Norelco designs.</li>
            <li>It is super quiet and the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li>The 1250x/40 was perfect for me because I shave my face dry, so cleaning isn&#x27;t a big issue.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean and very quiet.</li>
            <li>Clean up is also a snap, just run hot water over the heads.</li>
            <li>Previously bought 1150, very loving husband.</li>
            <li>for this kind of price they should have done the QA to consider this and provide us with either this little collar thing or even better, make it detachable from the stand itself.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only shaved once with it so far, but it was very comfortable and far quieter than the Braun razor I used for many years, and gave me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Shave just a little better then my old Norelco, but not to any great</li>
            <li>Like many have said, you don&#x27;t have to push hard to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for about a week now and have found it to be the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had other than a fresh new straight razor.  </li>
            <li>But their latest stand folds more flatly than their previous stand, so if that&#x27;s an issue, be sure to get the latest version.</li>
            <li>Very close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I had no razor irritation or burn from using the product, and it really glides smoothly over my face.  </li>
            <li>The heads really pivot to make it fit the contours of your face,</li>
            <li>It seems to glide smoothly over my skin and cuts very close.</li>
            <li>charge is great - give it one hour from a dead charge</li>
            <li>However, I got a very close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>he really like&#x27;s the close and smooth way it cuts his beard.  </li>
            <li>After using this razor for several months, it does offer an amazing shave.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it whole heartedly to anyone one who needs a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t attempted a wet shave with this yet, but I have been very happy with the results of a dry shave as well as the ability to easily clean the unit when done.  </li>
            <li>One of the few shavers I was happy with.  </li>
            <li>The shave is very close, even and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that it&#x27;s a bit challenging to accurately shave up to the bottom of my sideburns.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and charges really fast.</li>
            <li>It gives a really close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to cheaper non flex shavers it makes all the difference and the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li>The head is very flexible and comfortable.</li>
            <li>it and you will enjoy shaving and hopefully, Philips continue manufacturing the RQ12 replacement head with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Fast, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I have used it a few times now and seems to work great.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use, and the shave was very close.  </li>
            <li>Very quite and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Meets the primary purpose very well, a close shave.</li>
            <li>Battery life is pretty sweet, I&#x27;ve shaved almost once per day since I got it (a month ago)</li>
            <li>And I own everything from a fusion pro glide to a Double Edge Aristocrat.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the $200?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I didnt want to reject the electric shavers on a poor model so decided to buy the best    3.</li>
            <li>The upgrade is worth it.</li>
            <li>Zero redness even in the more sensitive spots (jaw line and neck).</li>
            <li>They actually don&#x27;t need the auto cleaning station (although it is handy for storage for the Panny).</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.be curly, and the hairs would curve under and cause bumps growing under the skin laterally.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This razor is lightweight, fits nice in your hand and is so much quieter than the old one.</li>
            <li>Nice visual aesthetic but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even quieter than my Dad&#x27;s old Sunbeam that he used many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I hoped the expense was worth it to get</li>
            <li>, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>i think it is really worth it.</li>
            <li>Okay I thought I&#x27;ll give it a couple more tries.  </li>
            <li>I just gave up, so it might have been 20 minutes or more of work just to get it to the point where my old foil shaver could get to.</li>
            <li>Really liked it overall.  </li>
            <li>My old 6826XL remains my favorite, but Norelco no longer makes replacement heads that work well with it.  </li>
            <li>Find a deal, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Wet Shave - Just as good.</li>
            <li>im glad i didnt spend the extra 100 for the bells and whistles of the advanced model.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is much better than the old Norelcos i used to use.</li>
            <li>I could have not been more surprised.</li>
            <li>well worth the extra dollars to own it.  </li>
            <li>well worth the extra dollars to own it.   </li>
            <li>It offers better coverage.</li>
            <li>They are not that rare and you can probably find one in your employee pool.  </li>
            <li>They are not that rare and you can probably find one in your employee pool.  </li>
            <li>And, the more sensitive parts never feel as if they have been \\&quot;sandpapered\\&quot;.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Additionally, the shaver really noiseless which is good especially at morning.</li>
            <li>good, very like, the next opportunity will come to buy!</li>
            <li>fancy looks doesn&#x27;t make it a better shaver than old style ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, that &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; idea where the neck bends in every which way sounds good in theory but has absolutely no benefit whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I have used electric razors most of my adult life to shave.  </li>
            <li>I am not unhappy with my choice.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good but not a whole lot else.</li>
            <li>It does hold a charge for about a week and the trimming blade is useful.</li>
            <li>but i can&#x27;t comment on the durability because i rarely used it.</li>
            <li>Each shave has gotten better, I&#x27;ve used the razor around 10 times so far.    </li>
            <li>Yes, I know it&#x27;s charged for up to 17 days worth of shaving but</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been a Norelco man for many years, wanted this model when it was time to replace his old one.</li>
            <li>Yes, this is somewhat pricey, but to me it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth the price.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they mention you actually also need to take the razor stand with you or you can not charge the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>big difference between senso 2D and 3D really liked it.</li>
            <li>bit price but worth it.</li>
            <li>it shaves without the pulling on the face  and neck but not any better than the old model.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Rarely do I have to go over an area twice</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed about the shaver was the cool battery meter.  </li>
            <li>This razor is smooth on the face and actually cuts most of my whiskers off.</li>
            <li>Got better shave with my old Norelco 9190.</li>
            <li>Alas, nothing is perfect.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was literally losing my hearing from my old Panasonic foil shaver, so sound was my primary concern.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is cordless but a far as a close shave</li>
            <li>You simply pop the shaver heads up on their hinge and run warm water through the heads and the well which collects the whiskers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>They are worth maybe $0.50.  </li>
            <li>Will be a useful appliance.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for in your busy day?</li>
            <li>So Soft make shaving an absolutely enjoyable experience.  </li>
            <li>but I think that it is worth every penny that I paid for it.</li>
            <li>THIS WOULD BE WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>I.ve bought, but worth it,</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t believe it is worth it.</li>
            <li>No electric razor could EVER be as good as a straight razor, but this is a quicker, cleaner alternative for daily shaving before work.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and gives a very smoth shave pluse it is always ready with the recharging stand in place</li>
            <li>Worth every penny?  </li>
            <li>Because of the pivoting heads, it&#x27;s not as good on the detail as my old fixed rotary was.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it if you loathe the irritation from shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lets say you use a high end razor with replaceable cartridges, pick one of the top of the line with 4-5 blades that really shaves super close.    </li>
            <li>Super quiet, a surprisingly smooth, close shave, comfortable and efficient, this product is true winner and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like a display that tells me more clearly how much battery life is remaining, but perhaps the marketing department at Philips Norelco needed a way to disaggregate their product line and charge more on the high end.</li>
            <li>I never spent so much on a razor before, but I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>But one year after purchasing this product I do expect to be able to purchase a replacement head with the same design as the original head.  </li>
            <li>I had some mild discomfort for the first two shaves and none since.  </li>
            <li>Cleans quickly by opening up the petals and rinsing with hot water.  </li>
            <li>the build is very nice, it is not cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The good: quiet... long battery life,nice close shave, easy to clean</li>
            <li>(I dump my Braun into the more convenient, connected charger/cleaner whenever I am at home.)&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning - Flip open each of the three heads and clean under running water.  </li>
            <li>It is so superior to any other shaver I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m that person that reads a ton of reviews before I buy something like this, and they were all absolutely right.</li>
            <li>It even shaves right under my nose.</li>
            <li>It was the right decision.</li>
            <li>Google was right.</li>
            <li>any case I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s right by Amazon how they handled this</li>
            <li>It just seems like it is lacking the power to do the job right.</li>
            <li>I knew I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>Look for the $20 coupon being offered by Norelco right now (just saw the ad on TV).</li>
            <li>He charged it right away and used it right away.</li>
            <li>I find that the On/Off switch is positioned right where I hold the razor</li>
            <li>In all fairness the hair on my neck just on the right side never cooperates.</li>
            <li>I just hope it&#x27;s easy to buy a new stand in case the plastic breaks.</li>
            <li>This gives a clean shave all over my face and neck, and the trimmer really works.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco for the past 10+ years and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This Norelco 1250x/40 is much easier to clean by comparison.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much quieter and easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>It is super quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Quick to charge, easy to clean and gives a terrific shave.</li>
            <li>It shaved pretty good but not real close.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really know how to clean the blades.</li>
            <li>, the only thing that concerned me was the heads were very easy to push inwards.</li>
            <li>First I have to say, the shipping was really fast!!</li>
            <li>When charging the product, my razor emitted a high frequency ringing sound.</li>
            <li>Use dry or in the shower with some Body Wash Gel and smooth as my Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy all over again!!</li>
            <li>Shame on you, Philips Norelco for making a good product, only to abandon it for the new model.</li>
            <li>The new one doesn&#x27;t feel as good in my hand when shaving, a personal preference or course.</li>
            <li>Always like a dummy the grass is greener on the other side of the fence, so surely a more costly razor must certainly work better than the economical throw away Remington razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>My previous Braun did a great job on my face, but it really struggled with my neck.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is even easier to clean than my old Braun which had a noisy cleaning system because even using that you still had to periodically clean it manually.  </li>
            <li>Short hairs were easy to cut, and this razor provided a comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li>it offers a quick and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it offers a quick and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This new one is great, as it provides a thorough shave, is quiet, easy to clean, and shows how much charge you have left.</li>
            <li>Small, light, almost noiseless, a very close shave, easy to clean, versatile in many ways.  </li>
            <li>However its great for traveling especially due to the liquid restrictions on flights</li>
            <li>Charges fast and lasts about a week with a full charge.</li>
            <li>Full marks to the manufacturers for a real state-of-art shaver.  </li>
            <li>The razor not only performed noticeably better than the crappy $8 electric razor I purchased while I was waiting for this razor, but also better than my old Norelco model with the HQ-9 heads.  </li>
            <li>A few of them are really helpful, many of them are just amusing.  </li>
            <li>in built beard trimmer is pretty useful and tucks away, so it is almost forgotten.</li>
            <li>While this was an upgrade from an electric shaver I&#x27;ve used for the past 10+ years, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Since I have had a great experience in the past, I was eager to continue with the Philips brand.  </li>
            <li>Now it is so much smoother than my old razor and still - doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all! :)</li>
            <li>but it certainly does not shave as closely or as quickly as a razor.</li>
            <li>A light tap with a finger is enough to send finely chopped hair all over your pants when I am not shaving under a sink - which is often.  </li>
            <li>, good job Philips, I got 2, never let me down.</li>
            <li>You *cannot* directly plug the charger into the shaver, meaning if you want to be able to charge it while traveling, plan on packing the large charging stand too.  </li>
            <li>It works better than my old Norelco smart touch XL.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having as a reference the electric shaver of my grandfather and my dad, I was impressed by how little noise this unit makes, it is really quiet.  </li>
            <li>Like many of these products, you will / should replace the blades maybe once a year or little longer, to keep it performing top notch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of wet shaving, but both of these do a very good job.</li>
            <li>One more thing to have to make sure you have when you travel, and the quality of the docking station material (light plastic) would seem to guarantee that it won&#x27;t last as long as the razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mean look at the thing... its beautiful....</li>
            <li>My face and head are nice and smooth and it was extremely convenient not having to lotion-up my whole head and rinse the shaver heads every 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Before this, I owned a Philips Norelco Smart Touch XL that lasted over 6 years!</li>
            <li>A standard razorhead could do the job much faster and effectively.  </li>
            <li>Since I never bought a foil shaver, i still dont know which is bettwe, but sometimes I think the straight movement against the grain would be better and far quicker    </li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin that is easily irritated by shaving, you will appreciate any of the Phillips/Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li>Quietly does it&#x27;s job, easy to clean and shaves so close.  </li>
            <li>Which is surprising since it requires so much less pressure than the Braun did.  </li>
            <li>I use this razor daily, overall I&#x27;m happy with it with some limitations.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it irritates easily</li>
            <li>The manual is complete and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>The vendor and delivery were super fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>This shaver is absolutely superior to my previous Norelco in terms of closeness and efficiency, design and ergonomics.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I had a previous Norelco which is preatty good, but decided to upgrade.</li>
            <li>After using for several months, the razor does not cut as good as my 6 yr old razor.</li>
            <li>I convinced my wife into letting me spend some extra cash on a really good razor as it was that my old one was nicking my face.</li>
            <li>The SensoTouch is much quieter which is nice; especially when getting close to my ear</li>
            <li>The ease of cleaning is also excellent; I simply open the heads and run the shower on them for a few seconds, cleaning everything, after I&#x27;m finished</li>
            <li>Sleek design  *longer battery life than previous generations, good for travel  </li>
            <li>As a precision trimmer it works OK, but I much prefer the old trimmer size and pop-out method.</li>
            <li>I can say that I am not impressed because for this money you kind expecting good quality.</li>
            <li>My previous Norelco looked like this one, but didn&#x27;t give as good a shave.  </li>
            <li>The 1250x/40 worked well and was easy to clean - until it stopped working after only 2 years!</li>
            <li>After getting used to the features of the shaver, I&#x27;ve found it provides a close shave, is exceptionally quiet, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Quiet, easy to clean and holds the charge well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the shaver can only be charged with the stand which is big and clunky making not so great for traveling</li>
            <li>It is not as good as my multiple year old Norelco 8240XL</li>
            <li>The 3D feature is comfortable and the three heads really cover a lot of ground and make my shaves fast.</li>
            <li>This new model is outstanding in performance and value and is highly recommended by this user.</li>
            <li>the older models actually are better in my book and cheaper!</li>
            <li>He loves it and highly recommends it for a clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li>Several days after this review, I&#x27;ve been getting better and better at shaving with this shaver as I learn which parts of my face require a little more care.</li>
            <li>That is not something I could have done with a blade....  and considering how easy it is to clean after use, by simply running it under hot water?  </li>
            <li>the product is of excellent quality, meets my expectations and is exactly what you expected, widely recommended this product.</li>
            <li>They were super sharp and gave a superb shave, didn&#x27;t pull or hurt your face and didn&#x27;t slice your skin like the old double edge blades.  </li>
            <li>That last bit was sarcasm, since nobody needs an LCD battery meter and can clean their razor just fine with 10 seconds of running waster.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive and get razor burn pretty easy.</li>
            <li>he like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast shave in just 3 minutes, with shaving</li>
            <li>to a massive imbalance when sitting on the stand, the stand uses 3 suction cups to hold it to whatever (very smooth) surface it&#x27;s sitting on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However the shaver shaves very, very well.  </li>
            <li>i like it very much.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very fast and quiet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also it charges very fast.</li>
            <li>When I purchased it though I didn&#x27;t realize I was getting a model that did not have a self cleaning system which I like very much.</li>
            <li>So far, the batteries are behaving fine.  </li>
            <li>I tried using light pressure and many other things, but nothing helped stop the razor burn.</li>
            <li>The downside is that, with the irregular head shape and recommended circular strokes, it takes a little longer to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Quickly and easily shave all my facial hair off.</li>
            <li>Good, close, and consistent shave in little time.  </li>
            <li>The razor works very well for me and cleans up easily since heads are not directly connected to motor, washing is easily accomplish.    </li>
            <li>Although it feels a little cheap plastic, but the overall performance is great.</li>
            <li>It does get a little hot towards the end of your shave which can make things take longer and not feel as nice as a cool razor, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the traditional Norelco razors for decades and have been satisfied.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need the additional bells and whistles of the even higher models of Norelco.  </li>
            <li>The razor works Better than I would have ever thought possible.</li>
            <li>He has been through many electric shavers and back and forth with the disposable razors.</li>
            <li>shave the first time, after charging the unit overnight.</li>
            <li>As promised, the razor did adjust to my face, and was able to get out the hairs much better than I&#x27;ve had with electric razors in the past.  </li>
            <li>Well, in this economy, maybe you&#x27;d stick with the manual, because I&#x27;ll admit the price is pretty steep.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor and till now i have used the Gillette Mach series.     </li>
            <li>You know the answer to the first 2 questions, and this is what i found  1.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Yes, a razor will definitely perform a closer shave, the price of razors are nothing compared to this electric shaver but what this shaver has offered is way better than that:</li>
            <li>the product camequikly and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>So, not only does this shaver cost a lot, it costs more than buying cartridges each year to use -</li>
            <li>Most batteries like this last 2-3 years tops before they stop holding a charge.</li>
            <li>I am in the first week of that 21 days.</li>
            <li>Much more quiet than the corded one that died after 7 years of use.</li>
            <li>As far as the heads themselves, I believe there is a reminder light that comes on after a year to remind you to change the heads.  </li>
            <li>As far as the heads themselves, I believe there is a reminder light that comes on after a year to remind you to change the heads.  </li>
            <li>I love it and would definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Now, with the Gyroflex 3D, I am completely burn free.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be a quality device that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone willing to pay the price.</li>
            <li>First is that you can&#x27;t just plug the cord in to recharge it....</li>
            <li>The price outstanding, I looked at several stores in my area</li>
            <li>It is better than a prior Philips rotary shaver that I owned.  </li>
            <li>I charged it when I first got it and then used it every day for almost a month before I had to charge it again.</li>
            <li>Once the battery indicator turned red, I was still able to use it another four days.</li>
            <li>first Norelco I owned was a cheaper model that squirted lotion.</li>
            <li>I felt as if it would not be able to push enough to cut the hairs..</li>
            <li>It felt cheap, and its 1-month performance demonstrated to me that today&#x27;s Norelco is not the Norelco of old.</li>
            <li>Been using Norelco&#x27;s since I first began shaving.  </li>
            <li>Better than a razor and my last electric.</li>
            <li>I did not wait till the real day!</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and my beard is light.  </li>
            <li>Just rinse under hot water.  </li>
            <li>You run the top part under water for 5 seconds, then you pop open the 3 heads and run them all under water for about 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>After using Lectric Shave, there was a lot more stubble left, and I had some nicks on my face and razor burn.</li>
            <li>I used the Senso Touch for the first time this morning</li>
            <li>The shave is still pretty close but not as close as a blade</li>
            <li>This product gets the stubble on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>I really love this razor and actually look forward to shaving.  </li>
            <li>First off, a disclaimer.  </li>
            <li>First use of this razor</li>
            <li>(Really!)</li>
            <li>(Really!)</li>
            <li>Is it worth paying 2-3 times as much for a SensoTouch 3D?  </li>
            <li>first shave is always tricky since you have to follow a circular motion along the contours of the face.</li>
            <li>Much more flexible and gets to all the places on my neck with relative ease.  </li>
            <li>will add here that a funny thing happened on the way to bed monday night..</li>
            <li>I wonder exactly what they are expecting to do with the trimmer on an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s the reason I moved to electric shavers in the first place.</li>
            <li>First, the surface around the heads extends out farther than on the cheaper models which means that you can&#x27;t get the blades to cut as close to your nose and ears.</li>
            <li>Unless you see sense in spending more for future replacement heads than you did for the shaver.</li>
            <li>I even checked online first to see if they had it in stock and on walmart site</li>
            <li>(shaving heads more often)and recently replaced my 5-year-old Philips Norelco.  </li>
            <li>It is considerably more silent running.</li>
            <li>First, the razor works well.  </li>
            <li>give the Norelco SensoTouch five stars but for that issue with my first one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Philips/Norelco shavers for years and finally upgraded to the latest 3D</li>
            <li>So now I treat myself to a nice wet shave once or twice a week</li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve owned that I can say that about.</li>
            <li>Even though they recommend you replace the heads on this razor once every 12 months, mine aren&#x27;t lasting more than 3-4 months at a time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it actually takes more time to use this than a blade.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t the first electric razor I&#x27;ve tried but it is the first in this price range.</li>
            <li>never failed.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>My neck broke out at first.</li>
            <li>which part of the face to shave first.</li>
            <li>Shave with the grain at first.</li>
            <li>I bought it more than 2 years ago, and checked the head prices back then.</li>
            <li>and save your money on the self cleaning models,because all you need to do is run it under hot water</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I decided to stick with the brand, but upgrade to a higher quality model.</li>
            <li>I will follow up later on my use of this &amp; expecting a better shave in time.</li>
            <li>Thanks Norleco, way to treat your customers!</li>
            <li>Just got it today,So far shaving level is smooth as hell</li>
            <li>Received shaver on 3/2&lt;br /&gt;and am still on first charge.</li>
            <li>Having been a Braun fan for most of my life, the last experience just didn&#x27;t set with me all too well.</li>
            <li>That would be an issue when I travel a lot (more on that later).</li>
            <li>(You experience the same \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period when These seemed to be perfect from the first, possibly explained by the fact that the blade replacement cost is roughly double what Norelco charges for non-3D models.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Not recommended at all to anyone who really needs a shaver!  </li>
            <li>I hope my unit won&#x27;t stop working all of a sudden as many have reported...</li>
            <li>The razor works OK when it actually charges...</li>
            <li>exactly is the go (The Braun took 4</li>
            <li>SensoTouch 3D is completely cord free, has a travel lock, and comes with a protective pouch, so you can toss it in your bag, briefcase, or suitcase when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li>I have tried both this shaver and the Braun Series 7-790 shaver and there is no comparison that the Braun is a higher quality product.  </li>
            <li>Also, the overall quality of the shave was better with the Braun.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this, he gets a very close shave!</li>
            <li>Rotary shaving is multi-directional, while the Brauns make shaving against the grain easier.)&lt;br /&gt;Charging - This shaver charges only on its stand, which seems OK when you are at home.  </li>
            <li>First the good:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve been able to tell, the Panasonic solution is only a detergent.</li>
            <li>luck if your product never fails.</li>
            <li>the first 10 shaves than your beard adjusts to the rotary shaving and its just a couple of passes to catch everything.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it</li>
            <li>*shaves very close without any \\&quot;tugging\\&quot; of the hairs or skin!  </li>
            <li>It is a lot more quiet.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what is advertised.</li>
            <li>It included an extra replacement shaving head so it was a better deal than elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>Very stealth!  </li>
            <li>but I was able to finish shaving in personal record time.  </li>
            <li>as I say, this is my first, so I have no others to compare to..</li>
            <li>This is definetely a better shaver than my last $60 shaver but for twice the price</li>
            <li>I had to use a beard shaver first then the foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>As of this writing (3/24/15), the replacement head costs more than the actual razor itself.</li>
            <li>I am a first time user of an electric razor.</li>
            <li>so it stays where you put it, and charges in one hour, much better than the last Norelco we had.</li>
            <li>It gives a close shave, has a long battery life and is so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>But I still love how quiet it is, and it still does the job.  </li>
            <li>Within 5 months the smooth shave was gone completely, replaced by a head that was biting and tearing my skin.</li>
            <li>I admit that while the design of these shaver had caught my postive attention at first, the purchase price dissuaded me from making the purchase.</li>
            <li>The manual says it can take up to 21 days for your beard and skin to become used to this shaver, so one should be patient about being satisfied with the initial shaves.</li>
            <li>My first shave had my face feeling like a babies bottom.</li>
            <li>Been using this piece for about 8 months now and earlier versions of philishave models for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>Several reasons, but the most imp is - comfort.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s more, but you definitely get what you pay for!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Norelco - you have ended years of frustration!</li>
            <li>But I like the shaver so much that it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>all electrics it will never cut as close as a safety razor but it will get pretty damned close to</li>
            <li>and I buy this one because I think could be better, but the reality is not, is the same shaving sensation and do</li>
            <li>This razor works exactly as all the promotional information states.  </li>
            <li>no te gusta, obviamente no la pienso devolver.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>I charged it up and proceeded to take my first shave.  </li>
            <li>EVEN BETTER SHAVE THAN MY LAST NORELCO</li>
            <li>I think this shaver is much better than the Braun series shavers and is what saved me from going back to a manual shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor is quieter and provides an even better shave than earlier Norelco shavers that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Wished I had stayed with the more traditional Norelco design.  </li>
            <li>The travel case is flimsy which is worrisome given the seemingly more fragile design.  </li>
            <li>This one was probably $50 or $60 more than my last Norelco</li>
            <li>This shaver is different it is outstanding in the close shave you receive from it.</li>
            <li>My first shave went like this:</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>whom would you recommend this product - Anyone interested</li>
            <li>Actually I would hope to be able to still buy it *</li>
            <li>Cleaning is more of a chore with the blade assemblies on a hinge and each cutter buried deeply within the assembly.  </li>
            <li>So far it works really good and holds a charge for a long time before having to recharge.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco died (after a good, long life), so I upgraded to this one.</li>
            <li>I use this razor everyday and it does a good job, but doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.</li>
            <li>In spite of the hype I would say this shaver shaves as well as or very slightly better than my old Norelco does with new cutters installed, certainly not enough better to justify the much higher price.  </li>
            <li>This one seems more fragile, is less comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t appear to give a better shave.  </li>
            <li>There, he took it apart and said it&#x27;s made cheaply of plastic and will no longer be waterproof after he solders new battery in.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after much footwork and cost, it works again.  </li>
            <li>I started my search for a new razor when my old Braun, top of the line at the time, Model # 8589 started to faulter.</li>
            <li>After some question and answer I was pleased (and a bit surprised) when I was asked for my mailing address and told a new handle would be sent to me.  </li>
            <li>I have usued it dry and with shaving gel, and what a nice fast close shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a joy to shave like this as opposed to the daily burden of a dry shave.</li>
            <li>The shaver is lighter, easier to use, shaves very closely and is easier to clean than was my older model.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is an original replacement heat, feels and cuts like a cheap razor, I am using my old 3 yr old head</li>
            <li>It is extremely easy to clean, I wouldn&#x27;t spend money on the more expensive models, they all have the same shaving head and performance, the add ons are the cleaning station and more advanced display screens.  </li>
            <li>Here are a few specifics: shockingly quiet, super close shave, very comfortable, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>My previous Norelco was an Arcitec, and I was very pleased with it, and planned to go on line and get another like it.</li>
            <li>very close shave, quiet, quick recharge, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>If you need to shave quickly under normal circumstance with the avoidance of razor burn this could be the razor for you as it has worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li>My only issue is that it&#x27;s size takes up a large part of my travel kit, but a small price to pay for a great shave!</li>
            <li>My conclusion was that although the shave is great, it&#x27;s not that much better than my old norelco, and the frustrations aren&#x27;t worth the cost of this expensive shaver.    </li>
            <li>very smooth, less burn and clean shave.</li>
            <li>It works fine with gel of shaving cream, but using it dry does not give me a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Good razor, works fine on wet and dry surfaces.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the fancy cleaner like the Braun (which is kind of loud in the morning when my wife is trying to sleep), but hot water seems to work well at cleaning and is definitely cheaper than buying replacement cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>Although I have used other Norelco shavers over the years, this shaver gives me the best shave I could ask and in less time than any shaver I have used.  </li>
            <li>I went with the norelco because it was able to shave hard to reach places better.  </li>
            <li>This was a great shaver until the replacement heads became outrageously expensive (for the original model) and then replaced with a new model (that isn&#x27;t as good as the original and more expensive).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaver gives a good, close, comfortable shave and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery appears to last a long time on a single charge.</li>
            <li>Because it gives a closer, more comfortable shave, is faster since you won&#x27;t have to go back to tackle missed hairs or stubble in hard to reach spots, and it&#x27;s so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>and they confirmed that the main board was damaged so nothing can be done but purchase a new razor, still, i dont recomend this product.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit heavy (menthol) but the no-foam consistency is a perfect match for a wet electric shave.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel like I was cutting anything, but the shave was incredibly close and ultimately smooth.  </li>
            <li>this one is solid, powerful and accurate.  </li>
            <li>Never really appreciated how easy, fast, thorough, and comfortable an electric shave could be until I tried this one.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a nice travel case for the shaver, but nothing for the stand, which takes up nearly as much space and not really meant for a travel bag.   </li>
            <li>We have had this razor for a few days &amp; so far both husband and son think it works great.</li>
            <li>With less noise, vibration, and lighter, it offers a more enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li>I have found that using this as a wet shaver (which is a nice feature) works better for me than it does as a dry shaver.</li>
            <li>I had to pull out my old Braun to clean up after shaving with the LA-93K.  </li>
            <li>the same job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this machine is lighter, the grip is better, the charging time is better than de older model, the charge last longer and the cleaning process is easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cuts clean, and close, and doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; the hair as much as my old razor did.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work any better than my old 49.00, 8 year old Philips razor</li>
            <li>The shaver is very quiet and gives a quick clean shave.</li>
            <li>The Norelco has more surface area and if you do go over multiple times, it just makes the shave that much closer.  </li>
            <li>He uses it with shaving foam when he wants an extra close shave and swears it works better than a razor.  </li>
            <li>And finally, something good enough to keep him from using razor number one...  </li>
            <li>Overall, this razor does a good job, but I won&#x27;t be giving up my traditional Mach 3 anytime soon.</li>
            <li>Too many reviewers are only comparing the closeness of the shave, but that&#x27;s only one factor of several that may be most important.</li>
            <li>After years of using the cheaper razors, and never getting a good shave, I finally stepped up to the big time.</li>
            <li>I have always had a problem with whiskers that tend to grow parallel to the skin, and true to claim, this razor actually gets them and most often on the first swipe!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean (simply fold up some tabs, rinse with warm water, and put it in the stand leaving it open until it dries), shaves wet or dry without any problems, and most importantly feels good to shave (hardly ever pulls a hair).</li>
            <li>so i guess i&#x27;ll come back later for a full review,but so far so good</li>
            <li>Close shave, easy to clean... a little pricey but totally worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>shaving experience is good, involving minimal pressure, except for the stubborn longer hairs, which can be removed with a little bit more effort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You need to be a little more careful handling it,pay attention to cleaning regularly,like daily,and it will provide a much superior shave as a reward.</li>
            <li>His tough beard is shaved smooth, and more importantly, he has not had an issue with rash or razor bumps in 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the shaver head compartments are not sealed very well and the hair folicles seem to easily fall out.  </li>
            <li>this review was helpful, please consider a positive vote.</li>
            <li>Very nice does the job extremely well and the battery life is pretty darn solid.  </li>
            <li>Some of the older Norelco razors had a spring-loaded trimmer that could pop up at inappropriate times if you touched the release just right.  </li>
            <li>and I was pretty much content with it.</li>
            <li>more that I could say about these razors, but this review is already way too long.</li>
            <li>gives a really close shave and its really fast too!</li>
            <li>For my first shave I wanted to give the shaver a real workout</li>
            <li>It gives a reasonably close shave the first time around.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I wasted my money, but after about a month of my face getting accustomed to the shaver - I absolutely love it now!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of replacing the missing parts, I decided to upgrade, and I am so very pleased with that decision.  </li>
            <li>but over the long haul I feel sure I will save money.</li>
            <li>but I use a real blade anyway for &amp;#34;date night&amp;#34; with my wife, when I really need to be smooooooth!  </li>
            <li>I had no had good experiences in the past with electric shavers</li>
            <li>It even does a good job with flat hairs lying on the neck, though extra caution is called for in this area.</li>
            <li>The trimmer doesn&#x27;t work as well as past Norelco models I&#x27;ve owned, but all else is much superior.</li>
            <li>As a traveler, this is definitely more convenient (hotels normally have those cheap razors that do nothing but leave you with a red face, so I normally end up buying new ones on my trips)&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was tough making the leap to the higher price points, but the reviews strongly favored going for something like this Norelco, so I pulled the trigger and purchased the 1250X from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I can not speak highly enough of this razor and how light it feels on the face ;while doing an incredible job!not missing any facial hair.</li>
            <li>the high speed of the motor caused more friction and made my face red.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this state-of-the-art Philips 3d shaver and although it is expensive, it is the best!</li>
            <li>This is a high end razor and is far from cheap.</li>
            <li>the hairs on my neck that all previous electrics would miss&lt;br /&gt;-comes with nice travel case</li>
            <li>Not too big either, it easily shaves every place on my face.</li>
            <li>Recharging is very simple and easy using the stand and cord.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver over a month now and it easily rates the 5 stars I indicated above.  </li>
            <li>It was an even better shave than spending 15 minutes with my Braun series 5 foil (admittedly the foil shaver was dry while the Norelco was with shaving cream).</li>
            <li>But Lectric Shave is about 50% better than shaving dry.</li>
            <li>It is over-packaged, but, thankfully, the polypropylene package was easy to open and recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is possible that my beard growth is tougher than average, but in contrast the Norelco 1250x has worked great.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy and simple.  </li>
            <li>the Advantage 7735X, which comes with 5 lotion packs by Nivea that  are easy to insert into the back of the razor, the SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver does not come so equipped.  </li>
            <li>but the shave was less effective.</li>
            <li>Dry powder sticks seem to work better for me than wet-shaving, though.</li>
            <li>With the curvy black body and nicely coordinated charging stand, the 1250x wouldn&#x27;t look out of place on Darth Vader&#x27;s bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li>Easy to charge, close shave, I don&#x27;t need to bring charger and chord for short trips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reason I can&#x27;t go 5 stars is the sideburn/edge trimming issue, and I&#x27;d like it to be able to dry shave</li>
            <li>The drivers were spinning strongly, but there was no contact between the heads and the drivers when the heads were snapped back into place.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would do a good job shaving and last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>this more expensive swivel head is not as good as the older cheaper model.</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t make them strong enough for him.</li>
            <li>5 Stars, not because I liked it, but because Philips Norelco offers a 21 day trial and will refund your money if not completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It just takes a bit longer and you don&#x27;t get as many shaves on a single charge.</li>
            <li>and I can get a week or more out of a single charge.</li>
            <li>I have large hands, and this is probably the reason.  </li>
            <li>I have large hands, and this is probably the reason.  </li>
            <li>and I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just used to the pop up on my Smart Touch XL</li>
            <li>and I can always use the one on my Smart Touch</li>
            <li>If you need to charge it, you must bring the also awkwardly large stand.  </li>
            <li>philips/Norelco, smart battery charging technology is all OVER the place..</li>
            <li>I certainly would recommend it as a replacement.</li>
            <li>It certainly is.  </li>
            <li>But certain areas on my neck took a while to get.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cleaning its very easy and fast, operating it its just like any other shaver and it takes about an hour to get fully charged.</li>
            <li>Great razor, BUT weak battery.  </li>
            <li>I have used 5 or 6 different electric shavers in the past 15 years and this has been the best one by far.</li>
            <li>For the exact same problem to happen twice with different models tells me there has got to be some kind of manufacturing problem with the device.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 82, have had several electric razors in the past, and this is far the best.  </li>
            <li>The new head is not as flexible as the old one and is very obviously much cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Philips is an outstanding company having pioneered lot of new products over several decades.</li>
            <li>It seems to be designed so you have to kind of &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; it into place, where usually you just pop it right onto the razor head.</li>
            <li>Plus, the ability to both dry and wet shave is great feature.       </li>
            <li>Great shaver, my only problem was some of the packaging had been removed suggesting that it had been opened previously.</li>
            <li>Worked great wet or dry, with or without shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great dry or wet in the shower too.</li>
            <li>It looks like it has a pretty long life, but the charger works just as easily.    </li>
            <li>The charging and cleaning indicators are really useful.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the device is really easily, involving open the three shaver heads and running it under water.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>At first it was difficult for me to clean, but I gotten good at it: with hot water run over the blades while the chambers are closed most of your hair should get pushed out.  </li>
            <li>The others have been fine, but this one is definitely the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>:) I have not tried any other electric shavers this is my first one after using a mach 3 for years.</li>
            <li>Like a lot of guys, I was at first hesitant to move from blades to electric, but was looking for better solution than scraping my face with sharp steel every day, so eventually decided to \\&quot;try\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of electric shavers, I find them to provide a less than perfect shave - leaving blotches of hair and not being close enough, this electric shaver, however, is in my opinion the closest you can get to a razor shave.  </li>
            <li>The shaving head conforms perfectly to the contours of your face, takes about half the time of an regular razor, and requires only seconds to clean--just flip up the shaving heads and brush/wash out the residue.</li>
            <li>By 3 or 4pm, there is definitely a bit of shadow, but that&#x27;s fine for my needs.</li>
            <li>I liked its fancy look, but 3D shaving is very far from 3D, you cant shave near the nose and the shaving is not smooth at all, but shaves pretty clean.</li>
            <li>Compared to my old shaver, panasonic 8103s, this new one is smooth and quiet, and more clearly than panasonic&#x27;s ,  i like it</li>
            <li>If I do a quick shave, it wouldn&#x27;t reach the standard that I have to have a really groomed appearance, but is good enough to get out in public.</li>
            <li>I also refuse to pay $160 and higher for a high end Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>First, I highly recommend buying through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The Braun cleaning system is very good but expensive.</li>
            <li>I especially like the ability to take it in the shower where a little shave gel, or conditioner can help get the closest to blade shave from an electric I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li>I used canned air to clean it and the little carrying case allowed easy carrying in my assault pack.</li>
            <li>It does a great job shaving those areas under the chin and near the neck that are hard to get.</li>
            <li>, while it&#x27;s an older model of the new 3D series it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It actually made a HUGE difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even 8 hours later, much of my face remains stubble free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another huge plus in my mind is the fact that it&#x27;s very quiet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean -- don&#x27;t waste your money on the fancy cleaner.</li>
            <li>Shaves are very close, comfortable and last all day.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, fast, no neck burn, quiet, close shave.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a happy camper and I was more than frustrated.</li>
            <li>Doesnt work much on the mustache.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this shaver.</li>
            <li>They make a grinding sound and he has to open and close them all to re-engage.  </li>
            <li>after 4 months, it started to be very noisy.</li>
            <li>We would really recommend it to anyone who needs a heavy-duty shaver.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin at all and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>He really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning takes too much time,awkward with stubby fingers.</li>
            <li>So yes, it shaves well, but I would never buy another one - who needs that much of a downside at that price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a shave this close and smooth since I used to shave with a razor back in the stone ages.  </li>
            <li>Called Amazon to complain - the person was very helpful in resolving the issue.</li>
            <li>Very close shave.</li>
            <li>I know reviews aren&#x27;t really supposed to be based on cost as prices change</li>
            <li>I found the Norelco cuts very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver and the way it cuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maneuverabilit - this is where the Braun really shines for me.</li>
            <li>I find that very helpful.</li>
            <li>I find that very helpful.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he really likes the shave it gives.  </li>
            <li>The shave is much closer too.</li>
            <li>It gives a really close shave, glides well on the skin, and flexes to cover curves on chin and jaw.</li>
            <li>After a year I needed to replace the whole head.</li>
            <li>Yes, if you really want to piss him off, buy him this shaver.</li>
            <li>I shave my head and face every day and really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>What is really upsetting is the policy of Philips Norelco to not grant you the rebate that you are entitled to at the time of purchase.  </li>
            <li>I would rate the razer about 3.5 stars for effectiveness on an absolute scale, I would rate it 1.0 stars as value for the money, and I would rate Philips Norelco at 0 stars for its lack of ethics and refusal to honor its legal and fiduciary responsibilities.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compare that to this shaver - The shave is fast.</li>
            <li>- now she cant really tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s some fancy technology built into the device that is really for marketing purposes.</li>
            <li>At a very conservative rate of $10 an hour, you&#x27;ve saved yourself the money after one year of usage.</li>
            <li>It was the most I&#x27;ve ever spent on an electric razor.</li>
            <li>so it should get better, but for now I feel I have to press harder and take longer.</li>
            <li>I am getting a shave much closer than anything I have owned before</li>
            <li>This razor does the job very well.</li>
            <li>Very useful!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After two weeks, I still haven&#x27;t decided how much I like this.  </li>
            <li>I surprice myself every morning that I shave, it so close and fast.    </li>
            <li>This is basically why my bf loves it so much is becuz</li>
            <li>but it is very close.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, quiet shave.  </li>
            <li>Does not work without charging stand which is a nuisance and takes up too much space.</li>
            <li>The chin and neck grow in fast, though, but that&#x27;s biology, not the shaver&#x27;s fault...</li>
            <li>They really designed it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like that it&#x27;s a lithiumion battery and not nickle cadmium.</li>
            <li>I really wish the designers would have done that</li>
            <li>Very quiet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Need shaving cream if you want a fast and close shave with</li>
            <li>While a bit pricey, it does provide a very close shave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still functional, but not as much as ones that flip out..</li>
            <li>Bought this for my partner&#x27;s birthday and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Much sooner.  </li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying I really wanted to like this razor.</li>
            <li>electric shavers will give you a smooth shave and not necessarily a close shave.</li>
            <li>Shave very well, and can be washed.</li>
            <li>No irritation and the heads really do adapt to the contours of my face.  </li>
            <li>In comparison, the SensoTouch 3D is much faster and misses a lot fewer hairs.  </li>
            <li>spend so much on this product?  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like the razor.  </li>
            <li>It is much smoother.  </li>
            <li>After this \\&quot;training\\&quot; period it works very well.</li>
            <li>And it does not work very well.</li>
            <li>and i really need to shave..</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Norelco</li>
            <li>it charges fast and has a reliable charge indicator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this guy now for a month and can&#x27;t say how much of an improvement it is over the Braun.  </li>
            <li>Always straight strokes.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>It was reasonably close from the start and has remained so for me.</li>
            <li>This is a real drag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>; the stand is really flimsy.</li>
            <li>, seems to cut real close.</li>
            <li>(I think the heads may be turning much faster.)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Wet shaving (with shaving gel) is better with this shaver.</li>
            <li>The pros of this razor is that it is extremely quiet, and feels smooth on your sking.  </li>
            <li>The power plug only plugs into the stand, it doesn&#x27;t fit the shaver socket, that plugs into the stand.  </li>
            <li>I really hope the results continue like this.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Norelco really designed an inferior product with this one.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast charging..</li>
            <li>30 seconds pickingup the extras with the straight part, then 15 seconds cleaning in running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did something unusual this year for my husband.  </li>
            <li>Sounded great but either the item was broken or there was no power.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>it is a lot quicker than a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>My friends very like it.</li>
            <li>It gives a really close shave and is so much quicker and easier than using a blade.</li>
            <li>I don’t like the fact that you have to travel with the whole charger with you.</li>
            <li>(he no longer wants a really close shave)</li>
            <li>He was reluctant to use it, but now he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This product is really light weight, very low noise.  </li>
            <li>fast charge.</li>
            <li>Straight-edge absolutely destroys me and electric razors tend to be much easier on my skin.</li>
            <li>I was really amazed how well it did on my cheeks/</li>
            <li>It replaced my Braun and is much quieter and shaves closer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>very comfoortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just rinse off and it is ready to go.</li>
            <li>The order and delivery was handled very well.  </li>
            <li>The razor is very quite compared to the Panasonic and Braun.  </li>
            <li>BUT cleaning is too much effort.</li>
            <li>Much quieter too.</li>
            <li>After much anxiety, I bit the bullet and decided to purchase this Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>really??  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real beauty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, conforms to you face very well, and really does get the longer hairs with ease.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready to recommend it at this point.</li>
            <li>A display lets you know how much power remains in the lithium-ion battery</li>
            <li>how much power remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>received on time, works very well, close shave.</li>
            <li>It shaves very close for an electric</li>
            <li>The trimmer is noisy but works very well on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;The Package got to me, and the inside package was dented and the styrofoam holder was cracked</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one makes it easier and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li>So, I can&#x27;t really hold that against it.</li>
            <li>I love how I can wet shave with it.</li>
            <li>also found the shave to be much closer than my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;However, the Philips is noticeably larger.&lt;br /&gt;Especially the shaving head - it is much larger.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Shaving without water was actually really convenient and helped me get ready faster in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not irritatingly so.</li>
            <li>I no longer use my straight razor with shaving brush/shave soap.  </li>
            <li>My husband is SO picky about ANY electronics he gets and he really loves this shaver.</li>
            <li>whole kit includes everything you need to shave.</li>
            <li>It really works well.  </li>
            <li>You can do it every day and your whole life is going to turn better.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent purches.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buy in China.</li>
            <li>Then follow up with a regular razor to get a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a really close shave, but it takes a lot of time to do so.</li>
            <li>Also the construction feels very flimsy for what I paid for.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and this gives me a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>The real beauty of this machine is attributed to the 3d heads so that it just glides over the contours.</li>
            <li>I find it very convenient compared to shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>and he has used electric shavers his whole life.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want another piece of plastic to store.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>They clearly stand behind their product and that kind of support and the overall quality of the device confirms that it was a good decision to buy this razor.</li>
            <li>Now that is where the difference is really tangible.</li>
            <li>I find I have to lightly go over the same spot</li>
            <li>the charger takes up about as much room as a phone charger.  </li>
            <li>The three light indicator degreases as the battery life drops and then changes from white to amber red as it gets really low - another nice feature.  </li>
            <li>My shaves are averaging about two minutes and when done I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>Smooth and quiet.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>life is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It is smooth, quiet and handles all the bumps and curves with ease.  </li>
            <li>at any rate, if you need a razor that works on dry/wet skin, without cuts and fast, this will suffice.</li>
            <li>This provides a really close shave.</li>
            <li>I think that it works very well.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to keep your face wet.  </li>
            <li>am very displeased.</li>
            <li>Braun series 7 for example has a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t blame Amazon for this issue but I must say, I feel really cheated by Philips.</li>
            <li>Close shave, light and very quiet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-the trimmer does not work very well</li>
            <li>My husband really loves this razor.  </li>
            <li>After about three shaves with this, the razor burn started really flaring up.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>was looking at Straight Blade and an Electric Shaver and after reading online, despite straight blade being cheaper - went for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Phillips Shaver is very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>Floating heads work very well.</li>
            <li>Provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sound - the 3D runs very quietly; the Braun and Panasonic are far more \\&quot;buzzy\\&quot; but not too loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old double edge razor did a better job than this thing.  </li>
            <li>I think the main advantage of the Norelco 1250 is the pivot head, which easily follows the curves of your face and allows the razor to get every last hair.</li>
            <li>i have used electric razors such as norelco and braun over most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>It actually seemed to irritate my kneck more than my old Braun.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be an upgrade from the d model, but honestly after using it for a few months I want my 2d back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Positives. I&#x27;d agree that this shaver is a top quality product and will likely suit the bulk of the population - but if you do have sensitive skin perhaps keep looking?</li>
            <li>I am in the military and needed a good quality shaver that would last a deployment and field time.  </li>
            <li>Please be weary of the warranty and be sure to frequently test your product before you warranty expires or you will be in the same predicament that I&#x27;m in.</li>
            <li>It is particularly good for me as i have delicate skin and begin to get all sorts of spots on my face soon after i shave.</li>
            <li>The 3D is a nice looking razor and does the trick for giving a close shave in just a few passes.  </li>
            <li>The other one was in my teens and it was a very cheap model given to me by my parents.  </li>
            <li>As a whole, this is a very good electric shaver and if the price were to go down slightly, it&#x27;s star rating would improve, but for now it gets a  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave in very little time with easy clean-up.</li>
            <li>I just bought a new razor, the Braun 790, hopefully that works out better in the long run.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>They are nearly 70 dollars!!!</li>
            <li>First 2 weeks it slightly irritated my skin, but then everything became OK.</li>
            <li>razor easily handles the long whiskers and does 90% of my face very close.  </li>
            <li>It delivers a close shave, is very quiet and best of all was about half the price that I would have to pay for the same product in New Zealand.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to clean after a wet or dry shave.</li>
            <li>When the cord starting to become loose, and the shaver spontaneously shut itself off many times during my shave, it was then that I realized I definitely needed to get myself a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The head is defective and cracked when  I first received the new unit.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for a long time Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Strange design, but easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any improvement over my Speed XL , if you are not interested in shaving in the shower, except that it is more abrasive to my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Today I can say that I impreciono, first things easy and fast shaving, second how fast your cleaning and finally as remaining after shave, is exactly like my Mach 3 razor, so I recommend it apart, is satisfaction guaranteed with 21 days for testing and up to 45 to return if you do not like,</li>
            <li>Compared to most of Norelco&#x27;s other shavers, the 1250 is very light, apparently because it uses a smaller battery.</li>
            <li>Have to clean more often (but at least it&#x27;s easier to clean).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>And even after shaving in the morning, I can shave early evening for very special occasions, then shave again the next morning.</li>
            <li>Much better than any other shave cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different electric razors over the years, from all of the major companies.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you open each head individually after each shave and wash them with hot water.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the 1150x for myself and wanted to buy the same for my Father for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I know some of the other reviewers have commented on the issue with international travel, but I can say this works perfectly abroad as I have used it in other countries.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for him to open it</li>
            <li>It is a breeze to clean, just rinse under hot water and blot it gently with a towel and set it out for a couple of hours to dry.  </li>
            <li>that is, well, unreliable or opt for some other brand that might be MORE reliable..</li>
            <li>The next few shaves gave me some pretty good razor burn, but I attributed this to my face not being used to it.     </li>
            <li>I would definitely say the 1250x is worth the price difference based on its ability to competently handle long stubble alone.</li>
            <li>This one is better than either of the two other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>I received the Norelco 1250x as a Christmas present and was quite excited.  </li>
            <li>The other is the velcro strap to keep the able on the power adapter coiled neatly when it&#x27;s not in use.   </li>
            <li>battery has lasted better than any other razor.  </li>
            <li>My father is able to handle this shaver due to</li>
            <li>you are a fast operator in the morning, then to make up for this, consider buying this shaver with the Jet Clean system as well, which will set you back an extra $50 plus the cost of the jet clean solution (there are two options for this</li>
            <li>My ratings reflect the fact that when everything is fresh and new, the razor works extremely well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re like me, and you want a quick, comfortable shave without the mess...</li>
            <li>There is absolutely nothing extra special about this shaver.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic&#x27;s special cleaning speed makes it slightly easier to manually clean than the Braun.    </li>
            <li>Thanks to my new Norelco!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other brands in the past, but this is superior by far.</li>
            <li>This new Norelco shaver is amazingly quiet but gives me a very close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-blade set lasts 1 year+&lt;br /&gt;-easy to clean and it actually tells you when it needs cleaning</li>
            <li>Consider this option if you do not want to have to clean the shaver manually and you want the ease and comfort of just popping it in the cleaner and only needing to replace the solution every so often.</li>
            <li>It has been doing everything well, under the nose, on the chin, and even long stubble seem to cut just fine.</li>
            <li>It is simple to charge, clean and operate.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very glad I spent the extra money.  </li>
            <li>Want a shave that is relatively close, and doesn&#x27;t take lots of additional clean up for missed areas  Shaver 2:  23</li>
            <li>&quot; so much so that I think I&#x27;ll be going back to the tried and true Advantage</li>
            <li>You have to open and clean each head separately</li>
            <li>Much closer shave than my older Panasonic wet/dry</li>
            <li>Cons - Don&#x27;t like popping the heads open individually to clean</li>
            <li>That said, the Braun is the only system with alcohol in its cleaner to sanitize as well as a detergent to clean and oil to lubricate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor looks like something from a sci-fy movie when you open it to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I had a few Norelco razors in the past and this one is the best!</li>
            <li>Nice long charge and does trick on short notice.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t really want to spend the money then a step down from the top end</li>
            <li>What a difference, a quick clean shave, and no long hairs left.</li>
            <li>The past few years I have been buying the top of the line new shavers available from the top brands.</li>
            <li>Speed-XL, single button to release heads making it easy to tap them and shake out the shavings.</li>
            <li>The flex head and design is comfortable to hold and easily accesses all the hard to get places on my face.  </li>
            <li>My research suggested it was a little more prone to complaints of razor burn, and it was not quite as good in the hard to reach areas of the neck.</li>
            <li>Used worse, however this shaver is far from impressive, especially considering how much it costs.</li>
            <li>In the early days he occasionally used a straight razor to get a nice, close shave and often used a regular non-electric razor.  </li>
            <li>The heads follow the contours of my face better than any conventional three head shaver could.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see too many other reviewers complaining about this problem (which surprises me), so perhaps it has something to do with the water where I am (slightly high in calcium), or the fact I shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>even the trimmer is interesting because the razor is so quiet you can hear it as it finds and cuts hairs, it makes a little popping like sound.  </li>
            <li>However, I dry shave with this razor numerous times and it still preform amazingly.</li>
            <li>Less if you make the cartridges last longer than a month or find a good deal on them.     </li>
            <li>Lathering up my face &amp; using a razor doesn&#x27;t really take any more or less time</li>
            <li>A really close shave, and so quick &amp; quiet.  </li>
            <li>Good, close, shave wet or dry .&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Can use dry or wet with equally good shave.  </li>
            <li>Good shave wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>I must admit that I expected a little bit more of it, but after sharing my experiences with other owners I am happy with my razor.</li>
            <li>A very comfortable shave that previous electrics can&#x27;t touch.  </li>
            <li>And as for my main review, I still really like the shaver and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The following morning I went into the restroom to get my shave started and realized, my beautiful animations informing me that my razor was ready for action, was actually missing in action.</li>
            <li>With fresh cutters, this razor cuts nearly as close as a blade - WOW!</li>
            <li>battery holds unbelievably long without charging, shaves well, skin is smooth as baby.</li>
            <li>Cool digital readouts for charging status &amp; battery.  </li>
            <li>Comes with a nice charging stand and a zip up travel case and a small brush.  </li>
            <li>I justified it by telling myself that  something I&#x27;d use every day for several years is worth an extra $50-$75.   </li>
            <li>The shaver does not get near as hot as a foil shaver.    </li>
            <li>The product has a good performance, but Philips does not satisfy with the global guarantee, I request the Global Guarantee last two weeks in South America, and Philips didnt help me with that.</li>
            <li>They insisted I wage war on my face for the full 45 days before I could send it back.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend even complemented me since this was her first time ever seeing my face completely shaved.</li>
            <li>I will being going back to Remington because I get a much closer shave without so many passes over the same area.</li>
            <li>Not bad, just different.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, just different.  </li>
            <li>He is very particular about what he wants, so I was naturally nervous that it was not the model he wanted.  </li>
            <li>The battery life was OK, but was down to needing a charge every two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I waited many years before I would break down and buy an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I had a 10 year old Norelco (6705x), which was pretty decent in and of itself.</li>
            <li>but it was far superior compared to any electric I&#x27;ve previously owned and left my face relatively irritation free.  </li>
            <li>I tried to clean it up with the pop-out shaver, but I feel like I am growing a full mustache just under my nose, and my sideburns are all uneven.  </li>
            <li>The $60 investment each year for new shaving heads replacement is a small price to pay for such a great unit</li>
            <li>I said forget it and bought a new Braun, after checking on the availability of replacement parts!  </li>
            <li>Going back to the head thing, this product, if you buy it new on Amazon, shows that the heads are the original ones.  </li>
            <li>The heads flex very well and stay flat to your face making quick work of shaving.</li>
            <li>: Just tried the new Remington Alphagel shaving cream and that works very well with both the Panny and the Norelco.</li>
            <li>This new 1250x 3d is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I deep clean it with the jet rinser once a week, to insure a like new razor feel.</li>
            <li>with the new shaver, you need to open the blades and clean after each use.  </li>
            <li>the price is high, and if you can afford it you get an high quality electric shaver at a premium, but for most of us, this is just not worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This is in marked contrast to my original Phillips which was one single head that popped open and allowed me to easily rinse it out.</li>
            <li>Even with the dry shave, the shaver is ultra comfortable.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip even if your hands are wet.</li>
            <li>If this one lasts half that time I&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li>The shave is SO much better than my previous razor.  </li>
            <li>I will buy the latest Panasonic... hopefully, it works like the previous Panasonics.  </li>
            <li>For me it does a better job if gettin the pesky whiskers and irritates my skin less.  </li>
            <li>Does the job better than my previous Norelco.</li>
            <li>, It shaves better then my previous one ever did.</li>
            <li>That is, it works like any decent one should.</li>
            <li>I was using an older Philips Norelco model (maybe a 600 series?)</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s also a 45 day money back guarantee if not satisfied which is nice!</li>
            <li>This heads are also an upgrade to some of the older Norelco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The 3D takes some practice, but it can do a decent job.</li>
            <li>While not perfect, it excels in several areas and feels the best.</li>
            <li>While not perfect, it excels in several areas and feels the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s true, even in the usage manual sayes that the first shaves will be rough...</li>
            <li>One of my main complaints with this shaver is the fact that if your hair is longer than a millimeter, you will get pulled hairs all over the place.</li>
            <li>(obviously the actual ability is more like an hour nonstop)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent shaver since I removed my beard 7 years ago</li>
            <li>Clean-up is simple and quick.</li>
            <li>In my love blindness, I overcame a poorly designed charger and a trimmer with the sophistication and sound of a Weed Whacker.</li>
            <li>He regularly uses an earlier version of this product and was satisfied with the shave he got from it.  </li>
            <li>Super quiet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;If cost is your main factor, go with Norelco.</li>
            <li>If cost is your main factor, go with Norelco.</li>
            <li>While the trimmer is noisy compared to prior models, it&#x27;s smaller design seems more efficient and</li>
            <li>After two weeks of use, the indicator shows it still has more than a third of its power left, so no nuisance there.  </li>
            <li>but i really do enjoy the wet shave as it gives a very close</li>
            <li>The only thing I could complain about and the reason I have gone with 4 stars instead of 5 is simply because it can take a bit of time to get some of the more stubborn hairs gone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve traditionally been more of a regular Gillette Mach 3 Turbo kinda guy, but the idea of an electric razor has always appealed to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems like it will hold a good charge for heavy beard daily use.  </li>
            <li>My skin has aged and become more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the older style Norelco razors but this one will suffice.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent, yet pricey razor.  </li>
            <li>While I had some initial skin irritation switching from a Braun, it quickly adjusted.</li>
            <li>It is no big deal as I just use shaving gel for sensitive skin and afterwards I have a smooth as butter face and neck with zero irritation.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried wet shaving with cream yet, but I&#x27;m getting such a nice shave without that</li>
            <li>The Braun&#x27;s harder case gives it top honors over the Panasonic&#x27;s soft one, but the Panasonic has an on-off lock that the Braun lacks.</li>
            <li>Speaking of stealth, this thing is super quiet.  </li>
            <li>I have heard and read many reviews about different razors, and how it takes time to get used to the difference between the electric and the basic razor.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different electric razors over the years and have tried most all brands including different versions of wet/dry  </li>
            <li>I gave it the ol&#x27; college try for two weeks, trying to get to the magic 45-day trial period nirvana, but I&#x27;m a big baby and couldn&#x27;t stand the constant assault on my mug.</li>
            <li>I´ve got a older model of Philips Razor</li>
            <li>I recently purchased it from Amazon and have been pleased with the entire experience.  </li>
            <li>This is a great unit, I only hope I get at least 5 years out of it.</li>
            <li>Replacement came quickly and included a postage paid label to send the damaged unit back.</li>
            <li>I then purchased this older generation model from amazon.  </li>
            <li>And it had more than plenty enough battery to do my entire head, face and neck and still had power</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin though, so maybe thats why it hurt so much.</li>
            <li>I always wanted an electric shaver, but had so many negative comments that I dared not currently shaved faith with mach 3 and ought to look good doing it first from top to bottom and then conversely, was tedious and took a long time to clean the machine, 3D came out</li>
            <li>I have a very sharp face features, so most normal shavers would irritate my skin</li>
            <li>For the price breakdown of disposable or other traditional razors (with new heads) the Norelco is a great investment--needless to say I will never be using a traditional razor again.</li>
            <li>I have long had my eye on a new electric shaver and this one fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>but it does shave better in less time then my old Smart Touch XL razor.    </li>
            <li>Norelco 3D Sens Touch may be good for other beards, not certainly not for mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The Norelco model HS8420 is still available on Amazon for $50, a real bargain for those who prefer wet shaves.  </li>
            <li>He is very pleased with how close it shaves wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li>Highly recomended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>High Quality with Lower price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Price is fairly high, unless you get a deal when it is on sale.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>I have used the high end</li>
            <li>Now they are not providing high quality heads for my SensoTouch.  </li>
            <li>a high end</li>
            <li>I highly recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I still HIGHLY recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try the rotary style razor with high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this razor based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>High recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product,</li>
            <li>Well, to be frank I bought this razor because I needed a high end electric razor for my chin and mustache areas, Had a $45.90   Amazon Rewards credit to spend.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality razor</li>
            <li>I would highly recomend this razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this Norelco.</li>
            <li>However, now that I&#x27;ve tried a high end</li>
            <li>He says he would highly recommend this item for shaving.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to every guy to have one.</li>
            <li>The new variety of replacement head is widely reviewed as inferior, but more modestly priced.  </li>
            <li>it FAR exceeds the Smart Touch XL.</li>
            <li>Good razor, not sure it is worth the high price vs other Norelco razors</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;ve used electric razors for many years and typically my skin has to adapt to any new products.  </li>
            <li>Knocked a star off for this, and the charger is a little more fussy with it&#x27;s dedicated stand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it three times, so I&#x27;ll give it a little more time to see if it improves.</li>
            <li>but because its a closer shave I did have a little more razor burn.</li>
            <li>Just wish the little pop-out  trimmer was a tad better.....</li>
            <li>When I put this one in my old washer, it worked ! !  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d take a little razor burn if i&#x27;d get done shaving sooner. :)</li>
            <li>Not significantly :) yep</li>
            <li>Generally like it very much.</li>
            <li>First you get a little reminder light (looks like a water faucet)</li>
            <li>I mention before in my original review that I get ingrown hairs but even dry shaving with the razor</li>
            <li>Prior to this one, I had the Norelco Cool Skin 7775X; if you don&#x27;t recognize that particular model it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s probably almost 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>When I first bought this shaver there were so many different variants (with/without cleaning, and many other options), that it was pretty confusing.  </li>
            <li>but I am left to go back to my $30 Panasonic that shaves better, even though it is loud, but my little Panasonic does a better job.</li>
            <li>However as it started to get older, I knew I had to spend the money to buy a new foil and cutter.</li>
            <li>Now it seems the blades have come down to a little more reasonable price, but the fact remains that this is a shaver that works well but must be kept in a very safe place and handled carefully</li>
            <li>He says it is very comfortable to use, and the wet or dry function is pretty nifty too.</li>
            <li>I have to say so far I have not had to shave my neck with a straight razor after every shave.  </li>
            <li>you can clearly see this is a very well made shaver, contrary to others</li>
            <li>Rinsing it during shaving, and then raising the three heads and rinsing them, completely cleans the whole shaver.  </li>
            <li>&quot; - I find that they do not really make a huge difference in the shave on the side of the face.  </li>
            <li>I like the idea of an electric razor, but enjoy a wet shave.</li>
            <li>What a pain to have to take the whole stand on a trip, especially when you want to pack light and not to pay for extra baggage charges.  </li>
            <li>where near as close a shave as a DE or Straight blade.</li>
            <li>I have had probably five or six Norelco shavers in my life time and this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the few extra dollars to get something that floats/contours on your face, easy to clean and&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sorry I cannot compare to others, but have always had great luck&lt;</li>
            <li>Not much to say here expect it works fantastic.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gents, I have to say that I don&#x27;t find any real difference between how the model 1250X/40 shaves as compared to my six year old 9195XL.</li>
            <li>WIth the Norelco,  you can shave blind,  and this 3 D one,  you can be skiing, LOL,  </li>
            <li>Laugh as you imagine him going over and over and over the same spot trying but failing to cut those whiskers.  </li>
            <li>its was well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>for about 2 yrs,I used this Philips Norelco and have been using for about past 8 months.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, both of them provide a good shave, and if you are debating which one to go for, following</li>
            <li>This is a normal occurrence.\\</li>
            <li>No awkward angles as I aim for curved areas, and no going over the same area until I have razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time on the 26th - and promptly bought another one for my son, whose birthday was 2 days later (thanks Amazon Prime for the one day shipping rate).    </li>
            <li>First, the sensotouch is much easier to shave with since it conforms to your face as you move it from one part to the next</li>
            <li>GONE is the loud buzzing noise that I thought was a part of the shave; the only sound is a relatively soft whirr.</li>
            <li>the last several months I seemed to have developed a skin allergy to the lubricating pad now found on most manual razors.  </li>
            <li>I had done a lot of research beforehand, and I know that electric razors normally don&#x27;t get as close a shave as a manual one</li>
            <li>Pre-shave isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve normally used because I don&#x27;t like the fragrances of any of them, but I may have to try to find one.  </li>
            <li>I figured with a lifespan like that, it would be worth spending the extra money on a nicer razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have bought many products from Amazon and this is the first negative I have ever responded with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Speed - If you&#x27;re in a hurry and want to get in and get out with a dry-shave as quickly as possible, the Norelco wins.</li>
            <li>I normally use Fusion Manual.</li>
            <li>but I had to use a normal non electric razor to take care of all the areas missed.</li>
            <li>but in my mind is the only worth while difference.  </li>
            <li>I decided to abandon my normal razor and stick with this</li>
            <li>Good but not great</li>
            <li>Good but not great razor.</li>
            <li>I would not give it a perfect score on long stubble as it takes a while to get all the whiskers mowed down and still pulls a few,  </li>
            <li>I would highly suggest anyone looking for a new shaver to look or buy this one no questions asked. . .</li>
            <li>It takes a few more strokes to cover the same area, but what it cuts, it cuts much closer and better than the other models.   </li>
            <li>So what, the original head design *is* available and still in production, but only if you buy another brand new shaver??!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the actual product worked well so far, but his one-star review is well-deserved because of the above.</li>
            <li>However, it takes some getting used to holding it as compared to previous Norelco units and cleaning it is not as easy as in the older models.</li>
            <li>The three blade chambers open easily but click firmly back in place every time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend shaving dry, not only for convenience, but it seems to result in a better shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fact that this razor works on dry or wet skin is also a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>It is easy to see why; you see those big circumferential slots in the second concentric ring of the heads?</li>
            <li>It glides much better over my face than any earlier model I&#x27;ve used for dry shaving.</li>
            <li>I first tried a Panasonic, but sent it back because it was big, loud, took longer to clean, and didn&#x27;t shave my beard any closer than the Norelco.</li>
            <li>I bought this recently from Amazon for the right price after doing a bit of research.</li>
            <li>Phillips/Norelco has finally gotten it right with the 1250X40 SensoTouch 3D shaving system.</li>
            <li>Well i went to my local walmart and they had it for $99, so i bought it right away.</li>
            <li>Finally made the right choice in cordless razor.</li>
            <li>LiPo recharge battery lasts a long time and charges quickly.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer is sub par and it does not capture the small fine hairs on the cheek along the beard line very well, but I still gave it 4 stars for the very close shave and ease of use around neck and under jaw areas.</li>
            <li>Super long battery life too.  </li>
            <li>When using the dry shave setting (if you are in a rush) it obviously will cause a little skin discomfort, but the wet and shaving cream options make for a great and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I still clean up a bit with my regular razor...but just a few quick spots that aren&#x27;t really needed if I was in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Says it is so easy to use, and cuts the hair down to \\&quot;baby-butt smooth\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>They verified that it was the newer model of the original head and that there was really not much else they could do.</li>
            <li>For those of you accustomed to the jet engine roar of other models, you may enjoy getting fooled into thinking that the battery charge on this Norelco was dying,</li>
            <li>Only used it for a week but am very glad I spent the extra dollars for it.</li>
            <li>He had already shaved and then decided to use his new razor.</li>
            <li>The delivery driver was new to my area, and it was a cluster.</li>
            <li>its brand new so lest see what happens with time and</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to even use the new one yet.  </li>
            <li>If the new shaver doesn&#x27;t work out, I&#x27;ll probably switch to a Braun Series 7-790cc.</li>
            <li>So, that means $15 for the razor and $50-$60 a year on cartridges assuming you use a new one each month.</li>
            <li>One day the battery will die and you will either send it in for a new one or toss it and buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li>After researching Norelco&#x27;s new offerings, I decided on the 1250X.</li>
            <li>With this new SensoTouch shaver, your problems are solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I went shopping for a new razor without lotion</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new, affordable replacement head, the RQ12</li>
            <li>I refuse to accept the inferior performance of the new head.</li>
            <li>Your face will have time to adjust to the new shaver.</li>
            <li>But the quality of your shave will improve over time using a new shaver.</li>
            <li>So I started researching the new Norelco line.  </li>
            <li>I buy a new electric razor every 5 to 10 years for touch ups and travel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going 100% electric with this new razor.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I recommend holding off on a new purchase until production issues resolved.  </li>
            <li>The reason I was looking for a replacement was that the shaver heads for the 8020X were now costing as much as a new razor.</li>
            <li>So I decided it was time for a new shaver.   </li>
            <li>Norelco razor (9160xl) which was in need of new heads</li>
            <li>it has/had a relatively new cutter foil and block and i run the cleaning cycle every use..</li>
            <li>To my surprise I received a new razor in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I went from a Norelco to this new Norelco</li>
            <li>Just stopped Tuesday 8/13/13 and would not take a charge, so I contacted Norelco this morning, and with the Registration of the product they are sending me a new shaver body.</li>
            <li>but if your new like me than you should know that electrics dont shave close to the skin at all.</li>
            <li>so I decide to try new Phillips</li>
            <li>I returned the razor, and purchased a new cutter and foil for my 7000 seriec Braun, which I am now using.</li>
            <li>I have been using Electric Shavers for years because manual blades tend to irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Usually buy a new shaver every three years</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve not had a razor now for a week because they mis-typed my address shipping the new handle....</li>
            <li>but it is still new.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new 1250 razor.</li>
            <li>This ain&#x27;t new</li>
            <li>The $30.oo rebate means that there are new models on the event horizon after Xmas I assume.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see a new and improved mousetrap/razor.  </li>
            <li>you know how to shave with electric razor and just want something new I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Time for a new shaver again.  </li>
            <li>New head &#x3D;</li>
            <li>brand new shave again - for 5 months.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor 2 years ago and it keeps performs like new every day.  </li>
            <li>So I am returning the new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- you will feel like you just bought a brand new</li>
            <li>Shaving is a pleasure with my new 3D.</li>
            <li>Bought the 3D version of this, used as a new year gift.</li>
            <li>My husband was looking for a new shaver, and had mentioned about the tilting heads.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad now that the parts needed for my old shaver were not available, had to get the new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy it so much that I have added a few minutes each day.  </li>
            <li>I was worried with oily skin that this may cause problems, but it&#x27;s been much gentler overall than my straight razor was.  </li>
            <li>It is important to shave regularly, cuz if you miss a couple of days, you will get an incomplete shave the next time you use this.</li>
            <li>My solution is to bring my older, lower-end Norelco that plugs directly into the shaver.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave and works very well, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li>, i can look if anyone really cares) because the braun was really tearing my face up after several years..</li>
            <li>BUT the lady is kind enough to say she will ship a replacement out (7 to 10 days) from someplace in ohio and that when i get it i need to return the dead \\&quot;handle\\&quot;..</li>
            <li>but I thought if I spent some extra money and got a better one that it would pay off.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be the same, but I expected it to be better than it is for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t plug the cord directly into shaver as with the older models.</li>
            <li>It does the job but doesn&#x27;t shave as well as my older Norelco Quadra Action.  </li>
            <li>Comfort - I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but the Braun wins out (unless going wet-shave with the oil/gel as described above).</li>
            <li>I bought this for my father who recently had a stroke and was having trouble shaving his own face.</li>
            <li>smooth, quiet, but solid.</li>
            <li>When the shaver did work, I think that the shave was not close enough; I was expecting it to be much closer - more like a blade and less</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I use my older one which charges directly into the razor</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to cut at a detailed level...cuts more than you expect, and it makes weird noises when it cuts anything...hard to explain.  </li>
            <li>Need a good trimmer to allow a quick, but not perfect shave similar to a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow  </li>
            <li>There are no more of the original RQ12 blades being made, and the only ones available are being sold at highway robbery prices.  </li>
            <li>instructions are very clear.</li>
            <li>I have tried many electric shavers in the past and like most, have given up on them as they are either too rough on my face or they just don&#x27;t shave close enough or a combo of the two.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58 with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Just received this as a replacement for a very old Braun 7 series.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to get into the discussion about electric versus blades; I&#x27;ve given enough blood in my time, thank you very much.  </li>
            <li>I doubt very much that it was ever intended to replace a beard and mustache trimmer, which is a completely different grooming tool.  </li>
            <li>The razor was very loud and the shave head was bulky.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>this is my first try at a electric, I am getting older, and the razor, I used all my life, is now starting to take chunks out of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Also, I am feeling skin irritation a little more than I did with my old, loud, foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>After receiving my new shaver, I retired my original and more expensive shaver for emergency&#x27;s only.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m very surprised to see that this shaver has gone up in price by 30 dollars since this time last year.</li>
            <li>Original blade unit is still sharp.</li>
            <li>A couple things about the actual features...Pretty easy to clean, though the manual is somewhat confusing (yeah, I&#x27;m one of those that read manuals too).</li>
            <li>Being a traditionalist, I was at first taken back by the design.</li>
            <li>Rotary seems like a good choice, though using the round method to shave is much more difficult than I thought.</li>
            <li>The quality of this shaver versus lesser cost units and brands is evident in every facet of it&#x27;s construction and operation.</li>
            <li>What first stood out to me was how quiet the unit is.</li>
            <li>first let&#x27;s get a basic question out of the way</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done it is a very low shave, way better than any other electric razors I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li>I have never been impressed with electric shavers in the past, but I&#x27;m tired of bleeding every time I shave with a normal multi-blade razor.  </li>
            <li>As a person who has been using a blade for more than 20 years I was not able to shave well with this razor.  </li>
            <li>Then open the chambers and run the hot water under the blades and all over the chamber floor.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is a simple hot water rinse.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first rotary shaver since I switched to foil shavers back in the mid-90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>For the past two years, it hasn&#x27;t been able to hold a charge, and I had been using it while plugged in to the wall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a more expensive option, but well worth it!</li>
            <li>This thing shaves so much better than other electric razors, and does just as well of a job as my 3-blade standard razor.</li>
            <li>A hot water rinse of the heads only takes a minute.  </li>
            <li>Who knows, the 2D model may provide a better shave due to different blades and a pop off trimmer.  </li>
            <li>to the cleaning solution, Braun shaver has bit higher operational cost, but extra convenience in use.</li>
            <li>At first it was so quiet</li>
            <li>(this is the 3rd saver i buy in the last 3 years and only now i am satisfied).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really not sure how much better it can get.  </li>
            <li>, I missed a couple spots but my problem areas without extra effort was smoother than I had ever been able to get it with any other type of razor.</li>
            <li>I thought be upgrading to a more expensive model with my next one it would work even better....</li>
            <li>my problem comes in, first it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, second</li>
            <li>I got the Norelco, I charged it up and the next day took it for its first test drive.  </li>
            <li>The first instinct with this electric is to do the same thing.</li>
            <li>I decided to drop the extra money to buy the higher end 1250x over a year ago, after having one of the $40 Norelco models that lasted me almost 3 years.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if anyone can ever make a better electric shaver than the Braun Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first turned this one on, it was so quiet that I thought it might be faulty</li>
            <li>I gave it to a co-worker who at first didn&#x27;t want it either for the same reasons</li>
            <li>least it is easy to daily clean.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with a great product, superclean shave - however it strikes me as extraordinarily retarded that you can only charge it with the stand.  </li>
            <li>This shaver which looks a bit like a small Martian creature gives me the most rapid and close shaves ever.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t necessarily faster than other Norelco models, but the results are notably better.   </li>
            <li>As usual i read all the reviews before purchasing;looked at the opposition and asked my son who lives in Singapore what he thought of the latest model as he has</li>
            <li>He totally loves it and unlike some of the reviews listed it did not irritate him at all during the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Nowhere near a blade!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a bunch of different 3D models but they primarily differ in the features that don&#x27;t directly relate to the shave, such as the battery life</li>
            <li>usually spend around $60 for a shaver but decided to upgrade and go for a better one.  </li>
            <li>but it gets pretty close and without the occasional nicks and cuts</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco shavers for the past 25 years now and they just keep getting better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got the basic feats of the more advanced models, without the cost and unnecessary added</li>
            <li>Heads have to be cleaned much more often than other Norelco shavers because there is essentially no capacity to hold the shaved hair particles.</li>
            <li>I decided that since it&#x27;s going to cost me the price of a new razor to get a new shaver head that I would find a replacement head for my old 8020X.</li>
            <li>I know there is a time to get use to electric shavers but my neck felt right at home with this shaver, and I have just a slight bit of irritation, nothing like I had years ago trying to get use to the electric shaver I first had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It shaves easy, with little irritation.</li>
            <li>The older, 2D type, appears to do the job reasonably well, especially when I use the Norelco shaver lubricant frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes you have to open each head individually, but you don&#x27;t have to take the head apart to clean it</li>
            <li>Both Norelco and Braun offer money back trial periods, so my main advice is to not overthink the decision or put too much stock in reviews like this one.  </li>
            <li>and I would need to make several passes to get all the stubble, and still there was some left on my neck that I would quickly clean up with my fusion proglide.    </li>
            <li>It is actually easier to clean than any of my earlier Norelco razors.  </li>
            <li>I use an old tooth brush to clean it after every wet shave.</li>
            <li>The third dimension of movement for the shaving heads really does make a difference , particularly on the neck area.</li>
            <li>every other shave to remind you to clean it.  </li>
            <li>decide to just use the other cheaper razor and just get a close shave instead of the clean shave.</li>
            <li>That being said, there are a couple less positive things that are worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>Getting the last green light of the charge indicator means I have 3-6 days left before a recharge--not a particularly accurate indicator.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts enough for a several shaves, and charging an empty battery is incredibly fast, can&#x27;t ask for more in this department.  </li>
            <li>My old norelco didn&#x27;t have this problem; if hair ever came out (rarely) it was because i&#x27;d gone over a week without emptying it, but at least it holds a weeks worth!  </li>
            <li>My beard, thin but wiry, is too challenging for most other brands.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave, no prickly skin afterwards, no need to press down hard, the flex head is fantastic in going over the chin/neck contours.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to start shaving with this new Norelco.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When my 10 year old started getting slower speed, I decided to order a new one.  </li>
            <li>The new one requires you to charge it using the charging stand, you can&#x27;t just plug the charging cord into the bottom of the shaver like the old one.</li>
            <li>But this is a very minor quibble, and not one worth taking a star off for.  </li>
            <li>But this is a very minor quibble, and not one worth taking a star off for.  </li>
            <li>I found that on previous shavers, it might slip around in my hand on the smooth surfaces.</li>
            <li>Clearly Norelco is no longer interested in providing a quality product nor properly servicing their existing customers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it lasts as long as my prior Norelco, over 20 years, the price will have been cheap.</li>
            <li>The guide covers 6 model types so it can be a bit confusing at first but all the needed information is available and in detail.</li>
            <li>They just didnt cut like my first and second norelco&#x27;s of old.</li>
            <li>Overall, not worth the approximatly $70 more for the SensoTouch 3D unit.</li>
            <li>Yes, this razor sells for too much money considering it barely outperforms my old razor that is a Philips Norelco 8240XL.</li>
            <li>The rotary heads are not close enough to the edge to do a good job of shaving the upper lip next to the nose, and the heads scrape against the upper lip hair (hurting) and I have to keep going over the same area over and over to get a close shave</li>
            <li>Then you give it a little shake and let it dry on its own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to make your Norelco battery last longer, every six months or so make sure you let the battery run down to below \\&quot;0\\&quot; on the charge indicator - until it stops.</li>
            <li>When I began looking for a new (and also my first) electric shaver, I spent several weeks researching and comparing products and the norelco just seemed to be the right buy.</li>
            <li>As a first time user I had to go through several shaves to adjust to the electric shaver and there was minor irritation on the first days.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s still far from closing on manual blades&#x27; smoothness, so beware sensitive skins!</li>
            <li>A simple U shaped cradle with a flat bottom that can sit flat on any surface would be better.      </li>
            <li>My four year old made the comment the other day that he liked that I didn&#x27;t have a &#x27;sharp beard&#x27;.     </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know that was possible – a dry shave as smooth as you can get without the razor</li>
            <li>(Black men are more susceptible to razor bumps than white men because of the course curly nature of our hair).</li>
            <li>Traditional razors tend to irritate my skin the most, and through experimentation over the years, I have found that Norelco brand razors tend to irritate my skin much less than all the others.  </li>
            <li>This unit is much better than previous Norelcos I&#x27;ve owned especially in \\&quot;angled\\&quot; spaces -</li>
            <li>But now dry shaving is the weekday routine when I&#x27;m rushing to get ready for office and don&#x27;t have much time.</li>
            <li>sure to check Walmart in your area to see if it is on clearance as above stated I got mine for less then a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li>Amazon CS took care of business and send me out a replacement quickly, however when I finally got a chance to open it, it appeared that the box had been opened before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, if I would need to buy a new shaver again, I&#x27;d buy this one again!</li>
            <li>The heads on the old one were getting gross and instead of paying for new heads (which can cost as much as upgrading) got this 1250x instead.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve accumulated quite a few electric razors over the years, with the three most recent being the new models from Norelco, Braun and Panasonic.</li>
            <li>The cons: the flip-up trimmer is not as good as older Norelco shavers; there are 3 seperate compartments that capture hair and it fills up quickly, requiring emptying about every day; my major complaint is that it requires use of the charging stand and does not plug in directly, which sucks for traveling.</li>
            <li>The unit is light, fits the hand very well, has a convenient pop up trimmer, and can be used, wet, dry, and in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It shaves fine, just not fantastic, and the one nit I have is that if I go 3 days without shaving, it tugs and pulls vs lifts and cuts in spots.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic was not seriously considered, especially since I prefer a quick, dry shave, but I looked at it for my son.  </li>
            <li>you are a picky shaver and enjoy shaving with shaving cream, you can even use that here, as the shaver has special stops to prevent shaving cream from destroying the system as it will with other shavers.</li>
            <li>I prefer the shape of the smaller rounder Norelcos, even though I have large hands.</li>
            <li>(1255x was the specific box item) from the large bulk membership-required store.  </li>
            <li>I have wet shaved and in more recent years used a Braun series 5 for the last 7 years and a Remington before that I am 62 semi retired and was not interested in the self cleaning model as i have &#x27;PLENTY&#x27; of time to clean the unit.</li>
            <li>So you need to constantly peer at the mirror to ensure that Secondly, its far less effective if you want to shave in the evening and then again in the morning    4.</li>
            <li>It does pinch me a little lower on my neck, but I&#x27;ll take the pain for smooth skin.</li>
            <li>As a daily-use razor it is definitely worth every single dollar!</li>
            <li>Even though it was still working relatively well, I wanted a little better shave for my aging face.</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve bought the top line shaver from the three major shaver manufacturers (Braun, Panasonic, Phillips/Norelco) &amp; tried them out side by side.</li>
            <li>a little better I&#x27;ll probably go back to the Braun as it has the self cleaner.</li>
            <li>with the original cutters that cost about half the price.  </li>
            <li>have a hard time with any razor and my beard on my neck, as most do.</li>
            <li>I would have to press considerably hard with the head on the skin, pluck those hairs, or use the extendable trimmer in these situations (many times it was a combination).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hard to tell how many electric razors I&#x27;ve bought through the years - 50? 75?</li>
            <li>speed - the 3D is the clear winner here.</li>
            <li>Nothing severe, but it is clearly a notch below the others on the comfort</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not been overly happy with the cheaper Philips products in the past and had changed to a microfoil shaver which I had been using for the past 12 months.</li>
            <li>However, coming from using a traditional 5-blade razor, I can&#x27;t get a shave quite a smooth using the Norelco, even when shaving wet with shave</li>
            <li>Yes it has triple cut action, but the inner and middle circles are very different, and it appears to make a huge difference in the shave.  </li>
            <li>If you want a shaver that you have to clean less frequently, but that gives an inferior shave, there are plenty of them on the market.    </li>
            <li>(Note the instructions clearly do say you can use it in the shower and</li>
            <li>over the last 12 years I&#x27;ve purchased roughly 6 electric shavers all hoping they will be the cure to leaving my skin smooth and irritation free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also had no trouble with the blades getting near the hairs near my nose.  </li>
            <li>While it works, it&#x27;s great but don&#x27;t  count on it lasting just because it is expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Norelco customer for over forty years, but I think I&#x27;m ready to change over to a different product.  </li>
            <li>I have to use my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Battery charges and holds charge, no water damage even though I use it frequently in the shower.</li>
            <li>After using a Remington Electric razor for about 6 months I was ready to go back to blade razors.</li>
            <li>Not enough flex or something I really dont know?</li>
            <li>He has one of the thickest beards I&#x27;ve ever seen (this is a kid who has to shave his back before dates), and this razor really does the job.</li>
            <li>I got this shaver for my husband for Christmas because his old Norleco shaver had worn out.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to think about how much energy is wasted by running the hot water faucet until you actually get to having hot water</li>
            <li>Will it completely replace my manual razor  4.</li>
            <li>charging times are fast and the rechargeable battery has lasted for almost two weeks now without having been recharged (used on a daily basis) which I think is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have had shaving rash on my neck all my adult life...</li>
            <li>To get a really close shave, which I like, this shaver doesn&#x27;t actually save me any time.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve used the Norelco, the old one will be consigned to the shaver graveyard.  </li>
            <li>but this has stopped completely with the 1250X.  </li>
            <li>but this has stopped completely with the 1250X.  </li>
            <li>I have been using an old Norelco \\&quot;Advantage\\&quot; razor for over 6 years and decided to upgrade to the 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d.</li>
            <li>His old Norelco no longer held a charge.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that it outworks my old razor.</li>
            <li>Some of them have personal cleaning systems that you don&#x27;t really need.</li>
            <li>I shave in a fraction of the time it took my old one and</li>
            <li>Amazon provided a $30 rebate form at the time of purchase that was directly from Philips Norelco.  </li>
            <li>The 3 heads move independently and while they are very \\&quot;cool\\</li>
            <li>However, I was amazed that not only did I get a really close shave</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a requirement to use the cradle instead of attaching the cable directly to the shaver.  </li>
            <li>It adds considerable bulk to my charger drawer.    </li>
            <li>Wow I guess my beard needed to adjust or something</li>
            <li>My next plan is to use a straight razor for the neck and try this for everything else.     </li>
            <li>My son has sensitive skin and has struggled with shaving with a blade because of his acne.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver for my husband to replace a 15 year old Norelco shaver that was just worn out.  </li>
            <li>so he was nursing the old one along.  </li>
            <li>It is now 2 months after the 2 year warranty, so it seems I am completely out of luck at this point.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was ready to send it back yesterday, but I decided to give it another try.</li>
            <li>So this is a big improvement in speed, and it&#x27;s a much closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can accept having to use shaving cream if it means I can get a perfectly smooth shave in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>My old shaver was like that, and I was always worried about running out of charge mid-way into my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as performance</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>Quite surprised at how close this shaver shaves me.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at how close the shave was based on the reviews I have read on these pages.</li>
            <li>I had an old shaver that didn&#x27;t work too well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Blades have a pretty long life.</li>
            <li>but this razor is capable and the experience was terrific.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace a 2 year old Braun Series 3, which compared to the newer series 7</li>
            <li>I still feel it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my old foil razor, but I&#x27;m getting the technique of close shaves.</li>
            <li>My old foil razor shaved close but it also ate holes in the foils so I had to replace them about every three months.</li>
            <li>I used the \\&quot;old style\\&quot; Norelco for years.</li>
            <li>but I have been using for 5 months and so far I have saved $20 on gillettes .</li>
            <li>The 9160 is 5 years old.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly very quiet and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>you know the old line about the \\&quot;heir and a spare\\&quot;..  :</li>
            <li>well, out comes that old braun shaver and WOW, it still holds a charge and still works..</li>
            <li>it provides very close shaves especially with shaving foam.</li>
            <li>This however, leads to irritation, and frequent cuts around my jaw line.     </li>
            <li>It not only cut it, but it was a VERY close shave and no irritation.</li>
            <li>, we guys have to struggle with shaving nearly every day - don&#x27;t skimp out.  </li>
            <li>Many reviewers complained about the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>They cost nearly $200.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the coolest looking crappy shavers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Near my sideburns and nose, these rotary razors cannot shave at all.  </li>
            <li>I did research to learn about shavers for sensitive skin and this was my choice.  </li>
            <li>Wish you could just plug the cord directly into the razor to charge it</li>
            <li>the years I have tried a number of razors--any number of traditional one-to-four blade straight (disposable) handles, as well as electric units from Remington and Norelco.  </li>
            <li>We ordered the shaver, including (and I quote)\\&quot; SensoTouch 3D 1250X/40 razor, charging stand, soft pouch for travel and storage, protective cap, power cord, and cleaning brush.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>But it isn&#x27;t anywhere near the shave that my Braun 790 was.  </li>
            <li>I love a traditional wet shave with a double edge and a quality shaving cream.</li>
            <li>When he tried the 1250X/40 he said he preferred the old shaver, the 7310.  </li>
            <li>My old Braun 760 sounded like a lawnmower.</li>
            <li>A lot closer shave than my old electric shaver and the battery</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll wish I could plug the cord directly into it, so I wouldn&#x27;t need the charging stand when traveling.</li>
            <li>Use a fragrant-free lotion, if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>This Norelco replaces my old Braun 8585.</li>
            <li>This is where the problem begins - on the Phiillps website the MSRP for a replacement head is $64.99, but they are no longer being made so the few available ones are being offered at inflated prices.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was gettinng it with my 2 year old self cleaning BRAUN PULSONIC 7.But when the trimmer broke</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33 years old</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see an improvement over my old Braun or the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by how well the shaving heads countored to my face.  </li>
            <li>I always had sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Also the Li-ion battery does not suffer from memory like the old ni-cads.</li>
            <li>So far the battery life is exemplary.  </li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no way to run the shaver directly on AC.</li>
            <li>likely it will not go very well, but I&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
            <li>I have to resort to my 12y old philips shaver to get the job done...  </li>
            <li>My old one did not.</li>
            <li>As with the old Norelco you can accidently shut it off with your thub when shaving.</li>
            <li>, the shaving cream was old</li>
            <li>would probably get an extra replacement head if ordering again, but then, you don&#x27;t really know what improvements might be there in 3 or 6 years</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m frequently away for 2-3 weeks, and I do not need to bring a charger with me).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Also, if one has a longer stubble, one might use the extendable trimmer to do a first pass or to get a pesky long hair or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>Perhaps it was made on a Monday or Friday as the old saying goes</li>
            <li>Remington Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel 5 oz.</li>
            <li>The Braun has three speeds so you can go slower for sensitive areas and intensive on less-sensitive places.</li>
            <li>The Norelco soft case does not hold the stand</li>
            <li>This model was made in 2010 making it about two years old.</li>
            <li>I had an old Braun.</li>
            <li>old Norelco trimmer).  </li>
            <li>I replaced my old Panasonic 2 blades shaver with this 1250X.  </li>
            <li>Wow,</li>
            <li>but i dont think the shave is as close as my old norelco.</li>
            <li>I upgraded to this shaver in 2012, after a year the unit stopped working completely, I contacted Phillips, they asked a lot of questions about how I recharged the unit.  </li>
            <li>This Norelco destroys my old shaver.  </li>
            <li>This replaced my two year old Panasonic Shaver.</li>
            <li>Using a circular motion while shaving improves the results to near that of a razor.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco razors since the early 50s</li>
            <li>It probably took me about a minute to complete the shave.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>My old electric razor gave me razor burns on my neck.  </li>
            <li>and I think the the 3D swivel action along with the blade configuration is what makes it all happen.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco 7810XL  needed replacment.</li>
            <li>This model(and the 1150/40 for that matter) are not your old fashioned lawn mower type of electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that you have to take the whole charging unit with you when you travel.</li>
            <li>He was used to the old razors with the gel inside the razor.  </li>
            <li>i already had a philips norelco razor (about 4-5 years old) and decided to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I bought this for my dad, a 50+ year old man.</li>
            <li>I wear mustache, so it was a problem to shave near them and to trim them.</li>
            <li>IS THE LAST ONE FOR ME.AMAZONS PRICE WAS LOWER THAN THE SHAVERS WEBSITE,VERY REASONABLE.</li>
            <li>in all, for nearly $200 dollars, I received 2 $100 shaves.  </li>
            <li>In fact, they are almost completely eliminated.</li>
            <li>quiet you figure it can&#x27;t have much power.</li>
            <li>It works very well and the battery charge seems to last for weeks.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor to replace my old, worn out Philips Norelco razor of over 6+ years.  </li>
            <li>Nearly two hundred</li>
            <li>I have to keep and use my old style razor with trimmer  to complete my shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;JUST GET THE SIDEBURN TRIMMER SITUATION FIXED</li>
            <li>This shaver is a replacement for my 8470XL, ruined by an over zealous TSA agent, who thought it looked like a gun - dismantled the top and misplaced the entire head assembly -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The slip-over cover for the 3D heads was the first I&#x27;ve owned that didn&#x27;t break after the first few months.   </li>
            <li>In the end it wasn&#x27;t worth the constant razor burn and extra time to shave as it often missed hairs.  </li>
            <li>I only had it a few days as, again, I was looking for more of a beard trimmer</li>
            <li>matter how good the 12xx series Norelco&#x27;s are, they are useless if they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>my philips sonicare toothbrush (about 6 months old) followed the razor into failure mode but this charger is not stupid, its smart and the toothbrush still runs but does not vibrate..</li>
            <li>If you let the battery run down, a 3-5 minute charge will get you a full shave.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t tried this shaver wet, my past experience has always been that a dry shave is closer &amp; more comfortable with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It makes me wonder if they even sell it anymore, or are more interested in getting new razors to retailers, rather than returning customers, who&#x27;s Norelco product has failed on them.  </li>
            <li>At first i bought this razor due to the high ratings, I thought that maybe i should update my old razor with a high-end product like this one.</li>
            <li>Like any new razor it takes a few tries to figure out problem areas, but once you get that down it works great.</li>
            <li>Not easily done with this one with the way the 3 heads open as well as many metal snag points for the towel.  </li>
            <li>I used this with shaving gel and dry, but never got very good results, and it even began cutting my face in certain sensitive areas, namely above the lip.</li>
            <li>As I said , it&#x27;s very light, very slim and the battery charge lasts through over a dozen uses (which for my father now are long, slow shaves).</li>
            <li>My new Norelco has given me nothig but close, comfortable shaves, wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always not easy to find, but some stores carry it and it is easily available online, including Amazon.</li>
            <li>I first tried the shaver on a dry skin</li>
            <li>Just rinse under hot water and let it dry.</li>
            <li>&amp; so I let my beard grow for a full two and a half days.</li>
            <li>Still gives a great shave, I&#x27;ve gotten a little lazy and at times if I don&#x27;t go over my chin enough</li>
            <li>The head cover is hard to remove and sometimes the  head comes off when I remove its cover, but it is very easy to put the head back on.  </li>
            <li>The shaver works fine, but no better, faster, or closer than the 8 year old $40 dollar model that it replaced.</li>
            <li>The design is some different than my previous ones, but easy to adapt to.  </li>
            <li>The razor is easy to use and works on wet or dry face.  </li>
            <li>My last Norelco shaver, which was very adequate, took up a lot less space in my suitcase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I quickly blow dry the blades with a hair dryer on low temperature.  </li>
            <li>I like the old shaver better and would probably think seriously about getting it repaired if I hadn&#x27;t bought this one.</li>
            <li>I ordered this razor to replace an older model Norelco that I had for several years because the battery completely died.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I expected more, performance wise, based on Consumer Reports review, but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li>I know my wife is tired of hearing from both of us how much we like our new razors, but we are still amazed at how much better the shaves are than what we thought was possible.  </li>
            <li>What you get for the extra money is a slight improvement in the shave, a bit better design, and a few somewhat useful bells and whistles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d owned: a quiet, smooth wet shave and a very acceptable dry shave.</li>
            <li>liked the fact that this razor can be used wet or dry, but after 3 weeks of daily use, I still could not get a close enough shave and my shaving time  doubled.</li>
            <li>The SensoTouch 3D shaving system easily removes the long hairs due to the way the heads conform to your neck &amp; jaw line.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor because my old braun broke and I was looking for some thing that could be cleaned and rinsed with plain old water instead of having to by special cleaning kits.</li>
            <li>My husband is not into trying new things, his old razor was about 15 years old and he couldn&#x27;t find the same module</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this new shaver is nice but not what I would consider an improvement over the old one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First the is the small trimmer that you push out will take you like 45 minutes to cut your facial hair (and I have very light facial hair, and never thick).</li>
            <li>and he has to clean it everyday because it holds no shavings.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband who is a marine and must be clean shaven everyday.</li>
            <li>It was quick and it took less than three minutes.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s some highlights of how this compares to older units such as the Speed-XL line (which you can still find).    </li>
            <li>However after having used a razor like the Speed-XL, the Senso seems excessively long and narrow (it&#x27;s like trying to shave with a stick) while the Speed fits my hand better and is easier to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>When I first turned it on, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working properly, so I turned it off &amp; back on again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an older style Norelco for 5 years and after replacing the blades several times, decided I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li>Main issue is that after 10 weeks, razor ceased working ... totally died.  </li>
            <li>It was like the first time behind the wheel of a well crafted sorts car after spending a lifetime driving cheap sedans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have owned several Norelco electric razors over the past forty years and all have been pleased with all of them.  </li>
            <li>It was kinda cool to be able to drop this thing on it&#x27;s charge base and it would clean for the next use.</li>
            <li>This does a decent job but does not provide a close enough shave.</li>
            <li>In fact my first electric razor was a double head back in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>However, now about 11 months later, the exact same problem is occurring with the replacement I was sent.  </li>
            <li>When this razor does die then I will definitely buy another exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I decided to replace my old Norelco razor that had the lotion and ability to wet shave because Philips Norelco stopped supporting it.</li>
            <li>This Norelco razor simply will not give me a decent shave, even after shaving for 10-15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I called in the next day and got the exact same</li>
            <li>It also offers three settings (gentle, normal and intensive) that vary the speed of the cutters, a feature the other two lack.</li>
            <li>It also offers three settings (gentle, normal and intensive) that vary the speed of the cutters, a feature the other two lack.</li>
            <li>After charging I was surprised to find it shaved under my chin, something no other electric could ever do.</li>
            <li>I spoke to an extremely unhelpful customer service supervisor named Claudine, and all she could tell me to do was to clean the shaver, in the middle of a shave;</li>
            <li>Searched high and low, read reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, and compared value and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>The only two things that I can criticize about the SensoTouch is the high cost of the replacement heads and the trimmer placement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d of purchased such a high priced shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it, especially at Amazon&#x27;s competitive price.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this razor, especially for people (like me) who are used to a blade and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>A high end razor should last longer than a cheaper one and replacement blades should not be obsolete or overpriced while they are still selling the</li>
            <li>The charging stand is light and folds up to occupy very little space when not in use.</li>
            <li>and I have used a few other electric razors and many of the new multi-blade manual razors.</li>
            <li>Wet or dry, the shave is comfortable and close.</li>
            <li>Works great,Good smooth shave and even has a larger head than my previous Norelco&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>and I found this rotary shaver is designed to give a smooth shave in dry or wet conditions.</li>
            <li>The Braun shaver was uncomfortable when shaving my head, the Norelco is so comfortable and quick.  </li>
            <li>It does a very close shave quickly even if you have 3 or 4 days of thick stubble.</li>
            <li>Charges fast, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been surprised with how much they&#x27;ve improved in the last ten years.  </li>
            <li>The cord was small &amp; easily fit in my travel shaver bag.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say how long it will go without charging.  </li>
            <li>I am really upset I waited this long to spend the money on a topshelf shaver....</li>
            <li>great shave but very expensive razor</li>
            <li>and if I were the one doing it, I think I&#x27;d opt for a Foil razor which requires long, straight strokes &amp; should produce a closer shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver shaves very close and even gets the long hairs on my neck that my Braun electric shaver could not get.  </li>
            <li>My past shaver was a cheap Panasonic wet/dry dual blade (ES4026NC).  </li>
            <li>Smooth shaving and without the usual razor burn</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was just another empty sales pitch.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it,it shaved off 4 days of stubble with absolutely no problem.    </li>
            <li>It took a few shaves to get used to the heads being placed further apart than with a standard Norelco (so they have room to pivot), so there&#x27;s more need to use a circular motion.  </li>
            <li>So for the next few days it is BACK to the BLADE... :-)</li>
            <li>You use hot water when the three circular blade compartments are closed</li>
            <li>not only took longer than a normal non electric razor</li>
            <li>This thing is so quiet, so powerful, so versatile and so smooth that I&#x27;ve never experienced an electric shaver like it</li>
            <li>as it is not important to have such a close shave anymore, it is fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1) Don&#x27;t press hard - use an easy touch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1) Don&#x27;t press hard - use an easy touch.</li>
            <li>It even gently cut my thick beard hairs and I didn&#x27;t even have to use the trimmer attachment first!  </li>
            <li>I normally shave with the grain (up to down) and then shave sideways (left to right).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that hard - pop all 3 heads and then use running water in the sink - but it has to be done more often than the lower-end Norelcos with bigger compartments.  </li>
            <li>Please know that while Amazon only began selling it today, the shaver has been available from other sources since mid August.</li>
            <li>Contacted Panasonic via online chat and they sent me a replacement handle without much fuss (although I have to ship the original back to them...prepaid at least).  </li>
            <li>yr old son is prone to razor bumps - need to be able to minimize that  Has to be able to handle thick, tough beard and shave relatively close  Trimmer for sideburns and/or beard depending on his style of the week  </li>
            <li>i have never had such a close,comfortable shave as with this new phillips norelco 1250x.  </li>
            <li>Enough said it&#x27;s $53 for a new blade set.</li>
            <li>So I ordered a new 1250-40 model norelco and now I get the quiet shave and efficiency in beard handling.  </li>
            <li>You cannot properly trim with these new style trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Really close dry shave.</li>
            <li>I always dry shave, and doing so with the 3D works very well.  </li>
            <li>For the last 6 -7 years I&#x27;ve used top of the line Braun razors and prior had tried a Norelco, the wet / dry version that dispensed shaving lotion.     </li>
            <li>; I get too much irritation on my neck dry shaving with the SensoTouch.  </li>
            <li>This razor, with the floating heads, gives a much closer shave then the older Norelco style, I was previously shaving with.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>My last two nivea norelcos, and the archtect or some such really sucked.</li>
            <li>His old shaver (Norelco) was only a couple years old</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quiet that it seems strange at first.   </li>
            <li>Yet, the motor is less powerful</li>
            <li>If you have light facial hair or plan on using this razor a few days out of the week you&#x27;re in business.</li>
            <li>Only traditional shavers can provide you a very close shave in that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why these higher end models cost so much.</li>
            <li>However I find myself constantly going back to the straight razor to get one spot that 1250x can&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li>I can truthfully say that even though it was quite expensive, it can give me a very close shave without burning me, I do use Willaims Lectric Shave liquid.  </li>
            <li>I have used this style (triple head) razor for many years and at least 4 prior designs from Norelco.  </li>
            <li>(although for most travelers it shouldn&#x27;t matter, I get at least ten shaves between charging, probably closer to twenty).</li>
            <li>I have never used the most expensive electric shavers so I could not compare this product to those, however I have used this product for about 4 months and find it very satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only problem i have with this shaver is that it is much bulkier than my last shaver</li>
            <li>/&gt;Norelco looks more stylish while standing on its base on the sink counter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have another son, who was shaving with a very old speed xl razor that has no battery life left.  </li>
            <li>This shaver does exactly what every other shaver before it does.</li>
            <li>The recipient states that this razor is like no other electric razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every major brand made.  </li>
            <li>This is a major benefit for the 1250X40.</li>
            <li>and so are the replacement heads apparently!</li>
            <li>I wish Norelco would do a major redesign on the functional aspects.</li>
            <li>Combined with the inward-and-outward flexibility of the 3D&#x27;s heads, this is a major advance.</li>
            <li>This leads to my major issue.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it even at the higher price than other models..</li>
            <li>I usualy get Panasonic or Remington or other brands but this is my first Norelco.</li>
            <li>I just make it a practice to rinse them with hot water every couple of days and leave them open to dry.  </li>
            <li>do most of my shaving dry, as I am to lazy to use foam or gel.</li>
            <li>like this far more as a wet shaver than dry, it doesn&#x27;t get as close in dry mode, but this might just be a personal thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Charging the razor is a simple matter of easily sliding it into a small stand.</li>
            <li>neck - this is the most difficult area for most shavers, and all of these models left a few errant hairs here and there.</li>
            <li>Decent razor as long as it works.</li>
            <li>As far as cons since it is round and not flat like other razors you aren&#x27;t able to get some spots</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>The price is a little steep for a razor, but I think it will be well worth it.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers complained that you have to clean the razor too frequently.  </li>
            <li>Typically when you buy a newer model (particularly at this price), you expect an improvement from older and lower priced units.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the quality of the shave is acceptable, since I wasnt too particular with my manual shave also on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>so I wondered why would anybody want to shave wet when shaving dry is so convenient and quick.</li>
            <li>I have used electric razors for many years and one of my main compaints over the years is the fact that it&#x27;s often difficult to get a close shave with an electric razor.</li>
            <li>, it has all the features of his old norelco shaver with some additional features and a new swivel to the heads to make shaving the chin easier, it also comes with a travel carry case and a very nice charging base.</li>
            <li>Second, the width of the slide up trimmer is narrower than on the older and cheaper models, which makes sideburns harder to trim straight, Third,</li>
            <li>totally shocked by how great.</li>
            <li>I have experienced no skin irritation at any time using this product, and gone are the painful nicks of a razor blade and the drying effects of shaving lotions.</li>
            <li>I generally replace them every four or five years</li>
            <li>Apparently men old enough to shave still need to be reminded about this.</li>
            <li>It provided a very close shave but also missed a lot of whiskers, so it took a long time and a lot of going back and forth and stretching and pinching of my skin to get everything.   </li>
            <li>His old one finally wore out after about 25 years of service.</li>
            <li>So much hair is left on my face, I would only use this if I wanted the short stubble look.</li>
            <li>I guess this is more a personal observation than a complaint, but I present it for your review and information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess this is more a personal observation than a complaint, but I present it for your review and information.    </li>
            <li>As far as the different versions of the Sensotouch 3d, I decided to go with the cheapest version.</li>
            <li>Several weeks ago my old Norelco went the way of all gadgets.</li>
            <li>When the battery drains far enough the shaver just turns off and has to be charged again.   </li>
            <li>Quiet, close shave, it did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(My last Braun shaver had a cord that could plug into the charger stand or directly into the shaver.</li>
            <li>My old Braun series 5 foil shaver was loud enough to annoy anyone sleeping in the next room.</li>
            <li>I only just recently had to charge it for the 1st time, so it really does last for a lot of shaves.     </li>
            <li>but until now, never really notices much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If I were to purchase another razor again, at this point, I would skip this series, and go back to acordless model using the HQ-9 heads, which lasted me nearly 5 years</li>
            <li>It slides out, but just barely.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it twice so far</li>
            <li>I definitely get a closer shave than with the old model.  </li>
            <li>I also have the luxury of a 15 year old in need of a razor, without the same \\&quot;refined\\&quot; criteria that I have.  </li>
            <li>the only drawbacks i found are the blades are not close enough to the edge (like my old 7775X) to trim off the hairs near the nose.</li>
            <li>It does not shave as close as the old traditional Speed XL type.</li>
            <li>I wonder if it will last like my earlier Norelco&#x27;s since it seems more delicate.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the Foil razors are noisier, so that would be one drawback.</li>
            <li>Also it didn&#x27;t shave very close, i was already rough around 12pm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I finally replaced an old Norelco rotary shave with this one.</li>
            <li>On the old style the clasp to open it was at the front</li>
            <li>The 3D is the only shaver in the lineup thus far to have them.  </li>
            <li>67 db at 6 inches is about a quarter as loud as the Braun Series 7 (79-80 db); with the Braun Series 5 in the middle.  </li>
            <li>Norelco&#x27;s apparently has detergent and lubrication.</li>
            <li>Purchased the 1250x as an upgrade to my 2 year old philips norelco that looks similar in form.</li>
            <li>im back to my old ways.</li>
            <li>I actually have a rechargeable unit that is probably six or seven years old that is still running, that I use as a spare.  </li>
            <li>It is only meant for a fixed location.</li>
            <li>I could use this wet, and I may eventually, and I suspect it would shave very close to blade closeness then -</li>
            <li>It was an upgrade from a 5-year old Norelco 7000 series model (or something similar).  </li>
            <li>Also very quiet, not the buzz saw of my old one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this razor for a couple of weeks, but so far it does everything I want in a razor.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally, I&#x27;ve used my old $50 Norelco.  </li>
            <li>You can barely hear it.  </li>
            <li>As far as saving me time shaving, I find just the opposite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a solid build that when dropped, does not break like my old shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its quieter (but the old one was already very quiet).</li>
            <li>If I had tried to do that with my old 7775X, it would have felt like each individual hair was being plucked from my head with a pair of tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Series 8000 now, apparently.  </li>
            <li>Though Norelco says that it takes about 30 days for your face to get used to its shaving heads, I think the reality is that it normally takes that long for the blades to wear to a point where they seat correctly in the shaving head.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is kind of lame, but I have a separate razor for that</li>
            <li>I bought a top of the line model but was never happy with the shave.  </li>
            <li>Probably the most frustrating thing is the fact that you can&#x27;t get through one, or maybe two, shaves before hair dust is spilling out all over your shirt.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is well worth the money, my boyfriend LOVES it, uses it EVERYDAY</li>
            <li>But given it&#x27;s expected long life, with quality shaves throughout, it&#x27;s probably still worth it.</li>
            <li>Cleaning in water and air-drying cannot be good for cutting edges.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer</li>
            <li>But the head wears out too quickly and despite the elegant aesthetic design requiring the entire very expensive head to be replaced two to three times a year (instead of just the blades) is a major industrial design flaw.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, the \\&quot;large-slot\\&quot; heads will work their way down the product line; until then it&#x27;s well worth paying the extra money for the 3D.</li>
            <li>very close shaving compared to other brand, ergonomically designed, very well built and battery last long.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, spending nearly $170 wasn&#x27;t high on my priority list either.</li>
            <li>negative is that you have to hand-clean each head which is easy to do only sometimes (if it cooperates).</li>
            <li>far as the quality, if I shave somewhat regularly, this razor does do a decent job, though it takes longer than traditional shaving as I do have to go over the same areas multiple times and that can leave your skin irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the long run time this isn&#x27;t a big issue for me, at least not with new strong batteries.  </li>
            <li>I have been a Norelco user for over 40 years, and while this model (I have model #1260x) shaves okay, the design is ridiculous!</li>
            <li>but it is less than stellar on my chin and in the mustache area.</li>
            <li>This all black model has the nicest, cleanest aesthetic of all the Norelco higher end models.</li>
            <li>The SensoTouch 3D got most of the hair all the other electric shaver usually miss.</li>
            <li>Due to the cleaning solution, Braun shaver has bit higher operational cost, but extra convenience in use.</li>
            <li>Then after three weeks it was a little better, but my neck would still get irritated a little.</li>
            <li>Shaving quality and comfort of this particular unit were acceptable, not great but not bad,</li>
            <li>There are a few differences between the old speed and smart touch xl razors compared to the 3D.  </li>
            <li>The Braun can be cleaned with water, but it&#x27;s hard to get it very clean since the cutter block is a single unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He is extremely picky and has very stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>why reviewers here think it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>
            <li>My face was a little tender after using it for a few weeks but got better after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>The Norelco CSR confirmed that my unit was bad, and offered a free replacement.  </li>
            <li>Serious backorder could indicate a manufacturing or design defect since there was no schedule for when handles will become available.</li>
            <li>He says it delivers the fastest cutting speed he has ever experienced, and he is careful to always buy the shavers highest recommended on Consumer Reports.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom-line, while cheaper units may do what you would consider the same job, the quality of the unit, the features and the convenience it offers would be reason enough to consider this electric shaver over others.</li>
            <li>just simply is nowhere near the closeness of a shave I get with a regular razor.</li>
            <li>As a mature male, I&#x27;ve become accustomed to a \\&quot;style\\&quot; of shaving and have been using various electric shavers for over twenty years.  </li>
            <li>the last one (8420 if I remember correct) was the wet/dry shaver about 5 years old and it finally gave up on me</li>
            <li>Ever since I was old enough to shave, my skin just does not work well with standard razers--I bleed all over.  </li>
            <li>They recommend obsessive cleaning that is totally unnecessary, and suggest cleaning the head under hot water, and sternly warn against getting hurt from the hot water.</li>
            <li>It is worth the few extra bucks over any thing cheaper.</li>
            <li>some spots if the skin is especially soft it will not cut the hair, no matter how many times you pass the cutting heads over.</li>
            <li>(And I&#x27;m not impressed very easily).  </li>
            <li>The suction cups on the base of the charging stand keeps it solid and secure in spite of the fact that it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>There should also be either a small place where you can plug it in directly (like many other, much cheaper models) or if it needs to be sealed for wet/dry then a small plastic collar adapter that will touch the charging contacts - allowing it to be plugged into the wall and charged in a hotel.      </li>
            <li>I can hardly get a full night&#x27;s sleep because I can&#x27;t wait to leap out of bed and stampede to the bathroom to shave.</li>
            <li>bought the least expensive 3D model since the only difference with the more expensive models are more sophisticated power indicators.</li>
            <li>The 3D stuff seems so gimmicky, but something with the razor is definitely doing it right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Feels a bit odd in my hand at first (I have big hands)&lt;br /&gt;No corded shaving</li>
            <li>You have to open each head independently for cleaning as opposed to older ones that the entire assembly popped open at the at the same time.</li>
            <li>The Wahl spray cleaner/lubricant is half the price of other cleaners such as Remington Shaver Saver and is available at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shaver, you will not be disappointed...</li>
            <li>I generally put it back in the charger after it dries</li>
            <li>I have generally found electric shavers to offer closer shaves than regular blades, but that may be just dependent on how I use electric blades.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, fast, and cuts extremely close.     </li>
            <li>3/12/2011 - I had electrics (rotary and foil; Norelco and Braun) when I was a teen and transitioned to a blade over time due to lack of a close shave or too much irritation.  </li>
            <li>My neck area became very irriated after shaving due to the multiple passes.  </li>
            <li>totally recommend to anyone thinking of purchaseing an electric shaver not to bother with any other and go straight to Philips and buy one of the 3D sensotouch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, fast, and cuts extremely close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t bare shaving every day for such a so so shave</li>
            <li>With the Panasonic &amp; Braun shavers, I frequently had to go over &amp; over these areas to get those stubborn long hairs.</li>
            <li>Further, Norelco apparently has no plans for a replacement.</li>
            <li>But, after trying it out for a few days, I have decided that this will be my first Amazon Return.</li>
            <li>Then, Amazon came riding up on the white steed and told me that if I was not satisfied, then send it back for a full refund.</li>
            <li>buying a new model every few years on the promises of \\&quot;New and Improved\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal but most standard 3 head electric razors have a large cavity below the cutting heads that can hold ample trimmings.  </li>
            <li>With a blade razor, you get used to making straight strokes -- whether up or down, or sideways.</li>
            <li>(1) Instructions for cleaning the shaving unit are for rinsing the razor heads closed under hot water \\&quot;for a few minutes\\&quot; followed by rinsing under hot water open \\&quot;for at least 30 seconds.\\&quot; That cleaning takes longer than shaving and uses as much hot water than shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li>The LED charging indicator is pretty cool and it charges right from the base.</li>
            <li>My previous Norelco was of the standard $40-$70 variety, and gave me 15 years of reliable service before getting noisy, sputtering, and generally being ready to conk out.  </li>
            <li>You also have to clean this shaver after every use because of the very small collection chambers.  </li>
            <li>You also have to clean this shaver after every use because of the very small collection</li>
            <li>I did not replace them whenever a \\&quot;new and advanced\\&quot; model appeared, but when I did, the improvements seemed to be minimal.</li>
            <li>Shaver was received as expected in condition (new)</li>
            <li>but I thought that was to be expected trying to get used to a new electric razor, but the rashes, pain and burning continued.</li>
            <li>Even the small details are done right...</li>
            <li>have a sensitive face, and the dry electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned before, burned my face.</li>
            <li>Always wash your face with soap &amp; water &amp; dry completely before shaving.</li>
            <li>The Norelco is a much closer shave and it gets odd hairs around the neck line with ease.  </li>
            <li>I use it dry and it runs circles around the old Braun I have.  </li>
            <li>I get very close shaves in less time than with the Panasonic for example.</li>
            <li>Philips is much much quieter than the Braun, with much less vibration too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Philips 1250 is much quieter than the Braun and causes me less irritation.</li>
            <li>It is less fancy but the shave is just as close and just as fast.  </li>
            <li>Whole process takes less than a minute.</li>
            <li>In a pinch you can use it with just water but having a gell or foam really makes for less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li>I charge it probably once every two weeks or less depending on how much its used.</li>
            <li>Thus far, all my shaves have been dry.</li>
            <li>My husband probably waited too long to replace his old Norelco, (they last forever), but he couldn&#x27;t be happier with this model.</li>
            <li>When you use shaving cream, use it like the manual says: First wet your face with water, then apply shaving cream, then wet your shaver with water, then shave (in that order)...</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace another Norelco cordless razor (don&#x27;t recall the exact model, but it used the almost as pricey HQ-9 heads) that I had misplaced en-route to recent deployment.  </li>
            <li>First I tried the Philips Norelco 8240 shaver when my old electric gave out, but couldn&#x27;t stand how it pulled long stubble that had grown after the last shave a few days earlier.  </li>
            <li>Luckily the battery holds at least two weeks without recharging, so this works for me.</li>
            <li>on my first shave i thought i may well have to give it a few weeks to get used to the different style of blade as opposed to the Braun</li>
            <li>It gives me face burn especially at the neck area a lot for the first few shaves, but it is going away.  </li>
            <li>The only down side is that the trimmer is much narrower.</li>
            <li>I have a heavy beard, and I have smooth skin well past 8 PM after an early morning shave, and that ain&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it was worth the price, but i would never go back to a regular razor ever again.</li>
            <li>I had a 2 day growth when I tried my new Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, wet shave, and I just could not believe when I was done, my face didn&#x27;t hurt, wasn&#x27;t red and beat-up</li>
            <li>Also, the shaver works in wet situations, but you really need lotion to ensure your skin does not get totally dry.</li>
            <li>Shaving is much quicker and requires less passes over the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable and not that expensive.</li>
            <li>That razor had served me faithfully for nearly 5 years, and I was only recently noticing the battery to not be lasting long.  </li>
            <li>The hair on my neck grows in a strange pattern and typically large amounts of hair get missed, if I use anything other than an actual razor.</li>
            <li>The shave quality was below average; it didn&#x27;t shave areas on my face particularly well.  </li>
            <li>It is now much easier &amp; with a little practice</li>
            <li>, it shaves very well, with little or no irritation.  </li>
            <li>- long battery life  CONS  - MAJOR CON FOR TRAVEL: the charger plugs into the stand, which then charges the shaver through some contact points.  </li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s not a big deal, the fact that it comes with the little flip-up straight section makes it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Philips could have made it a little better if they at least made it into a holder for the razor that could adhere to a vertical surface.</li>
            <li>It replaced a relatively new Remington that sounded like a threshing machine and very carefully pulled out the whiskers one at a time.</li>
            <li>but I would hardly say it was uncomfortable and I experienced no irritation or redness.    </li>
            <li>The new \\&quot;3d\\&quot; head, although gimmicky in title, is very percise and does not leave any area untreated, however, just like any other electric shaver, this too doesn&#x27;t provide the close shave that can be attained by an actual razor shave.  </li>
            <li>The first experience with this shaver was bad, my skin was getting very irritated, i guess i had to get used to it at first.</li>
            <li>There is a huge difference in the smoothness when shaving - this one just glides over the skin without irritating even a bit.</li>
            <li>His face is crazy baby smooth, and his sensitive skin has completely cleared of all ingrown hairs and blemishes.</li>
            <li>I use the dry Braun to clean up around my sideburns and ears, and any few rough places left over from my 1250 shave.  </li>

            <li> my man said its the best razor he ever used.</li>

            <li> but this is the best ever.  </li>
            <li> It does a very good, almost excellent job on my cheeks</li>
            <li> While the aesthetics of this 1250x/40 is very pleasant, its day-by-day use is impractical.</li>
            <li> It did not do a very good job.</li>
            <li> But, the 3D and the Panasonic are also very good shavers and will get the job done.</li>

            <li> Very good razor.</li>
            <li> The product works very good also.</li>
            <li> also if I could do it again I would go ahead and upgrade to the package that comes with the cleaner as cleaning it manually can be a chore and not do very good job.  </li>
            <li> fastest  best shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend is still happy, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I received the Senso Touch 3d for Christmas and I have to write that it is the best shave that I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li> Great product, best on the market from my experience.</li>
            <li> Works great in shower with soap or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed.</li>
            <li> My husband says it is a great razor, so we are happy with the purchase and the price!</li>
            <li> He said it gave a great shave for a electric razor, the best one he&#x27;s every had.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best of the lot I have experienced to date.</li>
            <li> I contacted the folks at Norelco, who blew an incredible amount of smoke up my kiester, telling me that this SensoTouch 3D was their finest razor ever, and I should be delirious with satisfaction.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver...does an excellent job at SHAVING.  </li>
            <li> Incredible shave, charge lasts quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I used it with a pre shave and it does a real nice job.  </li>
            <li> He loved it!</li>
            <li> I paid a lot for this hoping for a good Razor!</li>
            <li> I should have bought a bag of BIC RAZORS it would have did just as good!</li>
            <li> This might indeed be a good shaver, but we have no way of knowing, because we can&#x27;t use it!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product!thanks!</li>
            <li> excellent product works flawlessly a great buy great price</li>
            <li> He is very loving, very pleasant surprise.</li>

            <li> This is really a great shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.</li>

            <li> Still a great buy</li>
            <li> THE IDEA OF USING AN ELECTRIC SHAVER WITH SHAVING CREAM IS GREAT.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s really happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Provides a great shave for an electric.</li>
            <li> A joy to use.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I purchased this razor and would never think of looking at another.</li>
            <li> The razor was great for my beard, but Norelco changed the replacement head from RQ12 to RQ12+.  </li>
            <li> Great job</li>
            <li> It does a great job on whiskers, but cleaning it is a pain.  </li>
            <li> great price  extremely happy  </li>
            <li> great product</li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> I will be honest, no electric shaver cuts as close as a Merkur razor using a Art of Shaving quality badger brush and their wonderful cream.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.</li>
            <li> Still a great shave.  </li>

            <li> Shave is great.  </li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I shave every couple of days and this shaver works great in shower with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I am quite happy.</li>
            <li> Great razor</li>
            <li> The trimmer isn&#x27;t all that great, but the floating head shaver is great in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.</li>
            <li> just anywhere, it had great reviews, but reading two exclusivamentes where one said that he was shaving with razor and test this</li>
            <li> It really is great.  </li>
            <li> Great with or without form.</li>
            <li> The 1250X/40 is a great razor.</li>
            <li> The battery life is great 50min unplugged and a 1hour charge.</li>
            <li> Great shave&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> The shaver works great.</li>
            <li> Great company to buy from.</li>
            <li> Its really great, it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This was honestly the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> Nice price, excellent shaver .&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Not at all happy with this razor.  </li>
            <li> Great shave with this razor.</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver.</li>
            <li> Very handy for travel, no need to pack a razor and gel / cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Build quality - all are very nicely put together.</li>
            <li> A very nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A very nice bonus.    </li>
            <li> Pull the one piece triplehead unit off the charged up Norelco shaver and hold the triplehead unit under very warm running water from the showerhead for a couple seconds.</li>
            <li> I find it is very nice.</li>
            <li> very nice slim body</li>
            <li> Works very nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is still very easy to clean--a very nice gift for that guy!</li>
            <li> It does a nice close shave (not as close as a blade, but very good).  </li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I have been a norelco tripple header user for more than 30 years and this 1250x/40 3d shaver is the best i have.  </li>
            <li> Even a $25 stand-alone trimmer would be better than the best built-in trimmer you can find out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> and I am very impressed and satisfied.</li>
            <li> I STILL think it is a great shaver, the way it shaves in really good and efficient.</li>
            <li> Razor does nice job!</li>
            <li> love it,  works wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied, a product of excellent quality.</li>
            <li> If you liked this review, please mark it as helpful!</li>
            <li> I was expecting to be blown away by a great shaver and wasn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s still good.  </li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the way the Norelco worked with just water, but i found it was much better when using some shaving cream</li>
            <li> i AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE SHAVER, IT SHAVES A LOT BETTER.</li>
            <li> I love it and have had some of the best shaves ever.</li>
            <li> Best shave ever after many years of non rated shavers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice shave!</li>
            <li> ,I am very happy now as its very light and shave smoothly,also its good value for money here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend might love that!!! :)</li>
            <li> The shaver fits perfectly in the hand and has a good feel to it, it feels like some thought was put into it&#x27;s design and top quality materials were used in the manufacturing process.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant.</li>
            <li> Easily the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Top-notch design and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable to shave and very good</li>
            <li> He said it is very good, very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I tried a Norelco Spectra and loved it.</li>
            <li> I settled on the Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d shaver because the descriptions of what it could do design wise was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe how impressive it is to have an electric razor that doesn&#x27;t sound like a weed whacker.</li>
            <li> However, this was a good exception to the rule.      </li>
            <li> And not as good, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> So that means you are spending $70 a year to use this shaver at the optimum performance.</li>
            <li> And I loved the price Amazon had.</li>
            <li> I have always used Norelco Shavers with good results,until now.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic takes about 4 min for a good shave; the Braun clocks in at about 5</li>
            <li> (It feels good going over my bony knees, also)  </li>
            <li> At Christmastime, I decided to check out reviews for the razors to find that Philips were a good buy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my 1250X for about 2 months, and I&#x27;m delighted with it.</li>
            <li> I received a sensor touch razor as a gift and loved it.</li>
            <li> Norelco seemed like a good brand</li>
            <li> but I it just wasn&#x27;t a good machine for me.</li>
            <li> hey, still a good product.</li>
            <li> My Father received it and has had nothing but good things to say.</li>
            <li> This Shaver Provides a superior shave-</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> sometimes it&#x27;s a good idea to throw caution to the wind</li>
            <li> The Jet system will also lubricate and charge the shaver as well, so it&#x27;s a good buy if you can keep it in one place - traveling with it</li>
            <li> After a couple days of shaving to get my face acclimated to the shaver, I was very happy with how smooth my face was.  </li>
            <li> I gave it one more try with the 3d model which impressed me immediately with the greatly reduced noise and the more effortless shaving.</li>
            <li> I loved this razor.</li>
            <li> just avery good razor</li>
            <li> it is superior to the Braun 7 which is heavier and slower.    </li>
            <li> Every usersaid that it is good and work well.</li>
            <li> have used a Braun electrical shaver for years, a good and reliable shaver.  </li>
            <li> a good gift for your loved ones.</li>
            <li> Also Amazon&#x27;s price is good.</li>
            <li> It was a good shave, but it required work.</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t giving me a good shave.</li>
            <li> Without shaving cream, it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job at all, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what was surprising to me.</li>
            <li> I got this Philips Norelco Shaver with a good price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It keeps its charge fairly well&lt;</li>
            <li> so I decided this would be a good idea for him.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor a year ago to replace a Norelco 8020X which I loved.</li>
            <li> It did a good job shaving</li>
            <li> The ease of cleaning was good as well.  </li>
            <li> Good razor.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t the closet electric razor I have ever used but the quality and feel of the shave makes it a good purchase.</li>
            <li> The RQ12 (replacement) razor heads are good but pricey.</li>
            <li> loved it.</li>
            <li> If you can afford one, it&#x27;s definitely a good investment.  </li>
            <li> It also does not appear to be good for razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I do not have to go over and over areas and contort to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> I also have problems with ingrown hairs but razor still works good with that too.</li>
            <li> philips seems to have good customer care</li>
            <li> amazed AND delighted.</li>
            <li> Not as good as a blade</li>
            <li> The Norelco bests it in every way except for the electronic display and battery life, which are superior on the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Good close shave.</li>
            <li> this deal it is your good</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> the after Christmas looked for sales, did my homework, found the BEST electric razor available.  </li>
            <li> Because of the flaw this razor has never been any good as a travel razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The truth is, the $30 razor I carry with me on trips shaves just as good as this thing does.</li>
            <li> Philips is always good.</li>
            <li> Great battery life, nice design.  </li>
            <li> But its good.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use this while plugged in to charge and the sideburn trimmer is not as good.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed at how smooth it glides on my skin and how it got to every size of hair.</li>
            <li> The model I was using had 4 years of good service</li>
            <li> The GOOD news:</li>
            <li> Yes, it looks good.  </li>
            <li> The heads cut well, I think just as good as the 8150.  </li>
            <li> My husband loved this shaver now</li>
            <li> The Norelco Sensotouch 3D model 1250x is a good shaver.</li>
            <li> Good things about the shaver</li>
            <li> battery life is good, with one charge giving me two weeks, with one 2-5min shave per day.</li>
            <li> Philips/Norelco recommends using for three weeks - without using another shaver - as a fair test.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I cannot complain - as it is superior to the Braun - without a doubt.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve never tried an electric, this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li> But my farther bought one of these and said it&#x27;s really good.  </li>
            <li> Shave wise</li>
            <li> Good battery life</li>
            <li> Fits good in the hand&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trimmer is not as good as my cheaper Norelco, but as others have said, I didn&#x27;t buy it for the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Good price for this electric razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit pricy, (almost $200), but it is of good quality.</li>
            <li> The  outsiade  pack  is  good  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t come with all the bells and whistles as the superior models, but it works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li> I think that this is a good shaver and competitively priced.</li>
            <li> it does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li> After using this shaver for about three weeks I find it to be nearly as good as the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a good product, improved but not change in the shaving sensation.</li>
            <li> This razor does a good job shaving close without tugging.  </li>
            <li> Philips product quality is good.</li>
            <li> I find it to be vastly superior to any type of liquid pre electric shave formulation or shave cream.  </li>
            <li> I was paying good money for what seemed to be a minuscule bottle of baby oil.  </li>
            <li> The razor looks good, but thats about all it does good.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job.</li>
            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> Good battery life between charges.  </li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> My husband, who has used electric razors for years, absolutely loved this razor.  </li>
            <li> Norelco had been good to me</li>
            <li> like the trimmer option too and used it around the side burns and did a good job</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver.</li>
            <li> Clean up is a awesome.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this razor is how you clean it.</li>
            <li> The merchants who use Amazon to sell their products will give you exceptional service.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is best described as adequate.  </li>
            <li> Received this product quickly and everything was perfect.</li>
            <li> I have never been impressed with those as the screens wear out quickly leading to a lot of cuts and irritation.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product!thanks!&lt;br /&gt;i love it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product!thanks!&lt;br /&gt;i love it!</li>
            <li> Great razor,  Very smooth.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very good &amp; smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I still love it, still get great battery life out of it: I could count the number of times I&#x27;ve charged it probably with one hand.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the 1250, works like a champ.</li>
            <li> I am so very glad that I decided to upgrade to this razor.  </li>
            <li> I would be happy to trade it for the top of the line</li>
            <li> Being able to rinse it in the sink was also welcome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the shaves the 1250x/40</li>
            <li> He is very satisfied with this and says anyone who is on the fence should get it.</li>
            <li> I am happy to provide answers about the shaver and my experience, so feel free to ask any questions you may have!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shave I have ever had and worth every penny (or dollar).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Braun also comes with a neat form fit plastic case and a cleaning brush, thus, making it an ideal travel mate for business trips.</li>

            <li> I am very glad I chose this product over all the others</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I loved this razor when I first got it - best electric</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great razor, but I like the feel of the Arcitec model better.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product, I like it and brought 3 more for family and friends as gift.</li>
            <li> a great combination of a $50 off offer from Amazon and another coupon for $30 off from the manufacturer, it made the decision more</li>
            <li> I am very pleased, and although I cannot speak of the durability quite yet, I believe and hold faith that this razor will continue to give me the convenient, close shave I have been used to for years.</li>
            <li> i was very pleased.</li>
            <li> really nice shaver and good value.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a good razor but didn&#x27;t get the stubble as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Shaver is a good shaver, its nice to shave in shower</li>
            <li> Called customer service, they sent one right away, alright awesome.</li>
            <li> But right now it is excellent.</li>
            <li> Very good; significant improvement in comfort and shaving efficiency.  </li>
            <li> This shaver got top reviews from Consumer Reports and deserves them; its a VERY nice machine.</li>
            <li> For the most part,it does do a good job shaving and is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Well, I was pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li> Notwithstanding excellent customer service, I never received my first package by FedEx.</li>
            <li> i was pretty impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think you can get a better razor around this price range, Try it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> but after my first shave I was really impressed.  </li>
            <li> OK, hello..!?</li>
            <li> The first two times I charged it on a perfectly level granite counter, it fell off.</li>
            <li> This shaver without a doubt gives me the best shave that I have ever received from an electric razor, and I look forward to many, many more</li>
            <li> I love this razor!</li>
            <li> The unit comes with excellent instructions that indicate that the shaver should be washed with hot water after each use and that no blotting of the shaver head is allowed for fear of lint getting into the shaver head.</li>
            <li> Love using it in the shower !  </li>
            <li> guy who knows how to use an electric razor will love this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed after just one shave.</li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> I was so glad to see this razor was made in the Netherlands!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a good shave and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Has a built in trimmer, very nice and easy to use.       </li>
            <li> I returned the Razor to Amazon after 3 weeks of use, the return was very easy, was very pleased with Amazon&#x27;s customer service.    </li>
            <li> I love this razor, because it is very light but works great.</li>
            <li> He gets a super close shave- almost as good as using a blade!</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li> the difference is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Its a really great shaver and is comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> Amazing shave.</li>
            <li> THE DIFFERENCE IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Amazing razor for the price.</li>
            <li> My face felt amazing.</li>
            <li> Great smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The battery just goes and goes and goes, amazing.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing shaver through and through...</li>
            <li> It is also extremely light weight and not bulky fits great in the hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and comfortable and can give you a great close shave.</li>
            <li> I had bought this while it was on sale and being that it was reasonably priced, it was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller for the great product!</li>
            <li> I have completed the 21 day test and am thrilled.</li>
            <li> Got my Grandson the Philips Norelco 1250x/40 Shaver from Amazon for Christmas, and he&#x27;s thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice looking and it shaves well.  </li>
            <li> after reading so many good things about it</li>
            <li> This shaver works awesome, putting this shaver to maximum pressure having to shave a complete head at once it shows how good</li>
            <li> ... nice.</li>
            <li> The best part about the razor though, is how easy it is to clean.  </li>
            <li> My brother had a Norelco and I tried it and liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> This Product is wonderfull in what it means packaging, materials, and shape, but my boyfried isn&#x60;t so thrilled about the way it shaves...</li>
            <li> Nice shaver while it worked.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for more than 6 months now, I found that quality of the shave is not as good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for years, and this is a nice one.</li>
            <li> The electric shave rolls the skin up and forces the hairs into the blade, which then slices it off nicely without any pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One nice feature I have noticed about the Phillips/Norelco shavers is that none of them have ever grabbed or pulled the hair on my face.</li>
            <li> This one is their top of the line rotary shaver, so I figured it would be a good test.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I received it.  </li>
            <li> Excellent razor and very amazed by its quality shave.  </li>
            <li> it might make a nice decoration in a fish tank or as a paper weight.</li>
            <li> Once you are comfortable with the pattern you get the best smooth close shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m commenting on my own review to update somethings about the razor.</li>
            <li> Well in my defense, I am sure the razors 10 years ago were not as good as this one.</li>
            <li> / whistles would be nice</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for just a month now and really loving the results.  </li>
            <li> The pros are that it gives a nice looking shave on my face.</li>
            <li> Time for an upgrade and liked the reviews I had read about the Senso Touch, so I purchased one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice razor, no question.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice razor, as I said, but if I had it to do over again I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it.  </li>
            <li> It works and it does a nice job of it.</li>
            <li> I think this was almost top of the line when I bought it, and I got a good promotional price.  </li>
            <li> It gives him a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> nice design.</li>
            <li> I just upgraded to the senso touch and am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;ve really got to give razors a shot and see which one works best for you.  </li>
            <li> I was using a norelco 8160xl which I liked.</li>
            <li> nice otherwise...</li>
            <li> It was a very close shave and the best part</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would be nice if they mention that this info is not for this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I asked how can Norelco not have there own product in stock.</li>
            <li> A case is provided for the shaver which would be handy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t beat the price - thanks Phillips great product!!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-looks nice, and battery lasts me about a week without charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lock which is nice for packing it away</li>
            <li> he used his dads now has his own and is happywith it</li>
            <li> Cute and looks good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Norelco did do a fine job of designing the stand in a manner that the shaver will slide through a hole in the bottom of the stand and be cradled very nicely.</li>
            <li> I very rarely give reviews on products unless they leave a great impression on me.  </li>
            <li> Its really easy to clean too so to some up, I Love It!!!</li>
            <li> The Norelco power indicator is very nice, an it is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice looking, smooth electric razor.</li>
            <li> It has good battery life and gives a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful shavor.my friend love it very much.</li>
            <li> The 3D senso touch is awesome, quick, easy to clean, provides a great shave.</li>
            <li> After having a noisy Braun shaver that shed all the hairs to the floor or bathroom sink, it was very refreshing to have a quieter shaver that held the hairs more effectively than the Braun.</li>
            <li> My first experienced was surprising.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for more than a month now and am very satisfied with it and the shave it gives.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is very powerful, and quick -- took about 2.5 minutes to get a perfect shave, and that&#x27;s even around the edges of my beard.  </li>
            <li> I then run the opened up triplehead unit under the running very warm water from the showerhead to throughly clean out the cut hair and shaving cream holder as well as the rotary razors.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, the shave was very nice and clean.</li>
            <li> This seller is excellent, and the products are brand new.  </li>
            <li> I was considering the purchase of a new razor when I saw a consumer review on the evening news where they rated this razor the best of the group they tested.  </li>
            <li> only good thing about these philips-norelco razors is they give a really excellent shave..</li>
            <li> Received the product quickly and for a great price.  </li>
            <li> Grab design is good, and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> the next best thing or as good as shaving with a disposable razor, thinking about getting another one for my vehicle</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I never have a razor cut and it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to torch your skin with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very easy to hold with the contour</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, clean-up is always very easy.</li>
            <li> It recharges very easy, although if I traveled I may not like the charging stand</li>
            <li> is very easy.</li>
            <li> He tried it out and from the first day he loved it!</li>
            <li> The shave was equally as impressive and easy as the first shave.</li>
            <li> I am retired and did not shave every day but this razor has gotten better and better and now gives an exceptional shave</li>
            <li> This shaver is very light weight, easy to grip &amp; feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> As a Norelco user for years this is by far the best razor.  </li>
            <li> This model is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this so far.</li>
            <li> Among the 7 or 8 razors I&#x27;ve tried out this year, the Norelco 1250 is by far the best for how close of a shave it gives me.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic cleaning station is OK, but is louder, takes longer, and the water-based cleaning solution is not as effective.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best of the lot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice to be able to rinse it out after using.</li>
            <li> It arrived a day early in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> It has a good heft in your hands and will feel comfortable when you are shaving your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> but by far, this is the best Norelco I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Norelco I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature that your wife will love, is that the stubble stays inside the heads.</li>
            <li> it would be best if it was not needed and  one could charge the razor with just the cord as my old Norelco could be.  </li>
            <li> how good my shave is that I ask my girlfriend to feel my face to see how smooth it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors for over 20 years - this, by far, is the best.  </li>
            <li> At this point I am able to use the razor for two or three weeks before charging, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> The SencoTouch is, by far, the best shaver I have used.</li>
            <li> (Quite honestly, I spend at most 1/2 the time shaving with the sensotouch as with the series 7)</li>
            <li> but this is the best  so far.  </li>
            <li> I own this electric razor, but was a die-hard fan of blade shaving most of my life.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this razor suits me perfectly.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also comes with a nice travel pouch and stylish holder/recharging stand.[[ASIN:</li>

            <li> /&gt;This is by far the best technology for electric razors on the market.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> by far this is the best one with its close shave .</li>
            <li> On top of the great product, I got an incredible price... $20 off retail price plus $50 instant coupon for a savings of $70.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money does a great job.</li>
            <li> So far this has been the best electric razor I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Nice shave but look forward to a better experience by continuing to use this SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor  </li>
            <li> Regardless, this is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li> Closeness - Let&#x27;s start with the most popular category.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric rajors for over 20 years and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I thought it was trick before I knew where it was made and liked it even more when I found that out.</li>
            <li> (I shave my head with it too) works great, easy to clean, charges nicely.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> What you have to ask yourself is: will this Norelco shave better than the one I already own?</li>
            <li> &quot; Wow, am I impressed!</li>
            <li> The comfort is like 3 times more with some warm water and foam.</li>
            <li> impressed so far.</li>
            <li> The new razor is great and I am sure I&#x27;ll get many years of great service.</li>
            <li> The Panny works best with a very thin layer of gel-type cream; the 3D works best with a heavier lather (I got good results with Edge).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also happy that I got to use the $30 coupon right on this site</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase and the packaging and delivery were right on target.</li>
            <li> Easy day!  </li>
            <li> It shaves very clean and nice.</li>
            <li> The product information says that the redesigned head is superior but, based on the reviews, I don&#x27;t think so, so I would buy the original if I could, but I cannot.  </li>
            <li> I have had many razors in my life but this is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li> Great razor, easy to clean, keeps a chnage up well.</li>
            <li> It provides a great shave and is so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s fast, glides smoothly and gives a excellent shave.  </li>
            <li> The design is intelligent and the pivoting heads provide a smooth and comfortable experience.  </li>
            <li> The most amazing thing to me is the noise level, or better stated the lack of noise.  </li>
            <li> If you shave against the grain with a blade, a light touch, and good beard prep, you may get closer, but at the cost of considerably more irritation.</li>
            <li> nice razor, replaced my norelco 8850 from 11+yrs of service, this thing has more flexibility to contour the face, does even better in shaving</li>
            <li> As an owner of 3 Norelco razors over the years, this is the most impressive by far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a noble quest for the perfect electric razor after finally giving in and shaving my beard of forty years.</li>
            <li> It is a nice shaver but for price wise I don&#x27;t think it was worth it for him.</li>
            <li> no problem very easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;and have owned many.  </li>
            <li> Very beautiful shaver, exquisite workmanship, the voice is  small than Braun 380s-4, but Braun shave clean than this one.i like it .</li>
            <li> This unit looks cool, the charging stand and battery life is great, it cleans easily.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m generally in a rush every morning, so this razor has been wonderful.  </li>
            <li> This thing worked great for a hot minute, then the battery died.</li>
            <li> Great close shave, easy clean can&#x27;t ask for more</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy to get this razor.</li>
            <li> It gives you a great shave the first time.</li>
            <li> Fine product!</li>

            <li> It gives a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> this one is very very VERY comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It was very smooth with the lotion.</li>

            <li> It is a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Fits very comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Very precise cut.</li>
            <li> He says it is very smooth and that you can&#x27;t feel it when you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li> this is a very important category.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I have learned a very important lesson...</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth and not abrasive at all.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had an incredible deal on this at the first of the year.  </li>
            <li> The razor fits nicely in my hand and is easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> On the plus side is it looks nice, holds a longer charge, and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> trimmer too is super good &amp; efficient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Razor is overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;Charging system and stand is nice, and easy to use.,</li>
            <li> I have experienced no skin irritation while shaving, and the shaver is very easy and quick to clean after shaving.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, easy to use and feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a fine razor, well balanced, nice &#x27;touch.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Is very good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After looking at the makes and models of shavers on display in the stores I shop at, I cruised the internet and did more research on shavers.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Norelco for the design and rebate, and to Amazon.com for the great price opportunity.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this razor</li>
            <li> Unless you plan to use this thing for 5 or more years, and spend 20 minutes each time you want to fully shave your face, you will regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Its simply the best electric razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> But he&#x27;s more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> It works way better, it&#x27;s smoother and cuts closer.</li>
            <li> Holds charge for many shaves.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t be easier or more efficient.</li>
            <li> Also love the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof .</li>
            <li> e had in many years</li>
            <li> So glad I bought it for him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelcos for many years.  </li>
            <li> On the Speed-XL, the lip around the edge of the head housing seems to better setup the hairs for shaving as you move the razor across your skin.  </li>
            <li> Also brings up reliability concerns for how many times the head assembly coupling can be pulled apart and reinserted without wearing out.</li>
            <li> Generally OK for both.  </li>
            <li> If sleek styling is your top priority, go for it.  </li>
            <li> If practicality and shaving are your top priorities, try another razor.</li>
            <li> Which is better: rotary or foil  2.</li>
            <li> Should i buy a low cost product as trial or go for the best option  3.</li>
            <li> The shaving takes time, more than a manual shave.</li>
            <li> I am sure you have read the sales pitch:</li>
            <li> The charging station and remaining power readout are outstanding.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is the included \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; isn&#x27;t the greatest, but I have a beard/trim razor for that functionality anyway, so that doesn&#x27;t affect me.    </li>
            <li> Hope it gets better.    </li>
            <li> plus I still get a closer shave with a top of the line razor cartridge.</li>
            <li> And I love the close shave of these blades.</li>
            <li> The Braun feels the most substantial; the 3D feels the most \\&quot;plasticy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, the 3D did a better job on the neck and jaw line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I reviewed the Alphagel if you want more info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the cleaning station from Braun.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> MORE SHAVING BUMPS (aka ingrown</li>
            <li> Better shaving that</li>
            <li> Better shaving that way.    </li>
            <li> i hope that his face will accomodate with the shaver and will be ok.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I used a Norelco rotary razor.</li>
            <li> It was okay, but the cleaning was a chore.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.     </li>
            <li> This razor provides a nice smooth shave that lasts for days.  </li>
            <li> The instruction manual is entertaining.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I decided to try these out.</li>
            <li> Imagine how many people will greet him today with a horrified look and ask, \\&quot;what happened to your face?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Had a Braum before but this works much better for me.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping that it would be an improvement on my cheaper Braun electric razor that I bought many years ago.</li>
            <li> In my opinion a manual razor does a better job.</li>
            <li> and they all wanted 200 dollars or more.</li>
            <li> All of my family members love touching my face with this shaver - before, my wife would complain that my face would be scratchy unless I used a razor to manually shave close to my skin</li>
            <li> It runs well with water - I was able to use it in the shower and was able to grip the razor without qualms.</li>
            <li> might be a greater burden.</li>
            <li> Compare it to a shaver that costs $75 or $90 dollars, and you&#x27;re still spending $60 more on a shaver.</li>
            <li> My beard is somewhat coarse and this shaver just works best for me this way.</li>
            <li> I was in love with this shaver for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> This was my best affair in shaving ever, but we won&#x27;t be getting back together...</li>
            <li> The shave is very close and feels great.  </li>
            <li> This is the most efficient shaver that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could have done better.</li>
            <li> My son had much better results.  </li>
            <li> The pivoting head on the razor is the best thing about the razor and is a lot better than my son&#x27;s earlier version.</li>
            <li> Electric Razor was the inability of being able to achieve results around my neck and jawline.</li>
            <li> It is the best, lightest and quietest electric shaver that I have used.(I have owned about 8 Norelcos in the last 30 years.)</li>
            <li> No electric shaver is able to cut the hair below the skin like a blade razor.</li>
            <li> If shaving ever irritates your skin you&#x27;re going to love this shaver.</li>
            <li> Make sure it irrigates well while drying out.</li>
            <li> i saw so many review about that.</li>
            <li> However, the Norelco GyroFlex 3D Shaver is a better shaver.  </li>
            <li> Although it takes several weeks to retrain the wiskers, the end result is an excellent shave.  </li>
            <li> more than most people as I also shave my head every morning.  </li>
            <li> If you want the top of the line this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I started shaving in the shower with foam...</li>
            <li> PROS  - best shave of all shavers I&#x27;ve owned, including several Norelcos.</li>
            <li> I use it with water and cream, and it&#x27;s better than shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably not a problem for most users and it didn&#x27;t stop me from giving it five stars.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver, I,ve been using Norelco shavers for many years ,always just wore them out from so much use.</li>
            <li> appealing appearance.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my choice.</li>
            <li> This would make it better  for travel than with its bulky charging stand.  </li>
            <li> His charge lasted about 2 weeks or more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s when I saw the Norelco 1250x/40 rotary shaver and thought I&#x27;d give it a try and see if rotary shavers were any better than foil ones.</li>
            <li> the shaving cream, I was able to shave in just 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually thinking this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> And if they designed it so that it protruded more than it does now, I think more people would have a problem with that.</li>
            <li> But yes, having a corded feature would be much more welcomed.</li>
            <li> and there is one more thing to talk about.</li>
            <li> Shaving cream is a lot better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this shaver for 5 years, and just bought it again for my whiskered twin teenagers.</li>
            <li> The problem of charging still remains, if you are traveling for more than a week you have to bring the charging stand along.  </li>
            <li> I have had many electric razors in my 70+ years</li>
            <li> I have shaved using a fusion razor for many years, I have never been a believer of electric shavers.</li>
            <li> If you had money to spend and had to pick one I like the rotary razor in Norelco(Braun is a lot more in cost).  </li>
            <li> 5/15/2011 - Still love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Keep a cheap disposable razor handy to touch up your sideburns.    </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love it for the shave and rue the day you met the built-in trimmer.</li>
            <li> With my receipt, he was able to promptly get a replacement.</li>
            <li> He is pleased with the product .    </li>
            <li> I can shave my entire face and neck in 45 seconds and get the best shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Had Norelco razors for many years and decided to try a foil electric a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better at getting stray longer hairs in areas</li>
            <li> A manual razor against the grain will provide the closest shave, but also the most discomfort.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco also doesn&#x27;t spill as many clippings while you are shaving, but still can spill some.  </li>
            <li> So if this is the best overall shaver I have used, why just 3 stars?  </li>
            <li> B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]I love my phillips shaver</li>
            <li> The sleek style had me thinking this razor would be mostly form over function</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s refreshing to see quality craftsmanship.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I opted for the \\&quot;bare-bones\\&quot; model as my counter space is sparce</li>
            <li> This razor must be cleaned more often.  </li>
            <li> I am now able to shave on the go, and I no longer have the shaving irritation as I had before.  </li>
            <li> and I think this one is better.  </li>
            <li> I checked out the Wahl offerings that are supposed to be much better for bumps, but decided not to go that route.  </li>
            <li> However, it does a much better job.  </li>
            <li> It does get better with time.</li>
            <li> The more you use it the better.</li>
            <li> I am sure it&#x27;s because I still need to wait the 21 day period.   </li>
            <li> Worlds going to end this year :)</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that i can get out the shower, slap some shaving cream on and shave with the razor.</li>
            <li> but this gets most of them, not all but most.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with razor burn for many years</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d never be able to get a &#x27;close&#x27; shave without the penalty of razor burns.</li>
            <li> I am sure as I continue using this razor</li>
            <li> I have always used Norelco razors and usually love them.  </li>
            <li> ok, i meter the charger and its producing about 16 VDC as required..</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO, i suppose the point here is this thing about the battery not being able to take being in the charger..</li>
            <li> so I started researching the top electric shavers.</li>
            <li> After getting the braun home I was in love with its build quality.</li>
            <li> After a week of shaving I had got better with controlling the razor but shaving took quite a while</li>
            <li> I went out and bought the Norelco sensotouch 3d to compare and the results are interesting.</li>
            <li> Just love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s more, there is virtually no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I love reading product reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have used an electric razor exclusively for many years, and have tried many.  </li>
            <li> And I love the way the trimmer slides out with the push of a lever.  </li>
            <li> There are much better choices then this.</li>
            <li> To put a number, I think it&#x27;s about 30-40% better in this regard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> The wiz kids at Philips need to take physics 101 and learn a bit more about something called gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to go back to a rotary style and I am very happy I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric razors for many years.</li>
            <li> I now use my electric razor more than my safety razor.  </li>
            <li> I thought that was OK.</li>
            <li> I really love this razor.</li>
            <li> You will feel it bite the stubble and remove it; I achieve better results without a mirror because I concentrate on the feel.</li>
            <li> They keep getting better.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and most times its for two weeks or more.  </li>
            <li> My recommendation is BUY this razor and put up with the charger until they make a more compact or travel charger.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to and more.</li>
            <li> OK... I have used Norelco Shavers for years...</li>
            <li> glad I waited) and shaved with it this morning...</li>
            <li> thanks Norelco for another great shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> Perfect to shave short beards.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> If you have the money, buy the best - no need to skimp on a daily thing like this.  </li>
            <li> This one seems to require use of a pre-shave more than the others have.  </li>
            <li> Not as close as a shave with a razor, but more convenient.</li>
            <li> The trimmer on the brauns is much better than this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this overall.  </li>
            <li> I feel for it after a couple shaves and love it.</li>
            <li> I will say this is the Best Norelco I have owned in the last 48 years of using Norelco!!!!</li>
            <li> If you buy be sure to use a pre shave product, like Lectric Shave, to halo lubricate your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used many electric shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Second electric, and the best shave I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my friend and he thought it was cute and better than any shaver that he used before.</li>
            <li> I currently own four norelco razors, all of which are readily available for convenient use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that this is the one I use the most which speaks for itself.  </li>
            <li> Philips could’ve done a better job with the charger.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best razor I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> My husband has shaved his head for more than 45 years.  </li>
            <li> For many years now he has been using the Norelco 7310XL.  </li>
            <li> look and feel, looks stylish</li>
            <li> than most electric shavers&lt;br /&gt;*Quiet</li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t do any better job of shaving than my cheaper one I had for many years(20</li>
            <li> /&gt;Caution it doesn&#x27;t work on a stubble more than 3 to 5 days old.&lt;br</li>
            <li> too many passes on my neckline with this razor.</li>
            <li> You can pass over your stubble multiple times, almost nothing best shaved.</li>
            <li> The precision trimmer on the backside works okay, but it makes no sense to buy something</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> And I had to figure out 1) which pre-shave to use and 2) which aftershave lotion worked best, and 3) how to use an electric shaver, especially which directions to shave and</li>
            <li> With a manual razor, I couldn&#x27;t shave more than once in 24 hours, and I always skipped a day whenever I could.</li>
            <li> No charging stand or cord is needed unless gone for more than about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> To speed the drying of the skin and beard, many men use an alcohol-based pre-shave lotion.</li>
            <li> Alcohol works for most guys, but my face didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with Norelco electric shavers forever, more than 50 years.  </li>
            <li> what more could I ask for.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I upgraded.</li>
            <li> The electric shaver in question excels in most of these areas:    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving with a Gillet Fusion straigh razor, it irritated my neck area more than any of the electric razors.    </li>
            <li> The head seems to countor to my face better than the LA-93K but from a performance stand point</li>
            <li> I tried the shaver with shaving lotion, worked great, glided and really seemed to limit the irriation.  </li>
            <li> I would rate it slightly better than my XL, It runs quite and gives a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Or even better...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li> This razor is fabulous!</li>
            <li> and I check reviews to get the highest rated each time.&lt;br /&gt;Tried the latest Braun, Panasonic</li>
            <li> It does not require more than a couple of passes over each area for a close shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> shave is okay</li>
            <li> Really pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the expense because of its superior performance</li>
            <li> The Panasonic top of the line shaver was much better</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and I was not at all pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> , I tried the top of the line Remington and Braun electric razors, and now the Norelco Sensotouch 3 D.</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad I did.     </li>
            <li> It also gives a much better shave.</li>
            <li> I leant it to my dad to try and now he wants to buy one lol.</li>
            <li> Got this one yesterday and love it..</li>
            <li> Have had many year of experience with the Norelco brand shavers and have been satisfied with their peformance.</li>
            <li> Though this really shouldn&#x27;t matter, this has to be one of the most attractive shavers Norelco has ever designed.</li>
            <li> My dad said it was mostly plastic and not metal.  </li>
            <li> He says it is better but thinks these razors are not the quality they were years ago.</li>
            <li> I decided to go ahead and get the top of the line 3D shaver and give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It has been many years since i used a philishave.</li>
            <li> If I follow the advise and toss my SensoTouch 3D in the bag including charger I still wont be able to charge it since their is no way to plug the charger into the razor.</li>
            <li> I would sure suggest any one to try 3D one.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace an aging Norelco Speed 8150XL shaver that I&#x27;ve had for many years now.  </li>
            <li> the replacements heads cost 169.00 + shipping, more than I paid for the razor itself...</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase for it does what is intended - give a terrific shave.</li>
            <li> I alway purchase the top model.</li>
            <li> So I purchased the 1250x 3d model because they said it did a better job on the neck hairs.  </li>
            <li> Philips rotary head shaver and decided I wanted the more flexible</li>
            <li> I tried it with shaving cream and it was interesting</li>
            <li> but I cannot say it was any better</li>
            <li> glad</li>
            <li> If you like the stubble look this is for you,or if your a female perfect for your legs.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> I found the three top of the line electric shavers - Braun Series 7, Panasonic es-la63, and Phillips Norelco 3D -  to be so similar as to recommend any of them as excellent shavers, but each has its strengths and weaknesses.</li>
            <li> Still, a sleeping spouse nearby will appreciate you using the Norelco most.    </li>
            <li> He claims of all the shavers he&#x27;s bought, this one is his favorite.</li>
            <li> That being said, I think that most $50 electric shavers will provide a better shave than this fancy GyroFlex gimmick.</li>
            <li> but it the latest thing Norelco has to offer.</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best, sleek design, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is an excellent shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The separate floating blades seem to make it work better and easier than the locked in blades found on most electric razors.</li>
            <li> Could not have asked for a better experience with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The shave is inadequate in many ways.</li>
            <li> areas did require more than one pass</li>
            <li> I am buying one for myself soon too :)</li>
            <li> But that is what I love about it...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> but I felt I got a better shave with the 2d</li>
            <li> After four days I couldn&#x27;t take it any more and returned the machine.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco for many, many years.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Philips Norelco 1250 for about 2 months and have been pleased with the quality and closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for 1 and 1/2 months and love it.</li>
            <li> I used a braun for 8 years and was satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was so glad I did my homework.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you would be pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want or need the self-cleaning model which adds more cost and accessories.</li>
            <li> Shaves nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The most I hoped for was perhaps a suggestion of things I could try that would fix the problem.  </li>
            <li> I just need to be more carefull.</li>
            <li> So why is it better?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ideally I would love a shaver that didn&#x27;t shave so close to the skin level and had a feature that could change how close you&#x27;d like to shave.</li>
            <li> I did not have the best experience on my second call.</li>
            <li> These shavers are much more of a precision instrument,which rewards you with a wonderful shave,if properly maintained.</li>
            <li> could) say this about any razor, but I truly love this Norelco 1250x.  </li>
            <li> 2 models up you get about 20% more battery life which is not a substantial difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many of the $40 to $60 Norelco shavers over the years, and they&#x27;ve always gotten the job done.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the ArciTec model i had.</li>
            <li> Most of them have been Phillips Norelco, None of them shave as well as a blade type shaver.  </li>
            <li> This razor is unquestionably the most efficient electric razor that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> and I have owned many of them.</li>
            <li> The floating heads follow the contours of my face better than any shaver I&#x27;ve had before (about 6 of them over 40 years).</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I mostly shaved with it</li>
            <li> For upwards of $200, I would expect more from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> unplugged my SensoTouch and stored it safely into my bottom drawer for hibernation.</li>
            <li> they all love it as well.</li>
            <li> Made a mistake that I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;After ordering so many electronic shavers I reached conclusion that nothing beats Gillette.</li>
            <li> Wish I could say it was just the blades dulling out and not being able to find replacement blades.</li>
            <li> And in that regard, it&#x27;s top notch.</li>
            <li> better than a blade.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about a month now, and really love it.</li>
            <li> It would have given the razor more portability.</li>
            <li> The most gental and smoothest shave from an electric</li>
            <li> This razor is so much better than its predecessors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is amazingly quite and it feels really smooth on my face when I shave.  </li>
            <li> He never complains about shaving any more.</li>
            <li> I love the moving heads that help catch all the hairs on your chin, neck and under the chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shaved in the shower, so I did not expect much more for an electronic I exposed to the water about 500 times.</li>
            <li> Top Rated</li>
            <li> its great and does a wonderfull job shave very closely as goor as razor blad and no skin aerations .&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I Have used Norelco Razor&#x27;s for over 35 years bought this one to replace one I have owned for more than 10 years</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t quibble over this, act to get one today, this razor is truly outstanding.</li>
            <li> I recommended to many of my friends to buy it.</li>
            <li> Uses is most of the time.</li>
            <li> I used it about once a week, used a blade razor most of the time.</li>
            <li> AS IT&#x27;S JUST OKAY.  </li>
            <li> (I was looking for more of a beard trimmer, which this is not).</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit is very easy to clean and the display makes it very easy to tell what the battery level is.  </li>
            <li> Shaves great, easy to hold, easy to clean and has a pretty good charge time.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth yet powerful shaving!!</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a more comfortable shave than the older models and it has very good battery life before it needs to be recharged.  </li>
            <li> Gets a very close smooth shave!!!</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer works fine and the unit itself is very easy to hold while in operation.</li>
            <li> The product is very nice, and the express is so fast.</li>
            <li> You get wonderful clean and soft skin.</li>
            <li> I know it costs more, but it&#x27;s so SO worth it!!</li>
            <li> It makes for a very close, comfortable shave, is easy to clean, has great battery life, and is fairly compact.</li>
            <li> Being able to wash them out with water is good, but it requires HOT water.  </li>
            <li> particular model is a great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I paid a little more because this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> give it 5 stars but the high price keeps me from doing so.......even though it&#x27;s a great shaver I do think it&#x27;s overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this shaver, you will be happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was trying to make the switch because I liked the idea of being able to shave on the way to work, but this razor doesn&#x27;t do an adequate job.</li>
            <li> Bought this product, I began to use it, use them very smoothly, very clean shaving, I will come to choose this product.</li>
            <li> The feel of the razor in the hand is very comfortable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> And one more thing, it is so easy to clean, just rinse it under warm tap water</li>
            <li> The Sensotouch is pretty good.</li>
            <li> If you are willing to spend the money, any one of these would be a good choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are willing to spend the money, any one of these would be a good choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> understand that it can take time (2-4 weeks) for an Electric Razor to start showing good results and I was expecting a crappy first shave.</li>
            <li> This was also the first Norelco shaver that provided good results from day one.</li>
            <li> This norelco works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I got a pretty good deal with my Amazon Rewards cash.</li>
            <li> life is pretty good on this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit&#x27;s battery is of good quality, and the unit itself feels pretty</li>
            <li> Far and away the best part of the experience is the ability to easily shave my neck, which gets as full a beard as my face.  </li>
            <li> Is very nice, comfortable, International brands,Cheap,  good value,&lt;br /&gt;Is very nice, comfortable, International brands,Cheap,  good value,&lt;br /&gt;Is very nice, comfortable, International brands,Cheap,  good value,</li>
            <li> looks so cool to me! :)</li>
            <li> Gets a pretty great shave on the cheeks and mustache, except for right at the jaw line, it takes more effort and often there is more stubble there,</li>
            <li> with the lower-end single-head Norelcos, it&#x27;s easy to dab a towel after washing to get most of the water and facilitate drying.  </li>
            <li> The package is ok, The speed is very quickly</li>
            <li> I love that it has an easy grip too.</li>
            <li> The whole head moves around which is good for your wrist but again is more of a \\&quot;gimmick\\&quot; than anything</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fantastic thing about this razor is that it has a voltage function that allows you to convert from 110 to 240 volts AC which is perfect for international travels.</li>
            <li> Better shave, quieter, and definitely more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great shave, fast, comfortable,</li>
            <li> Its very easy to clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;Manual cleaning - both the Panasonic and 3D are very easy to clean manually.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to clean under the tap by flipping up the three heads, then shake the water out and put it on the charger.     </li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s does the job (eventually), and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The razor is very easy to clean by rinsing in the sink after each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Smooth close shave, very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine most of the time</li>
            <li> I have always prided myself with a close clean shave,but do not want the fuss of shaving with a blade!</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, better than the other 7000 or 8000 philips series shavers I had.  </li>
            <li> Very nice on phone but replacement handles are backordered without a projected date for manufacturing new ones.  </li>
            <li> Gave me a nice smooth and clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Norelcos are quiet to begin with but this unit is exceptional and the shave was superior to any electric that I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Overall it is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> Plus it looks pretty sleek and sexy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a purely functional point of view; you can depend on this razor to give you a brilliant, comfortable shave, every time.</li>
            <li> The shave is as good as any Norelco shaver, but it is much easier to clean and maintain!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit is very comfortable in the hand, light and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> The one benefit of the top model that I do miss is the accurate display of remaining shaves.</li>
            <li> It has not been better than a cheap plastic disposable.</li>
            <li> But remember if its an important occasion you may be better off using the manual blades</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall feel - for me, the Braun feels the most comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Not horrible, but not all that comfortable</li>
            <li> The 3D does a pretty good job, but my face does not feel as smooth as with the others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very happy with that outcome even though I hadn&#x27;t expected it.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with that outcome even though I hadn&#x27;t expected it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to many smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> This will give the closest &amp; most comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> It is the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  </li>
            <li> I have primarily shaved with a safety razor for most of my life.</li>
            <li> My face was noticeably smoother, and I was happy for the $150 or so that I paid for it so far.  </li>
            <li> AWESOME money well spent</li>
            <li> Since there are already many detailed reviews, this one will focus on performance and value.  </li>
            <li> The ability to shave wet makes this my best shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Compared to my Arcitec it gives a quieter and more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The replacement cutters are also more easily available than those for the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get something that provided a smoother, more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> So many of their models have two toned designs that just look cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had the shaver two weeks and am convinced there is nothing better available.</li>
            <li> No instructions, and, most important, no charging stand or cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I find it is the closest most comfortable alternative in electric</li>
            <li> The shave was more comfortable for me than the LA-93K but not drastically differet.    </li>
            <li> This razor is quieter &amp; more comfortable than my Norelco 7775X.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the razor features a worldwide voltage function that adjusts automatically from 100 volts to 240 volts AC, making the SensoTouch 3D ideal for international travel\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> On top of that from day one it has been comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The wet-shaving Panasonic and Norelco are the most comfortable of all if you want to put up with the oil/gel prep and clean-up time.    </li>
            <li> My cheap Norelco razor for $39.95 has a much better clipping device than this pricy 1250x/40.  </li>
            <li> important - get the most out of your</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable and close shaving electric razor that I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I started using an electric razor about 15 years ago when I had decided that it was a more civilized way to shave.  </li>
            <li> Lifelong Norelco user -- SensoTouch 3D provides THE best Norelco shave I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li> and it was the most smooth shaving experience I&#x27;d ever had.  </li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s light and cute.</li>
            <li> : do you have to spend this much to get a good shave from an electric shaver?</li>
            <li> He says its EXTREMELY comfortable when used with the appropriate electric shaving gel and feels much more comfortable about shaving now.</li>
            <li> I think if you shave your whole face this will be a good shaver still.</li>
            <li> the trimmers not to good, but you dont really need it.  </li>
            <li> has good battery life, and recharges fast....</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, the travel case is something good to have.</li>
            <li> Really does a good job and so easy to clean!</li>
            <li> There were a couple of minor, but very nice touches that I really liked.</li>
            <li> can honestly say this latest shaver is a positive continuation in Norelco product development .</li>
            <li> It cuts soft and is a very very nice gift.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with how quick (very important to me - no need to go over a spot a hundred times; no stray hairs), comfortable, and close the shave was.  </li>
            <li> I get why they did it that way, just not the most user friendly for travel.</li>
            <li> but it looks cool!   </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love the series 7, thats why I bought it first; but in the end, for the money, the Norelco sensotouch 3d does win out.</li>
            <li> Light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a long time , nice charger stand.&lt;br /&gt;Shaver holds a great charge I have been keeping track</li>
            <li> I do recommend the 3D model due to its movement in 3 planes, which results in excellent conformation to the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> It needed to be replaced a full 7 months before the supposed life of the head!</li>
            <li> AT FULL PRICE !</li>
            <li> When I read the other reviews on this shaver I figured it had to be great!</li>
            <li> Not bad!</li>
            <li> To see the charge level indicator, you have to look fast when you turn the shaver off, and not in a bright light.</li>
            <li> And I love the water clean</li>
            <li> Sleek design making it easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> Easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy as well.  </li>
            <li> All you have to do is lift the head and the hairs are easy to retrieve.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Charging is very quick, but you must use the charger stand, no corded shaving capabilities with this.  </li>

            <li> There are still some areas that just don&#x27;t get shaved easily.</li>
            <li> I also like being able to clean with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> there were no nicks, no misses and the shaver cleaned easily.  </li>
            <li> Does anyone have any ideas regarding an easy fix?</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Cleaning and charging are easy tasks.  </li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S EASY TO CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li> I like the easy water cleanout of the heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important, It is so cheap, it is priced  385-626 U.S. dollars in China.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily with water.</li>
            <li> main problem I had with my Braun series 5 foil shaver was that it took about 10 to 12 minutes to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> If you can afford it, I would strongly suggest this shaver.</li>
            <li> I replaced the head after a year and then after 2 years then I guess the motor slowed or the battery wasn&#x27;t as strong</li>
            <li> It is a fairly high quality shaver that gives me a good shave.</li>
            <li> good shaver, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Norelco SensoTouch 3D to anyone looking for a good razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the high quality shave, and the good service</li>
            <li> the most important is you will get a perfect shave even the little stubble will be shaved</li>
            <li> If the heads are getting warm or hot, you&#x27;re pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> If the heads are getting warm or hot, you&#x27;re pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> You almost aren&#x27;t sure if it is running at full speed</li>
            <li> Do not pay full price for this razor, there are better ones out there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i love it.&lt;br /&gt;it can work 2week that you charge it full once</li>
            <li> The Braun was not a bad shaver, just nothing better to justify the ongoing costs.</li>
            <li> More importantly the gf approves of the clean shave instead of prickly stubble or ruffian appearance.  </li>
            <li> and it is as good as new.</li>
            <li> It works like a finely engineered machine.</li>
            <li> This item works fine as a shaver.  </li>
            <li> Amazon handled the transaction just fine, it&#x27;s Philips Norelco that is at fault.  </li>
            <li> It was working fine yesterday, and now it won&#x27;t turn on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Once your face adjusts, the 1250x does a fine job, though not as close as a blade, so 4 stars for the shaver</li>
            <li> But this is the first time with 3D electric, which is great - very close to skin.</li>
            <li> once my face and beard became accustomed to it, it worked fine..</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best, smooth, clean shave, easy to use, after a few weeks I can give a better review, but I could not wait to get this out there.</li>
            <li> find the stand and the charging to be fine.</li>
            <li> Portability... Fine and sturdy for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s talc based, which is fine for me.</li>
            <li> For me, CeraVe and Lubriderm work fine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give me a perfect shave but closer to perfection than the others with less irritation.  </li>
            <li> and it does fine without having to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> If I forget to shave the fine hairs were not getting trimmed</li>
            <li> etc then itl work just fine.</li>
            <li> Razor works fine.</li>
            <li> Smooth, never pulls and cleans so easily by just rinsing heads.  </li>
            <li> At home this is fine but to travel it is too bulky.</li>
            <li> The carrying case works fine but will not hold the charging cord so shove the cord in a bag or something you won&#x27;t need it often anyway.</li>
            <li> Shaving is easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Never has one shaved as comfortably, closely and easily as does this.</li>
            <li> The Razor shave the best of all the ones I have had Previously though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are so many contours to a human face and this razor with its exceptional technology is able to meld, fold, bend, curve to make this happen.</li>
            <li> WOW, what a pleasant surprise and experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not shave quite as close as a manual razor but way more than adequate.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy the special cleaner as it is really easy to just clean it with water from the tap.</li>
            <li> Because of the limited charge and need for a charging stand, this might not be the ideal traveling companion for road warriors, but otherwise I would give this shaver my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> Took my chances and bought it, i was quite happy with the product during the first two months, however it started to \\&quot;not turn on\\&quot;, at first i thought it was the batteries, but after 1 or 2 weeks the razon stopped working at all even after a full night charge.  </li>
            <li> Battery  life is great as well,charge quick and the display is clear.</li>
            <li> easy to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I went shopping for a replacement head, and the price was astronomical for the original equipment kind - almost as much as the shaver cost!  </li>
            <li> how it&#x27;s felt when my bf used it but its like a lovely gift on valentine&#x27;s day so far, and im sure that any bf would like it!</li>
            <li> It is light weight, easy to grip, quiet, gives a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the Norelco, it shaves very close, and very quickly.</li>
            <li> If you have a light beard with fine hair</li>
            <li> Thank you VERY much!!</li>
            <li> CS was willing to send me a new one, again, however after pondering it I ending up just going to Target and picking up a NEW one for the peace of mind of it - even though I ended up spending about $40 more, lol!</li>
            <li> Shaver gives a comfortable shave and is easy to clean.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s pivoting head is amazingly comfortable, and it&#x27;s easy to clean...</li>
            <li> this item has been a huge improvement for my father.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to be able to plug the charging cord directly into the razor.</li>
            <li> A month later, I (and my wife) am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall great shaver...</li>
            <li> The battery charge lasts two weeks and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The Gillete just wasn&#x27;t giving me a comfortable shave</li>
            <li> And of course the girlfriend approved, so it was definitely a great purchase, no buyers remorse possible.   </li>
            <li> Faster, closer shave and easy to clean.</li>

            <li> Lower-end models such as the Braun Series 5, the 7000 and 8000 Norelco series and the Panasonic ArcIV are great shavers.</li>

            <li> It was speedy, no chafing, felt smooth when finished.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light weight and slim design.</li>
            <li> Since I got it for 99.99, I would say that it was worth it, though I would hesitate to spend more for it.</li>
            <li> Important note</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and holds a great charge.  </li>
            <li> Smooth face comfort.</li>
            <li> The clean up of the shaver was easy as could be.</li>
            <li> He uses it every day and complain how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> but none have given me the close comfortable shave that this one has.</li>
            <li> It arrived by Fed Ex in just a few days and it works perfectly.  </li>

            <li> After several months of use, he said it is a great razor compared to what he used before.</li>
            <li> It was absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s easily justified IMO.</li>
            <li> If that feature isn&#x27;t that important to you</li>
            <li> Yet it&#x27;s as smooth and comfortable as one could hope for.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> Shaving has never been so smooth and convenient.</li>
            <li> The unit is extremely quiet and of great design.</li>
            <li> I thought my old razor was good</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> (I had to use my old Braun shaver because of its superior trimmer).</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave are fairly close together in my opinion, but the Braun takes a lot more strokes to get the same effect.  </li>
            <li> My 9160 had a good independent head system, but the 3d gyro is better.  </li>
            <li> Particularly, a good choice if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The only real drawback has been the beard trimmer which is subpar at best</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as good as my old razor</li>
            <li> After using a variety of Norelcos since the early 1970&#x27;s, I can state unequivocally that this is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li> So far, good wet/foam shave.  </li>
            <li> Good razer doesn&#x27;t pull hairs like my old one.</li>
            <li> i have to say that this razor is superior in comfort but not too convinced if it provides a better overall shave.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my 85 year old father &amp; he has loved it.  </li>
            <li> It was a good shaver, but I FINALLY couldn&#x27;t find any more shave lotion to go with it.  </li>
            <li> Getting into my 30&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been looking for a real shaving saver since I am growing more hair than ever :)</li>
            <li> it was very good quality and packaged well, it was a present and it arrived right on time</li>
            <li> Having purchased this product just over a year ago, the &amp;#34;replace head&amp;#34; light is flashing, which is fine, but the problem is that the original head is no longer available and have been replaced by &amp;#34;RQ12+&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I see people mentioning the &#x27;give your skin a month to get used to it&#x27; - I had no skin issues moving form the older one to this one, it just works a lot better!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to shave right up to my side burns &amp; mustache without that dreaded \\&quot;ooops\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> That really adds up over the lifetime of this shaver!!!</li>
            <li> First, and I can&#x27;t understand why I have not seen this problem listed before, for any of the SensoTouch models; the stubble does not stay in the shaver!!</li>
            <li> ) Run very warm water from the showhead unto my facial hair for a minute or so.</li>
            <li> very powerful electric razor,just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> Philips quickly sent me out a new shaver as it was under warranty, so good service.  </li>
            <li> and it takes fewer passes through the same area to get a clean shave thus greatly reducing the amount of time it takes to shave.</li>
            <li> It is great on the chin where you will have difficulty with a flat head.</li>
            <li> Might as well enjoy how rich people shave and brush their teeth</li>
            <li> Overall a great shaver that gets the job done right!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user of electric shavers and I&#x27;m happy so far,  </li>
            <li> More importantly it has been a breeze to use,it&#x27;s well made and cleans easily and quickly under hot running water.</li>
            <li> It got my face clean and smooth with just one or two passes.</li>
            <li> with Jet Clean System, Frustration Free Packaging]]</li>
            <li> clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Light and cuts clean, flexible.</li>
            <li> The Phillips/Norelco 1250X40 is a quick and easy shave system.</li>
            <li> It looks cool and easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> , that is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it really is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> It fits the hand easily and shaves quickly.</li>
            <li> This is actually my first time using a electric razor, and i love it so much!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, nice cleean shave.</li>
            <li> I used Phillips before ,then BRAUN and was very happy with both,BRAUN left the cosy sporty shape and new design is too bulky</li>
            <li> The clean up process is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> only good thing about this shaver is the easy cleaning unfolding piece for the razor and the battery</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also super easy to clean (i didnt buy the one with the jet stream cleaning system as 1.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to rinse out &amp; clean too.</li>
            <li> I love the design, the easy cleaning, and the job it does on the rest of my face, but the neck - not so much.</li>
            <li> The pop up heads make it quick and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Good price compared to Australian Retail prices, great delivery time from amazon - only took a week for it to be delivered to Australia.</li>
            <li> Originally, I had a Phillips Norelco 7130 shaver which has 3 heads</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vibration on my original Norelco was like holding a jet engine.</li>
            <li> The original replacement head was the RQ12.</li>
            <li> That being said, as cleaning the razor manually was fairly straightforward</li>
            <li> originally gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> original review follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The original shaver head RQ12 had been replaced by RQ12</li>
            <li> But the razor burn is pretty severe, much more than I get with foil shavers.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips for long time, which I was always happy with philips product.</li>
            <li> As someone who can afford better (yet is pretty thrifty), the SensoTouch 3D does everything I hoped it would</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first electric razor, and I really love it.</li>
            <li> My beard grows in all different directions, and shaving with a manual razor requires more than one pass in different directions to obtain the perfect shave.</li>
            <li> When it came time to replace my latest Lawnboy, I decided to take a closer look at the higher end offerings.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, the shave is close, fast and remarkably smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than the Braun Series 7 - 720S which I tried first but returned.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tug when my scruff is long which is great.</li>
            <li> Philips has a stated 2 year warrantee but customer service said it is from the &amp;#34;date of manufacture&amp;#34; unless you can produce the original receipt, regardless of whether or not you&#x27;ve registered the product online, which I did.  </li>
            <li> this shaver is great on long hair.  </li>
            <li> K - I read the reviews on Amazon as was extremely excited to give the razor a shot.  </li>
            <li> I dropped my original and water shorted it out.  </li>
            <li> As usual excellent service delivered to Australia in a week.</li>
            <li> It has cool lights and electronic light display.</li>
            <li> I used Norelco SmartTouch-XL 9160XL for 5 years and did not feel significant difference between them except that</li>
            <li> I love my first time ever electric razor.. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> I would dare to say that the shave i got was even closer than the kind i normally get from the Gillete Fusion</li>
            <li> You do not get a better razor when you buy the higher end models.  </li>
            <li> First time i paid more than $50 for a norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Wont</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Try it and you will not disappointed</li>
            <li> and I was pretty much satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this razor thus far (over 30</li>
            <li> , I found the original heads on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to get this razor to tug after 3-4 days growth, but it just cuts right thru smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li> I have had 3 and while all were good, was willing to look at much higher price if the performance was right.  </li>
            <li> did try the shaving creme with the shave and it woked alright and being able to us a hot towel was comfortable but doesn&#x27;t make for a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very good, very like, the next opportunity will come to buy!</li>
            <li> The trimmer is also better designed and more effective on the side burns as well as other stay hairs on the ears, etc.   </li>
            <li> I bought two razors are Philips, a 1150 and a 1250.As a New Year gift for my friends, they liked.</li>
            <li> All you have to do to clean</li>
            <li> First let me say this shaver is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Clean up is a breeze.  </li>
            <li> B003V37Z9W Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; just hold it under the faucet and let the water wash it clean.  </li>
            <li> The Braun \\&quot;3\\&quot; series with the \\&quot;clean and renew\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t come close to the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> clean up&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I clean it every two or three shaves.  </li>
            <li> Be prepared to have a disposable just to shape and clean up your sideburns.  </li>
            <li> It literally takes about 20 seconds to clean this after each shave.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s clean.  </li>
            <li> Its great for dry</li>
            <li> The Norelco is quieter and more comfortable as the 63 while shaving my beard much faster.</li>
            <li> far I am more pleased with the Norelco than any shaver I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> so who needs to clean it every time.  </li>
            <li> come on, it takes 2 seconds to manually clean it).  </li>
            <li> to clean.</li>
            <li> The razor provides a clean shave</li>
            <li> and it just does not cut well or give clean lines.</li>
            <li> I like the ease of cleaning - image using water to clean an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I replaced the RQ12 head once and clean it with water every time I use it</li>
            <li> It is well ballanced and a snap to clean.</li>
            <li> short, this is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> ,powerful, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It even shaves cleanly along the beard line without pulling any hairs from the beard.  </li>
            <li> You must clean it after each use.</li>
            <li> Manually, the Norelco is easiest to clean and you can duplicate the auto clean by pouring some of its [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> B002DHVAZW Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution]] in a dish or mug and whirring the shaver in it for 30 seconds after shaving.</li>
            <li> In order to have a clean shave, the Panasonic design needs to you pay attention to where and the movement to shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Can clean by running water over the heads</li>
            <li> if your buying to take on trips or for in the car to clean up before work..date..</li>
            <li> It truly cuts almost as clean as a hand razor.  </li>
            <li> bought this to replace a near top of the line braun and think this is better</li>
            <li> The shave you get is not as smooth a blade can produce, but the cut is good enough to look clean shaven.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make a particularly clean cut for sideburns.</li>
            <li> Must clean each unit separately after every shave as there is no room for cut hair to accumulate.</li>
            <li> get me wrong, I was happy with the older model, but when my family gave me this razor as a gift, I was very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the 3D Senso Touch model, at twice the price of the HS8420, would give at least as good a shave and hopefully superior shave.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco 3D razor gives a good save while not irritating skin much  </li>
            <li> Every product I have purchased has been exactly what I expected and the review systems has always lead me to making intelligent and safe purchases.</li>
            <li> , I have a light beard at best, and it took twice as long to get it knocked out as it does with a 13 year old</li>
            <li> It looks cool, but my old Norelco felt better in my hand, more control.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s replacing my old Phillips Norelco and it does a much better job!</li>
            <li> My shave yesterday was as good as the first shave I had with the device when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> Battery live is pretty good - you can probably get 10+ shaves in before having to re-charge.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a long time to get one of these new philips Norelco and when I was about to order from elsewhere, i found the best deal on amazon and went for it.</li>
            <li> It felt very smooth to the touch, and it was very soothing.  </li>
            <li> Very lightweight and gives a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It does a great job dry and wet is just great.</li>
            <li> I did significant research really trying to find something better than a Norelco.  </li>
            <li> had it for more than a month now, only used it in dry mode but works perfectly..</li>
            <li> my new shaver in about a week, brand new out of the box, works great.</li>
            <li> Arcitec, which had a special price offer, when I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I did this and received an E-Mail saying so and a special code that I could order supplies for my shaver on line for a 10% discount.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t show any place where to enter my special code.  </li>
            <li> Also it leaves alot of hair no matter how many times i go over a certain spot it just doesnt get all the hair.</li>
            <li> bought this one on a special.</li>
            <li> It sure was painless, and easy to fix, should have my new shaver in 7 to 10 business days.</li>
            <li> It gets two stars because it charges quickly and is easy to clean, but it does not give me a clean, easy shave, so it&#x27;s really 1 star of performance and two of convenience.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, particularly compared to the old Norelco it replaced.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to order this razor because I had never had an electric one before and always wanted one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially effective in the hard to shave areas at the interface of my moustache and my nose.</li>
            <li> There is just nothing overly impressive about the build quality that I feel justifies the high price unless you must have the wet shave ability.  </li>
            <li> If you get too aggressive you can get redness, but for normal use this is much more comfortable than blade shaving.  </li>
            <li> Pretty easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is bye far the best razor I have ever used, would not even think about buying one of those $60.00 ones ever again, I just can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to get one,</li>
            <li> basically good, but I wish there was a bigger trimmer</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t give it up for 10 years worth of free power glides or something.</li>
            <li> A overall really good razor.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet and easy to clean up since it allows for rinsing under warm water.</li>
            <li> , they were all good, but when the last one I had started to die, I thought, for some reason, to try out a Braun.  </li>
            <li> Both provided close shaves, with the Panny a bit more gentle than the 3D.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, you have to learn how to use an electric razor properly to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, you have to learn how to use an electric razor properly to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Personally I get a shave that is as good as a blade when I use shaving cream with it.</li>
            <li> so you are always at a full charge when you pick it up.</li>
            <li> virtually full charged 24/7 even after a 10 minute shave.</li>
            <li> However any of the top line shavers made by Panasonic, Braun or Phillips/Norelco will come very close.</li>
            <li> All of these negatives are acceptable to me, since it does give me such a good shave.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bite, pull or irritate and it still gives a clean, quick shave.  </li>
            <li> I must admit the heads are kind of funky on the Norelco, so I am concerned how it will travel, but as far as the shave</li>
            <li> Many thanks,    </li>
            <li> However if you want a really close shave, as I do, you do have to go over your skin one or more times, but this is no problem&lt;</li>
            <li> The Norelco is still not as good as a regular blade razor.</li>
            <li> If you need to shave 1-2 times a day and your super hairy I might recommend the Jet Clean never used it</li>
            <li> The stand is a bit unbalanced, but does not take up a lot of real estate on your counter top either.</li>
            <li> Overall I have found this to be a good product.</li>
            <li> , this product is true winner and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quiet and feels good on the face.  </li>
            <li> but good enough</li>
            <li> I finally got a good razor that will take my fuzz</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have paid full price for it.  </li>
            <li> One of the others is more comfortable to use, but this one does a better job of shaving, especially if I have missed a day or two of shaving.  </li>
            <li> Love this Razer very close to shaving as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> So over the course of my life the shavers have kept me whole and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this shaver, if U can afford it :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true what they say - it may take a couple of weeks for your face to adjust and for you to figure out what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>
            <li> had I paid the full price though.</li>
            <li> Shave seems a bit closer and is much quicker, more efficient.</li>
            <li> and when you need to replace the blades.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not true.</li>
            <li> The style was good for this razor but the shave was inconsistant and we needed to use a regular razor what a disaapointment.</li>
            <li> have used it with foam and it glides really well and maybe does a slightly better job, if not taking a bit</li>
            <li> Pro: The only really good thing about the 1255x is the noise:</li>
            <li> I judged the 1255x could not get as good as the Braun Series 5 with such a test, so I quit.  </li>
            <li> Pros - still sleek and quiet, does a good job on cheeks.</li>
            <li> Looks cool  </li>
            <li> It provides a quick and clean shave.  </li>
            <li> if you are one that needs a very close shave, the razor is better.</li>
            <li> Sensotouch 3d does a good enough job, but if I was going to buy another electric razor</li>
            <li> I am very well satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Gave to my son for Christmas and he can&#x27;t say enough good about the ease and comfort of this razor.</li>
            <li> A full charge does take just about an hour as described in the manual.</li>
            <li> Good present for father&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> I get about 15+ shaves per full charge.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell that the razor is on or maybe I have a really noisy exhaust :)</li>
            <li> I gave this razor a good review initially, but after using it for over a year I have downgraded my rating because it does not work well shaving the hair below my chin.  </li>
            <li> he just lifted the whole top and empty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really has enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Overall, this shaver was a good purchase and exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> had my eye on this model for quite awhile, but just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend so much while not being sure I would even like</li>
            <li> I got this shaver at costco for $115 after mail-in-rebate which is a pretty sweet deal considering that the shaver itself is worth more than that</li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery lasted a full calendar week of use for me, and I also had the trimmer attachment to trim my goatee, which I did once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dry-shave with this unit, and many people are amazed at the hairlength, which is very comparable to blade</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gives a close shave, looks cool</li>
            <li> so not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The beard trimmer part is not bad, either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really as bad as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> This razor is not bad.</li>
            <li> thoughts are this: it&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not for</li>
            <li> Have been using this new electric shaver - Philips Norelco 1250x/40 senso touch for about a month and find it excellent so far, easy to use and easy to clean, do not like the recommended frequent change of blades,feel it is a large added cost factor.</li>
            <li> Ever Very fast shave Cleans easy too</li>
            <li> face ends up much smoother with less work, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It shaves closer, feels   more natural, cleans easily.</li>
            <li> This really seems like a great razor and, from most of the other reviews, it would seem to be.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver Philips makes, the 1290x and other similar model costs more, because of the cleaning station and longer battery life.</li>
            <li> This shaver has a quick 1 hour to full charge feature.</li>
            <li> the charging stand is pretty easy to topple over.</li>
            <li> The detachable head is extremely easy to clean and really does come out clean when you are done, no place for the hairs to hide so to speak  5 Out of 5    </li>
            <li> I have had many electric shavers and always had to resort to the blade razors to make sure it left my face clean.</li>
            <li> The shave feels very smooth and close, maybe not as close as a razor but way more convenient if you shave on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> However after many years &amp; many different shavers I find this to be true.</li>
            <li> After reading all the other great reviews of this shaver, I couldnt wait to get it</li>
            <li> Knowing he would not spend this type of money of himself I went out on a limb and bought it after reading the other great reviews.</li>
            <li> If Philips made the original head available for purchase too (at a reasonable price), then fair enough.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to find the website and very quickly I had selected the live chat option and was explaining my issue with a customer service rep.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I just run it under some hot water and it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, well packed.</li>
            <li> It was quick and painless.</li>
            <li> It is very compact and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Some quick tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some quick tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it irritates my neck even more than a regular razor because I have to go over the area so many times.</li>
            <li> Fast, comfortable, and smooth.  </li>
            <li> he can just rinse by running water after each use, convenient and quick.             </li>
            <li> Of course, electric shavers do not shave as close as a blade and if going out at night, have to give a quick touch-up.</li>
            <li> I got this razor at Walmart for $80+tax because it was on super clearance for some reason</li>
            <li> We got it in the mail quickly</li>
            <li> try it and you will never experience such a delightful shaving experience especially when you use a foam shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Super close, zero irritation.  </li>
            <li> Norelco is as extraordinarily close as the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Purchased phillips norelco before heading to Afghanistan for the second time the razor has held up through the entire deployment and still works great to this day!</li>
            <li> But the Norelco gives a closer, more comfortable shave by far.  </li>
            <li> but you get used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li> This can give you a quick painless shave, or if you stretch you skin and push aggressively, can get you as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> And that for me is the main disadvantage of the razor; while the Advantage 7735X shaves closely, without lotion, and even better with it, without some sort of moisturizer</li>
            <li> Each time I use this, I keep thinking to return it because of the time it takes but the convenience and ability to shave quickly if I want seems to outweigh the negatives.</li>
            <li> I love this because I can use it in so many different ways.  </li>
            <li> Shaving often is not only ok, but is even better with an electric.</li>
            <li> Quick charging, efficient.</li>
            <li> I really like how easy the blades are to clean.  </li>
            <li> I thought that was adequate for a higher-end razer.</li>
            <li> and I think that I&#x27;m now ready to provide an accurate and detailed review.    </li>
            <li> He likes the fact that it can be cleaned under running water, recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> My friend think that it is worthy to recommend to them.</li>
            <li> Shaves super close.  </li>
            <li> Quick charging&lt;br</li>
            <li> I came from about 20 years of using Panasonics and find that the Norelco 1240/50 to be a worthy successor.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Norelco user for years.  </li>
            <li> Charges quickly</li>
            <li> After contemplating, I decide to just go ahead and write a quick description of my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a good shaver - not great, but good.</li>
            <li> I have used norelco razors for many many years and never had any complaints until the last two razors I have Purchased.  </li>
            <li> It handles curves and the soft skin of my neck very easily.  </li>
            <li> I was actually so impressed, I went back onto amazon and purchased the Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro.</li>
            <li> Overall, an amazingly close and comfortable shave, and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> With each time that I have used this razor, the cuts have been consistent and still just as smooth.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;WOW; from the very first shave I was rapt.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t provide reviews for items that I purchase, however this time I am so satisfied with this razor that I will break with that policy.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stylish (so what), easy to clean, shaves like a charm, and is SO QUIET!!!  </li>
            <li> It felt so smooth and really close to a blade shave!</li>
            <li> However, it does do its primary purpose of shaving the face pretty well.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve all lasted a long time and done a good</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco wet shavers for a good 10 years; the last one I bought and am still using is the model HS8420 (probably now obsolete) which gives me a reasonably good shave for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I loved the long ago day when the Wilkinson Sword blades came out.  </li>
            <li> Not so good for long ones.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used norelco, but recently read that foil razors are better for sensitive skin and tried one that was good.  </li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years, most have been good, but not great.</li>
            <li> Now, if the replacement heads are easy to obtain I will certainly have a keeper..</li>
            <li> Simply flip up the heads &amp; run warm water over them &amp; they come completely clean.</li>
            <li> Other positives is that the shaver is very easy to hold with a very light weight.</li>
            <li> He is completely satisfied with this new Norelco 1250X/40 Sense Touch 3D and uses it every day.</li>
            <li> With increasing frequency, these electric shaver companies release a new product, coming up with increasingly enticing words that turn out to be more hype than substance.    </li>
            <li> After reading more reviews on the new electric Norelco rotary shavers I decided to purchase the Philips Norelco triple head 1250x.</li>
            <li> It just took too many passes even after a new blade</li>
            <li> This new 3D series, IS better.</li>
            <li> This new style is much better, it hasn&#x27;t happened yet.</li>
            <li> They shipped me a new handle, now after two more years the unit still runs but will not charge.  </li>
            <li> do I want a better shave, or just a new novelty?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some Cons: the new one cuts just as close but takes more &amp;#34;strokes&amp;#34; over an area to get there, so a shave takes about 25% longer.</li>
            <li> NOW, it seems that Philips Marketing have nothing better to do than to come up with new names for a product that they already shipped.  </li>
            <li> In fact I still use it, after, the new unit to finish many shaves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite, smooth, comfortable, painless and best of all, it really give you a very close shave, even at the hard to get spots.  </li>
            <li> The 3D flex inward/outward blade head is cool and is responsible for the comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Because of this I experienced slight irritation along the neck...</li>
            <li> reviews were good, if not better than the Arcitec, and it was a better price.  </li>
            <li> Foil shavers have been pretty good for me, and the last one I had was the Braun series 5 foil shaver.</li>
            <li> overall a pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li> Loved my first one, second one didn&#x27;t hold up as well</li>
            <li> easy to use and fast charging.</li>
            <li> the Norelco is comparatively quieter; it&#x27;s easier to clean (which becomes even more important when traveling); and it&#x27;s smaller than the Braun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-- Fast, easy, and often...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave the neck and sensitive areas first, while the shaver isn&#x27;t too warm.</li>
            <li> Still cuts really close and is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> new 3D razor is much more comfortable and does the job significantly faster than the older models.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean, easy to charge, holds charge very well and for numerous shaves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how other brand works but the performance of this razor is amazing!</li>
            <li> but I dont really care because of the speed at which you can have a shave with this thing!!</li>
            <li> went and got the whole dame set!!  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver, so i don&#x27;t have a reference to compare with, but I really amazed how good this shaver is, as I have a sensitive skin and this shaver did not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> The last innovative Norelco I had purchased was not as  good as the more conventional one before.</li>
            <li> design is impressive and a complete departure from previous Norelco designs.</li>
            <li> It is super quiet and the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> The 1250x/40 was perfect for me because I shave my face dry, so cleaning isn&#x27;t a big issue.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean and very quiet.</li>
            <li> Clean up is also a snap, just run hot water over the heads.</li>
            <li> Previously bought 1150, very loving husband.</li>
            <li> for this kind of price they should have done the QA to consider this and provide us with either this little collar thing or even better, make it detachable from the stand itself.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only shaved once with it so far, but it was very comfortable and far quieter than the Braun razor I used for many years, and gave me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Shave just a little better then my old Norelco, but not to any great</li>
            <li> Like many have said, you don&#x27;t have to push hard to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a week now and have found it to be the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had other than a fresh new straight razor.  </li>
            <li> But their latest stand folds more flatly than their previous stand, so if that&#x27;s an issue, be sure to get the latest version.</li>
            <li> Very close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I had no razor irritation or burn from using the product, and it really glides smoothly over my face.  </li>
            <li> The heads really pivot to make it fit the contours of your face,</li>
            <li> It seems to glide smoothly over my skin and cuts very close.</li>
            <li> charge is great - give it one hour from a dead charge</li>
            <li> However, I got a very close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> he really like&#x27;s the close and smooth way it cuts his beard.  </li>
            <li> After using this razor for several months, it does offer an amazing shave.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it whole heartedly to anyone one who needs a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t attempted a wet shave with this yet, but I have been very happy with the results of a dry shave as well as the ability to easily clean the unit when done.  </li>
            <li> One of the few shavers I was happy with.  </li>
            <li> The shave is very close, even and comfortable.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that it&#x27;s a bit challenging to accurately shave up to the bottom of my sideburns.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and charges really fast.</li>
            <li> It gives a really close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to cheaper non flex shavers it makes all the difference and the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> The head is very flexible and comfortable.</li>
            <li> it and you will enjoy shaving and hopefully, Philips continue manufacturing the RQ12 replacement head with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Fast, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times now and seems to work great.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use, and the shave was very close.  </li>
            <li> Very quite and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Meets the primary purpose very well, a close shave.</li>
            <li> Battery life is pretty sweet, I&#x27;ve shaved almost once per day since I got it (a month ago)</li>
            <li> And I own everything from a fusion pro glide to a Double Edge Aristocrat.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the $200?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I didnt want to reject the electric shavers on a poor model so decided to buy the best    3.</li>
            <li> The upgrade is worth it.</li>
            <li> Zero redness even in the more sensitive spots (jaw line and neck).</li>
            <li> They actually don&#x27;t need the auto cleaning station (although it is handy for storage for the Panny).</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.be curly, and the hairs would curve under and cause bumps growing under the skin laterally.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This razor is lightweight, fits nice in your hand and is so much quieter than the old one.</li>
            <li> Nice visual aesthetic but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even quieter than my Dad&#x27;s old Sunbeam that he used many years ago.  </li>
            <li> I hoped the expense was worth it to get</li>
            <li> , it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> i think it is really worth it.</li>
            <li> Okay I thought I&#x27;ll give it a couple more tries.  </li>
            <li> I just gave up, so it might have been 20 minutes or more of work just to get it to the point where my old foil shaver could get to.</li>
            <li> Really liked it overall.  </li>
            <li> My old 6826XL remains my favorite, but Norelco no longer makes replacement heads that work well with it.  </li>
            <li> Find a deal, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Wet Shave - Just as good.</li>
            <li> im glad i didnt spend the extra 100 for the bells and whistles of the advanced model.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is much better than the old Norelcos i used to use.</li>
            <li> I could have not been more surprised.</li>
            <li> well worth the extra dollars to own it.  </li>
            <li> well worth the extra dollars to own it.   </li>
            <li> It offers better coverage.</li>
            <li> They are not that rare and you can probably find one in your employee pool.  </li>
            <li> They are not that rare and you can probably find one in your employee pool.  </li>
            <li> And, the more sensitive parts never feel as if they have been \\&quot;sandpapered\\&quot;.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Additionally, the shaver really noiseless which is good especially at morning.</li>
            <li> good, very like, the next opportunity will come to buy!</li>
            <li> fancy looks doesn&#x27;t make it a better shaver than old style ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, that &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; idea where the neck bends in every which way sounds good in theory but has absolutely no benefit whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I have used electric razors most of my adult life to shave.  </li>
            <li> I am not unhappy with my choice.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good but not a whole lot else.</li>
            <li> It does hold a charge for about a week and the trimming blade is useful.</li>
            <li> but i can&#x27;t comment on the durability because i rarely used it.</li>
            <li> Each shave has gotten better, I&#x27;ve used the razor around 10 times so far.    </li>
            <li> Yes, I know it&#x27;s charged for up to 17 days worth of shaving but</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been a Norelco man for many years, wanted this model when it was time to replace his old one.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is somewhat pricey, but to me it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Defiantly worth the price.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they mention you actually also need to take the razor stand with you or you can not charge the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> big difference between senso 2D and 3D really liked it.</li>
            <li> bit price but worth it.</li>
            <li> it shaves without the pulling on the face  and neck but not any better than the old model.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Rarely do I have to go over an area twice</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed about the shaver was the cool battery meter.  </li>
            <li> This razor is smooth on the face and actually cuts most of my whiskers off.</li>
            <li> Got better shave with my old Norelco 9190.</li>
            <li> Alas, nothing is perfect.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was literally losing my hearing from my old Panasonic foil shaver, so sound was my primary concern.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is cordless but a far as a close shave</li>
            <li> You simply pop the shaver heads up on their hinge and run warm water through the heads and the well which collects the whiskers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> They are worth maybe $0.50.  </li>
            <li> Will be a useful appliance.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for in your busy day?</li>
            <li> So Soft make shaving an absolutely enjoyable experience.  </li>
            <li> but I think that it is worth every penny that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> THIS WOULD BE WELL WORTH</li>
            <li> I.ve bought, but worth it,</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t believe it is worth it.</li>
            <li> No electric razor could EVER be as good as a straight razor, but this is a quicker, cleaner alternative for daily shaving before work.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and gives a very smoth shave pluse it is always ready with the recharging stand in place</li>
            <li> Worth every penny?  </li>
            <li> Because of the pivoting heads, it&#x27;s not as good on the detail as my old fixed rotary was.  </li>
            <li> but well worth it if you loathe the irritation from shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lets say you use a high end razor with replaceable cartridges, pick one of the top of the line with 4-5 blades that really shaves super close.    </li>
            <li> Super quiet, a surprisingly smooth, close shave, comfortable and efficient, this product is true winner and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like a display that tells me more clearly how much battery life is remaining, but perhaps the marketing department at Philips Norelco needed a way to disaggregate their product line and charge more on the high end.</li>
            <li> I never spent so much on a razor before, but I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> But one year after purchasing this product I do expect to be able to purchase a replacement head with the same design as the original head.  </li>
            <li> I had some mild discomfort for the first two shaves and none since.  </li>
            <li> Cleans quickly by opening up the petals and rinsing with hot water.  </li>
            <li> the build is very nice, it is not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The good: quiet... long battery life,nice close shave, easy to clean</li>
            <li> (I dump my Braun into the more convenient, connected charger/cleaner whenever I am at home.)&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning - Flip open each of the three heads and clean under running water.  </li>
            <li> It is so superior to any other shaver I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m that person that reads a ton of reviews before I buy something like this, and they were all absolutely right.</li>
            <li> It even shaves right under my nose.</li>
            <li> It was the right decision.</li>
            <li> Google was right.</li>
            <li> any case I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s right by Amazon how they handled this</li>
            <li> It just seems like it is lacking the power to do the job right.</li>
            <li> I knew I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> Look for the $20 coupon being offered by Norelco right now (just saw the ad on TV).</li>
            <li> He charged it right away and used it right away.</li>
            <li> I find that the On/Off switch is positioned right where I hold the razor</li>
            <li> In all fairness the hair on my neck just on the right side never cooperates.</li>
            <li> I just hope it&#x27;s easy to buy a new stand in case the plastic breaks.</li>
            <li> This gives a clean shave all over my face and neck, and the trimmer really works.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco for the past 10+ years and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This Norelco 1250x/40 is much easier to clean by comparison.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also much quieter and easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> It is super quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Quick to charge, easy to clean and gives a terrific shave.</li>
            <li> It shaved pretty good but not real close.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really know how to clean the blades.</li>
            <li> , the only thing that concerned me was the heads were very easy to push inwards.</li>
            <li> First I have to say, the shipping was really fast!!</li>
            <li> When charging the product, my razor emitted a high frequency ringing sound.</li>
            <li> Use dry or in the shower with some Body Wash Gel and smooth as my Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy all over again!!</li>
            <li> Shame on you, Philips Norelco for making a good product, only to abandon it for the new model.</li>
            <li> The new one doesn&#x27;t feel as good in my hand when shaving, a personal preference or course.</li>
            <li> Always like a dummy the grass is greener on the other side of the fence, so surely a more costly razor must certainly work better than the economical throw away Remington razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> My previous Braun did a great job on my face, but it really struggled with my neck.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is even easier to clean than my old Braun which had a noisy cleaning system because even using that you still had to periodically clean it manually.  </li>
            <li> Short hairs were easy to cut, and this razor provided a comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li> it offers a quick and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it offers a quick and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This new one is great, as it provides a thorough shave, is quiet, easy to clean, and shows how much charge you have left.</li>
            <li> Small, light, almost noiseless, a very close shave, easy to clean, versatile in many ways.  </li>
            <li> However its great for traveling especially due to the liquid restrictions on flights</li>
            <li> Charges fast and lasts about a week with a full charge.</li>
            <li> Full marks to the manufacturers for a real state-of-art shaver.  </li>
            <li> The razor not only performed noticeably better than the crappy $8 electric razor I purchased while I was waiting for this razor, but also better than my old Norelco model with the HQ-9 heads.  </li>
            <li> A few of them are really helpful, many of them are just amusing.  </li>
            <li> in built beard trimmer is pretty useful and tucks away, so it is almost forgotten.</li>
            <li> While this was an upgrade from an electric shaver I&#x27;ve used for the past 10+ years, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Since I have had a great experience in the past, I was eager to continue with the Philips brand.  </li>
            <li> Now it is so much smoother than my old razor and still - doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all! :)</li>
            <li> but it certainly does not shave as closely or as quickly as a razor.</li>
            <li> A light tap with a finger is enough to send finely chopped hair all over your pants when I am not shaving under a sink - which is often.  </li>
            <li> , good job Philips, I got 2, never let me down.</li>
            <li> You *cannot* directly plug the charger into the shaver, meaning if you want to be able to charge it while traveling, plan on packing the large charging stand too.  </li>
            <li> It works better than my old Norelco smart touch XL.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having as a reference the electric shaver of my grandfather and my dad, I was impressed by how little noise this unit makes, it is really quiet.  </li>
            <li> Like many of these products, you will / should replace the blades maybe once a year or little longer, to keep it performing top notch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of wet shaving, but both of these do a very good job.</li>
            <li> One more thing to have to make sure you have when you travel, and the quality of the docking station material (light plastic) would seem to guarantee that it won&#x27;t last as long as the razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean look at the thing... its beautiful....</li>
            <li> My face and head are nice and smooth and it was extremely convenient not having to lotion-up my whole head and rinse the shaver heads every 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Before this, I owned a Philips Norelco Smart Touch XL that lasted over 6 years!</li>
            <li> A standard razorhead could do the job much faster and effectively.  </li>
            <li> Since I never bought a foil shaver, i still dont know which is bettwe, but sometimes I think the straight movement against the grain would be better and far quicker    </li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin that is easily irritated by shaving, you will appreciate any of the Phillips/Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li> Quietly does it&#x27;s job, easy to clean and shaves so close.  </li>
            <li> Which is surprising since it requires so much less pressure than the Braun did.  </li>
            <li> I use this razor daily, overall I&#x27;m happy with it with some limitations.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it irritates easily</li>
            <li> The manual is complete and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> The vendor and delivery were super fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> This shaver is absolutely superior to my previous Norelco in terms of closeness and efficiency, design and ergonomics.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I had a previous Norelco which is preatty good, but decided to upgrade.</li>
            <li> After using for several months, the razor does not cut as good as my 6 yr old razor.</li>
            <li> I convinced my wife into letting me spend some extra cash on a really good razor as it was that my old one was nicking my face.</li>
            <li> The SensoTouch is much quieter which is nice; especially when getting close to my ear</li>
            <li> The ease of cleaning is also excellent; I simply open the heads and run the shower on them for a few seconds, cleaning everything, after I&#x27;m finished</li>
            <li> Sleek design  *longer battery life than previous generations, good for travel  </li>
            <li> As a precision trimmer it works OK, but I much prefer the old trimmer size and pop-out method.</li>
            <li> I can say that I am not impressed because for this money you kind expecting good quality.</li>
            <li> My previous Norelco looked like this one, but didn&#x27;t give as good a shave.  </li>
            <li> The 1250x/40 worked well and was easy to clean - until it stopped working after only 2 years!</li>
            <li> After getting used to the features of the shaver, I&#x27;ve found it provides a close shave, is exceptionally quiet, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Quiet, easy to clean and holds the charge well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the shaver can only be charged with the stand which is big and clunky making not so great for traveling</li>
            <li> It is not as good as my multiple year old Norelco 8240XL</li>
            <li> The 3D feature is comfortable and the three heads really cover a lot of ground and make my shaves fast.</li>
            <li> This new model is outstanding in performance and value and is highly recommended by this user.</li>
            <li> the older models actually are better in my book and cheaper!</li>
            <li> He loves it and highly recommends it for a clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li> Several days after this review, I&#x27;ve been getting better and better at shaving with this shaver as I learn which parts of my face require a little more care.</li>
            <li> That is not something I could have done with a blade....  and considering how easy it is to clean after use, by simply running it under hot water?  </li>
            <li> the product is of excellent quality, meets my expectations and is exactly what you expected, widely recommended this product.</li>
            <li> They were super sharp and gave a superb shave, didn&#x27;t pull or hurt your face and didn&#x27;t slice your skin like the old double edge blades.  </li>
            <li> That last bit was sarcasm, since nobody needs an LCD battery meter and can clean their razor just fine with 10 seconds of running waster.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive and get razor burn pretty easy.</li>
            <li> he like it very much.</li>
            <li> Very fast shave in just 3 minutes, with shaving</li>
            <li> to a massive imbalance when sitting on the stand, the stand uses 3 suction cups to hold it to whatever (very smooth) surface it&#x27;s sitting on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the shaver shaves very, very well.  </li>
            <li> i like it very much.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very fast and quiet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also it charges very fast.</li>
            <li> When I purchased it though I didn&#x27;t realize I was getting a model that did not have a self cleaning system which I like very much.</li>
            <li> So far, the batteries are behaving fine.  </li>
            <li> I tried using light pressure and many other things, but nothing helped stop the razor burn.</li>
            <li> The downside is that, with the irregular head shape and recommended circular strokes, it takes a little longer to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Quickly and easily shave all my facial hair off.</li>
            <li> Good, close, and consistent shave in little time.  </li>
            <li> The razor works very well for me and cleans up easily since heads are not directly connected to motor, washing is easily accomplish.    </li>
            <li> Although it feels a little cheap plastic, but the overall performance is great.</li>
            <li> It does get a little hot towards the end of your shave which can make things take longer and not feel as nice as a cool razor, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the traditional Norelco razors for decades and have been satisfied.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need the additional bells and whistles of the even higher models of Norelco.  </li>
            <li> The razor works Better than I would have ever thought possible.</li>
            <li> He has been through many electric shavers and back and forth with the disposable razors.</li>
            <li> shave the first time, after charging the unit overnight.</li>
            <li> As promised, the razor did adjust to my face, and was able to get out the hairs much better than I&#x27;ve had with electric razors in the past.  </li>
            <li> Well, in this economy, maybe you&#x27;d stick with the manual, because I&#x27;ll admit the price is pretty steep.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and till now i have used the Gillette Mach series.     </li>
            <li> You know the answer to the first 2 questions, and this is what i found  1.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Yes, a razor will definitely perform a closer shave, the price of razors are nothing compared to this electric shaver but what this shaver has offered is way better than that:</li>
            <li> the product camequikly and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> So, not only does this shaver cost a lot, it costs more than buying cartridges each year to use -</li>
            <li> Most batteries like this last 2-3 years tops before they stop holding a charge.</li>
            <li> I am in the first week of that 21 days.</li>
            <li> Much more quiet than the corded one that died after 7 years of use.</li>
            <li> As far as the heads themselves, I believe there is a reminder light that comes on after a year to remind you to change the heads.  </li>
            <li> As far as the heads themselves, I believe there is a reminder light that comes on after a year to remind you to change the heads.  </li>
            <li> I love it and would definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Now, with the Gyroflex 3D, I am completely burn free.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be a quality device that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone willing to pay the price.</li>
            <li> First is that you can&#x27;t just plug the cord in to recharge it....</li>
            <li> The price outstanding, I looked at several stores in my area</li>
            <li> It is better than a prior Philips rotary shaver that I owned.  </li>
            <li> I charged it when I first got it and then used it every day for almost a month before I had to charge it again.</li>
            <li> Once the battery indicator turned red, I was still able to use it another four days.</li>
            <li> first Norelco I owned was a cheaper model that squirted lotion.</li>
            <li> I felt as if it would not be able to push enough to cut the hairs..</li>
            <li> It felt cheap, and its 1-month performance demonstrated to me that today&#x27;s Norelco is not the Norelco of old.</li>
            <li> Been using Norelco&#x27;s since I first began shaving.  </li>
            <li> Better than a razor and my last electric.</li>
            <li> I did not wait till the real day!</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and my beard is light.  </li>
            <li> Just rinse under hot water.  </li>
            <li> You run the top part under water for 5 seconds, then you pop open the 3 heads and run them all under water for about 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> After using Lectric Shave, there was a lot more stubble left, and I had some nicks on my face and razor burn.</li>
            <li> I used the Senso Touch for the first time this morning</li>
            <li> The shave is still pretty close but not as close as a blade</li>
            <li> This product gets the stubble on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> I really love this razor and actually look forward to shaving.  </li>
            <li> First off, a disclaimer.  </li>
            <li> First use of this razor</li>
            <li> (Really!)</li>
            <li> (Really!)</li>
            <li> Is it worth paying 2-3 times as much for a SensoTouch 3D?  </li>
            <li> first shave is always tricky since you have to follow a circular motion along the contours of the face.</li>
            <li> Much more flexible and gets to all the places on my neck with relative ease.  </li>
            <li> will add here that a funny thing happened on the way to bed monday night..</li>
            <li> I wonder exactly what they are expecting to do with the trimmer on an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s the reason I moved to electric shavers in the first place.</li>
            <li> First, the surface around the heads extends out farther than on the cheaper models which means that you can&#x27;t get the blades to cut as close to your nose and ears.</li>
            <li> Unless you see sense in spending more for future replacement heads than you did for the shaver.</li>
            <li> I even checked online first to see if they had it in stock and on walmart site</li>
            <li> (shaving heads more often)and recently replaced my 5-year-old Philips Norelco.  </li>
            <li> It is considerably more silent running.</li>
            <li> First, the razor works well.  </li>
            <li> give the Norelco SensoTouch five stars but for that issue with my first one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Philips/Norelco shavers for years and finally upgraded to the latest 3D</li>
            <li> So now I treat myself to a nice wet shave once or twice a week</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve owned that I can say that about.</li>
            <li> Even though they recommend you replace the heads on this razor once every 12 months, mine aren&#x27;t lasting more than 3-4 months at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it actually takes more time to use this than a blade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the first electric razor I&#x27;ve tried but it is the first in this price range.</li>
            <li> never failed.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My neck broke out at first.</li>
            <li> which part of the face to shave first.</li>
            <li> Shave with the grain at first.</li>
            <li> I bought it more than 2 years ago, and checked the head prices back then.</li>
            <li> and save your money on the self cleaning models,because all you need to do is run it under hot water</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I decided to stick with the brand, but upgrade to a higher quality model.</li>
            <li> I will follow up later on my use of this &amp; expecting a better shave in time.</li>
            <li> Thanks Norleco, way to treat your customers!</li>
            <li> Just got it today,So far shaving level is smooth as hell</li>
            <li> Received shaver on 3/2&lt;br /&gt;and am still on first charge.</li>
            <li> Having been a Braun fan for most of my life, the last experience just didn&#x27;t set with me all too well.</li>
            <li> That would be an issue when I travel a lot (more on that later).</li>
            <li> (You experience the same \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period when These seemed to be perfect from the first, possibly explained by the fact that the blade replacement cost is roughly double what Norelco charges for non-3D models.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Not recommended at all to anyone who really needs a shaver!  </li>
            <li> I hope my unit won&#x27;t stop working all of a sudden as many have reported...</li>
            <li> The razor works OK when it actually charges...</li>
            <li> exactly is the go (The Braun took 4</li>
            <li> SensoTouch 3D is completely cord free, has a travel lock, and comes with a protective pouch, so you can toss it in your bag, briefcase, or suitcase when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li> I have tried both this shaver and the Braun Series 7-790 shaver and there is no comparison that the Braun is a higher quality product.  </li>
            <li> Also, the overall quality of the shave was better with the Braun.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves this, he gets a very close shave!</li>
            <li> Rotary shaving is multi-directional, while the Brauns make shaving against the grain easier.)&lt;br /&gt;Charging - This shaver charges only on its stand, which seems OK when you are at home.  </li>
            <li> First the good:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve been able to tell, the Panasonic solution is only a detergent.</li>
            <li> luck if your product never fails.</li>
            <li> the first 10 shaves than your beard adjusts to the rotary shaving and its just a couple of passes to catch everything.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it</li>
            <li> *shaves very close without any \\&quot;tugging\\&quot; of the hairs or skin!  </li>
            <li> It is a lot more quiet.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what is advertised.</li>
            <li> It included an extra replacement shaving head so it was a better deal than elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> Very stealth!  </li>
            <li> but I was able to finish shaving in personal record time.  </li>
            <li> as I say, this is my first, so I have no others to compare to..</li>
            <li> This is definetely a better shaver than my last $60 shaver but for twice the price</li>
            <li> I had to use a beard shaver first then the foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> As of this writing (3/24/15), the replacement head costs more than the actual razor itself.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of an electric razor.</li>
            <li> so it stays where you put it, and charges in one hour, much better than the last Norelco we had.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave, has a long battery life and is so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> But I still love how quiet it is, and it still does the job.  </li>
            <li> Within 5 months the smooth shave was gone completely, replaced by a head that was biting and tearing my skin.</li>
            <li> I admit that while the design of these shaver had caught my postive attention at first, the purchase price dissuaded me from making the purchase.</li>
            <li> The manual says it can take up to 21 days for your beard and skin to become used to this shaver, so one should be patient about being satisfied with the initial shaves.</li>
            <li> My first shave had my face feeling like a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> Been using this piece for about 8 months now and earlier versions of philishave models for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> Several reasons, but the most imp is - comfort.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s more, but you definitely get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Thanks, Norelco - you have ended years of frustration!</li>
            <li> But I like the shaver so much that it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> all electrics it will never cut as close as a safety razor but it will get pretty damned close to</li>
            <li> and I buy this one because I think could be better, but the reality is not, is the same shaving sensation and do</li>
            <li> This razor works exactly as all the promotional information states.  </li>
            <li> no te gusta, obviamente no la pienso devolver.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I charged it up and proceeded to take my first shave.  </li>
            <li> EVEN BETTER SHAVE THAN MY LAST NORELCO</li>
            <li> I think this shaver is much better than the Braun series shavers and is what saved me from going back to a manual shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor is quieter and provides an even better shave than earlier Norelco shavers that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Wished I had stayed with the more traditional Norelco design.  </li>
            <li> The travel case is flimsy which is worrisome given the seemingly more fragile design.  </li>
            <li> This one was probably $50 or $60 more than my last Norelco</li>
            <li> This shaver is different it is outstanding in the close shave you receive from it.</li>
            <li> My first shave went like this:</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> whom would you recommend this product - Anyone interested</li>
            <li> Actually I would hope to be able to still buy it *</li>
            <li> Cleaning is more of a chore with the blade assemblies on a hinge and each cutter buried deeply within the assembly.  </li>
            <li> So far it works really good and holds a charge for a long time before having to recharge.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco died (after a good, long life), so I upgraded to this one.</li>
            <li> I use this razor everyday and it does a good job, but doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> In spite of the hype I would say this shaver shaves as well as or very slightly better than my old Norelco does with new cutters installed, certainly not enough better to justify the much higher price.  </li>
            <li> This one seems more fragile, is less comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t appear to give a better shave.  </li>
            <li> There, he took it apart and said it&#x27;s made cheaply of plastic and will no longer be waterproof after he solders new battery in.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after much footwork and cost, it works again.  </li>
            <li> I started my search for a new razor when my old Braun, top of the line at the time, Model # 8589 started to faulter.</li>
            <li> After some question and answer I was pleased (and a bit surprised) when I was asked for my mailing address and told a new handle would be sent to me.  </li>
            <li> I have usued it dry and with shaving gel, and what a nice fast close shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a joy to shave like this as opposed to the daily burden of a dry shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver is lighter, easier to use, shaves very closely and is easier to clean than was my older model.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is an original replacement heat, feels and cuts like a cheap razor, I am using my old 3 yr old head</li>
            <li> It is extremely easy to clean, I wouldn&#x27;t spend money on the more expensive models, they all have the same shaving head and performance, the add ons are the cleaning station and more advanced display screens.  </li>
            <li> Here are a few specifics: shockingly quiet, super close shave, very comfortable, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> My previous Norelco was an Arcitec, and I was very pleased with it, and planned to go on line and get another like it.</li>
            <li> very close shave, quiet, quick recharge, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> If you need to shave quickly under normal circumstance with the avoidance of razor burn this could be the razor for you as it has worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it&#x27;s size takes up a large part of my travel kit, but a small price to pay for a great shave!</li>
            <li> My conclusion was that although the shave is great, it&#x27;s not that much better than my old norelco, and the frustrations aren&#x27;t worth the cost of this expensive shaver.    </li>
            <li> very smooth, less burn and clean shave.</li>
            <li> It works fine with gel of shaving cream, but using it dry does not give me a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Good razor, works fine on wet and dry surfaces.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the fancy cleaner like the Braun (which is kind of loud in the morning when my wife is trying to sleep), but hot water seems to work well at cleaning and is definitely cheaper than buying replacement cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Although I have used other Norelco shavers over the years, this shaver gives me the best shave I could ask and in less time than any shaver I have used.  </li>
            <li> I went with the norelco because it was able to shave hard to reach places better.  </li>
            <li> This was a great shaver until the replacement heads became outrageously expensive (for the original model) and then replaced with a new model (that isn&#x27;t as good as the original and more expensive).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaver gives a good, close, comfortable shave and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery appears to last a long time on a single charge.</li>
            <li> Because it gives a closer, more comfortable shave, is faster since you won&#x27;t have to go back to tackle missed hairs or stubble in hard to reach spots, and it&#x27;s so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> and they confirmed that the main board was damaged so nothing can be done but purchase a new razor, still, i dont recomend this product.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit heavy (menthol) but the no-foam consistency is a perfect match for a wet electric shave.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel like I was cutting anything, but the shave was incredibly close and ultimately smooth.  </li>
            <li> this one is solid, powerful and accurate.  </li>
            <li> Never really appreciated how easy, fast, thorough, and comfortable an electric shave could be until I tried this one.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a nice travel case for the shaver, but nothing for the stand, which takes up nearly as much space and not really meant for a travel bag.   </li>
            <li> We have had this razor for a few days &amp; so far both husband and son think it works great.</li>
            <li> With less noise, vibration, and lighter, it offers a more enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li> I have found that using this as a wet shaver (which is a nice feature) works better for me than it does as a dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I had to pull out my old Braun to clean up after shaving with the LA-93K.  </li>
            <li> the same job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this machine is lighter, the grip is better, the charging time is better than de older model, the charge last longer and the cleaning process is easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cuts clean, and close, and doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; the hair as much as my old razor did.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better than my old 49.00, 8 year old Philips razor</li>
            <li> The shaver is very quiet and gives a quick clean shave.</li>
            <li> The Norelco has more surface area and if you do go over multiple times, it just makes the shave that much closer.  </li>
            <li> He uses it with shaving foam when he wants an extra close shave and swears it works better than a razor.  </li>
            <li> And finally, something good enough to keep him from using razor number one...  </li>
            <li> Overall, this razor does a good job, but I won&#x27;t be giving up my traditional Mach 3 anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Too many reviewers are only comparing the closeness of the shave, but that&#x27;s only one factor of several that may be most important.</li>
            <li> After years of using the cheaper razors, and never getting a good shave, I finally stepped up to the big time.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with whiskers that tend to grow parallel to the skin, and true to claim, this razor actually gets them and most often on the first swipe!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean (simply fold up some tabs, rinse with warm water, and put it in the stand leaving it open until it dries), shaves wet or dry without any problems, and most importantly feels good to shave (hardly ever pulls a hair).</li>
            <li> so i guess i&#x27;ll come back later for a full review,but so far so good</li>
            <li> Close shave, easy to clean... a little pricey but totally worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> shaving experience is good, involving minimal pressure, except for the stubborn longer hairs, which can be removed with a little bit more effort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You need to be a little more careful handling it,pay attention to cleaning regularly,like daily,and it will provide a much superior shave as a reward.</li>
            <li> His tough beard is shaved smooth, and more importantly, he has not had an issue with rash or razor bumps in 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the shaver head compartments are not sealed very well and the hair folicles seem to easily fall out.  </li>
            <li> this review was helpful, please consider a positive vote.</li>
            <li> Very nice does the job extremely well and the battery life is pretty darn solid.  </li>
            <li> Some of the older Norelco razors had a spring-loaded trimmer that could pop up at inappropriate times if you touched the release just right.  </li>
            <li> and I was pretty much content with it.</li>
            <li> more that I could say about these razors, but this review is already way too long.</li>
            <li> gives a really close shave and its really fast too!</li>
            <li> For my first shave I wanted to give the shaver a real workout</li>
            <li> It gives a reasonably close shave the first time around.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I wasted my money, but after about a month of my face getting accustomed to the shaver - I absolutely love it now!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead of replacing the missing parts, I decided to upgrade, and I am so very pleased with that decision.  </li>
            <li> but over the long haul I feel sure I will save money.</li>
            <li> but I use a real blade anyway for &amp;#34;date night&amp;#34; with my wife, when I really need to be smooooooth!  </li>
            <li> I had no had good experiences in the past with electric shavers</li>
            <li> It even does a good job with flat hairs lying on the neck, though extra caution is called for in this area.</li>
            <li> The trimmer doesn&#x27;t work as well as past Norelco models I&#x27;ve owned, but all else is much superior.</li>
            <li> As a traveler, this is definitely more convenient (hotels normally have those cheap razors that do nothing but leave you with a red face, so I normally end up buying new ones on my trips)&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was tough making the leap to the higher price points, but the reviews strongly favored going for something like this Norelco, so I pulled the trigger and purchased the 1250X from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I can not speak highly enough of this razor and how light it feels on the face ;while doing an incredible job!not missing any facial hair.</li>
            <li> the high speed of the motor caused more friction and made my face red.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this state-of-the-art Philips 3d shaver and although it is expensive, it is the best!</li>
            <li> This is a high end razor and is far from cheap.</li>
            <li> the hairs on my neck that all previous electrics would miss&lt;br /&gt;-comes with nice travel case</li>
            <li> Not too big either, it easily shaves every place on my face.</li>
            <li> Recharging is very simple and easy using the stand and cord.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver over a month now and it easily rates the 5 stars I indicated above.  </li>
            <li> It was an even better shave than spending 15 minutes with my Braun series 5 foil (admittedly the foil shaver was dry while the Norelco was with shaving cream).</li>
            <li> But Lectric Shave is about 50% better than shaving dry.</li>
            <li> It is over-packaged, but, thankfully, the polypropylene package was easy to open and recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is possible that my beard growth is tougher than average, but in contrast the Norelco 1250x has worked great.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy and simple.  </li>
            <li> the Advantage 7735X, which comes with 5 lotion packs by Nivea that  are easy to insert into the back of the razor, the SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver does not come so equipped.  </li>
            <li> but the shave was less effective.</li>
            <li> Dry powder sticks seem to work better for me than wet-shaving, though.</li>
            <li> With the curvy black body and nicely coordinated charging stand, the 1250x wouldn&#x27;t look out of place on Darth Vader&#x27;s bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> Easy to charge, close shave, I don&#x27;t need to bring charger and chord for short trips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reason I can&#x27;t go 5 stars is the sideburn/edge trimming issue, and I&#x27;d like it to be able to dry shave</li>
            <li> The drivers were spinning strongly, but there was no contact between the heads and the drivers when the heads were snapped back into place.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would do a good job shaving and last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> this more expensive swivel head is not as good as the older cheaper model.</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t make them strong enough for him.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars, not because I liked it, but because Philips Norelco offers a 21 day trial and will refund your money if not completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It just takes a bit longer and you don&#x27;t get as many shaves on a single charge.</li>
            <li> and I can get a week or more out of a single charge.</li>
            <li> I have large hands, and this is probably the reason.  </li>
            <li> I have large hands, and this is probably the reason.  </li>
            <li> and I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just used to the pop up on my Smart Touch XL</li>
            <li> and I can always use the one on my Smart Touch</li>
            <li> If you need to charge it, you must bring the also awkwardly large stand.  </li>
            <li> philips/Norelco, smart battery charging technology is all OVER the place..</li>
            <li> I certainly would recommend it as a replacement.</li>
            <li> It certainly is.  </li>
            <li> But certain areas on my neck took a while to get.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cleaning its very easy and fast, operating it its just like any other shaver and it takes about an hour to get fully charged.</li>
            <li> Great razor, BUT weak battery.  </li>
            <li> I have used 5 or 6 different electric shavers in the past 15 years and this has been the best one by far.</li>
            <li> For the exact same problem to happen twice with different models tells me there has got to be some kind of manufacturing problem with the device.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 82, have had several electric razors in the past, and this is far the best.  </li>
            <li> The new head is not as flexible as the old one and is very obviously much cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Philips is an outstanding company having pioneered lot of new products over several decades.</li>
            <li> It seems to be designed so you have to kind of &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; it into place, where usually you just pop it right onto the razor head.</li>
            <li> Plus, the ability to both dry and wet shave is great feature.       </li>
            <li> Great shaver, my only problem was some of the packaging had been removed suggesting that it had been opened previously.</li>
            <li> Worked great wet or dry, with or without shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great dry or wet in the shower too.</li>
            <li> It looks like it has a pretty long life, but the charger works just as easily.    </li>
            <li> The charging and cleaning indicators are really useful.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the device is really easily, involving open the three shaver heads and running it under water.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> At first it was difficult for me to clean, but I gotten good at it: with hot water run over the blades while the chambers are closed most of your hair should get pushed out.  </li>
            <li> The others have been fine, but this one is definitely the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> :) I have not tried any other electric shavers this is my first one after using a mach 3 for years.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of guys, I was at first hesitant to move from blades to electric, but was looking for better solution than scraping my face with sharp steel every day, so eventually decided to \\&quot;try\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of electric shavers, I find them to provide a less than perfect shave - leaving blotches of hair and not being close enough, this electric shaver, however, is in my opinion the closest you can get to a razor shave.  </li>
            <li> The shaving head conforms perfectly to the contours of your face, takes about half the time of an regular razor, and requires only seconds to clean--just flip up the shaving heads and brush/wash out the residue.</li>
            <li> By 3 or 4pm, there is definitely a bit of shadow, but that&#x27;s fine for my needs.</li>
            <li> I liked its fancy look, but 3D shaving is very far from 3D, you cant shave near the nose and the shaving is not smooth at all, but shaves pretty clean.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old shaver, panasonic 8103s, this new one is smooth and quiet, and more clearly than panasonic&#x27;s ,  i like it</li>
            <li> If I do a quick shave, it wouldn&#x27;t reach the standard that I have to have a really groomed appearance, but is good enough to get out in public.</li>
            <li> I also refuse to pay $160 and higher for a high end Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> First, I highly recommend buying through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The Braun cleaning system is very good but expensive.</li>
            <li> I especially like the ability to take it in the shower where a little shave gel, or conditioner can help get the closest to blade shave from an electric I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li> I used canned air to clean it and the little carrying case allowed easy carrying in my assault pack.</li>
            <li> It does a great job shaving those areas under the chin and near the neck that are hard to get.</li>
            <li> , while it&#x27;s an older model of the new 3D series it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It actually made a HUGE difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even 8 hours later, much of my face remains stubble free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another huge plus in my mind is the fact that it&#x27;s very quiet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean -- don&#x27;t waste your money on the fancy cleaner.</li>
            <li> Shaves are very close, comfortable and last all day.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, fast, no neck burn, quiet, close shave.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a happy camper and I was more than frustrated.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work much on the mustache.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this shaver.</li>
            <li> They make a grinding sound and he has to open and close them all to re-engage.  </li>
            <li> after 4 months, it started to be very noisy.</li>
            <li> We would really recommend it to anyone who needs a heavy-duty shaver.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin at all and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> He really likes it.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning takes too much time,awkward with stubby fingers.</li>
            <li> So yes, it shaves well, but I would never buy another one - who needs that much of a downside at that price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a shave this close and smooth since I used to shave with a razor back in the stone ages.  </li>
            <li> Called Amazon to complain - the person was very helpful in resolving the issue.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.</li>
            <li> I know reviews aren&#x27;t really supposed to be based on cost as prices change</li>
            <li> I found the Norelco cuts very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver and the way it cuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maneuverabilit - this is where the Braun really shines for me.</li>
            <li> I find that very helpful.</li>
            <li> I find that very helpful.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he really likes the shave it gives.  </li>
            <li> The shave is much closer too.</li>
            <li> It gives a really close shave, glides well on the skin, and flexes to cover curves on chin and jaw.</li>
            <li> After a year I needed to replace the whole head.</li>
            <li> Yes, if you really want to piss him off, buy him this shaver.</li>
            <li> I shave my head and face every day and really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> What is really upsetting is the policy of Philips Norelco to not grant you the rebate that you are entitled to at the time of purchase.  </li>
            <li> I would rate the razer about 3.5 stars for effectiveness on an absolute scale, I would rate it 1.0 stars as value for the money, and I would rate Philips Norelco at 0 stars for its lack of ethics and refusal to honor its legal and fiduciary responsibilities.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compare that to this shaver - The shave is fast.</li>
            <li> - now she cant really tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s some fancy technology built into the device that is really for marketing purposes.</li>
            <li> At a very conservative rate of $10 an hour, you&#x27;ve saved yourself the money after one year of usage.</li>
            <li> It was the most I&#x27;ve ever spent on an electric razor.</li>
            <li> so it should get better, but for now I feel I have to press harder and take longer.</li>
            <li> I am getting a shave much closer than anything I have owned before</li>
            <li> This razor does the job very well.</li>
            <li> Very useful!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After two weeks, I still haven&#x27;t decided how much I like this.  </li>
            <li> I surprice myself every morning that I shave, it so close and fast.    </li>
            <li> This is basically why my bf loves it so much is becuz</li>
            <li> but it is very close.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, quiet shave.  </li>
            <li> Does not work without charging stand which is a nuisance and takes up too much space.</li>
            <li> The chin and neck grow in fast, though, but that&#x27;s biology, not the shaver&#x27;s fault...</li>
            <li> They really designed it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like that it&#x27;s a lithiumion battery and not nickle cadmium.</li>
            <li> I really wish the designers would have done that</li>
            <li> Very quiet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Need shaving cream if you want a fast and close shave with</li>
            <li> While a bit pricey, it does provide a very close shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still functional, but not as much as ones that flip out..</li>
            <li> Bought this for my partner&#x27;s birthday and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Much sooner.  </li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I really wanted to like this razor.</li>
            <li> electric shavers will give you a smooth shave and not necessarily a close shave.</li>
            <li> Shave very well, and can be washed.</li>
            <li> No irritation and the heads really do adapt to the contours of my face.  </li>
            <li> In comparison, the SensoTouch 3D is much faster and misses a lot fewer hairs.  </li>
            <li> spend so much on this product?  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like the razor.  </li>
            <li> It is much smoother.  </li>
            <li> After this \\&quot;training\\&quot; period it works very well.</li>
            <li> And it does not work very well.</li>
            <li> and i really need to shave..</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks Norelco</li>
            <li> it charges fast and has a reliable charge indicator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this guy now for a month and can&#x27;t say how much of an improvement it is over the Braun.  </li>
            <li> Always straight strokes.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> It was reasonably close from the start and has remained so for me.</li>
            <li> This is a real drag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> ; the stand is really flimsy.</li>
            <li> , seems to cut real close.</li>
            <li> (I think the heads may be turning much faster.)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Wet shaving (with shaving gel) is better with this shaver.</li>
            <li> The pros of this razor is that it is extremely quiet, and feels smooth on your sking.  </li>
            <li> The power plug only plugs into the stand, it doesn&#x27;t fit the shaver socket, that plugs into the stand.  </li>
            <li> I really hope the results continue like this.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Norelco really designed an inferior product with this one.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast charging..</li>
            <li> 30 seconds pickingup the extras with the straight part, then 15 seconds cleaning in running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did something unusual this year for my husband.  </li>
            <li> Sounded great but either the item was broken or there was no power.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> it is a lot quicker than a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> My friends very like it.</li>
            <li> It gives a really close shave and is so much quicker and easier than using a blade.</li>
            <li> I don’t like the fact that you have to travel with the whole charger with you.</li>
            <li> (he no longer wants a really close shave)</li>
            <li> He was reluctant to use it, but now he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This product is really light weight, very low noise.  </li>
            <li> fast charge.</li>
            <li> Straight-edge absolutely destroys me and electric razors tend to be much easier on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was really amazed how well it did on my cheeks/</li>
            <li> It replaced my Braun and is much quieter and shaves closer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> very comfoortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just rinse off and it is ready to go.</li>
            <li> The order and delivery was handled very well.  </li>
            <li> The razor is very quite compared to the Panasonic and Braun.  </li>
            <li> BUT cleaning is too much effort.</li>
            <li> Much quieter too.</li>
            <li> After much anxiety, I bit the bullet and decided to purchase this Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> really??  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real beauty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, conforms to you face very well, and really does get the longer hairs with ease.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready to recommend it at this point.</li>
            <li> A display lets you know how much power remains in the lithium-ion battery</li>
            <li> how much power remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> received on time, works very well, close shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves very close for an electric</li>
            <li> The trimmer is noisy but works very well on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;The Package got to me, and the inside package was dented and the styrofoam holder was cracked</li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one makes it easier and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li> So, I can&#x27;t really hold that against it.</li>
            <li> I love how I can wet shave with it.</li>
            <li> also found the shave to be much closer than my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;However, the Philips is noticeably larger.&lt;br /&gt;Especially the shaving head - it is much larger.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Shaving without water was actually really convenient and helped me get ready faster in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not irritatingly so.</li>
            <li> I no longer use my straight razor with shaving brush/shave soap.  </li>
            <li> My husband is SO picky about ANY electronics he gets and he really loves this shaver.</li>
            <li> whole kit includes everything you need to shave.</li>
            <li> It really works well.  </li>
            <li> You can do it every day and your whole life is going to turn better.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent purches.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buy in China.</li>
            <li> Then follow up with a regular razor to get a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a really close shave, but it takes a lot of time to do so.</li>
            <li> Also the construction feels very flimsy for what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and this gives me a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> The real beauty of this machine is attributed to the 3d heads so that it just glides over the contours.</li>
            <li> I find it very convenient compared to shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> and he has used electric shavers his whole life.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want another piece of plastic to store.  </li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> They clearly stand behind their product and that kind of support and the overall quality of the device confirms that it was a good decision to buy this razor.</li>
            <li> Now that is where the difference is really tangible.</li>
            <li> I find I have to lightly go over the same spot</li>
            <li> the charger takes up about as much room as a phone charger.  </li>
            <li> The three light indicator degreases as the battery life drops and then changes from white to amber red as it gets really low - another nice feature.  </li>
            <li> My shaves are averaging about two minutes and when done I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> Smooth and quiet.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> life is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is smooth, quiet and handles all the bumps and curves with ease.  </li>
            <li> at any rate, if you need a razor that works on dry/wet skin, without cuts and fast, this will suffice.</li>
            <li> This provides a really close shave.</li>
            <li> I think that it works very well.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to keep your face wet.  </li>
            <li> am very displeased.</li>
            <li> Braun series 7 for example has a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blame Amazon for this issue but I must say, I feel really cheated by Philips.</li>
            <li> Close shave, light and very quiet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-the trimmer does not work very well</li>
            <li> My husband really loves this razor.  </li>
            <li> After about three shaves with this, the razor burn started really flaring up.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> was looking at Straight Blade and an Electric Shaver and after reading online, despite straight blade being cheaper - went for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Phillips Shaver is very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> Floating heads work very well.</li>
            <li> Provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sound - the 3D runs very quietly; the Braun and Panasonic are far more \\&quot;buzzy\\&quot; but not too loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old double edge razor did a better job than this thing.  </li>
            <li> I think the main advantage of the Norelco 1250 is the pivot head, which easily follows the curves of your face and allows the razor to get every last hair.</li>
            <li> i have used electric razors such as norelco and braun over most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> It actually seemed to irritate my kneck more than my old Braun.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be an upgrade from the d model, but honestly after using it for a few months I want my 2d back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Positives. I&#x27;d agree that this shaver is a top quality product and will likely suit the bulk of the population - but if you do have sensitive skin perhaps keep looking?</li>
            <li> I am in the military and needed a good quality shaver that would last a deployment and field time.  </li>
            <li> Please be weary of the warranty and be sure to frequently test your product before you warranty expires or you will be in the same predicament that I&#x27;m in.</li>
            <li> It is particularly good for me as i have delicate skin and begin to get all sorts of spots on my face soon after i shave.</li>
            <li> The 3D is a nice looking razor and does the trick for giving a close shave in just a few passes.  </li>
            <li> The other one was in my teens and it was a very cheap model given to me by my parents.  </li>
            <li> As a whole, this is a very good electric shaver and if the price were to go down slightly, it&#x27;s star rating would improve, but for now it gets a  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave in very little time with easy clean-up.</li>
            <li> I just bought a new razor, the Braun 790, hopefully that works out better in the long run.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> They are nearly 70 dollars!!!</li>
            <li> First 2 weeks it slightly irritated my skin, but then everything became OK.</li>
            <li> razor easily handles the long whiskers and does 90% of my face very close.  </li>
            <li> It delivers a close shave, is very quiet and best of all was about half the price that I would have to pay for the same product in New Zealand.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to clean after a wet or dry shave.</li>
            <li> When the cord starting to become loose, and the shaver spontaneously shut itself off many times during my shave, it was then that I realized I definitely needed to get myself a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head is defective and cracked when  I first received the new unit.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Strange design, but easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any improvement over my Speed XL , if you are not interested in shaving in the shower, except that it is more abrasive to my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I can say that I impreciono, first things easy and fast shaving, second how fast your cleaning and finally as remaining after shave, is exactly like my Mach 3 razor, so I recommend it apart, is satisfaction guaranteed with 21 days for testing and up to 45 to return if you do not like,</li>
            <li> Compared to most of Norelco&#x27;s other shavers, the 1250 is very light, apparently because it uses a smaller battery.</li>
            <li> Have to clean more often (but at least it&#x27;s easier to clean).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> And even after shaving in the morning, I can shave early evening for very special occasions, then shave again the next morning.</li>
            <li> Much better than any other shave cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different electric razors over the years, from all of the major companies.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you open each head individually after each shave and wash them with hot water.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the 1150x for myself and wanted to buy the same for my Father for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I know some of the other reviewers have commented on the issue with international travel, but I can say this works perfectly abroad as I have used it in other countries.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for him to open it</li>
            <li> It is a breeze to clean, just rinse under hot water and blot it gently with a towel and set it out for a couple of hours to dry.  </li>
            <li> that is, well, unreliable or opt for some other brand that might be MORE reliable..</li>
            <li> The next few shaves gave me some pretty good razor burn, but I attributed this to my face not being used to it.     </li>
            <li> I would definitely say the 1250x is worth the price difference based on its ability to competently handle long stubble alone.</li>
            <li> This one is better than either of the two other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> I received the Norelco 1250x as a Christmas present and was quite excited.  </li>
            <li> The other is the velcro strap to keep the able on the power adapter coiled neatly when it&#x27;s not in use.   </li>
            <li> battery has lasted better than any other razor.  </li>
            <li> My father is able to handle this shaver due to</li>
            <li> you are a fast operator in the morning, then to make up for this, consider buying this shaver with the Jet Clean system as well, which will set you back an extra $50 plus the cost of the jet clean solution (there are two options for this</li>
            <li> My ratings reflect the fact that when everything is fresh and new, the razor works extremely well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re like me, and you want a quick, comfortable shave without the mess...</li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing extra special about this shaver.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic&#x27;s special cleaning speed makes it slightly easier to manually clean than the Braun.    </li>
            <li> Thanks to my new Norelco!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other brands in the past, but this is superior by far.</li>
            <li> This new Norelco shaver is amazingly quiet but gives me a very close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-blade set lasts 1 year+&lt;br /&gt;-easy to clean and it actually tells you when it needs cleaning</li>
            <li> Consider this option if you do not want to have to clean the shaver manually and you want the ease and comfort of just popping it in the cleaner and only needing to replace the solution every so often.</li>
            <li> It has been doing everything well, under the nose, on the chin, and even long stubble seem to cut just fine.</li>
            <li> It is simple to charge, clean and operate.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very glad I spent the extra money.  </li>
            <li> Want a shave that is relatively close, and doesn&#x27;t take lots of additional clean up for missed areas  Shaver 2:  23</li>
            <li> &quot; so much so that I think I&#x27;ll be going back to the tried and true Advantage</li>
            <li> You have to open and clean each head separately</li>
            <li> Much closer shave than my older Panasonic wet/dry</li>
            <li> Cons - Don&#x27;t like popping the heads open individually to clean</li>
            <li> That said, the Braun is the only system with alcohol in its cleaner to sanitize as well as a detergent to clean and oil to lubricate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor looks like something from a sci-fy movie when you open it to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I had a few Norelco razors in the past and this one is the best!</li>
            <li> Nice long charge and does trick on short notice.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t really want to spend the money then a step down from the top end</li>
            <li> What a difference, a quick clean shave, and no long hairs left.</li>
            <li> The past few years I have been buying the top of the line new shavers available from the top brands.</li>
            <li> Speed-XL, single button to release heads making it easy to tap them and shake out the shavings.</li>
            <li> The flex head and design is comfortable to hold and easily accesses all the hard to get places on my face.  </li>
            <li> My research suggested it was a little more prone to complaints of razor burn, and it was not quite as good in the hard to reach areas of the neck.</li>
            <li> Used worse, however this shaver is far from impressive, especially considering how much it costs.</li>
            <li> In the early days he occasionally used a straight razor to get a nice, close shave and often used a regular non-electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The heads follow the contours of my face better than any conventional three head shaver could.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see too many other reviewers complaining about this problem (which surprises me), so perhaps it has something to do with the water where I am (slightly high in calcium), or the fact I shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> even the trimmer is interesting because the razor is so quiet you can hear it as it finds and cuts hairs, it makes a little popping like sound.  </li>
            <li> However, I dry shave with this razor numerous times and it still preform amazingly.</li>
            <li> Less if you make the cartridges last longer than a month or find a good deal on them.     </li>
            <li> Lathering up my face &amp; using a razor doesn&#x27;t really take any more or less time</li>
            <li> A really close shave, and so quick &amp; quiet.  </li>
            <li> Good, close, shave wet or dry .&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Can use dry or wet with equally good shave.  </li>
            <li> Good shave wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I must admit that I expected a little bit more of it, but after sharing my experiences with other owners I am happy with my razor.</li>
            <li> A very comfortable shave that previous electrics can&#x27;t touch.  </li>
            <li> And as for my main review, I still really like the shaver and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The following morning I went into the restroom to get my shave started and realized, my beautiful animations informing me that my razor was ready for action, was actually missing in action.</li>
            <li> With fresh cutters, this razor cuts nearly as close as a blade - WOW!</li>
            <li> battery holds unbelievably long without charging, shaves well, skin is smooth as baby.</li>
            <li> Cool digital readouts for charging status &amp; battery.  </li>
            <li> Comes with a nice charging stand and a zip up travel case and a small brush.  </li>
            <li> I justified it by telling myself that  something I&#x27;d use every day for several years is worth an extra $50-$75.   </li>
            <li> The shaver does not get near as hot as a foil shaver.    </li>
            <li> The product has a good performance, but Philips does not satisfy with the global guarantee, I request the Global Guarantee last two weeks in South America, and Philips didnt help me with that.</li>
            <li> They insisted I wage war on my face for the full 45 days before I could send it back.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend even complemented me since this was her first time ever seeing my face completely shaved.</li>
            <li> I will being going back to Remington because I get a much closer shave without so many passes over the same area.</li>
            <li> Not bad, just different.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, just different.  </li>
            <li> He is very particular about what he wants, so I was naturally nervous that it was not the model he wanted.  </li>
            <li> The battery life was OK, but was down to needing a charge every two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I waited many years before I would break down and buy an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I had a 10 year old Norelco (6705x), which was pretty decent in and of itself.</li>
            <li> but it was far superior compared to any electric I&#x27;ve previously owned and left my face relatively irritation free.  </li>
            <li> I tried to clean it up with the pop-out shaver, but I feel like I am growing a full mustache just under my nose, and my sideburns are all uneven.  </li>
            <li> The $60 investment each year for new shaving heads replacement is a small price to pay for such a great unit</li>
            <li> I said forget it and bought a new Braun, after checking on the availability of replacement parts!  </li>
            <li> Going back to the head thing, this product, if you buy it new on Amazon, shows that the heads are the original ones.  </li>
            <li> The heads flex very well and stay flat to your face making quick work of shaving.</li>
            <li> : Just tried the new Remington Alphagel shaving cream and that works very well with both the Panny and the Norelco.</li>
            <li> This new 1250x 3d is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I deep clean it with the jet rinser once a week, to insure a like new razor feel.</li>
            <li> with the new shaver, you need to open the blades and clean after each use.  </li>
            <li> the price is high, and if you can afford it you get an high quality electric shaver at a premium, but for most of us, this is just not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This is in marked contrast to my original Phillips which was one single head that popped open and allowed me to easily rinse it out.</li>
            <li> Even with the dry shave, the shaver is ultra comfortable.</li>
            <li> Easy to grip even if your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> If this one lasts half that time I&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li> The shave is SO much better than my previous razor.  </li>
            <li> I will buy the latest Panasonic... hopefully, it works like the previous Panasonics.  </li>
            <li> For me it does a better job if gettin the pesky whiskers and irritates my skin less.  </li>
            <li> Does the job better than my previous Norelco.</li>
            <li> , It shaves better then my previous one ever did.</li>
            <li> That is, it works like any decent one should.</li>
            <li> I was using an older Philips Norelco model (maybe a 600 series?)</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s also a 45 day money back guarantee if not satisfied which is nice!</li>
            <li> This heads are also an upgrade to some of the older Norelco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The 3D takes some practice, but it can do a decent job.</li>
            <li> While not perfect, it excels in several areas and feels the best.</li>
            <li> While not perfect, it excels in several areas and feels the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s true, even in the usage manual sayes that the first shaves will be rough...</li>
            <li> One of my main complaints with this shaver is the fact that if your hair is longer than a millimeter, you will get pulled hairs all over the place.</li>
            <li> (obviously the actual ability is more like an hour nonstop)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent shaver since I removed my beard 7 years ago</li>
            <li> Clean-up is simple and quick.</li>
            <li> In my love blindness, I overcame a poorly designed charger and a trimmer with the sophistication and sound of a Weed Whacker.</li>
            <li> He regularly uses an earlier version of this product and was satisfied with the shave he got from it.  </li>
            <li> Super quiet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;If cost is your main factor, go with Norelco.</li>
            <li> If cost is your main factor, go with Norelco.</li>
            <li> While the trimmer is noisy compared to prior models, it&#x27;s smaller design seems more efficient and</li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, the indicator shows it still has more than a third of its power left, so no nuisance there.  </li>
            <li> but i really do enjoy the wet shave as it gives a very close</li>
            <li> The only thing I could complain about and the reason I have gone with 4 stars instead of 5 is simply because it can take a bit of time to get some of the more stubborn hairs gone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve traditionally been more of a regular Gillette Mach 3 Turbo kinda guy, but the idea of an electric razor has always appealed to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems like it will hold a good charge for heavy beard daily use.  </li>
            <li> My skin has aged and become more sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the older style Norelco razors but this one will suffice.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent, yet pricey razor.  </li>
            <li> While I had some initial skin irritation switching from a Braun, it quickly adjusted.</li>
            <li> It is no big deal as I just use shaving gel for sensitive skin and afterwards I have a smooth as butter face and neck with zero irritation.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried wet shaving with cream yet, but I&#x27;m getting such a nice shave without that</li>
            <li> The Braun&#x27;s harder case gives it top honors over the Panasonic&#x27;s soft one, but the Panasonic has an on-off lock that the Braun lacks.</li>
            <li> Speaking of stealth, this thing is super quiet.  </li>
            <li> I have heard and read many reviews about different razors, and how it takes time to get used to the difference between the electric and the basic razor.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different electric razors over the years and have tried most all brands including different versions of wet/dry  </li>
            <li> I gave it the ol&#x27; college try for two weeks, trying to get to the magic 45-day trial period nirvana, but I&#x27;m a big baby and couldn&#x27;t stand the constant assault on my mug.</li>
            <li> I´ve got a older model of Philips Razor</li>
            <li> I recently purchased it from Amazon and have been pleased with the entire experience.  </li>
            <li> This is a great unit, I only hope I get at least 5 years out of it.</li>
            <li> Replacement came quickly and included a postage paid label to send the damaged unit back.</li>
            <li> I then purchased this older generation model from amazon.  </li>
            <li> And it had more than plenty enough battery to do my entire head, face and neck and still had power</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin though, so maybe thats why it hurt so much.</li>
            <li> I always wanted an electric shaver, but had so many negative comments that I dared not currently shaved faith with mach 3 and ought to look good doing it first from top to bottom and then conversely, was tedious and took a long time to clean the machine, 3D came out</li>
            <li> I have a very sharp face features, so most normal shavers would irritate my skin</li>
            <li> For the price breakdown of disposable or other traditional razors (with new heads) the Norelco is a great investment--needless to say I will never be using a traditional razor again.</li>
            <li> I have long had my eye on a new electric shaver and this one fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> but it does shave better in less time then my old Smart Touch XL razor.    </li>
            <li> Norelco 3D Sens Touch may be good for other beards, not certainly not for mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The Norelco model HS8420 is still available on Amazon for $50, a real bargain for those who prefer wet shaves.  </li>
            <li> He is very pleased with how close it shaves wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> High Quality with Lower price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Price is fairly high, unless you get a deal when it is on sale.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> I have used the high end</li>
            <li> Now they are not providing high quality heads for my SensoTouch.  </li>
            <li> a high end</li>
            <li> I highly recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I still HIGHLY recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try the rotary style razor with high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this razor based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> High recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product,</li>
            <li> Well, to be frank I bought this razor because I needed a high end electric razor for my chin and mustache areas, Had a $45.90   Amazon Rewards credit to spend.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality razor</li>
            <li> I would highly recomend this razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this Norelco.</li>
            <li> However, now that I&#x27;ve tried a high end</li>
            <li> He says he would highly recommend this item for shaving.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to every guy to have one.</li>
            <li> The new variety of replacement head is widely reviewed as inferior, but more modestly priced.  </li>
            <li> it FAR exceeds the Smart Touch XL.</li>
            <li> Good razor, not sure it is worth the high price vs other Norelco razors</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve used electric razors for many years and typically my skin has to adapt to any new products.  </li>
            <li> Knocked a star off for this, and the charger is a little more fussy with it&#x27;s dedicated stand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it three times, so I&#x27;ll give it a little more time to see if it improves.</li>
            <li> but because its a closer shave I did have a little more razor burn.</li>
            <li> Just wish the little pop-out  trimmer was a tad better.....</li>
            <li> When I put this one in my old washer, it worked ! !  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d take a little razor burn if i&#x27;d get done shaving sooner. :)</li>
            <li> Not significantly :) yep</li>
            <li> Generally like it very much.</li>
            <li> First you get a little reminder light (looks like a water faucet)</li>
            <li> I mention before in my original review that I get ingrown hairs but even dry shaving with the razor</li>
            <li> Prior to this one, I had the Norelco Cool Skin 7775X; if you don&#x27;t recognize that particular model it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s probably almost 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> When I first bought this shaver there were so many different variants (with/without cleaning, and many other options), that it was pretty confusing.  </li>
            <li> but I am left to go back to my $30 Panasonic that shaves better, even though it is loud, but my little Panasonic does a better job.</li>
            <li> However as it started to get older, I knew I had to spend the money to buy a new foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> Now it seems the blades have come down to a little more reasonable price, but the fact remains that this is a shaver that works well but must be kept in a very safe place and handled carefully</li>
            <li> He says it is very comfortable to use, and the wet or dry function is pretty nifty too.</li>
            <li> I have to say so far I have not had to shave my neck with a straight razor after every shave.  </li>
            <li> you can clearly see this is a very well made shaver, contrary to others</li>
            <li> Rinsing it during shaving, and then raising the three heads and rinsing them, completely cleans the whole shaver.  </li>
            <li> &quot; - I find that they do not really make a huge difference in the shave on the side of the face.  </li>
            <li> I like the idea of an electric razor, but enjoy a wet shave.</li>
            <li> What a pain to have to take the whole stand on a trip, especially when you want to pack light and not to pay for extra baggage charges.  </li>
            <li> where near as close a shave as a DE or Straight blade.</li>
            <li> I have had probably five or six Norelco shavers in my life time and this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the few extra dollars to get something that floats/contours on your face, easy to clean and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry I cannot compare to others, but have always had great luck&lt;</li>
            <li> Not much to say here expect it works fantastic.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gents, I have to say that I don&#x27;t find any real difference between how the model 1250X/40 shaves as compared to my six year old 9195XL.</li>
            <li> WIth the Norelco,  you can shave blind,  and this 3 D one,  you can be skiing, LOL,  </li>
            <li> Laugh as you imagine him going over and over and over the same spot trying but failing to cut those whiskers.  </li>
            <li> its was well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> for about 2 yrs,I used this Philips Norelco and have been using for about past 8 months.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, both of them provide a good shave, and if you are debating which one to go for, following</li>
            <li> This is a normal occurrence.\\</li>
            <li> No awkward angles as I aim for curved areas, and no going over the same area until I have razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time on the 26th - and promptly bought another one for my son, whose birthday was 2 days later (thanks Amazon Prime for the one day shipping rate).    </li>
            <li> First, the sensotouch is much easier to shave with since it conforms to your face as you move it from one part to the next</li>
            <li> GONE is the loud buzzing noise that I thought was a part of the shave; the only sound is a relatively soft whirr.</li>
            <li> the last several months I seemed to have developed a skin allergy to the lubricating pad now found on most manual razors.  </li>
            <li> I had done a lot of research beforehand, and I know that electric razors normally don&#x27;t get as close a shave as a manual one</li>
            <li> Pre-shave isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve normally used because I don&#x27;t like the fragrances of any of them, but I may have to try to find one.  </li>
            <li> I figured with a lifespan like that, it would be worth spending the extra money on a nicer razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have bought many products from Amazon and this is the first negative I have ever responded with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Speed - If you&#x27;re in a hurry and want to get in and get out with a dry-shave as quickly as possible, the Norelco wins.</li>
            <li> I normally use Fusion Manual.</li>
            <li> but I had to use a normal non electric razor to take care of all the areas missed.</li>
            <li> but in my mind is the only worth while difference.  </li>
            <li> I decided to abandon my normal razor and stick with this</li>
            <li> Good but not great</li>
            <li> Good but not great razor.</li>
            <li> I would not give it a perfect score on long stubble as it takes a while to get all the whiskers mowed down and still pulls a few,  </li>
            <li> I would highly suggest anyone looking for a new shaver to look or buy this one no questions asked. . .</li>
            <li> It takes a few more strokes to cover the same area, but what it cuts, it cuts much closer and better than the other models.   </li>
            <li> So what, the original head design *is* available and still in production, but only if you buy another brand new shaver??!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the actual product worked well so far, but his one-star review is well-deserved because of the above.</li>
            <li> However, it takes some getting used to holding it as compared to previous Norelco units and cleaning it is not as easy as in the older models.</li>
            <li> The three blade chambers open easily but click firmly back in place every time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend shaving dry, not only for convenience, but it seems to result in a better shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fact that this razor works on dry or wet skin is also a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> It is easy to see why; you see those big circumferential slots in the second concentric ring of the heads?</li>
            <li> It glides much better over my face than any earlier model I&#x27;ve used for dry shaving.</li>
            <li> I first tried a Panasonic, but sent it back because it was big, loud, took longer to clean, and didn&#x27;t shave my beard any closer than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently from Amazon for the right price after doing a bit of research.</li>
            <li> Phillips/Norelco has finally gotten it right with the 1250X40 SensoTouch 3D shaving system.</li>
            <li> Well i went to my local walmart and they had it for $99, so i bought it right away.</li>
            <li> Finally made the right choice in cordless razor.</li>
            <li> LiPo recharge battery lasts a long time and charges quickly.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer is sub par and it does not capture the small fine hairs on the cheek along the beard line very well, but I still gave it 4 stars for the very close shave and ease of use around neck and under jaw areas.</li>
            <li> Super long battery life too.  </li>
            <li> When using the dry shave setting (if you are in a rush) it obviously will cause a little skin discomfort, but the wet and shaving cream options make for a great and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I still clean up a bit with my regular razor...but just a few quick spots that aren&#x27;t really needed if I was in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Says it is so easy to use, and cuts the hair down to \\&quot;baby-butt smooth\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> They verified that it was the newer model of the original head and that there was really not much else they could do.</li>
            <li> For those of you accustomed to the jet engine roar of other models, you may enjoy getting fooled into thinking that the battery charge on this Norelco was dying,</li>
            <li> Only used it for a week but am very glad I spent the extra dollars for it.</li>
            <li> He had already shaved and then decided to use his new razor.</li>
            <li> The delivery driver was new to my area, and it was a cluster.</li>
            <li> its brand new so lest see what happens with time and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to even use the new one yet.  </li>
            <li> If the new shaver doesn&#x27;t work out, I&#x27;ll probably switch to a Braun Series 7-790cc.</li>
            <li> So, that means $15 for the razor and $50-$60 a year on cartridges assuming you use a new one each month.</li>
            <li> One day the battery will die and you will either send it in for a new one or toss it and buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> After researching Norelco&#x27;s new offerings, I decided on the 1250X.</li>
            <li> With this new SensoTouch shaver, your problems are solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I went shopping for a new razor without lotion</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new, affordable replacement head, the RQ12</li>
            <li> I refuse to accept the inferior performance of the new head.</li>
            <li> Your face will have time to adjust to the new shaver.</li>
            <li> But the quality of your shave will improve over time using a new shaver.</li>
            <li> So I started researching the new Norelco line.  </li>
            <li> I buy a new electric razor every 5 to 10 years for touch ups and travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going 100% electric with this new razor.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I recommend holding off on a new purchase until production issues resolved.  </li>
            <li> The reason I was looking for a replacement was that the shaver heads for the 8020X were now costing as much as a new razor.</li>
            <li> So I decided it was time for a new shaver.   </li>
            <li> Norelco razor (9160xl) which was in need of new heads</li>
            <li> it has/had a relatively new cutter foil and block and i run the cleaning cycle every use..</li>
            <li> To my surprise I received a new razor in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I went from a Norelco to this new Norelco</li>
            <li> Just stopped Tuesday 8/13/13 and would not take a charge, so I contacted Norelco this morning, and with the Registration of the product they are sending me a new shaver body.</li>
            <li> but if your new like me than you should know that electrics dont shave close to the skin at all.</li>
            <li> so I decide to try new Phillips</li>
            <li> I returned the razor, and purchased a new cutter and foil for my 7000 seriec Braun, which I am now using.</li>
            <li> I have been using Electric Shavers for years because manual blades tend to irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Usually buy a new shaver every three years</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve not had a razor now for a week because they mis-typed my address shipping the new handle....</li>
            <li> but it is still new.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new 1250 razor.</li>
            <li> This ain&#x27;t new</li>
            <li> The $30.oo rebate means that there are new models on the event horizon after Xmas I assume.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see a new and improved mousetrap/razor.  </li>
            <li> you know how to shave with electric razor and just want something new I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Time for a new shaver again.  </li>
            <li> New head &#x3D;</li>
            <li> brand new shave again - for 5 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor 2 years ago and it keeps performs like new every day.  </li>
            <li> So I am returning the new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - you will feel like you just bought a brand new</li>
            <li> Shaving is a pleasure with my new 3D.</li>
            <li> Bought the 3D version of this, used as a new year gift.</li>
            <li> My husband was looking for a new shaver, and had mentioned about the tilting heads.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad now that the parts needed for my old shaver were not available, had to get the new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy it so much that I have added a few minutes each day.  </li>
            <li> I was worried with oily skin that this may cause problems, but it&#x27;s been much gentler overall than my straight razor was.  </li>
            <li> It is important to shave regularly, cuz if you miss a couple of days, you will get an incomplete shave the next time you use this.</li>
            <li> My solution is to bring my older, lower-end Norelco that plugs directly into the shaver.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave and works very well, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> , i can look if anyone really cares) because the braun was really tearing my face up after several years..</li>
            <li> BUT the lady is kind enough to say she will ship a replacement out (7 to 10 days) from someplace in ohio and that when i get it i need to return the dead \\&quot;handle\\&quot;..</li>
            <li> but I thought if I spent some extra money and got a better one that it would pay off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be the same, but I expected it to be better than it is for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t plug the cord directly into shaver as with the older models.</li>
            <li> It does the job but doesn&#x27;t shave as well as my older Norelco Quadra Action.  </li>
            <li> Comfort - I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but the Braun wins out (unless going wet-shave with the oil/gel as described above).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father who recently had a stroke and was having trouble shaving his own face.</li>
            <li> smooth, quiet, but solid.</li>
            <li> When the shaver did work, I think that the shave was not close enough; I was expecting it to be much closer - more like a blade and less</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I use my older one which charges directly into the razor</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to cut at a detailed level...cuts more than you expect, and it makes weird noises when it cuts anything...hard to explain.  </li>
            <li> Need a good trimmer to allow a quick, but not perfect shave similar to a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow  </li>
            <li> There are no more of the original RQ12 blades being made, and the only ones available are being sold at highway robbery prices.  </li>
            <li> instructions are very clear.</li>
            <li> I have tried many electric shavers in the past and like most, have given up on them as they are either too rough on my face or they just don&#x27;t shave close enough or a combo of the two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Just received this as a replacement for a very old Braun 7 series.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to get into the discussion about electric versus blades; I&#x27;ve given enough blood in my time, thank you very much.  </li>
            <li> I doubt very much that it was ever intended to replace a beard and mustache trimmer, which is a completely different grooming tool.  </li>
            <li> The razor was very loud and the shave head was bulky.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> this is my first try at a electric, I am getting older, and the razor, I used all my life, is now starting to take chunks out of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Also, I am feeling skin irritation a little more than I did with my old, loud, foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> After receiving my new shaver, I retired my original and more expensive shaver for emergency&#x27;s only.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m very surprised to see that this shaver has gone up in price by 30 dollars since this time last year.</li>
            <li> Original blade unit is still sharp.</li>
            <li> A couple things about the actual features...Pretty easy to clean, though the manual is somewhat confusing (yeah, I&#x27;m one of those that read manuals too).</li>
            <li> Being a traditionalist, I was at first taken back by the design.</li>
            <li> Rotary seems like a good choice, though using the round method to shave is much more difficult than I thought.</li>
            <li> The quality of this shaver versus lesser cost units and brands is evident in every facet of it&#x27;s construction and operation.</li>
            <li> What first stood out to me was how quiet the unit is.</li>
            <li> first let&#x27;s get a basic question out of the way</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done it is a very low shave, way better than any other electric razors I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> I have never been impressed with electric shavers in the past, but I&#x27;m tired of bleeding every time I shave with a normal multi-blade razor.  </li>
            <li> As a person who has been using a blade for more than 20 years I was not able to shave well with this razor.  </li>
            <li> Then open the chambers and run the hot water under the blades and all over the chamber floor.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is a simple hot water rinse.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first rotary shaver since I switched to foil shavers back in the mid-90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> For the past two years, it hasn&#x27;t been able to hold a charge, and I had been using it while plugged in to the wall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a more expensive option, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> This thing shaves so much better than other electric razors, and does just as well of a job as my 3-blade standard razor.</li>
            <li> A hot water rinse of the heads only takes a minute.  </li>
            <li> Who knows, the 2D model may provide a better shave due to different blades and a pop off trimmer.  </li>
            <li> to the cleaning solution, Braun shaver has bit higher operational cost, but extra convenience in use.</li>
            <li> At first it was so quiet</li>
            <li> (this is the 3rd saver i buy in the last 3 years and only now i am satisfied).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really not sure how much better it can get.  </li>
            <li> , I missed a couple spots but my problem areas without extra effort was smoother than I had ever been able to get it with any other type of razor.</li>
            <li> I thought be upgrading to a more expensive model with my next one it would work even better....</li>
            <li> my problem comes in, first it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, second</li>
            <li> I got the Norelco, I charged it up and the next day took it for its first test drive.  </li>
            <li> The first instinct with this electric is to do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I decided to drop the extra money to buy the higher end 1250x over a year ago, after having one of the $40 Norelco models that lasted me almost 3 years.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if anyone can ever make a better electric shaver than the Braun Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first turned this one on, it was so quiet that I thought it might be faulty</li>
            <li> I gave it to a co-worker who at first didn&#x27;t want it either for the same reasons</li>
            <li> least it is easy to daily clean.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with a great product, superclean shave - however it strikes me as extraordinarily retarded that you can only charge it with the stand.  </li>
            <li> This shaver which looks a bit like a small Martian creature gives me the most rapid and close shaves ever.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t necessarily faster than other Norelco models, but the results are notably better.   </li>
            <li> As usual i read all the reviews before purchasing;looked at the opposition and asked my son who lives in Singapore what he thought of the latest model as he has</li>
            <li> He totally loves it and unlike some of the reviews listed it did not irritate him at all during the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Nowhere near a blade!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a bunch of different 3D models but they primarily differ in the features that don&#x27;t directly relate to the shave, such as the battery life</li>
            <li> usually spend around $60 for a shaver but decided to upgrade and go for a better one.  </li>
            <li> but it gets pretty close and without the occasional nicks and cuts</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for the past 25 years now and they just keep getting better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got the basic feats of the more advanced models, without the cost and unnecessary added</li>
            <li> Heads have to be cleaned much more often than other Norelco shavers because there is essentially no capacity to hold the shaved hair particles.</li>
            <li> I decided that since it&#x27;s going to cost me the price of a new razor to get a new shaver head that I would find a replacement head for my old 8020X.</li>
            <li> I know there is a time to get use to electric shavers but my neck felt right at home with this shaver, and I have just a slight bit of irritation, nothing like I had years ago trying to get use to the electric shaver I first had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It shaves easy, with little irritation.</li>
            <li> The older, 2D type, appears to do the job reasonably well, especially when I use the Norelco shaver lubricant frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes you have to open each head individually, but you don&#x27;t have to take the head apart to clean it</li>
            <li> Both Norelco and Braun offer money back trial periods, so my main advice is to not overthink the decision or put too much stock in reviews like this one.  </li>
            <li> and I would need to make several passes to get all the stubble, and still there was some left on my neck that I would quickly clean up with my fusion proglide.    </li>
            <li> It is actually easier to clean than any of my earlier Norelco razors.  </li>
            <li> I use an old tooth brush to clean it after every wet shave.</li>
            <li> The third dimension of movement for the shaving heads really does make a difference , particularly on the neck area.</li>
            <li> every other shave to remind you to clean it.  </li>
            <li> decide to just use the other cheaper razor and just get a close shave instead of the clean shave.</li>
            <li> That being said, there are a couple less positive things that are worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> Getting the last green light of the charge indicator means I have 3-6 days left before a recharge--not a particularly accurate indicator.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts enough for a several shaves, and charging an empty battery is incredibly fast, can&#x27;t ask for more in this department.  </li>
            <li> My old norelco didn&#x27;t have this problem; if hair ever came out (rarely) it was because i&#x27;d gone over a week without emptying it, but at least it holds a weeks worth!  </li>
            <li> My beard, thin but wiry, is too challenging for most other brands.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave, no prickly skin afterwards, no need to press down hard, the flex head is fantastic in going over the chin/neck contours.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to start shaving with this new Norelco.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my 10 year old started getting slower speed, I decided to order a new one.  </li>
            <li> The new one requires you to charge it using the charging stand, you can&#x27;t just plug the charging cord into the bottom of the shaver like the old one.</li>
            <li> But this is a very minor quibble, and not one worth taking a star off for.  </li>
            <li> But this is a very minor quibble, and not one worth taking a star off for.  </li>
            <li> I found that on previous shavers, it might slip around in my hand on the smooth surfaces.</li>
            <li> Clearly Norelco is no longer interested in providing a quality product nor properly servicing their existing customers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it lasts as long as my prior Norelco, over 20 years, the price will have been cheap.</li>
            <li> The guide covers 6 model types so it can be a bit confusing at first but all the needed information is available and in detail.</li>
            <li> They just didnt cut like my first and second norelco&#x27;s of old.</li>
            <li> Overall, not worth the approximatly $70 more for the SensoTouch 3D unit.</li>
            <li> Yes, this razor sells for too much money considering it barely outperforms my old razor that is a Philips Norelco 8240XL.</li>
            <li> The rotary heads are not close enough to the edge to do a good job of shaving the upper lip next to the nose, and the heads scrape against the upper lip hair (hurting) and I have to keep going over the same area over and over to get a close shave</li>
            <li> Then you give it a little shake and let it dry on its own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to make your Norelco battery last longer, every six months or so make sure you let the battery run down to below \\&quot;0\\&quot; on the charge indicator - until it stops.</li>
            <li> When I began looking for a new (and also my first) electric shaver, I spent several weeks researching and comparing products and the norelco just seemed to be the right buy.</li>
            <li> As a first time user I had to go through several shaves to adjust to the electric shaver and there was minor irritation on the first days.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s still far from closing on manual blades&#x27; smoothness, so beware sensitive skins!</li>
            <li> A simple U shaped cradle with a flat bottom that can sit flat on any surface would be better.      </li>
            <li> My four year old made the comment the other day that he liked that I didn&#x27;t have a &#x27;sharp beard&#x27;.     </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that was possible – a dry shave as smooth as you can get without the razor</li>
            <li> (Black men are more susceptible to razor bumps than white men because of the course curly nature of our hair).</li>
            <li> Traditional razors tend to irritate my skin the most, and through experimentation over the years, I have found that Norelco brand razors tend to irritate my skin much less than all the others.  </li>
            <li> This unit is much better than previous Norelcos I&#x27;ve owned especially in \\&quot;angled\\&quot; spaces -</li>
            <li> But now dry shaving is the weekday routine when I&#x27;m rushing to get ready for office and don&#x27;t have much time.</li>
            <li> sure to check Walmart in your area to see if it is on clearance as above stated I got mine for less then a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li> Amazon CS took care of business and send me out a replacement quickly, however when I finally got a chance to open it, it appeared that the box had been opened before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, if I would need to buy a new shaver again, I&#x27;d buy this one again!</li>
            <li> The heads on the old one were getting gross and instead of paying for new heads (which can cost as much as upgrading) got this 1250x instead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve accumulated quite a few electric razors over the years, with the three most recent being the new models from Norelco, Braun and Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The cons: the flip-up trimmer is not as good as older Norelco shavers; there are 3 seperate compartments that capture hair and it fills up quickly, requiring emptying about every day; my major complaint is that it requires use of the charging stand and does not plug in directly, which sucks for traveling.</li>
            <li> The unit is light, fits the hand very well, has a convenient pop up trimmer, and can be used, wet, dry, and in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It shaves fine, just not fantastic, and the one nit I have is that if I go 3 days without shaving, it tugs and pulls vs lifts and cuts in spots.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic was not seriously considered, especially since I prefer a quick, dry shave, but I looked at it for my son.  </li>
            <li> you are a picky shaver and enjoy shaving with shaving cream, you can even use that here, as the shaver has special stops to prevent shaving cream from destroying the system as it will with other shavers.</li>
            <li> I prefer the shape of the smaller rounder Norelcos, even though I have large hands.</li>
            <li> (1255x was the specific box item) from the large bulk membership-required store.  </li>
            <li> I have wet shaved and in more recent years used a Braun series 5 for the last 7 years and a Remington before that I am 62 semi retired and was not interested in the self cleaning model as i have &#x27;PLENTY&#x27; of time to clean the unit.</li>
            <li> So you need to constantly peer at the mirror to ensure that Secondly, its far less effective if you want to shave in the evening and then again in the morning    4.</li>
            <li> It does pinch me a little lower on my neck, but I&#x27;ll take the pain for smooth skin.</li>
            <li> As a daily-use razor it is definitely worth every single dollar!</li>
            <li> Even though it was still working relatively well, I wanted a little better shave for my aging face.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve bought the top line shaver from the three major shaver manufacturers (Braun, Panasonic, Phillips/Norelco) &amp; tried them out side by side.</li>
            <li> a little better I&#x27;ll probably go back to the Braun as it has the self cleaner.</li>
            <li> with the original cutters that cost about half the price.  </li>
            <li> have a hard time with any razor and my beard on my neck, as most do.</li>
            <li> I would have to press considerably hard with the head on the skin, pluck those hairs, or use the extendable trimmer in these situations (many times it was a combination).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to tell how many electric razors I&#x27;ve bought through the years - 50? 75?</li>
            <li> speed - the 3D is the clear winner here.</li>
            <li> Nothing severe, but it is clearly a notch below the others on the comfort</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been overly happy with the cheaper Philips products in the past and had changed to a microfoil shaver which I had been using for the past 12 months.</li>
            <li> However, coming from using a traditional 5-blade razor, I can&#x27;t get a shave quite a smooth using the Norelco, even when shaving wet with shave</li>
            <li> Yes it has triple cut action, but the inner and middle circles are very different, and it appears to make a huge difference in the shave.  </li>
            <li> If you want a shaver that you have to clean less frequently, but that gives an inferior shave, there are plenty of them on the market.    </li>
            <li> (Note the instructions clearly do say you can use it in the shower and</li>
            <li> over the last 12 years I&#x27;ve purchased roughly 6 electric shavers all hoping they will be the cure to leaving my skin smooth and irritation free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also had no trouble with the blades getting near the hairs near my nose.  </li>
            <li> While it works, it&#x27;s great but don&#x27;t  count on it lasting just because it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco customer for over forty years, but I think I&#x27;m ready to change over to a different product.  </li>
            <li> I have to use my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery charges and holds charge, no water damage even though I use it frequently in the shower.</li>
            <li> After using a Remington Electric razor for about 6 months I was ready to go back to blade razors.</li>
            <li> Not enough flex or something I really dont know?</li>
            <li> He has one of the thickest beards I&#x27;ve ever seen (this is a kid who has to shave his back before dates), and this razor really does the job.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver for my husband for Christmas because his old Norleco shaver had worn out.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to think about how much energy is wasted by running the hot water faucet until you actually get to having hot water</li>
            <li> Will it completely replace my manual razor  4.</li>
            <li> charging times are fast and the rechargeable battery has lasted for almost two weeks now without having been recharged (used on a daily basis) which I think is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have had shaving rash on my neck all my adult life...</li>
            <li> To get a really close shave, which I like, this shaver doesn&#x27;t actually save me any time.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve used the Norelco, the old one will be consigned to the shaver graveyard.  </li>
            <li> but this has stopped completely with the 1250X.  </li>
            <li> but this has stopped completely with the 1250X.  </li>
            <li> I have been using an old Norelco \\&quot;Advantage\\&quot; razor for over 6 years and decided to upgrade to the 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d.</li>
            <li> His old Norelco no longer held a charge.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that it outworks my old razor.</li>
            <li> Some of them have personal cleaning systems that you don&#x27;t really need.</li>
            <li> I shave in a fraction of the time it took my old one and</li>
            <li> Amazon provided a $30 rebate form at the time of purchase that was directly from Philips Norelco.  </li>
            <li> The 3 heads move independently and while they are very \\&quot;cool\\</li>
            <li> However, I was amazed that not only did I get a really close shave</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a requirement to use the cradle instead of attaching the cable directly to the shaver.  </li>
            <li> It adds considerable bulk to my charger drawer.    </li>
            <li> Wow I guess my beard needed to adjust or something</li>
            <li> My next plan is to use a straight razor for the neck and try this for everything else.     </li>
            <li> My son has sensitive skin and has struggled with shaving with a blade because of his acne.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband to replace a 15 year old Norelco shaver that was just worn out.  </li>
            <li> so he was nursing the old one along.  </li>
            <li> It is now 2 months after the 2 year warranty, so it seems I am completely out of luck at this point.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was ready to send it back yesterday, but I decided to give it another try.</li>
            <li> So this is a big improvement in speed, and it&#x27;s a much closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can accept having to use shaving cream if it means I can get a perfectly smooth shave in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> My old shaver was like that, and I was always worried about running out of charge mid-way into my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as performance</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> Quite surprised at how close this shaver shaves me.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at how close the shave was based on the reviews I have read on these pages.</li>
            <li> I had an old shaver that didn&#x27;t work too well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades have a pretty long life.</li>
            <li> but this razor is capable and the experience was terrific.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace a 2 year old Braun Series 3, which compared to the newer series 7</li>
            <li> I still feel it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my old foil razor, but I&#x27;m getting the technique of close shaves.</li>
            <li> My old foil razor shaved close but it also ate holes in the foils so I had to replace them about every three months.</li>
            <li> I used the \\&quot;old style\\&quot; Norelco for years.</li>
            <li> but I have been using for 5 months and so far I have saved $20 on gillettes .</li>
            <li> The 9160 is 5 years old.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly very quiet and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> you know the old line about the \\&quot;heir and a spare\\&quot;..  :</li>
            <li> well, out comes that old braun shaver and WOW, it still holds a charge and still works..</li>
            <li> it provides very close shaves especially with shaving foam.</li>
            <li> This however, leads to irritation, and frequent cuts around my jaw line.     </li>
            <li> It not only cut it, but it was a VERY close shave and no irritation.</li>
            <li> , we guys have to struggle with shaving nearly every day - don&#x27;t skimp out.  </li>
            <li> Many reviewers complained about the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> They cost nearly $200.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the coolest looking crappy shavers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Near my sideburns and nose, these rotary razors cannot shave at all.  </li>
            <li> I did research to learn about shavers for sensitive skin and this was my choice.  </li>
            <li> Wish you could just plug the cord directly into the razor to charge it</li>
            <li> the years I have tried a number of razors--any number of traditional one-to-four blade straight (disposable) handles, as well as electric units from Remington and Norelco.  </li>
            <li> We ordered the shaver, including (and I quote)\\&quot; SensoTouch 3D 1250X/40 razor, charging stand, soft pouch for travel and storage, protective cap, power cord, and cleaning brush.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> But it isn&#x27;t anywhere near the shave that my Braun 790 was.  </li>
            <li> I love a traditional wet shave with a double edge and a quality shaving cream.</li>
            <li> When he tried the 1250X/40 he said he preferred the old shaver, the 7310.  </li>
            <li> My old Braun 760 sounded like a lawnmower.</li>
            <li> A lot closer shave than my old electric shaver and the battery</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll wish I could plug the cord directly into it, so I wouldn&#x27;t need the charging stand when traveling.</li>
            <li> Use a fragrant-free lotion, if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> This Norelco replaces my old Braun 8585.</li>
            <li> This is where the problem begins - on the Phiillps website the MSRP for a replacement head is $64.99, but they are no longer being made so the few available ones are being offered at inflated prices.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was gettinng it with my 2 year old self cleaning BRAUN PULSONIC 7.But when the trimmer broke</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 years old</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see an improvement over my old Braun or the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by how well the shaving heads countored to my face.  </li>
            <li> I always had sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Also the Li-ion battery does not suffer from memory like the old ni-cads.</li>
            <li> So far the battery life is exemplary.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no way to run the shaver directly on AC.</li>
            <li> likely it will not go very well, but I&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have to resort to my 12y old philips shaver to get the job done...  </li>
            <li> My old one did not.</li>
            <li> As with the old Norelco you can accidently shut it off with your thub when shaving.</li>
            <li> , the shaving cream was old</li>
            <li> would probably get an extra replacement head if ordering again, but then, you don&#x27;t really know what improvements might be there in 3 or 6 years</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m frequently away for 2-3 weeks, and I do not need to bring a charger with me).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Also, if one has a longer stubble, one might use the extendable trimmer to do a first pass or to get a pesky long hair or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was made on a Monday or Friday as the old saying goes</li>
            <li> Remington Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel 5 oz.</li>
            <li> The Braun has three speeds so you can go slower for sensitive areas and intensive on less-sensitive places.</li>
            <li> The Norelco soft case does not hold the stand</li>
            <li> This model was made in 2010 making it about two years old.</li>
            <li> I had an old Braun.</li>
            <li> old Norelco trimmer).  </li>
            <li> I replaced my old Panasonic 2 blades shaver with this 1250X.  </li>
            <li> Wow,</li>
            <li> but i dont think the shave is as close as my old norelco.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this shaver in 2012, after a year the unit stopped working completely, I contacted Phillips, they asked a lot of questions about how I recharged the unit.  </li>
            <li> This Norelco destroys my old shaver.  </li>
            <li> This replaced my two year old Panasonic Shaver.</li>
            <li> Using a circular motion while shaving improves the results to near that of a razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco razors since the early 50s</li>
            <li> It probably took me about a minute to complete the shave.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> My old electric razor gave me razor burns on my neck.  </li>
            <li> and I think the the 3D swivel action along with the blade configuration is what makes it all happen.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco 7810XL  needed replacment.</li>
            <li> This model(and the 1150/40 for that matter) are not your old fashioned lawn mower type of electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that you have to take the whole charging unit with you when you travel.</li>
            <li> He was used to the old razors with the gel inside the razor.  </li>
            <li> i already had a philips norelco razor (about 4-5 years old) and decided to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad, a 50+ year old man.</li>
            <li> I wear mustache, so it was a problem to shave near them and to trim them.</li>
            <li> IS THE LAST ONE FOR ME.AMAZONS PRICE WAS LOWER THAN THE SHAVERS WEBSITE,VERY REASONABLE.</li>
            <li> in all, for nearly $200 dollars, I received 2 $100 shaves.  </li>
            <li> In fact, they are almost completely eliminated.</li>
            <li> quiet you figure it can&#x27;t have much power.</li>
            <li> It works very well and the battery charge seems to last for weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace my old, worn out Philips Norelco razor of over 6+ years.  </li>
            <li> Nearly two hundred</li>
            <li> I have to keep and use my old style razor with trimmer  to complete my shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;JUST GET THE SIDEBURN TRIMMER SITUATION FIXED</li>
            <li> This shaver is a replacement for my 8470XL, ruined by an over zealous TSA agent, who thought it looked like a gun - dismantled the top and misplaced the entire head assembly -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The slip-over cover for the 3D heads was the first I&#x27;ve owned that didn&#x27;t break after the first few months.   </li>
            <li> In the end it wasn&#x27;t worth the constant razor burn and extra time to shave as it often missed hairs.  </li>
            <li> I only had it a few days as, again, I was looking for more of a beard trimmer</li>
            <li> matter how good the 12xx series Norelco&#x27;s are, they are useless if they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> my philips sonicare toothbrush (about 6 months old) followed the razor into failure mode but this charger is not stupid, its smart and the toothbrush still runs but does not vibrate..</li>
            <li> If you let the battery run down, a 3-5 minute charge will get you a full shave.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t tried this shaver wet, my past experience has always been that a dry shave is closer &amp; more comfortable with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It makes me wonder if they even sell it anymore, or are more interested in getting new razors to retailers, rather than returning customers, who&#x27;s Norelco product has failed on them.  </li>
            <li> At first i bought this razor due to the high ratings, I thought that maybe i should update my old razor with a high-end product like this one.</li>
            <li> Like any new razor it takes a few tries to figure out problem areas, but once you get that down it works great.</li>
            <li> Not easily done with this one with the way the 3 heads open as well as many metal snag points for the towel.  </li>
            <li> I used this with shaving gel and dry, but never got very good results, and it even began cutting my face in certain sensitive areas, namely above the lip.</li>
            <li> As I said , it&#x27;s very light, very slim and the battery charge lasts through over a dozen uses (which for my father now are long, slow shaves).</li>
            <li> My new Norelco has given me nothig but close, comfortable shaves, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always not easy to find, but some stores carry it and it is easily available online, including Amazon.</li>
            <li> I first tried the shaver on a dry skin</li>
            <li> Just rinse under hot water and let it dry.</li>
            <li> &amp; so I let my beard grow for a full two and a half days.</li>
            <li> Still gives a great shave, I&#x27;ve gotten a little lazy and at times if I don&#x27;t go over my chin enough</li>
            <li> The head cover is hard to remove and sometimes the  head comes off when I remove its cover, but it is very easy to put the head back on.  </li>
            <li> The shaver works fine, but no better, faster, or closer than the 8 year old $40 dollar model that it replaced.</li>
            <li> The design is some different than my previous ones, but easy to adapt to.  </li>
            <li> The razor is easy to use and works on wet or dry face.  </li>
            <li> My last Norelco shaver, which was very adequate, took up a lot less space in my suitcase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I quickly blow dry the blades with a hair dryer on low temperature.  </li>
            <li> I like the old shaver better and would probably think seriously about getting it repaired if I hadn&#x27;t bought this one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor to replace an older model Norelco that I had for several years because the battery completely died.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I expected more, performance wise, based on Consumer Reports review, but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I know my wife is tired of hearing from both of us how much we like our new razors, but we are still amazed at how much better the shaves are than what we thought was possible.  </li>
            <li> What you get for the extra money is a slight improvement in the shave, a bit better design, and a few somewhat useful bells and whistles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d owned: a quiet, smooth wet shave and a very acceptable dry shave.</li>
            <li> liked the fact that this razor can be used wet or dry, but after 3 weeks of daily use, I still could not get a close enough shave and my shaving time  doubled.</li>
            <li> The SensoTouch 3D shaving system easily removes the long hairs due to the way the heads conform to your neck &amp; jaw line.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor because my old braun broke and I was looking for some thing that could be cleaned and rinsed with plain old water instead of having to by special cleaning kits.</li>
            <li> My husband is not into trying new things, his old razor was about 15 years old and he couldn&#x27;t find the same module</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this new shaver is nice but not what I would consider an improvement over the old one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First the is the small trimmer that you push out will take you like 45 minutes to cut your facial hair (and I have very light facial hair, and never thick).</li>
            <li> and he has to clean it everyday because it holds no shavings.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who is a marine and must be clean shaven everyday.</li>
            <li> It was quick and it took less than three minutes.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s some highlights of how this compares to older units such as the Speed-XL line (which you can still find).    </li>
            <li> However after having used a razor like the Speed-XL, the Senso seems excessively long and narrow (it&#x27;s like trying to shave with a stick) while the Speed fits my hand better and is easier to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> When I first turned it on, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working properly, so I turned it off &amp; back on again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an older style Norelco for 5 years and after replacing the blades several times, decided I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li> Main issue is that after 10 weeks, razor ceased working ... totally died.  </li>
            <li> It was like the first time behind the wheel of a well crafted sorts car after spending a lifetime driving cheap sedans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have owned several Norelco electric razors over the past forty years and all have been pleased with all of them.  </li>
            <li> It was kinda cool to be able to drop this thing on it&#x27;s charge base and it would clean for the next use.</li>
            <li> This does a decent job but does not provide a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> In fact my first electric razor was a double head back in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> However, now about 11 months later, the exact same problem is occurring with the replacement I was sent.  </li>
            <li> When this razor does die then I will definitely buy another exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I decided to replace my old Norelco razor that had the lotion and ability to wet shave because Philips Norelco stopped supporting it.</li>
            <li> This Norelco razor simply will not give me a decent shave, even after shaving for 10-15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I called in the next day and got the exact same</li>
            <li> It also offers three settings (gentle, normal and intensive) that vary the speed of the cutters, a feature the other two lack.</li>
            <li> It also offers three settings (gentle, normal and intensive) that vary the speed of the cutters, a feature the other two lack.</li>
            <li> After charging I was surprised to find it shaved under my chin, something no other electric could ever do.</li>
            <li> I spoke to an extremely unhelpful customer service supervisor named Claudine, and all she could tell me to do was to clean the shaver, in the middle of a shave;</li>
            <li> Searched high and low, read reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, and compared value and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The only two things that I can criticize about the SensoTouch is the high cost of the replacement heads and the trimmer placement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d of purchased such a high priced shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it, especially at Amazon&#x27;s competitive price.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this razor, especially for people (like me) who are used to a blade and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> A high end razor should last longer than a cheaper one and replacement blades should not be obsolete or overpriced while they are still selling the</li>
            <li> The charging stand is light and folds up to occupy very little space when not in use.</li>
            <li> and I have used a few other electric razors and many of the new multi-blade manual razors.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry, the shave is comfortable and close.</li>
            <li> Works great,Good smooth shave and even has a larger head than my previous Norelco&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> and I found this rotary shaver is designed to give a smooth shave in dry or wet conditions.</li>
            <li> The Braun shaver was uncomfortable when shaving my head, the Norelco is so comfortable and quick.  </li>
            <li> It does a very close shave quickly even if you have 3 or 4 days of thick stubble.</li>
            <li> Charges fast, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been surprised with how much they&#x27;ve improved in the last ten years.  </li>
            <li> The cord was small &amp; easily fit in my travel shaver bag.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really say how long it will go without charging.  </li>
            <li> I am really upset I waited this long to spend the money on a topshelf shaver....</li>
            <li> great shave but very expensive razor</li>
            <li> and if I were the one doing it, I think I&#x27;d opt for a Foil razor which requires long, straight strokes &amp; should produce a closer shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver shaves very close and even gets the long hairs on my neck that my Braun electric shaver could not get.  </li>
            <li> My past shaver was a cheap Panasonic wet/dry dual blade (ES4026NC).  </li>
            <li> Smooth shaving and without the usual razor burn</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was just another empty sales pitch.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it,it shaved off 4 days of stubble with absolutely no problem.    </li>
            <li> It took a few shaves to get used to the heads being placed further apart than with a standard Norelco (so they have room to pivot), so there&#x27;s more need to use a circular motion.  </li>
            <li> So for the next few days it is BACK to the BLADE... :-)</li>
            <li> You use hot water when the three circular blade compartments are closed</li>
            <li> not only took longer than a normal non electric razor</li>
            <li> This thing is so quiet, so powerful, so versatile and so smooth that I&#x27;ve never experienced an electric shaver like it</li>
            <li> as it is not important to have such a close shave anymore, it is fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1) Don&#x27;t press hard - use an easy touch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1) Don&#x27;t press hard - use an easy touch.</li>
            <li> It even gently cut my thick beard hairs and I didn&#x27;t even have to use the trimmer attachment first!  </li>
            <li> I normally shave with the grain (up to down) and then shave sideways (left to right).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that hard - pop all 3 heads and then use running water in the sink - but it has to be done more often than the lower-end Norelcos with bigger compartments.  </li>
            <li> Please know that while Amazon only began selling it today, the shaver has been available from other sources since mid August.</li>
            <li> Contacted Panasonic via online chat and they sent me a replacement handle without much fuss (although I have to ship the original back to them...prepaid at least).  </li>
            <li> yr old son is prone to razor bumps - need to be able to minimize that  Has to be able to handle thick, tough beard and shave relatively close  Trimmer for sideburns and/or beard depending on his style of the week  </li>
            <li> i have never had such a close,comfortable shave as with this new phillips norelco 1250x.  </li>
            <li> Enough said it&#x27;s $53 for a new blade set.</li>
            <li> So I ordered a new 1250-40 model norelco and now I get the quiet shave and efficiency in beard handling.  </li>
            <li> You cannot properly trim with these new style trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Really close dry shave.</li>
            <li> I always dry shave, and doing so with the 3D works very well.  </li>
            <li> For the last 6 -7 years I&#x27;ve used top of the line Braun razors and prior had tried a Norelco, the wet / dry version that dispensed shaving lotion.     </li>
            <li> ; I get too much irritation on my neck dry shaving with the SensoTouch.  </li>
            <li> This razor, with the floating heads, gives a much closer shave then the older Norelco style, I was previously shaving with.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> My last two nivea norelcos, and the archtect or some such really sucked.</li>
            <li> His old shaver (Norelco) was only a couple years old</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quiet that it seems strange at first.   </li>
            <li> Yet, the motor is less powerful</li>
            <li> If you have light facial hair or plan on using this razor a few days out of the week you&#x27;re in business.</li>
            <li> Only traditional shavers can provide you a very close shave in that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why these higher end models cost so much.</li>
            <li> However I find myself constantly going back to the straight razor to get one spot that 1250x can&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> I can truthfully say that even though it was quite expensive, it can give me a very close shave without burning me, I do use Willaims Lectric Shave liquid.  </li>
            <li> I have used this style (triple head) razor for many years and at least 4 prior designs from Norelco.  </li>
            <li> (although for most travelers it shouldn&#x27;t matter, I get at least ten shaves between charging, probably closer to twenty).</li>
            <li> I have never used the most expensive electric shavers so I could not compare this product to those, however I have used this product for about 4 months and find it very satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only problem i have with this shaver is that it is much bulkier than my last shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;Norelco looks more stylish while standing on its base on the sink counter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have another son, who was shaving with a very old speed xl razor that has no battery life left.  </li>
            <li> This shaver does exactly what every other shaver before it does.</li>
            <li> The recipient states that this razor is like no other electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every major brand made.  </li>
            <li> This is a major benefit for the 1250X40.</li>
            <li> and so are the replacement heads apparently!</li>
            <li> I wish Norelco would do a major redesign on the functional aspects.</li>
            <li> Combined with the inward-and-outward flexibility of the 3D&#x27;s heads, this is a major advance.</li>
            <li> This leads to my major issue.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it even at the higher price than other models..</li>
            <li> I usualy get Panasonic or Remington or other brands but this is my first Norelco.</li>
            <li> I just make it a practice to rinse them with hot water every couple of days and leave them open to dry.  </li>
            <li> do most of my shaving dry, as I am to lazy to use foam or gel.</li>
            <li> like this far more as a wet shaver than dry, it doesn&#x27;t get as close in dry mode, but this might just be a personal thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charging the razor is a simple matter of easily sliding it into a small stand.</li>
            <li> neck - this is the most difficult area for most shavers, and all of these models left a few errant hairs here and there.</li>
            <li> Decent razor as long as it works.</li>
            <li> As far as cons since it is round and not flat like other razors you aren&#x27;t able to get some spots</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> The price is a little steep for a razor, but I think it will be well worth it.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers complained that you have to clean the razor too frequently.  </li>
            <li> Typically when you buy a newer model (particularly at this price), you expect an improvement from older and lower priced units.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the quality of the shave is acceptable, since I wasnt too particular with my manual shave also on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> so I wondered why would anybody want to shave wet when shaving dry is so convenient and quick.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for many years and one of my main compaints over the years is the fact that it&#x27;s often difficult to get a close shave with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> , it has all the features of his old norelco shaver with some additional features and a new swivel to the heads to make shaving the chin easier, it also comes with a travel carry case and a very nice charging base.</li>
            <li> Second, the width of the slide up trimmer is narrower than on the older and cheaper models, which makes sideburns harder to trim straight, Third,</li>
            <li> totally shocked by how great.</li>
            <li> I have experienced no skin irritation at any time using this product, and gone are the painful nicks of a razor blade and the drying effects of shaving lotions.</li>
            <li> I generally replace them every four or five years</li>
            <li> Apparently men old enough to shave still need to be reminded about this.</li>
            <li> It provided a very close shave but also missed a lot of whiskers, so it took a long time and a lot of going back and forth and stretching and pinching of my skin to get everything.   </li>
            <li> His old one finally wore out after about 25 years of service.</li>
            <li> So much hair is left on my face, I would only use this if I wanted the short stubble look.</li>
            <li> I guess this is more a personal observation than a complaint, but I present it for your review and information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess this is more a personal observation than a complaint, but I present it for your review and information.    </li>
            <li> As far as the different versions of the Sensotouch 3d, I decided to go with the cheapest version.</li>
            <li> Several weeks ago my old Norelco went the way of all gadgets.</li>
            <li> When the battery drains far enough the shaver just turns off and has to be charged again.   </li>
            <li> Quiet, close shave, it did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (My last Braun shaver had a cord that could plug into the charger stand or directly into the shaver.</li>
            <li> My old Braun series 5 foil shaver was loud enough to annoy anyone sleeping in the next room.</li>
            <li> I only just recently had to charge it for the 1st time, so it really does last for a lot of shaves.     </li>
            <li> but until now, never really notices much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If I were to purchase another razor again, at this point, I would skip this series, and go back to acordless model using the HQ-9 heads, which lasted me nearly 5 years</li>
            <li> It slides out, but just barely.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it twice so far</li>
            <li> I definitely get a closer shave than with the old model.  </li>
            <li> I also have the luxury of a 15 year old in need of a razor, without the same \\&quot;refined\\&quot; criteria that I have.  </li>
            <li> the only drawbacks i found are the blades are not close enough to the edge (like my old 7775X) to trim off the hairs near the nose.</li>
            <li> It does not shave as close as the old traditional Speed XL type.</li>
            <li> I wonder if it will last like my earlier Norelco&#x27;s since it seems more delicate.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the Foil razors are noisier, so that would be one drawback.</li>
            <li> Also it didn&#x27;t shave very close, i was already rough around 12pm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I finally replaced an old Norelco rotary shave with this one.</li>
            <li> On the old style the clasp to open it was at the front</li>
            <li> The 3D is the only shaver in the lineup thus far to have them.  </li>
            <li> 67 db at 6 inches is about a quarter as loud as the Braun Series 7 (79-80 db); with the Braun Series 5 in the middle.  </li>
            <li> Norelco&#x27;s apparently has detergent and lubrication.</li>
            <li> Purchased the 1250x as an upgrade to my 2 year old philips norelco that looks similar in form.</li>
            <li> im back to my old ways.</li>
            <li> I actually have a rechargeable unit that is probably six or seven years old that is still running, that I use as a spare.  </li>
            <li> It is only meant for a fixed location.</li>
            <li> I could use this wet, and I may eventually, and I suspect it would shave very close to blade closeness then -</li>
            <li> It was an upgrade from a 5-year old Norelco 7000 series model (or something similar).  </li>
            <li> Also very quiet, not the buzz saw of my old one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this razor for a couple of weeks, but so far it does everything I want in a razor.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally, I&#x27;ve used my old $50 Norelco.  </li>
            <li> You can barely hear it.  </li>
            <li> As far as saving me time shaving, I find just the opposite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a solid build that when dropped, does not break like my old shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its quieter (but the old one was already very quiet).</li>
            <li> If I had tried to do that with my old 7775X, it would have felt like each individual hair was being plucked from my head with a pair of tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Series 8000 now, apparently.  </li>
            <li> Though Norelco says that it takes about 30 days for your face to get used to its shaving heads, I think the reality is that it normally takes that long for the blades to wear to a point where they seat correctly in the shaving head.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is kind of lame, but I have a separate razor for that</li>
            <li> I bought a top of the line model but was never happy with the shave.  </li>
            <li> Probably the most frustrating thing is the fact that you can&#x27;t get through one, or maybe two, shaves before hair dust is spilling out all over your shirt.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is well worth the money, my boyfriend LOVES it, uses it EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> But given it&#x27;s expected long life, with quality shaves throughout, it&#x27;s probably still worth it.</li>
            <li> Cleaning in water and air-drying cannot be good for cutting edges.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer</li>
            <li> But the head wears out too quickly and despite the elegant aesthetic design requiring the entire very expensive head to be replaced two to three times a year (instead of just the blades) is a major industrial design flaw.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, the \\&quot;large-slot\\&quot; heads will work their way down the product line; until then it&#x27;s well worth paying the extra money for the 3D.</li>
            <li> very close shaving compared to other brand, ergonomically designed, very well built and battery last long.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, spending nearly $170 wasn&#x27;t high on my priority list either.</li>
            <li> negative is that you have to hand-clean each head which is easy to do only sometimes (if it cooperates).</li>
            <li> far as the quality, if I shave somewhat regularly, this razor does do a decent job, though it takes longer than traditional shaving as I do have to go over the same areas multiple times and that can leave your skin irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the long run time this isn&#x27;t a big issue for me, at least not with new strong batteries.  </li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for over 40 years, and while this model (I have model #1260x) shaves okay, the design is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> but it is less than stellar on my chin and in the mustache area.</li>
            <li> This all black model has the nicest, cleanest aesthetic of all the Norelco higher end models.</li>
            <li> The SensoTouch 3D got most of the hair all the other electric shaver usually miss.</li>
            <li> Due to the cleaning solution, Braun shaver has bit higher operational cost, but extra convenience in use.</li>
            <li> Then after three weeks it was a little better, but my neck would still get irritated a little.</li>
            <li> Shaving quality and comfort of this particular unit were acceptable, not great but not bad,</li>
            <li> There are a few differences between the old speed and smart touch xl razors compared to the 3D.  </li>
            <li> The Braun can be cleaned with water, but it&#x27;s hard to get it very clean since the cutter block is a single unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He is extremely picky and has very stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> why reviewers here think it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>
            <li> My face was a little tender after using it for a few weeks but got better after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> The Norelco CSR confirmed that my unit was bad, and offered a free replacement.  </li>
            <li> Serious backorder could indicate a manufacturing or design defect since there was no schedule for when handles will become available.</li>
            <li> He says it delivers the fastest cutting speed he has ever experienced, and he is careful to always buy the shavers highest recommended on Consumer Reports.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom-line, while cheaper units may do what you would consider the same job, the quality of the unit, the features and the convenience it offers would be reason enough to consider this electric shaver over others.</li>
            <li> just simply is nowhere near the closeness of a shave I get with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> As a mature male, I&#x27;ve become accustomed to a \\&quot;style\\&quot; of shaving and have been using various electric shavers for over twenty years.  </li>
            <li> the last one (8420 if I remember correct) was the wet/dry shaver about 5 years old and it finally gave up on me</li>
            <li> Ever since I was old enough to shave, my skin just does not work well with standard razers--I bleed all over.  </li>
            <li> They recommend obsessive cleaning that is totally unnecessary, and suggest cleaning the head under hot water, and sternly warn against getting hurt from the hot water.</li>
            <li> It is worth the few extra bucks over any thing cheaper.</li>
            <li> some spots if the skin is especially soft it will not cut the hair, no matter how many times you pass the cutting heads over.</li>
            <li> (And I&#x27;m not impressed very easily).  </li>
            <li> The suction cups on the base of the charging stand keeps it solid and secure in spite of the fact that it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> There should also be either a small place where you can plug it in directly (like many other, much cheaper models) or if it needs to be sealed for wet/dry then a small plastic collar adapter that will touch the charging contacts - allowing it to be plugged into the wall and charged in a hotel.      </li>
            <li> I can hardly get a full night&#x27;s sleep because I can&#x27;t wait to leap out of bed and stampede to the bathroom to shave.</li>
            <li> bought the least expensive 3D model since the only difference with the more expensive models are more sophisticated power indicators.</li>
            <li> The 3D stuff seems so gimmicky, but something with the razor is definitely doing it right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Feels a bit odd in my hand at first (I have big hands)&lt;br /&gt;No corded shaving</li>
            <li> You have to open each head independently for cleaning as opposed to older ones that the entire assembly popped open at the at the same time.</li>
            <li> The Wahl spray cleaner/lubricant is half the price of other cleaners such as Remington Shaver Saver and is available at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, you will not be disappointed...</li>
            <li> I generally put it back in the charger after it dries</li>
            <li> I have generally found electric shavers to offer closer shaves than regular blades, but that may be just dependent on how I use electric blades.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, fast, and cuts extremely close.     </li>
            <li> 3/12/2011 - I had electrics (rotary and foil; Norelco and Braun) when I was a teen and transitioned to a blade over time due to lack of a close shave or too much irritation.  </li>
            <li> My neck area became very irriated after shaving due to the multiple passes.  </li>
            <li> totally recommend to anyone thinking of purchaseing an electric shaver not to bother with any other and go straight to Philips and buy one of the 3D sensotouch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, fast, and cuts extremely close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t bare shaving every day for such a so so shave</li>
            <li> With the Panasonic &amp; Braun shavers, I frequently had to go over &amp; over these areas to get those stubborn long hairs.</li>
            <li> Further, Norelco apparently has no plans for a replacement.</li>
            <li> But, after trying it out for a few days, I have decided that this will be my first Amazon Return.</li>
            <li> Then, Amazon came riding up on the white steed and told me that if I was not satisfied, then send it back for a full refund.</li>
            <li> buying a new model every few years on the promises of \\&quot;New and Improved\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal but most standard 3 head electric razors have a large cavity below the cutting heads that can hold ample trimmings.  </li>
            <li> With a blade razor, you get used to making straight strokes -- whether up or down, or sideways.</li>
            <li> (1) Instructions for cleaning the shaving unit are for rinsing the razor heads closed under hot water \\&quot;for a few minutes\\&quot; followed by rinsing under hot water open \\&quot;for at least 30 seconds.\\&quot; That cleaning takes longer than shaving and uses as much hot water than shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li> The LED charging indicator is pretty cool and it charges right from the base.</li>
            <li> My previous Norelco was of the standard $40-$70 variety, and gave me 15 years of reliable service before getting noisy, sputtering, and generally being ready to conk out.  </li>
            <li> You also have to clean this shaver after every use because of the very small collection chambers.  </li>
            <li> You also have to clean this shaver after every use because of the very small collection</li>
            <li> I did not replace them whenever a \\&quot;new and advanced\\&quot; model appeared, but when I did, the improvements seemed to be minimal.</li>
            <li> Shaver was received as expected in condition (new)</li>
            <li> but I thought that was to be expected trying to get used to a new electric razor, but the rashes, pain and burning continued.</li>
            <li> Even the small details are done right...</li>
            <li> have a sensitive face, and the dry electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned before, burned my face.</li>
            <li> Always wash your face with soap &amp; water &amp; dry completely before shaving.</li>
            <li> The Norelco is a much closer shave and it gets odd hairs around the neck line with ease.  </li>
            <li> I use it dry and it runs circles around the old Braun I have.  </li>
            <li> I get very close shaves in less time than with the Panasonic for example.</li>
            <li> Philips is much much quieter than the Braun, with much less vibration too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Philips 1250 is much quieter than the Braun and causes me less irritation.</li>
            <li> It is less fancy but the shave is just as close and just as fast.  </li>
            <li> Whole process takes less than a minute.</li>
            <li> In a pinch you can use it with just water but having a gell or foam really makes for less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li> I charge it probably once every two weeks or less depending on how much its used.</li>
            <li> Thus far, all my shaves have been dry.</li>
            <li> My husband probably waited too long to replace his old Norelco, (they last forever), but he couldn&#x27;t be happier with this model.</li>
            <li> When you use shaving cream, use it like the manual says: First wet your face with water, then apply shaving cream, then wet your shaver with water, then shave (in that order)...</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace another Norelco cordless razor (don&#x27;t recall the exact model, but it used the almost as pricey HQ-9 heads) that I had misplaced en-route to recent deployment.  </li>
            <li> First I tried the Philips Norelco 8240 shaver when my old electric gave out, but couldn&#x27;t stand how it pulled long stubble that had grown after the last shave a few days earlier.  </li>
            <li> Luckily the battery holds at least two weeks without recharging, so this works for me.</li>
            <li> on my first shave i thought i may well have to give it a few weeks to get used to the different style of blade as opposed to the Braun</li>
            <li> It gives me face burn especially at the neck area a lot for the first few shaves, but it is going away.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that the trimmer is much narrower.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard, and I have smooth skin well past 8 PM after an early morning shave, and that ain&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was worth the price, but i would never go back to a regular razor ever again.</li>
            <li> I had a 2 day growth when I tried my new Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, wet shave, and I just could not believe when I was done, my face didn&#x27;t hurt, wasn&#x27;t red and beat-up</li>
            <li> Also, the shaver works in wet situations, but you really need lotion to ensure your skin does not get totally dry.</li>
            <li> Shaving is much quicker and requires less passes over the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable and not that expensive.</li>
            <li> That razor had served me faithfully for nearly 5 years, and I was only recently noticing the battery to not be lasting long.  </li>
            <li> The hair on my neck grows in a strange pattern and typically large amounts of hair get missed, if I use anything other than an actual razor.</li>
            <li> The shave quality was below average; it didn&#x27;t shave areas on my face particularly well.  </li>
            <li> It is now much easier &amp; with a little practice</li>
            <li> , it shaves very well, with little or no irritation.  </li>
            <li> - long battery life  CONS  - MAJOR CON FOR TRAVEL: the charger plugs into the stand, which then charges the shaver through some contact points.  </li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s not a big deal, the fact that it comes with the little flip-up straight section makes it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Philips could have made it a little better if they at least made it into a holder for the razor that could adhere to a vertical surface.</li>
            <li> It replaced a relatively new Remington that sounded like a threshing machine and very carefully pulled out the whiskers one at a time.</li>
            <li> but I would hardly say it was uncomfortable and I experienced no irritation or redness.    </li>
            <li> The new \\&quot;3d\\&quot; head, although gimmicky in title, is very percise and does not leave any area untreated, however, just like any other electric shaver, this too doesn&#x27;t provide the close shave that can be attained by an actual razor shave.  </li>
            <li> The first experience with this shaver was bad, my skin was getting very irritated, i guess i had to get used to it at first.</li>
            <li> There is a huge difference in the smoothness when shaving - this one just glides over the skin without irritating even a bit.</li>
            <li> His face is crazy baby smooth, and his sensitive skin has completely cleared of all ingrown hairs and blemishes.</li>
            <li> I use the dry Braun to clean up around my sideburns and ears, and any few rough places left over from my 1250 shave.  </li>
            <li> I love the process of shaving with a real razor because it&#x27;s relaxing and there&#x27;s a technique involved, but I hate doing it frequently because it takes time</li>
            <li> It certainly is more difficult to clean than other Philips razors I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li> Actually Norelco&#x27;s new shaver performance seems to be going down with time.  </li>
            <li> The other thing is that it takes one pass to clear my stubble as compared to my Braun which I felt I had to go over the same area twice.</li>
            <li> the pop-out trimmer is actually less useful than the previous gens for me, it is also a bit smaller in size which I see as a disadvantage.</li>
            <li> only negative so far is the high cost of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> of cutting system for keeping the heads clean is very poor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BTW, I have a medium (not too heavy) beard and don&#x27;t have too many problems with ingrown hairs or serious</li>
            <li> The razor head is huge and covers a broad area of the face which makes it difficult to see what you are doing causing you to stop and remove the electric razor to see your progress.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin or troubles with other electric razors.  </li>
            <li> A blog that I checked out recently had about 500 people who complained about the exact same thing!!!  </li>
            <li> I will still buy Norelco since I like the features and other shavers I have purchased have lasted far longer.  </li>
            <li> you can never go wrong with this,  a bit high,  but worth every penny,</li>
            <li> And it looks like the Alien in Alien when open to dry :-)</li>
            <li> After exhausting the special proprietary cleaning fluid canisters I bought with the razor, I got fed up and bought this razor.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s much less the case with the new</li>
            <li> I purchased this new razor through Amazon at about $65.00 less than retail including a rebate.</li>
            <li> - small head compartments require frequent cleaning to clear out accumulated hairs.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it much thought at first because it was so expensive</li>
            <li> I dropped my previous 8 year old Norelco razor and it never worked the same, even after I replaced the entire head assembly.</li>
            <li> This razor is much better than the previous models, my only complaint, and the reason I gave it 4 stars is because it fills with hair very quickly, causing the shave to be much worse after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> , I think it is  reasonable, although my Panasonic usually could last for 2-3 weeks per charge.  </li>
            <li> There were only a couple areas which required me to go back over, but it was minor.</li>
            <li> Leaves a clean shave and unless you are experiencing extreme temperature change after shaving the Senso Touch is delicate on your skin.</li>
            <li> Ate me up the first couple uses, but I think that was my fault for push to hard.</li>
            <li> A really close shave with very little effort.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I generally used it dry, only using the &#x27;wet&#x27; shave occasionally.   </li>
            <li> I also needed it to be a comfortable shave, and be able to shave at least once a day and it not be painful.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to try another electric razor, because they usually caused a lot of irritation to my skin.  </li>
            <li> If you tap the razor against the faucet to shake it out, generally one or two of heads will swing closed meaning they don&#x27;t get fully emptied.  </li>
            <li> Now, I have a 4yr old cheap $70 Philips shaver with the same cutting outcome and all the hair stays inside the shaver head.</li>
            <li> Much easier than the usual scraping of the face with a razor.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, however the razor absolutely chewed up my neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t have much power.  </li>
            <li> Made well and robust so far; not worth the cost though.</li>
            <li> Only a minor mistake</li>
            <li> so I was concerned when I bought it about how long it would last.</li>
            <li> Battery last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It gave a close shave, but the rotary head did not last long.</li>
            <li> As long as your hair is short.</li>
            <li> on my thick beard it can take 10-15 minutes to get a consistently close shave.</li>
            <li> True or False?</li>
            <li> This thing gets so close, has little irritation, the charge is long, and it feels high quality.</li>
            <li> the only way to use the razor is to charge it with the charger Panasonic included with the razor, but that&#x27;s not covered......seems pretty ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I usually take my older Norelco instead where I only need the shaver and cord.</li>
            <li> You can just charge it after every use rather than worrying about letting it run down completely before recharging it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You cannot connect the cord directly to the razor if the battery is down.  </li>
            <li> Even when I go for a few days without shaving and have a beard forming it takes it right back off without any trouble.</li>
            <li> I have been using a blade for the past month as I researched shavers, not willing to shoot out $200.00 right away.</li>
            <li> With my previous Norelco&#x27;s, I would consistently have long hairs under my chin or around the \\&quot;Adam&#x27;s Apple\\&quot; that would require five or six passes to chop down.</li>
            <li> I had shyed away from Norelco in the past due to the circular motion needed to shave with the rotary heads, in the past this had cuased more irritaiton than the foil shavers.  </li>
            <li> It left alot of hair, I am an afro american male It might work for other ethnicities.</li>
            <li> (i only dry shave)    </li>
            <li> and I actually prefer dry.</li>
            <li> What I was hoping for is to get a similar result while dry shaving with the 1250x</li>
            <li> The only drawback that I&#x27;ve found is that when used dry I need aftershave on my neck.</li>
            <li> Just lift each individual head, run the razor under water and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to spend this much money on a razor, but now am sorry</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut or leave your face dry and red.</li>
            <li> I did try the dry shave option but owing to the hair thickness left me irritate for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This Norelco is smoother and easier on the skin than the previous version I had (10 years old).</li>
            <li> Mine is less than two years old</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave with your skin as dry as possible.</li>
            <li> I have only used it in dry mode</li>
            <li> Then leave the heads open to dry.  </li>
            <li> Dry shaving leaves my skin red, corrected using shaving gel and after save</li>
            <li> A complete charge takes less than a hour and the shaver displays the status.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, i was afraid to buy it as I found that the replacement head costs about $189.99 for the RQ12 considering that it costs more than the actual shaver $179.95 (January 2015).&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li> and tried it for a few days (not the 30 recommended) and decided that it was OK but not a great leap forward from the 7810XL.So I decided to take the plunge and spend well over $100 for an electric  shaver and got this 1250/40,3D.</li>
            <li> I did have to go over the area a few times and that did cause a little irritation after the fact, but I think that&#x27;s typical for using any new shaver for the first time.     </li>
            <li> Body only no new charger or blades which is all we needed.</li>
            <li> Can be used daily, though irritates a little until the skin gets used to it (after the first few weeks).</li>
            <li> The grip is a little odd at first</li>
            <li> The only minor complaint is the sideburn trimmer doesn&#x27;t really work too well - I&#x27;ve stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Having had several different shavers of varying quality over the years, I was more than a little skeptical of the claims made for this Norelco 3D.  </li>
            <li> These provide the closest shave possible, but, of course, it&#x27;s messy, takes a lot of extra time, and can be a general pain.</li>
            <li> I own a prior Norelco model and have used it for the past 5+ years until it finally failed.</li>
            <li> Only negative,and it&#x27;s minor to me, is the three heads open from the center outward.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after my first shave with my new shiny razor</li>
            <li> To pay $106 for a replacement head when a new unit costs $179 is just plain nuts.</li>
            <li> I also have blonde hair, so I suppose I can&#x27;t see any stubble left behind really; this might be different for a darker haired person.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it would have been fine if I shaved every day with out fail, but there are always going to be times when I skip a day or two.      </li>
            <li> I have only used it dry, and the shave is not as close as a blade - thankfully!  </li>
            <li> It gives an extremely close shave even in some of the more difficult spots under the neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid razor, but I feel there are other solid ones as well.</li>
            <li> (Other than the folding stand, the current 1250 is the same as before.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have no general dislikes on this shaver, except that it is possible to irritate sensitive skin; though skin will be less irritated than with other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you look on the chart at the bottom of product pages, the only difference between the most expensive version all the way down to the cheapest one is VERY minor difference.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is the tiny beard dust holders.  </li>
            <li> This makes it harder to reach tight corners of my face (such as directly underneath the nose to cut all the hairs of my mustache).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a lower cost electric on those days that I just feel lazy and need to trim things up a bit but decided to go with high quality and see if I could get away from blades.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to get straight lines with it.</li>
            <li> A single blade disposable razor cut my face much less than the two much more expensive double edge blade ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the aesthetics of this 1250x/40 are very pleasant, the 1255X is ugly, outdated and probably built of lower quality</li>
            <li> Its to bad, cause this thing looks amazing.</li>
            <li> The 3D feels the most awkward.</li>
            <li> like the design of the unit, it is cutting edge and stylish.  </li>
            <li> like the design of the unit, it is cutting edge and stylish.  </li>
            <li> I feel that the trimmer on the 1250X does a better job than the 7310 in cutting the hair on his head and beard.  </li>
            <li> Before you waste your time reading this review, read my review on Braun Series 7- 790cc or BRAUN SERIES 7 799CC-6WD shaver, it is cheeper and is the clear winner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will give you a shave comparable to a sharp flat edge blade but razor burn is likely without using a shaving gel or oil.</li>
            <li> Stuck too long ended up beyond the return window.</li>
            <li> Is the quality of shave equal to a careful manual shave    </li>
            <li> You need to ensure carefully that you capture all the hair as just going over that area does not guarantee the same.</li>
            <li> The cleaning method requires you to take the entire head off, and you need to be careful so that the parts don&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Happy shaving!ady way too long.</li>
            <li> He loves the wide shave area on this one; got used to it in a week and has thanked me several times.</li>
            <li> I pull the one piece triplehead unit off the charged up Norelco shaver and pull each rotary head from the center up and outward to open up the lid on each rotary head.</li>
            <li> It just took too long to shave in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Another minor issue:</li>
            <li> So plan on drying it a long time with beads of water all over the heads and compartments.  </li>
            <li> And because I was constantly going over and over the same areas, pressing harder and harder each time, it was leaving me with razor</li>
            <li> The one time I tried an electric razor, it left my skin irritated and the shave was nowhere close to being comparable to a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch provides the closest electric razor shave I have ever had and, as an added bonus, it lasts a long time between charges.   </li>
            <li> I figured, since the $100-something I spent on that razor lasted for 5 years, I&#x27;d drop the extra money on their newer, fancier line of razors.  </li>
            <li> A complete waste of space and effort.  </li>
            <li> The only issue that I have found is that the heads are pretty small and thus can only hold a small amount of trimmed hair.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> After I would shave I kept feeling stuble all day long.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a minor issue.  </li>
            <li> NORELCO has come a long way from the triple headers of the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been usuing an electric razor almost for as long as I&#x27;ve had to shave.  </li>
            <li> I had no real interest in paying the extra $100 (plus supply costs) for the cleaning unit when just blowing out and rinsing the heads after a shave is about all that I needed.</li>
            <li> He said it took him excessively long to shave his head and face and would sometimes cut.  </li>
            <li> I am not young and I get hair on my ears</li>
            <li> Yes, running this over and over on the same area will eventually get that remaining stubble, but that is not really desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun shaver for a long time - but the shaving head became faulty - so I have tried the Philips SensoTouch 3D.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time electric shaver user--and always Norelco.</li>
            <li> Retains charge for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Maneuverability - If you have a moustache, goatee, beard, long sideburns, or whatever</li>
            <li> Perhaps the Braun doesn&#x27;t need it because the case is harder, and also because the Braun is the only shaver that can run while plugged in with a depleted battery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically I was told that if you expect Philips to support one of their products that you bought from them you might have to hold your breath a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my foil shavers would just yank my whiskers out when they were long.  </li>
            <li> It keeps a long charge through shaves.</li>
            <li> None of the earlier models had a wet shaving option</li>
            <li> Those hairs eventually become long and unsightly and I have to use the push out razor to cut them off.  </li>
            <li> I have always gotten ingrown hairs, and this razor has gone a long way in reducing them.</li>
            <li> Instead you have to lug the razor, which is larger than I expected, plus the cord, and the stand with you when you travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor itself is larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I just bought the 1255x shaver and decided to put up a review on it as well as this model, as this is the smae shaver minus the extra head and silver exterior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didnt take me long, and the places where it worked</li>
            <li> I should have bought it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have not tried using it wet yet but because you can get this one wet daily cleaning is a snap just open the heads and rinse off.</li>
            <li> charger is sort of janky, but the charges last about a month (shaving once per day), So it is not much of a detractor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a huuge fan of the circular blade concept, but as long as you don&#x27;t let the hair grow to long</li>
            <li> The first month of use was somewhat frustrating as you have to \\&quot;train\\&quot; your hairs to use an electric shaver versus a regular razor.</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive, and any minor redness subsides in a few minutes with no additional treatment.    </li>
            <li> Certainly not worth the $275.00 price tag for cheaply made, poor customer service</li>
            <li> Not clear why design went to the two contact points rather than a plug but assume</li>
            <li> The three primary differences between the 3D and less expensive 2D models is the 2D blades can&#x27;t flex outward (they only flex inward), the 2D blades have a different shave pattern, and the 2D head must be popped off in order to attach the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> If the battery is low or dead you can give it a charge for a few mins that will get you through at least one shave.&lt;br /&gt;-Super easy cleanup.</li>
            <li> It seems to be due to the small compartments that hold the hair and the large slot openings in the blades.  </li>
            <li> Less than four months later, the shaver heads are not seating properly.  </li>
            <li> I have only ever used electric shavers, never a blade, apart from the odd time when I&#x27;d left my trusty Philips at home.  </li>
            <li> It is not super close, but it is close enough for daily use.  </li>
            <li> One odd thing is the cleaning - you have to open 3 compartments individually.</li>
            <li> model actually works both wet and dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only shaved dry so can&#x27;t say anything about the  wet shave.  </li>
            <li> The razor can be used both wet (indie the shower) and dry.  </li>
            <li> it simply has a really hard time giving a shave and this is not really excessive growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Norelco also tells you to wait a few weeks to let your body get used to it, but I found that my face reacted positively within a few days.</li>
            <li> I have parts under my chin where a regular razor blade, even the gigantic, multi-blade razors don&#x27;t get, requiring multiple passes and red, raw skin to be clean-shaven.</li>
            <li> On balance I am very disappointed in the SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver, so much so that I think I&#x27;ll be going back to the tried and true Advantage 7735X, or perhaps try a new lotion pack model; the lotion packs agree with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The constant nicks, cuts, and mess of doing that is what keeps me coming back to electrics.  </li>
            <li> I had an older Norelco which now needs some parts which are no longer available :( .  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t return it back to amazon due to the return policy.</li>
            <li> Been there and ended up shaving with my wife&#x27;s razor due to not bringing the charging cord (this on a different razor than the 1250X).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffered from shaving bumps, also known as ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Technology has come a long way!</li>
            <li> It may be expensive, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Needless to say it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I recently switched to electric shaving due to a dermatologist recommendation.</li>
            <li> Overall, I prefer this shave to anything else due to the consistancy, speed, and convenience.  </li>
            <li> I will use it especially during my trip to Europe and other parts of the world.</li>
            <li> If I have the same problem again, I will have to look at other brands.</li>
            <li> Something I didn&#x27;t used to do with my other razors because I thought what the heck there was a big holding area there</li>
            <li> have owned three other Norelco razors, and the only one that shaves as close as the Advantage 7735X was the Advantage 5655.  </li>
            <li> have owned three other Norelco razors, and the only one that shaves as close as the Advantage 7735X was the Advantage 5655.  </li>
            <li> With other razors I had to keep going over the same spots</li>
            <li> I usually only shave ever other day and this shaver seems to handle that well.</li>
            <li> shaver has quite sharp blades which means that it cuts really low and gets all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (Using a Braun, I have cut myself under my mouth, when I failed to stretch, but I have never had significant abrasion.  </li>
            <li> My only observation is that the sideburn trimmer is not quite as usable as the one on my other razors.</li>
            <li> Other conveniences of this model include the various glowing indicators telling me when the razor needs to be cleaned, charged, etc.</li>
            <li> I had read in some other reviews that you need to give your skin a few weeks to get used to a new way of shaving.  </li>
            <li> charge lasts very long.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer to cut my two day beard than my old Braun shaver which has the loud but very fast cutting linear motor.</li>
            <li> Works well with shaving cream, and also dry when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li> It doesnt even irritate my skin when shaving dry.</li>
            <li> Can use dry or with shaving cream / gel.  </li>
            <li> I use it dry, but like that I can rinse it out after each use.</li>
            <li> But dry shaving</li>
            <li> I have never shaved dry before now</li>
            <li> This time I decided to try using it with shaving cream rather than just dry skin.</li>
            <li> I dry</li>
            <li> Dry</li>
            <li> Even the difficult areas are clean with just a couple of passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still astonished by how well this thing shaves dry.</li>
            <li> , I thought the 3 separate heads would be a pain to clean, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer it dry</li>
            <li> The senso touch works well without irritation even when dry.</li>
            <li> AND with this product, I have opportunity for a dry shave</li>
            <li> Have not tried dry.  </li>
            <li> dry shaves, because I don&#x27;t have the time</li>
            <li> can use it dry and because of the battery it is cordless meaning you can use it in your car or on a bus or train or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li> dry</li>
            <li> I tried a dry shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may be that the design of the 3D model, in order to allow for both dry and wet shaving, is necessarily not optimized for wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> I needed at least two razors, so did considerable research based on the following criteria:  Shaver 1:  </li>
            <li> Has to minimize razor burn and rash on the neck area, but has to get pesky sideways neck hair and the angles without a lot of work  Can&#x27;t shave too low - few spots prone to ingrown hairs when hair is yanked out or cut too low below the skin  </li>
            <li> Summary - thought rotary heads would get trouble spots better, was wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Norelco has to be cleaned with warm water after every use, while Braun can be just put back into its base and the system itself will take care of the cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Braun</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to get an even shave and it is next to impossible to shave neatly near the hair line with the extra large plastic shells holding the three blade assemblies.  </li>
            <li> the really good news for my fellow razor bump suffers: I have not had a single bump since I started shaving with the SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver that at least is plus for the razor.electric razor is</li>
            <li> the really good news for my fellow razor bump suffers: I have not had a single bump since I started shaving with the SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver that at least is plus for the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is due to the fact of your face adjusting to the shaver or the fact that you gain experience in using that particular shaver.</li>
            <li> Hence the four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that i would recommend this shaver based on performance to anyone that is looking for a high quality shaver for delicate skin.</li>
            <li> shave - this is limited to just the Panasonic and the 3D.</li>
            <li> single anoying issue is the cleaning-</li>
            <li> , i like that its useable wet and dry, and it hold a charge for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Prior products consistently left stubble in the hard to get places even when I shaved them several times.  </li>
            <li> With my last shaver, it was taking 10-12 minutes on average.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is a nice bonus, however if you are going on an extended trip, it is a hassle to have to take the base along with you (but at least it will not take up too much room in your luggage).</li>
            <li> The shaver is held on the stand by two weak magnets that barely can hold it in place on a completely level surface</li>
            <li> This razor is not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> There is no more plugging the charger directly into the razor.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a bit awkward, but better than other shavers owned in past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first 9 months with this electric were frustrating.</li>
            <li> but the durability of the first one was poor.</li>
            <li> After a while it becomes loose.</li>
            <li> Hard to get a close shave even with a new set of heads.</li>
            <li> Putting these heads on a lesser dry shaver would probably cut the cost in half.  </li>
            <li> Have tried both wet and dry but use dry about 90% of the time.  </li>
            <li> But, we read these \\&quot;words of hope\\&quot; and gamble the money, only to be let down, just like I was with this shaver.</li>
            <li> This one cleans in 10 seconds if that and just lay it down on the trimmer edge with the heads popped open and it dries in no time.    </li>
            <li> I tried the Panasonic which cut the beard but took multiple passes for a close shave and it was extremely noisy!  </li>
            <li> The little plastic protection cover for the blades is very weak and flimsy, and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> dry!</li>
            <li> Those allow longer hairs to easily gain entrance into the cutting heads and be dealt with.</li>
            <li> Close shaves wet or dry.</li>
            <li> And it works wet or dry to boot.</li>
            <li> A shaver that could do wet and dry shaves.</li>
            <li> I believe both the 2D and 3D are sold to be used either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> It can be used wet, dry or even with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I just hold the blades under the water and it&#x27;s cleaned out in less than ten seconds.  </li>
            <li> Just mows through my beard, with a total shave time of less than 3 min.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten 6-8 years from previous Norelco shavers using this technique as opposed to constant charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the floating heads always missed the area under my jaw line and in order to get my sideburns I would have to constantly rotate the shaver to get all the hair since the individual shaver heads are relatively small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver both wet and dry</li>
            <li> You can buy the entire razor for less than the replacement</li>
            <li> My dry shave with the 1250x was as close as a wet shave with my Gillette Pro Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> This shaver can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The Norelco is quiet and shaves closer in less time.  </li>
            <li> You also can use this razor wet or dry, which should please those who like to shave in the shower or prefer to use shaving cream or gel.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a vast improvement over previous models.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is the ability to shave wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have had the 1290x for less then 1 year and battery indicator now reads 35 minutes left.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I should of gone for a more expensive model</li>

            <li> battery lasts me about a month, less than my last one</li>
            <li> This happened with both wet and dry shaves.</li>
            <li> One thing I have noticed though is that I need to wet shave now rather than dry shave</li>
            <li> Can shave wet (not tested); this might be the forte of the shaver, but I want to shave dry.  </li>

            <li> They have been using it dry, but will try wet w/shaving cream</li>
            <li> He has used it dry and wet and in both cases it works beyond what he had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and has a helpful indicator of the battery charge level, something my previous Norelco lacked.</li>
            <li> I had read about the dry vs. wet shave discussion.  </li>
            <li> I tried pulling my skin tight, different patterns, and even flipping the razor upside down to use different blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little harder to use it to trim back the bulk of my sideburns, but that&#x27;s a minor complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> using to shave head with very very little irritation (slight irritation to me is normal).  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift and he absolutely loves it, to say the least!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, doesn&#x27;t make a mess, and shaves well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to mess with tiny brushes or cans of air to get all of the hair out of the nooks and crannies of it.</li>
            <li> , this exposed how weak the razor really is.  </li>
            <li> It does not stay sharp for long also.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the replacement shaving unit is VERY expensive and not available at many local stores.</li>
            <li> However, I was never completely happy with the previous Norelco that I bought several years ago (an XL model) and I really wanted to try one of the 3D styles.   </li>
            <li> My only squalk is that the charging stand is too big to take travelling, and they could have easily designed it to let the \\&quot;charging collar\\&quot; detach from the base.   </li>
            <li> Also I have had little to no irritation on my neck or upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I can finally shave every day with little to no irritation.</li>
            <li> It just have little razor edge and batteries run low after a month that I don´t use it</li>
            <li> Sounds weird and messy, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> this is a tough call, with the Braun and the Panasonic both providing very close shaves.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is only mediocre; both lack of reach and cutting action (less effective than my 10 yr.</li>
            <li> I tried the &#x27;dry&#x27; shave and had no irritation afterwards, which I always had after shaving with other razors.</li>
            <li> - can&#x27;t seem to get them or keep them clean, leaves long hairs on side burns and under nose, hate the fact that I can&#x27;t plug directly into shaver - need to take stand on trips to recharge.</li>
            <li> In or out of the shower, dry shave or wet shave with foam, gel, or just water!</li>
            <li> I keep mine in a cabinet, delicately balanced on its fragile little charging stand, so I have no concern over the travel ability or not plugging directly into the shaver.  </li>
            <li> For those who have used other models, you know that it typically takes several passes to get the shave you want.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is that it is so tall in the charger that it doesn&#x27;t fit well on any of our shelves.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend last Christmas after a particularly bad case of razor burn from one of his cheap, blunt disposable razors.</li>
            <li> It looked so sleek and had great reviews, but this electric razor gave me a terrible shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heaved tray it for at least 7 days shaving my complete head every 2 days and my face every day.</li>
            <li> Worked very well until all of a sudden one day the unit failed to charge or turn on.</li>
            <li> I specifically purchased the razor to wet shave with shaving cream and water because previous electric razors that require you to dry dry irritated me.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, it had a card in the package that said if you order on line you would get a extra 6 months of warranty.  </li>
            <li> Since I shave my head and face at least three times a week, it is important to me that any razor I use shave closely without, again, irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> one is at least 4 or 5 years old and there may be a</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]This is at least my third or fourth electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower with a wet soapy face and have eliminated almost all irritation with the closest shave I have ever had, blade or electric.</li>
            <li> My only concern with this product is with the cost, it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t tried it wet yet, although it can be used in a shower.</li>
            <li> Cons: For a wet shave like I do - none.</li>
            <li> Actually it still works, I just wanted to try a newer version to see if I was missing out on anything</li>
            <li> I have not tried it while using shaving cream or wet shave.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not the performance level I expected when I bought this</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> Absolutely no irritation or redness.</li>
            <li> but the irritation to my skin was minimal around the neck/jawline area.</li>
            <li> The Norelco shaver can shave a wet, lathered beard almost as close as a safety razor blade.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks now since starting to use this shaver.</li>
            <li> as my troubleshooting/replacement process only took a few minutes.    </li>
            <li> Norelco or Braun is not much of a drop off.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want or need a wet shave, but Norelco does not give me a choice if I want these heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the wet shave/shave cream route</li>
            <li> Did not appear it was going to handle the razor bumps well, and may tap his patience when shaving wet.  </li>
            <li> I am not a very hairy man.</li>
            <li> I tried it on wet once.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of a trade off to me, and is why I prefer using it as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> I use both shavers wet with G....</li>
            <li> This product is not the quality I expected from Norelco.  </li>
            <li> not so, unless you shave each day with this one it has a rough time if you decide to be a unshaven slob for a day.</li>
            <li> actually worn out a few...</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was getting tired of the disposable razors I&#x27;d been using, and wanted something that would give me a close shave without too much effort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can also use shaving cream with the SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver, but that can get a bit messy (I only tried it once)  </li>
            <li> This razor gets them after only a few passes, and leaves me clean-shaven and pain-free.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*I haven&#x27;t tried this as a wet shave yet.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> u cant even feel the hair like ,and its quiet Fully recommend will leave another review for durability in a few months</li>
            <li> After my Braun series 3 decided to wig out, I spent some time on Amazon reading review after review on electric shavers and even digging through Consumer Reports.  </li>
            <li> but this one does it in only a few swipes.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t how it works in wet mode.</li>
            <li> Can be used wet or</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have sent it back but didn&#x27;t want to go thru the trouble if it worked</li>
            <li> absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Pulling the razor off the dock and putting it back on a few times caused the ringing to stop, but that noise did annoy me.</li>
            <li> The only foible I found with this razor after a few spins around the block (my face) is with the clipping device.</li>
            <li> I use a preshave and wet my face when shaving.</li>
            <li> not really what i exspected.</li>
            <li> But on weekends I prefer a wet shave with Gilette series shaving foam.</li>
            <li> This model is a bit expensive, but is worth it, no pull or razor burn.</li>
            <li> The rotary heads are not smooth but pull against my whiskers,especially my upper lip.</li>
            <li> , however this is to be expected when</li>
            <li> With arthritis in his hands it is harder to empty it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The replacement head costs a fortune as it is overpriced and Philips tries to shift their customers to use the RQ12</li>
            <li> their warranty promises are just empty words</li>
            <li> I was astonished and they would provide me with absolutely no help.</li>
            <li> For the price thought this would be a durable razor to last for a few years.</li>
            <li> I chatted with Norelco and they said the RQ12 shaving head has been replaced with the RQ12+, which is almost double the price on their website (and as I write this, not available on Amazon.com).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then i tried wet shaving with it and tried shave creams, FaceSaver, and a conditioner, but none of this helped either.</li>
            <li> One must be careful how you hold it because I sometimes inadvertently turn it off while shaving.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and money if you have fairly thick hair.</li>
            <li> Worst by far was the Panasonic - the huge head makes it very hard to create a clean edge around the &#x60;stash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a little small and sits back a little to far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The extendable hair trimmer is a convenient and not very powerful, but it works alright for cleaning up side burns with a few presses on the same spot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if it was designed to fail right after the warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is what I did with my previous shaver and it lasted a long while.</li>
            <li> If I travel it will be less than two weeks, and since this thing will hold a charge for a long time, I shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about the charge.</li>
            <li> I find it to be very quiet with very slight vibration.</li>
            <li> for example, I saw a review that said the &#x27;simple packaging&#x27; was not true -- but it is!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student living on a budget and this was a lot bigger of a purchase than any other typical razors I&#x27;ve bought!</li>
            <li> Due to a very large plastic border around the cutting heads, I simply can&#x27;t get the shaver to reach the stubbles by my nostrils.</li>
            <li> In terms of closeness of cut it about equals my the 8240XL model with its original cutting heads.  </li>
            <li> One other thing,you really do not need to use any pressure with this shaver while in use.</li>
            <li> This one you have to lift up the three cutters separately to empty and the other one that he had</li>
            <li> The high speed linear motors of the Braun &amp; Panasonic shavers will plow through a thick heavy beard faster than the Phillips/Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> Fueled by the lore of saving money in the long run over pricey Gillette blades, I broke down and bought this pretty expensive razor.</li>
            <li> Was a little reluctant to use an electric shaver with rotating heads because a decade ago it was hard on the skin, but not this new anorelco</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Braun shavers but this Norelco never pulls no matter how long the whiskers are and the trimmer gets to tight spots.</li>
            <li> burn at the base of my neck with my old Norelco (4 years old) to just about a 3 - 4 minutes with this new 3D.  </li>
            <li> Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that the newer and higher priced 3D gives me a totally inferior shave even when using the Norelco shaver</li>
            <li> I think it took less than 5 minutes for me to dry</li>
            <li> As the blades got older it got worse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit does feel a little strange in my hand.  </li>
            <li> The unit does feel a little strange in my hand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very quiet machine which was a little hard to get used to initially.</li>
            <li> Once for the regular shave and the second round for doing the getting around the remaining hair that was left behind.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the new handle displayed the same problem</li>
            <li> I had an old Philips Philishave and decided to take the plunge for a new one after the power cord was developing dangerous cracks in its insulation!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also this shaver has an awkward large shape that does not travel as well as a Braun or lesser Norelco, and because of the wet shave ability there is no travel charger.  </li>
            <li> I actually shave very little, since my work doesn&#x27;t require it.</li>
            <li> The hair gets collected into the unit while you use it, so very little if any hair lands in the sink (big points on the \\&quot;Wife Score\\&quot; chart).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Norelco&#x27;s trimmer is more ergonomic and easier to use on sides.&lt;br /&gt;Braun&#x27;s trimmer is a bit oddly placed, since the shaver itself blocks your view while trimming sides...sort of a bad design example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a white 65 year old with a heavy tough beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaves extremely close&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaves I&#x27;m getting are extremely close, and seem to be safety razor comparable.  </li>
            <li> Didnt need all the other fancy stuff, that the other Sensotouch 3d have.</li>
            <li> I never had a closer shave with any other electric razors.</li>
            <li> Beware of any holiday or other rebates from Philips Norelco as they will not honor it and not give you a means to appeal.  </li>
            <li> I also had to rub over my skin numerous times to get the shaver to pick up all of my hair, and even then I usually ended up using a manual blade to trim any close excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He uses it about every other day.</li>
            <li> But I have since demoted it to 3 stars due to the fact that it died after just 2 years.</li>
            <li> At first, I have to tell you, I was not impressed with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I also tried two other brands from time to time, always returning to the Norelco brand.</li>
            <li> I usually try to buy the most expensive model but $250?!</li>
            <li> I had problems with other electric razors not getting the hairs by my neck</li>
            <li> quiet and small..</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco over the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> i read in the other reviews that someone went to walmart and they had some type of clearance on the item.  </li>
            <li> and they said I would have to order from the other company.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unlike with other electrics, there&#x27;s no need to stretch the skin manually.</li>
            <li> this one will last past a year, we will see.</li>
            <li> It takes 2-4 weeks for your skin to adjust, so don&#x27;t return if the first few shaves feel strange or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The small collapsible trimmer in the back of the unit works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small collapsible trimmer in the back of the unit works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are small enough to reach into those crevices on my map.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco customer for many decades and have NEVER been disappointed with their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions say to go in circular motion, but the area above the lip is really small compared to the shaving head area.  </li>
            <li> Shaves extremely close in all directions and leaves NO whiskers around this sink.  </li>
            <li> His assessment: \\&quot;It didn&#x27;t tug or irritate my skin like other electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I will be returning this razor and absolutely do not recommend it!</li>
            <li> and my other one had 2.</li>
            <li> Been using it for almost 2 years, blades are still sharp.</li>
            <li> other reason I&#x27;m taking away a star is because of the non-availability of the replacement blades for this.</li>
            <li> Finally it got to the point where I was not able to turn the shaver on or off at all.  </li>
            <li> One other noted feature is the SensoTouch 3d heads which move around all the curves of you face and jaw to get to the finny growths on the neck line and around the jawline.  </li>
            <li> Had a problem with the sides of my face due to, well, having a somewhat flabby face.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several electric razors in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for about 30 years, about 25 with various electric razors (usually Norelco).</li>
            <li> No need to try other brands,  this one gets in every situation and trims the sideburns too.</li>
            <li> This was on sale at Amazon along with a coupon, so it was about $70 cheaper than at Target or other stores.  </li>
            <li> (This also applies to cell phones or any other rechargeable battery device.)</li>
            <li> Still it is about twice the price of other razors</li>
            <li> I have only used the cheaper electric razors in the past, including the $50 Norelco triple head shavers and those $10-$20 Remington shavers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even have a close shave comparing to other competitive products.  </li>
            <li> I consulted with my hairy men friends and business associates and they told me that they have used multiple brands in the past</li>
            <li> I tried unplugging and plugging it back in (This usually works with my windows laptop), but</li>
            <li> I tried other electric shavers years ago, but didn&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li> I usually have to shave again with a regular shaver.</li>
            <li> It has now quit working, I&#x27;ve charged and cleaned it every other week (after 2 or 3 uses).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other electric razors and had poor to total garbage for results.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the unit is a bit awkward in that you lift each individual head to clean out the hairs (but at least it collects the cuttings unlike the Panasonic which just let them fall in the sink as you shaved).  </li>
            <li> After taking my time and reading about this shaver I choose it for the \\&quot;active lift\\&quot; technology.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning out my old Braun series 5 foil shaver took several minutes, and it involved tediously using a brush to poke in between the holes in the foil, because oil and hair gunk would block the foil holes after a while.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well and the clippings from the rotor blades don&#x27;t empty into your hand or into the sink while trimming your sideburns like the previous model I had.</li>
            <li> I feel like nothing has changed between my old philips (10 years old) and this one in terms of cutting ability.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the charging stand is bulky, fragile and does not secure the shaver firmly.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, when you&#x27;ve spent your whole life NOT shaving, grinding away at your tender face with a blade does not produce agreeable results.</li>
            <li> It gives a closer shave with less irritation that my previous one and a single charge lasts me for about a month.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the trimmer, it is too small, the shaving heads get in the way.    </li>
            <li> I just hope this has the same durability as previous Norelco products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Having owned other Norelco products the brand still has not let me down</li>
            <li> The last time I used an electric razor was on a US Navy Destroyer back in the 50&#x27;s &amp; 60&#x27;s, a necessary, unpleasant task, with the only alternative a messy razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The Philips was difficult to shave and keep straight sideburns due to the circular design.  </li>
            <li> This is due to the thick roots which will be left by either of these shavers.</li>
            <li> I looked at the conventional designed Norelco&#x27;s and discovered that they were either made in China, a problem for me, or didn&#x27;t have a travel case.  </li>
            <li> It is constantly falling out as you shave, especially if the razor heads are turned downward at all, which happens often, including when you try to use the absurdly positioned trimmer, and it makes a big mess!</li>
            <li> three heads do not rotate, but are fixed in place and each head will only cut certain size hair,  very poor design , very poor performance.  </li>
            <li> My previous review is below, but i&#x27;ve since returned this product due to it&#x27;s design flaws.  </li>
            <li> Does not give even a half close shave compared to other shavers.</li>
            <li> It shaves closer in all area and takes less time than any other.  </li>
            <li> I do not like the tiny little sideburn trimmer as it is too small to do any grooming.</li>
            <li> It is so quiet that my wife can hardly hear me shaving now.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time shaving my neck and the under side of my jaw line but all the electric razors I owned had the same issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like the little stand that comes with it, but it&#x27;s necessary to use it in order to keep the charge level up.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard bear and must shave daily.</li>
            <li> I can have a dry shave like with other Norelco products that I&#x27;ve used for the past 35 years.  </li>
            <li> This is actually the first time I had a bad experience with Amazon, so to that I give them credit as mistakes do happen.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t like the price, but at least it does that one simple thing, shave, and</li>
            <li> My last last one had been rebuilt about twenty years ago, and later had the cutting head replaced as well as the battery.</li>
            <li> Well, perhaps those holes are blocked since my shaver left so much stubble, and so much longer hair for that matter that I would give this shaver a total fail when keeping in context all that crap they wrote to sell this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave the charger plugged in, I believe constant charging reduces battery life, at least in my experience.  </li>
            <li> However I feel  that it is not worth the price of 3-4 shavers to get this shaver.  </li>
            <li> That is no fun.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the charger.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;About the only negative things I&#x27;ll say about this are: 1) the battery is not replaceable, 2)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not worth your 150 $.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The design engineers had their heads way up in the dark on this one.  </li>
            <li> Then, a few days later, the shaver handle, again, in a small box.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is with the charging unit.</li>
            <li> Only negative is the size of charging cradle which makes for a space hog in suitcase if you travel with it.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it takes forever to shave with it.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - Since I left a negative review I wanted to update.</li>
            <li> In addition, charging requires a clumsy stand to set the razor in rather than simply plugging into the bottom of the razor.  </li>
            <li> This is the base model of the Senso Touch line with out all of the bells and whistles but the performance is top of the line.</li>
            <li> Both cut my face because my skin is so sensitive or thin.</li>
            <li> &quot; Truth is, it drains out slowly, over hours, and will drip out after taken off its stand for your next shave.</li>
            <li> I used to hate shaving, and would go with a stubble beard most of the week just because of that reason.</li>
            <li> I have a thick, coarse beard.  </li>
            <li> To make it even worse, the stand is required to have the shaver charged, since the power cord won&#x27;t plug directly to the shaver.</li>
            <li> There are no free lunches and no real bargains out there.</li>
            <li> I tried some actual baby oil and found that to be too thick.  </li>
            <li> (it still works but was starting to slow down)</li>
            <li> I am giving this shaver, which I have owned and used for several years, a poor review--not because the razor is not a fine product but because Norelco has recently started selling inferior shaver head replacements at an exorbitant price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My only complaint, if you can call it one, is that it shaves so close that I need to use a lotion to soothe a slight razor</li>
            <li> my frustrations are down.</li>
            <li> On the Speed-XL, flip the trimmer up, trim what you want and flip it down.  </li>
            <li> With some effort it will cut down my beard to a somewhat close level</li>
            <li> If you happen to be sitting down while shaving, it will drip on you.</li>
            <li> Nor do I have to spend time tracking down stragglers.</li>
            <li> I had a week&#x27;s growth and decided to try it without trimming it down.</li>
            <li> I still do from the standpoint of it&#x27;s aesthetics, but the shaving experience is a let down.</li>
            <li> I may update my review down the line.</li>
            <li> This product, hands down, is the closest shave I&#x27;ve had from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Since getting the shaver 3 weeks ago my shave times have been cut down by two-thirds.</li>
            <li> Recommend this over the Panasonic hands down.</li>
            <li> The Amazon Rewards knocked the price down, well, $45.90.</li>
            <li> But, i mean, cheaper electric shavers does the same job.</li>
            <li> of course, the pricing through Amazon beat all other retailers!</li>
            <li> I decided on an electric razor instead of a safety blade and eventually came down to this one because it was on sale for about $40 less than the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other two require a 5-minute charge to give you a few minutes shave.</li>
            <li> As a few other longer term users are reporting this one is now toast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m due for a new set of heads, and even they are quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Now that I have the SensoTouch 3D, my coworkers are going to be shocked at how often I come in clean shaven.    </li>

            <li> Without exception they have all been reliable shavers, each newer one an improvement on the previous model.  </li>
            <li> My previous model a Coolskin, I thought could not be surpassed.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for a year and a half andit</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s typical of the lower priced models</li>
            <li> i had the norelco arcitec previously</li>
            <li> B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]</li>
            <li> I purchased this Norelco to replace an identical one I purchased two and a half years ago.</li>
            <li> so I could use my Jack Black Beard Lube.</li>
            <li> Received as a gift from a deceased uncle less than 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li> in less than 3 months, i keep getting error msg to replace the shaver head..</li>
            <li> The shave is even closer than with previous model 9160xl  which I thought could not be improved upon.</li>
            <li> Thus, my shaving time was cut in half.</li>
            <li> I have previously used a Norelco 74xx series and a Braun.</li>
            <li> was there wasn&#x27;t any tugs or pulls like previous electric razors I have used.</li>
            <li> On the product page for Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black it says under \\&quot;Amazon.com Product Description\\&quot;; \\&quot;Cordless, Travel-Friendly Design&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I guess you get what you pay for or less than what you pay for.</li>
            <li> B003YJB026 Braun Series 5-550cc Shaver System, Black and Silver]]</li>
            <li> Less tax to pay too.</li>
            <li> Takes about 5 to 10 minutes to shave which is about 20 minutes less time than what I was used to.</li>
            <li> Unlike my previous Norelco, I can&#x27;t run it off the cord.  </li>
            <li> Does it shave better/ closer than the previous ones?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all you need, less money, and easier to use.</li>
            <li> typically i use a gillete mach 3 to touch up any areas missed.&lt;br /&gt;-In</li>
            <li> As a bonus, it cost less than the Panasonic I tried.</li>
            <li> I used it once with very short stubble, it didn&#x27;t shave worth a crap, and it cut the hell out of my neck area.  </li>
            <li> but this is probably needed with the less sturdy case.  </li>
            <li> I do not have the expensive cleaning/docking unit that comes with the more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> spots like directly under the jaw bone it seems to have a lot of difficulty in cutting and the skin must be pulled tightly and the razor passed over several times.</li>
            <li> The razor has a drain duct from the heads down to a little hole the bottom of the razor.</li>
            <li> I place the now cleaned onened up triplehead unit upside down on a thick cloth to dry</li>
            <li> He said it was not nearly as good a shave for his face as the brand he currently uses.</li>
            <li> On the flip side, this can cause a bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t cut as well-although I do have heavy whiskers and may not be average in that way.  </li>
            <li> I have read complaints about it this model making a mess out the sink and counter from dropping clipped whiskers.</li>
            <li> The shave was not very comfortable for my husband with his heavy beard.</li>
            <li> It is constantly falling out as you shave,especially if the razor heads are turned downward at all, which happens often, including when you try to use the absurdly positioned trimmer, and it makes a big mess!  </li>
            <li> As far as electric shavers are concerned this one does rank high.  </li>
            <li> I wound up just buying a new Norelco that is not as expensive as the 1250X/40.  </li>
            <li> At least not when shaving dry.</li>
            <li> It might help if the base had some weight in the bottom as it is easy to knock over.</li>
            <li> Shaves, but not a clean shave.</li>
            <li> For previous Norelco users there are a few surprises.  </li>
            <li> Neck hurts a little after shaving.</li>
            <li> It cleans up in little to no time.  </li>
            <li> A battery charge lasts a little under a month for me.  </li>
            <li> I wish that it was priced a little cheaper</li>
            <li> That means it has to sit on the counter, a little in the way.  </li>
            <li> It cut through my beard with little effort.</li>
            <li> I seen some comments where people said it took a little time to get used to, but my husband had no problems at all.  </li>
            <li> It broke after a little fall in the bathroom with the trimmer out.  </li>
            <li> but my neck was irritated a little longer than the product claimed.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if someone is sharpening these little blades?</li>
            <li> Its a little noisy but maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> You can charge as often or a little as you wish (lasts about two weeks between charges); charging frequency doesn&#x27;t affect a  lithium battery.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> It definitely does shave as close as a blade or at least the closest thing to it!</li>
            <li> There is little effort required with pressure to my face as the contour of the razors 3 heads just follows my skin.</li>
            <li> The Braun is a little buzzy and the Panasonic loudest although</li>
            <li> Just wish the replacement blades/head was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Up front cost is a little steep</li>
            <li> The battery life could be a little better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had been using a blade before this and the shave is a little bettter with that.</li>
            <li> , I went ahead and purchased this little guy and off the bat</li>
            <li> /&gt;-a little too pricey&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this razor couldnt ever get those little hairs.</li>
            <li> Also, those little hairs on my neck NEVER cut.</li>
            <li> but there are still little spots were hair</li>
            <li> I found the warp a little damaged on receiving it,maybe I should choose gift warp?</li>
            <li> The charging dock is a little cumbersome to carry whilst traveling.</li>
            <li> it is a little expensive， I hope it can be cheaper，the cheapest price of it</li>
            <li> One thing we both noted was that the charger does not securely hold the razor so it can be easily knocked off its base.     </li>
            <li> The only thing is around the adam&#x27;s apple and near my ears but that&#x27;s impossible with me.</li>
            <li> Because of the plastic around the rotary blades it is difficult to get to the edges of your shave which they tried to solve with a secondary straight razor for the sideburns but still is not good for upper lip area and anything beyond the sideburns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using safety razors for 4+ years since I have a very thick beard, and safety razors were the only way for me to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s base is smart enough to figure out the level of cleaning needed.</li>
            <li> for this expensive razor they can at least have a smart charger that stops charging when the battery is fully charged..</li>
            <li> At some point in time Norelco has basically decided to stop selling cleaning fluid for the thing so part of the reason for the large base is obsolete now.</li>
            <li> but again I don&#x27;t mind the little left behind.</li>
            <li> only thing that is a little disappointing is that the jet-clean is not standard for a razor that is close to $200.</li>
            <li> The Speed-XL also has a wider cutting head making straight line trimming easier.  </li>
            <li> It is very efficient at cutting this length.  </li>
            <li> Dont know what is wrong with it, spent hours googling for technical support but to no avail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is iffy on cutting all hair, but it is a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> It is recommended that the entire head be replaced annually versus just the cutting heads with the traditional model.  </li>
            <li> I shave and spend a few minutes, maybe 3 or 4, going over my cheeks, chin, mustache and neck.</li>
            <li> for a few years</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of researching I decided to go with this one for him.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s somewhat messy.</li>
            <li> He gets a blade close shave each time, even after a few day&#x27;s of growth.</li>
            <li> Can use it in the shower (or so it says, I am not brave enough to try!).  </li>
            <li> I used to just shave every few days.  </li>
            <li> This locks the shaver so you don&#x27;t run the risk of having a dead battery on arrival.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done both my facial hair and thin layer of shaving cream are gone from my face.</li>
            <li> As of this morning, it will no longer turn on and the battery charging indicator doesn&#x27;t light up when placed in the base.  </li>
            <li> Blades were not available and the head was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Even after a few weeks it still irritated my skin immensely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have a Braun 8985 Foil electric shaver and wanted to try this rotary type of shaver, especially as a wet electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> compared this guy to my manual razor - Gillette Fusion - which requires that I shave again every few days.</li>
            <li> I am always on the run and use this product almost everyday.</li>
            <li> This will sometimes occur with some shavers if your beard has grown for a few days.</li>
            <li> Purchased the 1250 and received it in a few days.  </li>
            <li> It can do quite a few shaves on one charge, so maybe you risk not bringing the charger.  </li>
            <li> I have attempted to like electric shavers in the past with no success.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t seem to be missing any areas at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve timed my shave with this shaver, and I get to 5 minutes if I&#x27;m being careful to go slow and pay attention to detail.</li>
            <li> You can probably find replacement heads online for cheaper and, unless you have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> News flash, no one will steal your patent, Philips, because it is underpowered, too narrow, and ineffective.  </li>
            <li> And you must use it everyday for your skin to get and keep used to it.</li>
            <li> In either case, you get used to it in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do not much like the increasingly common approach of pricing maintenance items to make the profit for the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it went dead about 14 months after the purchase.</li>
            <li> There are still a few times if I do not shave in a day or two and have longer hairs that I will have patches that do not get cut.</li>
            <li> leaving it in the charger, she says, will destroy the battery..</li>
            <li> /&gt;so, now what, dead razor</li>
            <li> myself, i will keep my old reliable braun self cleaning razor for that time the philips norelco razor craps out and given its history, it will do so with sad regularity..</li>
            <li> Now I shave everyday, and don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li> Since the replacement foil for the 63 would not fit into the Razor I had to look for another brand.</li>
            <li> This is an update of a review I wrote a few days ago.</li>
            <li> i went with the pull it apart and hope its a dead battery DIY home job.</li>
            <li> If you plan to travel, the stand and charger do not fit into the shaver case, you have to pack them separately.</li>
            <li> I few days ago I bought a 1250 3d (on sale 148.00,</li>
            <li> Was a gift, use it everyday ,no problems</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t work well if i haven&#x27;t shaved in a few days.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this shaver to few of my friends.</li>
            <li> The #1 issue being that they&#x27;re not exactly cheap.  </li>
            <li> Sounds like a lot of fussy trouble (NEVER thought I&#x27;d do anything like this),</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> After a couple of shaves I can tell you that it shaves as close and misses as few hairs as any shaver I have ever owned, even foil shavers.  </li>
            <li> The problem has only gotten worse with age.  </li>
            <li> I had to make a lot of passes with the razor in the neck area and it still left hair behind.  </li>
            <li> I can understand now why Philips has stuck with the technology of the floating head and round blades over the years.</li>
            <li> No charge, no light, no sound ...</li>
            <li> Put finger behind a rotor to improve shaving of upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Yes you do have to go over some area a few times</li>
            <li> Between the bulky head and the uneven shave</li>
            <li> Once the battery is dead, you have to wait for it to charge to operate again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> how does it do with a heavy beard?&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> You know ,turn it on,run it around your face a few times ,turn it of,clean it once a week or so ,and move on.</li>
            <li> few notes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the version with a cleaning kit.</li>
            <li> The unit arrived in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I then tried a few drops of some Avon Skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve HAD ELECTRIC SHAVERS BEFORE,BUT ALWAYS HAD TROUBLE WITH MY NECK.THIS SHAVER</li>
            <li> I probably should have wrote this review a few months ago</li>
            <li> [now that I&#x27;ve used it a few weeks]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe it shaves so closely....</li>
            <li> but instructions says may take a few weeks to adjust.</li>
            <li> At least that makes me feel better about being an idiot.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very tough customer as I&#x27;ve got extremely sensitive skin in my neck area.  </li>
            <li> I find that the razor head is a bit larger than the previous models, as well as the cutting surface on the head being a bit father inside, leaving a small gap of plastic on the outside.  </li>
            <li> My jaw line finally gets a clean shave on one or two passes, especially the area just behind the sides of my jaw that was terrible to aim at before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s flat so that I can get those tough spots that this one misses.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is not perfect: the trimmer is a little lacking, the power button is right where my thumb usually rests when shaving, and you can not shave and have it charge at the same time since the only way to charge it is through the charging base.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a carrying case large enough to hold everything that comes with the razor, including the charging base, and a small cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also comes with a carrying case large enough to hold everything that comes with the razor, including the charging base, and a small cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-close shave with least irritation compared to other electric shavers</li>
            <li> I am a previous die-hard \\&quot;scraper razor\\&quot; guy with a very heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> Open the three heads brush the interior base ,run the heads under water ,and leave the shaver in the stand with the heads open until dry.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a little small, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> the shaver makes a mess!</li>
            <li> I wish I had purchased a less expensive  norelco model similar to the one he had before.  </li>
            <li> The shave was not nearly as good as a blade -- and if I missed two days without shaving it seemed to NEVER really get rid of the growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave everyday, and usually have to recharge it once every 3 weeks...</li>
            <li> Usually if I go over stray hairs a few times this Norelco will get them, where with the Braun I&#x27;d have to break out the manual razor to touch up.  </li>
            <li> Battery is completely dead and not able to charge.</li>
            <li> charging base has cool suction cups on the bottom</li>
            <li> , I was a little bit skeptical about how close shave I will get from this shaver compared to a classical razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the protective cap was surprisingly difficult to pop into place, and eventually chipped... a little piece of it actually fell off.</li>
            <li> After using it, you have a very tight shave.  </li>
            <li> Then when you need too, you simply pop open the shaving heads and rinse this bad boy under the water.</li>
            <li> Recently, after consistently bad shaves with my current shaver, I decided to \\&quot;bite the bullet.\\</li>
            <li> /&gt;Multiple emails later i got nothing and ended up with one expensive dead shaver.</li>
            <li> You can rinse it off after each use and the blades have low friction coatings so nothign is sticking and the cleaning stuff is just a waste of money for a nifty but useless gadget.</li>
            <li> The least jostling causes the unit to fall over and half the time it ends up on the tile floor.</li>
            <li> If your beard hair are very thick (and dark colored too), then you may observe slight blackish tinge on your beard line over time.</li>
            <li> It was replaced quickly at no cost, but in the mean time I purchased the Senso Touch.  </li>
            <li> A little persistence helps me get these hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> This guy sounds like a cell phone vibrating, very little noise at all.</li>
            <li> With this razor I obtain a close shave, but with very little if any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Neck can be tough and never really gets as close a shave as anywhere else, but that&#x27;s kinda a priority issue.</li>
            <li> and i pushed it hard missing bits and pieces everywhere</li>
            <li> Previously, there would small (very small) patches of areas that would remain unshaven</li>
            <li> The 3D is amazingly quiet, as opposed to the very unpleasant screeching of the old one echoing in my small bathroom.  </li>
            <li> but but it leaves hairs sticking out of my neck(!) and is difficult to manage around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for the past 35 years.</li>
            <li> I retired my SensoTouch 3D Shaver because the replacement heads got way too expensive - for those of you still using this shaver, you can change it to the same head as the 9000 series.    </li>
            <li> I have the 9700 which in my opinion shaves no better than my SensoTouch 3D and wish I&#x27;d just bought the 9000 series head.</li>
            <li> (this is my 4th Norelco in the past years).</li>
            <li> I usually choose to have a rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li> shaving machine is really expensive especially because I got it shipped to south America.</li>
            <li> I usually have to shave 2-3 times a day and it takes a bit of time...</li>
            <li> Owned sever Norelcos in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s for the past 25 years.</li>
            <li> I have owned &amp; used 6-7 Philips shavers over the past 50 years.</li>
            <li> leaves a lot of uncut hairs, and makes big scars.</li>
            <li> Two small drawbacks.</li>
            <li> final note-this IS an expensive shaver.</li>
            <li> For an expensive razor it should have a standard jet cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I buy that 3D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sufficiently disappointed that I&#x27;m actually thinking of returning the shaver and going back to shaving cream and a razor.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unable to use it corded (battery only operation), and 3)</li>
            <li> trimmer may be difficult to get use unless you take the head off (and extra</li>
            <li> The 1250x trimmer is one step above useless.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe the difference in this shaver and the $70-90 shaver&#x27;s I &#x27;ve owed in the past.</li>
            <li> It worked as advertised for a short time, and then failed.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it would be only 4 because it is expensive</li>
            <li> I usually shave with a safety razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I usually use foil razors</li>
            <li> No more removing the head, unclasping a holder, taking the blades out, then brushing it out.  </li>
            <li> No more shaving like a Caveman.</li>
            <li> Wasted money!</li>
            <li> There is NOT, a better razor on the PLANET....</li>
            <li> i telephoned the philips customer support telephone number and after a few questions the person tells me that i should NOT leave it in the charger when i am not using it..!</li>
            <li> UPS ground from ohiop should take no more than 3 days MAX..</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for the past 20 years or so.</li>
            <li> And I have not had any trouble with razor burn!  </li>
            <li> So, I have stuck with Norelco for the past fifteen years</li>
            <li> and the shave was not much better and the reason I use an electric razor is so I do not have to use shaving gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> we received was a shaver head, in a small box.  </li>
            <li> I always have to flip up the small &amp;#34;straight section&amp;#34; on this shaver to pickup where the circular area does not get.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need solution or the self-cleaning thing, it&#x27;s pointless.  </li>
            <li> I have had 2 razors die in the past 2 years.  </li>
            <li> and i usually use a safety razor to shave.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> Well, no more with this razor.</li>
            <li> Also, skin irritation is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> He has been using it for years now and loves the small trimmer for his mustache</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I tore the packaging away before boarding the plane back to Brazil.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to unplug the small wall-wart when not charging - do not charge continuously - another liability.  </li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for the past 20 + yrs.</li>
            <li> I hope that the blades last, as they are expensive to change.</li>
            <li> Had been using blades for past 10 years.</li>
            <li> im not sure</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not impressed with the pop-out hair trimmer for trimming facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the shaver is expensive</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY PEOPLE!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I want to state that I usually buy 1 to 3 products from Amazon Prime a week.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but starting a blood thinner, my doctor said &#x27;</li>
            <li> However, I only give it one star because the replacement heads, which used to be affordable, are now outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> It is terrible and leaves many hairs unshaved.</li>
            <li> This is the worst Norelco shaver I have purchased over many years.  </li>
            <li> I have encountered in the past with electric shavers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pop up shaver is small, but does the job for trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> instead of popping out like in the past, it&#x27;s just on the back side, which makes it a little awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> - The heads being so elevated above the trimmer makes the trimmer a little awkward to us, as the heads are often bumping into some part of your face while you&#x27;re using the trimmer.</li>
            <li> This waiting game has gotten quite irritating, as I&#x27;ve been using the aforementioned crappy $8 razor that does a sub-par job while I patiently wait Norelco to come through for me with my replacement razor.  </li>
            <li> I simply sliced open the tape covering the seal on the cardboard box and inside the razor was packaged in a custom eggshell with no tape or annoying plastic packaging.  </li>
            <li> Braun still gives a slightly closer shave, but they are not ideal as a solo unit if you have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> Up until recently, I hated electric razors because they were hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> Yes it is quieter, but I find it is harder to shave above my lip as it has no give, and the poor battery life makes it inconvenient.</li>
            <li> At $60 per RQ12 replacement head, this razor is just unjustifiably expensive as a long term shaving solution</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive per bottle, but a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very slow comparing to my previous speed-XL.</li>
            <li> The Phillips/Norelco shavers have always been less irritating to the skin than the foil screen shavers.  </li>
            <li> In the worst case - I figured - If it didn&#x27;t live up, I could simply return it and get another $50 something or</li>
            <li> (it was really hard every time to get the curves around my chin).</li>
            <li> Hard to beat...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dull in all that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What is so hard about that?</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I like the flexibility in the razor to help with hard to reach places&lt;</li>
            <li> you hardly know you are shaving.</li>
            <li> I can hardly believe it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer placement makes it hard to see what you are trimming.</li>
            <li> And if you push to hard it hurts your face.</li>
            <li> It makes it hard to pack in a travel case.</li>
            <li> But given the fact that it doesn&#x27;t shave your face, these two pros hardly matter.  </li>
            <li> I had tried some electric razors in the past with terrible results; usually significant razor burns and excess stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> It hardly feels like you&#x27;re shaving.    </li>
            <li> That being said, I still get razor burn if I press too hard to do</li>
            <li> Hard to say.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press too hard.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s hard on someone that shaves every day.  </li>
            <li> You can hardly hear the Norelco at all.</li>
            <li> if you buy this, you should replace the cutters every 10 months or so as they do dull.  </li>
            <li> I have a clef chin which has always been hard to shave</li>
            <li> Blades are blades and they get dull.</li>
            <li> And with three cutting heads i can only use one because unless you push hard they don&#x27;t seem to cut.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that you couldn&#x27;t just plug the cord into the razor as you can with ever other electric razor I have owned, you have to use a docking stand to charge the thing - inconvenient, over engineered and just plain stupid.  </li>
            <li> I would pay at least $200 for this razor.</li>
            <li> I can confirm by experience this is no longer an issue (a note is included asking you to give it at least 21 days of usage to get used to)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I can get used to a late day shadow</li>
            <li> Wait at least an hour after getting up before shaving (everyone&#x27;s face gets a bit puffy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust Philips or any company that won&#x27;t allow a negative review.</li>
            <li> Regardless, this guy lasts at least 17 days depending on usage</li>
            <li> I often cut myself at least once or twice while shaving with the fusion, and it is time consuming to pre-lotion, lather, apply evenly, shave off, put on a bandaid, etc etc.</li>
            <li> This is a bit of a negative for the shaver.</li>
            <li> Every electric shaver manufacturer says to try their shaver for at least 30 days.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t throw in the towel for at least 30 days.</li>
            <li> At least the Arctec had a travel case that acted as the charger.  </li>
            <li> This keeps the hairs from falling out of the shaver as some have complained about.</li>
            <li> but at least there is no aggument..</li>
            <li> So I end up using a blade at least once a week which keeps that expense.</li>
            <li> Lately it just didn&#x27;t seem to be doing the job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Others have complained about the flimsy charging stand.</li>
            <li> If it is acceptable, protect the stand well as it&#x27;s delicate, bulky and required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So looks like its a common problem for these just to STOP working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charging stand sucks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing some of the head shaving lately</li>
            <li> but at least no hair.  </li>
            <li> So, I got a cheaper Norelco ($80.00) and have been unhappy for the last year.  </li>
            <li> The blade retension system sucks and 2 blades have fallen out over 2 months.</li>
            <li> I have owned at least 15 Norelco razors.</li>
            <li> (like it is when you shave) and then cold water when you open the three blade compartments.</li>
            <li> I had never liked the shave I got from my Braun.</li>
            <li> At least nothing I can afford.</li>
            <li> Everything is fantastic about this product -- except for an absolutely horrible charger.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month and have been left with nothing but disappointment.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is tiny, awkward to use and noisy whenever it cuts hair.</li>
            <li> If you check out the review comments for those heads, there are a lot of negative comments.  </li>
            <li> Just as if it wasn&#x27;t already confusing enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You need to go slowly with it</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard</li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard this razor will not work for you.  </li>
            <li> have thick hair</li>
            <li> Shaving time started out a bit slow and remained so..</li>
            <li> In order for it to cut well you have to go REALLY slow and that takes forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With my thick neck beard - I literally take 1-2 minutes doing circles,</li>
            <li> I purchased it and was not very happy.</li>
            <li> This was a real negative on previous versions of Phillips/Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Braun looks a bit big due to the its base with the cleaning solution inside.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other catch to having that giant charging base is that if it stops working, you can&#x27;t use the razor anymore.</li>
            <li> no more razor cuts!</li>
            <li> I tried moving the shaver in small circles while using it -- and it made all the difference in the world!</li>
            <li> It was hard to consider switching over to this from my trusty Gillette, but the cost of the replacement blades was getting ridiculous.</li>
            <li> , manufacturing defects mean I cannot recommend this product</li>
            <li> No more blade shaving!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got a little confused, cause I&#x27;m dumb</li>
            <li> However, I hate to shave because of the time, mess and overall discomfort.</li>
            <li> the ergonomics of the long pointy handle feels awkward.</li>
            <li> After a few years, it was hard to find the lotion packets, and eventually became too expensive to buy the lotion packs.</li>
            <li> The trimmer stopped working, the cleaning base stopped charging it, and it was time for a new head.  </li>
            <li> Beyond ridiculous.</li>
            <li> If you take shaving seriously, this is the shaver for you.    </li>
            <li> replacement heads are expensive, but if you look around you can find them for less.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads are expensive, but if you look around you can find them for less.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely ridiculous at this price point.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Product quality has serious issue as I&#x27;m an overseas buyer and my purchase is not eligible for warranty..</li>
            <li> This pricing is just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> However, the recharge stand is bulky and oddly shaped, and thus difficult to pack for business trips.  </li>
            <li> That gel was impossible to find locally.  </li>
            <li> I also hated the self cleaning unit since it was large and bulky to carry on vacations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to say that I see little difference between this shaver and the cheaper one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My husband has never liked an electric razor because he has a tough beard.  </li>
            <li> I do not have a tough or thick beard but tender</li>
            <li> the clipper part was designed poorly that you had a hard time angling it.&lt;br /&gt;I returned the item as a result</li>
            <li> After several weeks of use I have been very disappointed in the \\&quot;SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver\\&quot; performance; after I shave my scalp is often dry and somewhat flaky in need of lotion, but no shaving bumps</li>
            <li> Overall I can&#x27;t fault it, the father in law just brought one so it can&#x27;t be all that bad.</li>
            <li> The cheeks and mandible was acceptable but my neck was really not good at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was dead wrong.</li>
            <li> This is not a good razor for travelling.  </li>
            <li> it is just not a good buy.</li>
            <li> The charger can also be connected directly to the shaver without the need of the base.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco will always need its base in order to keep charged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charger can also be connected directly to the shaver without the need of the base.   </li>
            <li> in those spots if needed you can whip out a safety razor and knock it out in about 2 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;-Charging must be done on the base you cannot connect the cord directly ( assume this helps keep it water</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is pretty pathetic, very narrow, and difficult to get to grab the hair you&#x27;re cutting - it takes as long to trim my sideburns as it does to shave!  </li>
            <li> I could feel the vibration in my teeth as I shaved, and it was not a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> Wait at least an hour after getting up before shaving (everyone&#x27;s face gets a bit puffy when sleeping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence because you have a thick beard and don&#x27;t believe this product will work, give it a try!</li>
            <li> Words are not enough,I must be crazy to write whose down.</li>
            <li> My husband has Parkinson&#x27;s disease and it was very hard for him to use a razor with a blade.  </li>
            <li> Not very impressed.  </li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and need all of the help I can get with an electric razor to minimize skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and it gave me a shave as close as any</li>
            <li> My beard is what I would describe as being moderately tough</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard, but tender skin.</li>
            <li> It does the job on his tough beard.</li>
            <li> My husband has tender skin and a totally tough beard.</li>
            <li> He hair is multi-directional and very thick (as is mine).</li>
            <li> The shaver operates at a very slow speed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the head in place the pop-up trimmer is a little awkward.</li>
            <li> do have a few rogue hairs that come in very thick, the shaving head would just roll over these without cutting them, so I popped out the edge clipper</li>
            <li> (sorry for my bad english)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been frustrating finding a shaver that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do \\&quot;SHAVE\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was getting tired.</li>
            <li> Took 3 times longer and did a worse job than any Norelco I&#x27;d owned.    </li>
            <li> purchased a Norelco 6885XL lift and cut shaver approximately 9 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how poor of a shave</li>
            <li> NORELCO NO LONGER STANDS BEHIND ITS DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused</li>
            <li> Then came the waiting game.  </li>
            <li> Negatives are that edge of blades don&#x27;t allow for hairs close to nose area and pop-up trimmer works poorly.  </li>
            <li> --Not house broken.</li>
            <li> The shave quality is poor and the pop up trimmer is joke.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not hauling that giant base with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor seemed to be of poor construction; it had a plastic toy-like feel to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a razor that didn&#x27;t irritate my neck and leave some stray whiskers behind.  </li>
            <li> But whoever designed the concept did not take into consideration that things can get broken or lost.  </li>
            <li> This is a poor model Do not buy.</li>
            <li> When traveling, the stand will be an inconvenience, and it might get broken.  </li>
            <li> B0023XF60Q SHAVE SECRET SHAVING</li>
            <li> It is poor.</li>
            <li> The airlines and I have broken two</li>
            <li> I purchased Shave Secret and noticed an immediate improvement.  </li>
            <li> So Soft Bath Oil that I had used as mosquito repellent.  </li>
            <li> but I have some weird morale conflicts with writing negative reviews.</li>
            <li> This is bulky and poorly designed for travel.  </li>
            <li> only shave once every 2 weeks, because I hate doing it.  </li>
            <li> The worst problem, other than the fact there is no cord which several other reviewers have noted, is that the pop up shaver is virtually worthless.  </li>
            <li> No more dirty sink or countertop.  </li>
            <li> THE TRIMMER, HOWEVER, IS TOO SMALL AND AWKWARD TO USE.  </li>
            <li> To my disappointment, i ended up with a lot of nicks and burns all over my cheeks and my throat and neck area became very messy and irritated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;a mediocre job on my weak beard</li>
            <li> Probably not much of an issue at home, but again could be annoying if you&#x27;re packing it after use for travel.  </li>
            <li> No loud annoying angry mosquito buzz.</li>
            <li> The shave quality is ridiculously bad in the neck area, even on plain non-groovy areas of the chest</li>
            <li> I have been disappointed with all previous electric razors; however I prefer them when I travel</li>
            <li> but I was a little disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> I have to look for the missed hairs all over, so I&#x27;m a  little disappointed in the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Another benefit is that I don&#x27;t end up getting the five o&#x27;clock shadow as bad as I usually do.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> The beard edge trimmer is nearly useless.</li>
            <li> The $70 shavers should work like this one, but atlas, they are junk and should be illegal to sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I realize like a lot of folks, that this razor is expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect on the neck</li>
            <li> The pop out trimmer is useless in my mind.</li>
            <li> I stayed away from electric shavers for years after a terrible experience when I was younger- irritation, rashes, discomfort, etc.</li>
            <li> Not impressed  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this shaver wasn&#x27;t an improvement.</li>
            <li> Phillips/Norelco should provide this feature on a shaver this expensive).  </li>
            <li> the expensive Norelco provided.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not buying anymore expensive blades.</li>
            <li> Expensive head</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> (sorry Norelco)</li>
            <li> The built-in trimmer is still absolutely useless.  </li>
            <li> and it had a difficult time with longer stubble that you may have after a weekend of not shaving.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> When razor is out of warranty is become useless.  </li>
            <li> but in reality it should have a rating of useless.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You might wonder that replacement blade is expensive around $50 on amazon</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that razor blades are expensive.</li>
            <li> It is not perfect, but sometimes you can&#x27;t have your cake and eat it too.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but I felt there would be a payback over buying blades.</li>
            <li> There are also a few flaws with this model that are annoying when shaving.</li>
            <li> something else had failed within the shaver</li>
            <li> but it stops randomly.  </li>
            <li> He of course saw nothing wrong with this until he started using this electric razor.</li>
            <li> too expensive and 2.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver\\&quot; fails to shave as closely</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for me to rate this.  </li>
            <li> I like the razor, but it is expensive and the rplacement  head is also expensive.  </li>
            <li> this expensive just for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s equally useless as the $30 models.</li>
            <li> So instead of buying another too expensive BRAUN,I opted to check out the NORELCO 3D line.</li>
            <li> Indicator lights on the handle would flash randomly but would not charge.  </li>
            <li> Answer from Amazon Rep \\&quot;Sorry</li>
            <li> , I could just randomly move it in circular motion, and it does the job</li>
            <li> Needless to say we&#x27;ll take any help we can get and</li>
            <li> But this product falls prey to &#x27;Freebie Marketing&#x27; gone wrong...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the switch gave out.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this razor because the last one I bought like it was a terrible shave and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the price, though.  </li>
            <li> The razor has a problem staying in the lame cumbersome charger that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> (sorry for that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shane</li>
            <li> I did not purchase the system-too expensive.</li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time consuming, uncomfortable, messy and annoying.  </li>
            <li> Expensive?  </li>
            <li> I have to tell you that I consider this shaver useless to me.</li>
            <li> Really expensive for what I got from this electric razor.</li>
            <li> I think there is nothing wrong with my choice.</li>
            <li> Its an expensive machine</li>
            <li> 1), the stand is very poorly designed to the point of being useless.</li>
            <li> Razors like these are particularly terrible on my cleft, because I cannot quite get my chin as flat as this razor needs it to be to shave well.</li>
            <li> When I looked closely at the shaver i saw a very poorly constructed device.  </li>
            <li> It is poorly built and workmanship is extremely bad.</li>
            <li> but minus 1 star for the horrible trimmer.  </li>
            <li> too thick and electric shavers hate him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I almost immediately returned the 1250x due to the absolutely horrible trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Going dry-shave, I may give the tiniest of edges to Panasonic over Braun and Norelco, but all three are awfully close  - to each other and in quality of shave.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the product that breaks down within 6 months, i&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Price is a little outrageous though.  </li>
            <li> Cutting:</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take any longer and I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself ,</li>
            <li> And because there was no contact with even one of the heads there was no spinning just the buzz of the drivers underneath going like crazy.  </li>
            <li> disappointment considering the reviews this razor received.</li>
            <li> I contacted Philips-Norelco and told them why I was unhappy with the replacement head.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the downside, this razor doesn&#x27;t have the cutting power of others on the market.  </li>
            <li> Gets all those whiskers on your neck that go in all crazy directions.</li>
            <li> I got fed up with cutting myself and wanted an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> To me this is a design feature that is both convenient and inconvenient.</li>
            <li> However, there&#x27;s a lot to be said for not having to use shaving cream, and being in a hurry, and not having to worry about cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Norelco 1250X/40 - I was desperate at this point.  </li>
            <li> After using the 3D for three weeks, I have seen no trace of any hair eluding the wrath of the 3D&#x27;s cutting blades.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit awkward to use in the neck area (the reason for 4 stars and not 5).</li>
            <li> To say I was unhappy is an undertatement.  </li>
            <li> 99% of the shaved hairs stay inside the well under the cutting heads and can be flushed away in seconds if shaving in the shower it cleans as you shave but rinse when you are done</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t trust Norelco with another purchase ever after pulling this dirty pricing trick.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco has disappointed me with support for this expensive shaver.</li>
            <li> was unable to register the product at Phillips / Norelco!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very thick hair growth, and I have always hated using an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> An of course, it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 6 years and the battery started to go bad.</li>
            <li> +, has bad reviews and costs over $50.</li>
            <li> The BAD news:</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m thinking the charger is bad.  </li>
            <li> bad thing:</li>
            <li> To conclude, I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product, but it just wasn&#x27;t a winner for me.</li>
            <li> bad:  </li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> I shave my head every 5 days, I like to use a razor for that job but from time to time I get to cut my skin with the razor and that really painful, so I wanted a shaving machine that can put up with this job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The difference to me is that my skin is no longer breaking out and painful.  </li>
            <li> I was so sick of shaving with a blade and shaving cream</li>

            <li> I know, crazy!  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Anyway got the 1250 and was immediately disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;EDIT: (may 28, 2014)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it for the convenience, but am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just a tad disappointed.  </li>
            <li> disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be disappointed but I am.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed in this razor&#x27;s durability.</li>
            <li> Anyone thinking about purchasing this I can&#x27;t see being disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I gave it three shaves and was still very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> On calling Philips I was told that it was the base</li>
            <li> Another thing I hate is the hair collection chambers.  </li>
            <li> And the fact that you need to take the charging stand with you when you go on trips is annoying.</li>
            <li> Norelco will always need its base in order to keep charged.    </li>
            <li> The instructions say, \\&quot;While rinsing razor heads, water may drip out of the base of razor.</li>
            <li> You see, I&#x27;ve used blades for years but hate the amount of time it adds to my morning grooming.</li>
            <li> The charging stand was designed by an idiot.</li>

            <li> I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Awful shave.  </li>
            <li> My husband wanted an electric razor in the worst way.  </li>
            <li> My worst fear about getting an(other)</li>
            <li> This is the worst Norelco shaver I have owned.</li>
            <li> For the neck area, it is terrible.</li>
            <li> The system for recharging  Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s outrageous.  </li>
            <li> Terrible terrible investment.</li>
            <li> The 1250x/40 will give you the worst skin rash you have ever had.&lt;br</li>
            <li> catch is the replacement shaver head is very expensive, $60-70!!</li>
            <li> The trimmer in the shaver is horrible.  </li>
            <li> but Philips customer service is the WORST!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Neck hurts a little after shaving. Doesnt work much on the mustache.</li>
            <li> This Norelco shaver was a gift for my husband&#x27;s birthday. His old one finally wore out after about 25 years of service. He is completely satisfied with this new Norelco 1250X/40 Sense Touch 3D and uses it every day.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son&#x27;s birthday, and he loves the close shave it,gives him.</li>
            <li> basically good, but I wish there was a bigger trimmer</li>
            <li> Bought as a birthday present for my S/O he didn&#x27;t like it and we ended up sending it back.He said it was not nearly as good a shave for his face as the brand he currently uses.</li>
            <li> Good razor, works fine on wet and dry surfaces. I must admit that I expected a little bit more of it, but after sharing my experiences with other owners I am happy with my razor.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this shaver. Planned to get it for a while. I am very disappointed! Shaves my cheek well but but it leaves hairs sticking out of my neck(!) and is difficult to manage around my mouth. It has not been better than a cheap plastic disposable. The beard edge trimmer is nearly useless. I tried to give it a try, to stick with it. Stuck too long ended up beyond the return window. It gets two stars because it charges quickly and is easy to clean, but it does not give me a clean, easy shave, so it&#x27;s really 1 star of performance and two of convenience. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, well packed. Does a great job, particularly compared to the old Norelco it replaced. I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> No power returned shaver</li>
            <li> Purchased this razor as a Christmas gift for my husband.  Less than four months later, the shaver heads are not seating properly.  They make a grinding sound and he has to open and close them all to re-engage.  This fix may last until the next day when he shaves.  Paid a lot of money for a piece of junk.  I&#x27;ve been a Norelco customer for over forty years, but I think I&#x27;m ready to change over to a different product.  Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> This seller is excellent, and the products are brand new.  Great!!!!</li>
            <li> for the first 4 months, everything works great. And I love the water clean feature.&lt;br /&gt;But after 4 months, it started to be very noisy. I have to use my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I get a lemon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t return it back to amazon due to the return policy. Now I need to find out how to get a replacement from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This is really a great shaver. Close shave, easy to clean... a little pricey but totally worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver. Works well.</li>
            <li> one of the best electric shavers @</li>
            <li> does not shave as well as the cheaper Razors</li>
            <li> FOR THE THIRD TIME I BOUGHT ONE I AMAZON, THE RESULT IS ALWAYS THE SAME.IT WORKS FOR 1 OR 2 YEARS AND THEN  IT DIES. I NEED ANOTHER ONE , I WILL HAVE TO BUY A DIFFERENT BRAND.</li>
            <li> Bought this product as a gift for my brother on his request. He loved it! I had bought this while it was on sale and being that it was reasonably priced, it was in perfect condition. Thanks to the seller for the great product! Would consider buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Works well with shaving cream, and also dry when you&#x27;re in a rush. Charge lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the traditional Norelco razors for decades and have been satisfied. They&#x27;ve all lasted a long time and done a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new 3D razor is much more comfortable and does the job significantly faster than the older models. It&#x27;s also a wet-dry razor that you can use in the shower or with shaving cream, although I haven&#x27;t tried either of those options yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the least expensive 3D model since the only difference with the more expensive models are more sophisticated power indicators. The three indicator lights with the last one turning red when it&#x27;s time to recharge are quite sufficient. Go with the model 40 and save your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update October 7, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the razor for coming up on two years now and it&#x27;s still working perfectly. Battery charges and holds charge, no water damage even though I use it frequently in the shower. Original blade unit is still sharp.</li>
            <li> After using a Remington Electric razor for about 6 months I was ready to go back to blade razors. I tried a Norelco Spectra and loved it. I used it for about 6 years and the battery started to go bad. I then bought the Norelco 1250x/40 and have found it to be a wonderful razor. I have found that I have the smoothest shave on my face and neck with no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> As a Norelco user for years this is by far the best razor.  Very comfortable and close shave and a log battery life.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a blade for over 40 years. I wanted to switch to an electric razor for ease of use. I cannot be happier with my decision to go with the Philips Norelco 1250x. I read several on line reviews prior to my final decision. The shave is close and very comfortable. I have completed the 21 day test and am thrilled. I have not used water or shaving cream since receiving the razor approx 3 weeks ago. Part of the reason for my purchase was to lose the shaving ritual. Even with the dry shave, the shaver is ultra comfortable. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Yes this shaver works like a shaver should. That is, it works like any decent one should. The $70 shavers should work like this one, but atlas, they are junk and should be illegal to sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been frustrating finding a shaver that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do \\&quot;SHAVE\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I don&#x27;t like the price, but at least it does that one simple thing, shave, and my frustrations are down. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lambert Klein Author of: [[ASIN:B004LLIXNA SEO Results the Organic Way - Search Engine Optimization for Beginners]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for the past 35 years. My last last one had been rebuilt about twenty years ago, and later had the cutting head replaced as well as the battery. Even though it was still working relatively well, I wanted a little better shave for my aging face. After looking at the makes and models of shavers on display in the stores I shop at, I cruised the internet and did more research on shavers. I settled on the Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d shaver because the descriptions of what it could do design wise was just what I was looking for. I didn&#x27;t need the additional bells and whistles of the even higher models of Norelco.  A month later, I (and my wife) am extremely happy with my purchase. It has surpassed my expectations of how it would perform. The trimmer is also better designed and more effective on the side burns as well as other stay hairs on the ears, etc.   Thanks to Norelco for the design and rebate, and to Amazon.com for the great price opportunity. This has been another happy purchase through Amazon.com. And to think, I used to think that they just sold books and music type stuff!!!!! (Let&#x27;s see.... I&#x27;ve purchased speaker systems, cordless drills, ..................)</li>
            <li> This is the base model of the Senso Touch line with out all of the bells and whistles but the performance is top of the line. I have been using electric razors for 15 years and  this gives, without a doubt, the best shave ever. I use it in the shower with a wet soapy face and have eliminated almost all irritation with the closest shave I have ever had, blade or electric. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Close shaves wet or dry. Easy to clean. Sleek design making it easy to hold and maneuver. Overall great shaver...best one I&#x27;ve owned in years.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco shaver user for over 40 years and the SensoTouch 3D provides the closes, fastest  best shave I have ever experienced. The battery charge lasts two weeks and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was going to get a great razor for my husband but he hates it.  The trimmer on the outside doesn&#x27;t work at all and he has to clean it everyday because it holds no shavings.  I wish I had purchased a less expensive  norelco model similar to the one he had before.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor that I have every owned. So far it works really good and holds a charge for a long time before having to recharge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student living on a budget and this was a lot bigger of a purchase than any other typical razors I&#x27;ve bought! The Gillete just wasn&#x27;t giving me a comfortable shave and I couldn&#x27;t bare shaving every day for such a so so shave (it was really hard every time to get the curves around my chin). After putting up with it forever I saw this on Woot. I didn&#x27;t give it much thought at first because it was so expensive but then it was nagging me so I started looking at reviews. I needed it to be a close shave, with no hair to feel if I ran my fingers across my face. I also needed it to be a comfortable shave, and be able to shave at least once a day and it not be painful. I&#x27;m that person that reads a ton of reviews before I buy something like this, and they were all absolutely right. I LOVE this razor and I wouldn&#x27;t give it up for 10 years worth of free power glides or something. Smooth shave, and very comfortable. My brother was even astounded by the results I told him about, he commented he didn&#x27;t know an electric razor could cut so close! And of course the girlfriend approved, so it was definitely a great purchase, no buyers remorse possible.   A couple things about the actual features...Pretty easy to clean, though the manual is somewhat confusing (yeah, I&#x27;m one of those that read manuals too). Battery life is pretty sweet, I&#x27;ve shaved almost once per day since I got it (a month ago) and I just now had to recharge it. It does get a little hot towards the end of your shave which can make things take longer and not feel as nice as a cool razor, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all.   Overall, an amazingly close and comfortable shave, and worth every penny.  UPDATE (Nov 8 &#x27;11) - It was May 3 when I wrote this review, and nothing has changed. I still love it, still get great battery life out of it: I could count the number of times I&#x27;ve charged it probably with one hand. Carrying case is great for travel. Still gives a great shave, I&#x27;ve gotten a little lazy and at times if I don&#x27;t go over my chin enough it&#x27;ll miss the stubble. I&#x27;ll say now that it&#x27;s not going to shave everything off, especially with one pass. I shave and spend a few minutes, maybe 3 or 4, going over my cheeks, chin, mustache and neck. Neck can be tough and never really gets as close a shave as anywhere else, but that&#x27;s kinda a priority issue. Gets a pretty great shave on the cheeks and mustache, except for right at the jaw line, it takes more effort and often there is more stubble there, but again I don&#x27;t mind the little left behind. The chin is the toughest part to get. I end up just kinda pulling my skin (around the jaw line and chin) up and shaving it on a flatter surface to get it. Girlfriend is still happy, so I&#x27;m happy! I also have blonde hair, so I suppose I can&#x27;t see any stubble left behind really; this might be different for a darker haired person. Still a great buy, I know I&#x27;ll be getting a replacement head for it come ~April of next year!</li>
            <li> I have used Norelso&#x27;s electric razor&#x27;s for over 25 years. This model is by far the best. Faster, closer shave and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Used worse, however this shaver is far from impressive, especially considering how much it costs. A standard razorhead could do the job much faster and effectively.  Unless you plan to use this thing for 5 or more years, and spend 20 minutes each time you want to fully shave your face, you will regret buying it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]  Toward the end of November last year I saw an electric shaver (another brand) on sale for what looked like a great price. Now I know why it was on sale! It did not do a very good job. My wife often asked if I intended to shave. Finally I resorted to my blade! Now I get a great shave again! Thanks to my new Norelco!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST SHAVER IN THE WORLD PERIOD.....   I HAVE BEEN USING ALL MY LIFE PHILLIPS SHAVERS AND THEY ARE THE BEST ELECTRIC SHAVERS. BUT THIS WITH THIS ONE YOU GET A SHAVE AS CLOSE AS USING A RAZOR AND YOU DON&#x27;T GET ANY IRRITATION ON THE CONTRARY YOU GET A SMOOTH MASSAGE IN YOUR FACE. THE IDEA OF USING AN ELECTRIC SHAVER WITH SHAVING CREAM IS GREAT. IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT THIS IS THE BEST SHAVER IN THE WORLD .</li>
            <li> My last two nivea norelcos, and the archtect or some such really sucked. Dont know why. They just didnt cut like my first and second norelco&#x27;s of old. Not enough flex or something I really dont know? This one is does. And it works wet or dry to boot. Its very easy to clean so I dont think you need to get the optional cleaning station, just rinse and go! The trimmer is a little small, but it gets the job done. Highly recomended. If you can afford it, get it. Its made a regular shaver out of me. And I own everything from a fusion pro glide to a Double Edge Aristocrat. It also works with shaving cream! Hard to beat...</li>
            <li> I realize like a lot of folks, that this razor is expensive. Its simply the best electric razor I have ever owned.  It does a nice close shave (not as close as a blade, but very good).  It doesnt even irritate my skin when shaving dry. I used it with a pre shave and it does a real nice job.  Its easy to clean and I have yet to charge it after gettting it about a month ago. There is even a rebate coming on it. A overall really good razor. I purchased this razor at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This razor gives an  incredibly smooth and close shave.  That&#x27;s why I purchased it - and it lives up to its marketing claims.</li>
            <li> I bought this Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver for my son  After use of half a year I can tell u he like it very much. He enjoy using this Philips Norelco Electric Shaver - recomended for u too</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black  This is my best shaver, i like it because it can be use water to wash.</li>
            <li> I was using an older Philips Norelco model (maybe a 600 series?) for a few years and it was getting tired. Very pleased with the 1250, works like a champ. I see people mentioning the &#x27;give your skin a month to get used to it&#x27; - I had no skin issues moving form the older one to this one, it just works a lot better!  *** I do agree with others, the trimmer is not the best designed feature. Knocked a star off for this, and the charger is a little more fussy with it&#x27;s dedicated stand. I get why they did it that way, just not the most user friendly for travel.</li>
            <li> I have used 5 or 6 different electric shavers in the past 15 years and this has been the best one by far. It gives an extremely close shave even in some of the more difficult spots under the neck. It is very quiet and easy to clean up since it allows for rinsing under warm water. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Got my Grandson the Philips Norelco 1250x/40 Shaver from Amazon for Christmas, and he&#x27;s thrilled with it.  He has one of the thickest beards I&#x27;ve ever seen (this is a kid who has to shave his back before dates), and this razor really does the job. We would really recommend it to anyone who needs a heavy-duty shaver.</li>
            <li> First I have to say, the shipping was really fast!! This was a Christmas gift for my fiance. He&#x27;s always bought cheap shavers and they always irritated his skin and never got a close shave. After a few weeks of researching I decided to go with this one for him. He loves it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin at all and gives a very close shave. He&#x27;s really happy with it.  I&#x27;m also happy that I got to use the $30 coupon right on this site and there&#x27;s also a 45 day money back guarantee if not satisfied which is nice! But he&#x27;s more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> The razor works Better than I would have ever thought possible. I would pay at least $200 for this razor. I am coming from using a norelco razor that had the Nivea goo come out. It works way better, it&#x27;s smoother and cuts closer. The best part is that I can use shaving cream with it and it works like a dream. You will Not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Close shave. Easy cleaning.  Holds charge for many shaves. Overall a great shaver that gets the job done right!  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor three weeks ago because I wanted to go back to an electric razor. I wanted the best of both worlds. A shaver that could do wet and dry shaves. After several months of researching the net and reading reviews, I decided to purchase the Phiilips Norelco 1250/40 SensoTouch 3D with the Jet Rinser. The reason I chose this model is that it had the blade heads of the razor flexing outward. I used this razor with my shaving cream and instantaniously, I felt like I was shaving with a blade. It was smooth and no pulling at all. It was quick and it took less than three minutes. It was easy to rinse and to clean. I deep clean it with the jet rinser once a week, to insure a like new razor feel. I would recommend this to every man.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift and he absolutely loves it, to say the least! He has been through many electric shavers and back and forth with the disposable razors. After using this, he says he will never go back to disposables! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I retired my SensoTouch 3D Shaver because the replacement heads got way too expensive - for those of you still using this shaver, you can change it to the same head as the 9000 series.    I have the 9700 which in my opinion shaves no better than my SensoTouch 3D and wish I&#x27;d just bought the 9000 series head.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco wet shavers for a good 10 years; the last one I bought and am still using is the model HS8420 (probably now obsolete) which gives me a reasonably good shave for an electric razor.  I was hoping that the 3D Senso Touch model, at twice the price of the HS8420, would give at least as good a shave and hopefully superior shave.  Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that the newer and higher priced 3D gives me a totally inferior shave even when using the Norelco shaver lubricant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be that the design of the 3D model, in order to allow for both dry and wet shaving, is necessarily not optimized for wet shaving.  I have a tough beard and need all of the help I can get with an electric razor to minimize skin irritation.  The older, 2D type, appears to do the job reasonably well, especially when I use the Norelco shaver lubricant frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco 3D Sens Touch may be good for other beards, not certainly not for mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The Norelco model HS8420 is still available on Amazon for $50, a real bargain for those who prefer wet shaves.  This model is neither 2D nor 3D, as I understand it now.  I believe both the 2D and 3D are sold to be used either wet or dry.  This model HS8420 costs about only twice the price of its replaceable head.  this head needs to be replaced, in my opinion, about once every six months, or possibly up to a year, depending upon the user&#x27;s beard and how the shaver has been used.</li>
            <li> I love the process of shaving with a real razor because it&#x27;s relaxing and there&#x27;s a technique involved, but I hate doing it frequently because it takes time and it&#x27;s somewhat messy. I actually shave very little, since my work doesn&#x27;t require it. Now that I have the SensoTouch 3D, my coworkers are going to be shocked at how often I come in clean shaven.    Simply put, this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned! It&#x27;s quiet, fast, and cuts extremely close.     I can&#x27;t describe how impressive it is to have an electric razor that doesn&#x27;t sound like a weed whacker. This guy sounds like a cell phone vibrating, very little noise at all. It&#x27;s like getting a shave and a mini facial massage at the time.    I think it took less than 5 minutes for me to dry shave the first time, after charging the unit overnight. It was quick and painless. The hair on my neck grows in a strange pattern and typically large amounts of hair get missed, if I use anything other than an actual razor. The SensoTouch 3D got most of the hair all the other electric shaver usually miss. I did have to go over the area a few times and that did cause a little irritation after the fact, but I think that&#x27;s typical for using any new shaver for the first time.     Clean up is a awesome. The hair gets collected into the unit while you use it, so very little if any hair lands in the sink (big points on the \\&quot;Wife Score\\&quot; chart). Then when you need too, you simply pop open the shaving heads and rinse this bad boy under the water. It couldn&#x27;t be easier or more efficient. Plus, the ability to both dry and wet shave is great feature.       I can&#x27;t recommend this enough!!</li>
            <li> (Husband reviewing)    Well, I was pretty impressed.  I was very hesitant to try another electric razor, because they usually caused a lot of irritation to my skin.  However, this was a good exception to the rule.      It felt very smooth to the touch, and it was very soothing.  As promised, the razor did adjust to my face, and was able to get out the hairs much better than I&#x27;ve had with electric razors in the past.  With each time that I have used this razor, the cuts have been consistent and still just as smooth.      Cleaning is easy as well.  All you have to do is lift the head and the hairs are easy to retrieve.  I also don&#x27;t have to worry about running the battery.  It looks like it has a pretty long life, but the charger works just as easily.    Is it worth the $200?  Well, in this economy, maybe you&#x27;d stick with the manual, because I&#x27;ll admit the price is pretty steep.  I do believe, however, that it does delivers what it promises, so I have to give it the highest rating.</li>
            <li> Easy on the face. Provides a great shave for an electric. Also love the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof .</li>
            <li> Por el momento llevo solo una rasurada, pero puedo decir que la rasuradora se siente bien: es confortabla, ergonómica, ... La rasurada resultó confortable y prácticamente sin irritación, por ahora la probé en seco. Voy a probarla con una rasurada húmeda con gel, ... Lo que espero es poder rasurarme sin las irritaciones que sufría con el rastrillo o con otra rasuradora que tenía. Por el momento el pronóstico es favorable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers all my life, but nothing comes close to the Philips SensoTouch 3D.  It&#x27;s quite, smooth, comfortable, painless and best of all, it really give you a very close shave, even at the hard to get spots.  And one more thing, it is so easy to clean, just rinse it under warm tap water, that&#x27;s it.  It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver for my husband for Christmas because his old Norleco shaver had worn out.  He really likes it.  It&#x27;s so compact and quiet and it&#x27;s so easy to clean because you can run the head under running water.[[ASIN:B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]</li>
            <li> Being a traditionalist, I was at first taken back by the design. The last innovative Norelco I had purchased was not as  good as the more conventional one before. The Philips Norelco 1250X is everything it says it is. It shaves closer, feels   more natural, cleans easily.</li>
            <li> The Sensotouch is pretty good. It has a charging cradle which is the essential feature of any shaver. The heads cut well, and the battery lasts for ages. I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy the special cleaner as it is really easy to just clean it with water from the tap.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing. My husband should be writing this review not me. There are so many contours to a human face and this razor with its exceptional technology is able to meld, fold, bend, curve to make this happen. It is quiet. Pleasant. A joy to use. My husband has thanked me every couple of days for getting this for him.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver.  Small, light, almost noiseless, a very close shave, easy to clean, versatile in many ways.  The best I&#x27;ve e had in many years (this is my 4th Norelco in the past years).</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my Husband for Christmas. His old shaver (Norelco) was only a couple years old so I was unsure as to whether to buy it or not. He had already shaved and then decided to use his new razor. He was amazed at how much more it shaved off and what a clean shave it was. He loves it! So glad I bought it for him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelcos for many years.  Typically when you buy a newer model (particularly at this price), you expect an improvement from older and lower priced units.  Here&#x27;s some highlights of how this compares to older units such as the Speed-XL line (which you can still find).    Neck Shaving:  With this razor, I have to go over the upper neck under the chin NUMEROUS times to even attempt to get a close shave. On the Speed-XL, the lip around the edge of the head housing seems to better setup the hairs for shaving as you move the razor across your skin.  Senso&#x3D; 1.5, Speed&#x3D; 4.    Trimmer: The placement of the trimmer on this razor means you can&#x27;t see what you are trimming unless you pull the shaving head assembly off the razor.  On the Speed-XL, flip the trimmer up, trim what you want and flip it down.  If you are like me in that you make several trim touchups as you go over your face, the Senso is not the product for you. Also brings up reliability concerns for how many times the head assembly coupling can be pulled apart and reinserted without wearing out. The Speed-XL also has a wider cutting head making straight line trimming easier.  Senso&#x3D; 2, Speed&#x3D; 5.    Cleaning: With this razor, you must individually pop open each of the three heads.  If you tap the razor against the faucet to shake it out, generally one or two of heads will swing closed meaning they don&#x27;t get fully emptied.  Being able to wash them out with water is good, but it requires HOT water.  Don&#x27;t want to think about how much energy is wasted by running the hot water faucet until you actually get to having hot water come out.  Speed-XL, single button to release heads making it easy to tap them and shake out the shavings. Senso&#x3D; 1.5, Speed&#x3D; 4.    Size shape and balance: Generally OK for both.  However after having used a razor like the Speed-XL, the Senso seems excessively long and narrow (it&#x27;s like trying to shave with a stick) while the Speed fits my hand better and is easier to maneuver.  Senso&#x3D; 3,Speed&#x3D; 4.    Overall, not worth the approximatly $70 more for the SensoTouch 3D unit. If sleek styling is your top priority, go for it.  If practicality and shaving are your top priorities, try another razor.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and till now i have used the Gillette Mach series.     I bought this razor after a lot of research to understand the following  1. Which is better: rotary or foil  2. Should i buy a low cost product as trial or go for the best option  3. Will it completely replace my manual razor  4. Is the quality of shave equal to a careful manual shave    You know the answer to the first 2 questions, and this is what i found  1. Rotary seems like a good choice, though using the round method to shave is much more difficult than I thought. Since I never bought a foil shaver, i still dont know which is bettwe, but sometimes I think the straight movement against the grain would be better and far quicker    2. I didnt want to reject the electric shavers on a poor model so decided to buy the best    3. The shaving takes time, more than a manual shave. You need to ensure carefully that you capture all the hair as just going over that area does not guarantee the same. So you need to constantly peer at the mirror to ensure that Secondly, its far less effective if you want to shave in the evening and then again in the morning    4. Overall, the quality of the shave is acceptable, since I wasnt too particular with my manual shave also on a daily basis. However, if its an important occasion, you probably want to dig out the manual blades  However its great for traveling especially due to the liquid restrictions on flights (i only dry shave)    Should you buy it?  Yes. But remember if its an important occasion you may be better off using the manual blades</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have had many razors in my life but this is by far the best one.  I usually choose to have a rotary shaver.  I have oddly placed hair on my neck that seems to never get touched by foil shavers.  After taking my time and reading about this shaver I choose it for the \\&quot;active lift\\&quot; technology.  I have to say so far I have not had to shave my neck with a straight razor after every shave.  Also I have had little to no irritation on my neck or upper lip.  I have been using the product for about a week now and have found it to be the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had other than a fresh new straight razor.  I am so happy I purchased this razor and would never think of looking at another.</li>
            <li> With increasing frequency, these electric shaver companies release a new product, coming up with increasingly enticing words that turn out to be more hype than substance.    But, we read these \\&quot;words of hope\\&quot; and gamble the money, only to be let down, just like I was with this shaver. I am sure you have read the sales pitch: \\&quot;Sensotouch 3D.\\&quot; \\&quot;Combining gyroflex 3d, ultratrack heads and skinglide....\\&quot; My gosh, I read \\&quot;skinglide\\&quot; and start to believe there can be no skin irritation with a shaver that has \\&quot;skinglide.\\&quot;    They wrote this shaver has holes to catch the shortest stubble. Well, perhaps those holes are blocked since my shaver left so much stubble, and so much longer hair for that matter that I would give this shaver a total fail when keeping in context all that crap they wrote to sell this. I realize they will exaggerate to sell shavers, but this level of exaggeration is unacceptable.    There is absolutely nothing extra special about this shaver. This shaver does exactly what every other shaver before it does. And not as good, in my opinion. So much hair is left on my face, I would only use this if I wanted the short stubble look. And yes, even with shave gel I still felt skin irritation. Lots of irritation.    Please know that while Amazon only began selling it today, the shaver has been available from other sources since mid August. I have tried to stay with this shaver hoping things would improve, but they have not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice looking and it shaves well.  But, i mean, cheaper electric shavers does the same job.</li>
            <li> I have always used regular razors and never had used an electric shaver until now. Yes, a razor will definitely perform a closer shave, the price of razors are nothing compared to this electric shaver but what this shaver has offered is way better than that: convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment you get it out of the box you can clearly see this is a very well made shaver, contrary to others I have seen that look cheap. For those concerned about the price well, you get what you pay for, as soon as you see it and feel it you will understand this unit&#x27;s price range. As a first time user I had to go through several shaves to adjust to the electric shaver and there was minor irritation on the first days. I can confirm by experience this is no longer an issue (a note is included asking you to give it at least 21 days of usage to get used to)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having as a reference the electric shaver of my grandfather and my dad, I was impressed by how little noise this unit makes, it is really quiet.  The shave feels very smooth and close, maybe not as close as a razor but way more convenient if you shave on a daily basis. It is very compact and easy to clean. As a traveler, this is definitely more convenient (hotels normally have those cheap razors that do nothing but leave you with a red face, so I normally end up buying new ones on my trips)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging times are fast and the rechargeable battery has lasted for almost two weeks now without having been recharged (used on a daily basis) which I think is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-line, while cheaper units may do what you would consider the same job, the quality of the unit, the features and the convenience it offers would be reason enough to consider this electric shaver over others. In the end, you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better than my old 49.00, 8 year old Philips razor I was going to replace. Did not Handel well. Cleaning takes too much time,awkward with stubby fingers.</li>
            <li> Two years in this thing works great! Lets me list the ways:&lt;br /&gt;-battery lasts 2+ weeks and charges quickly&lt;br /&gt;-quiet operation doesn&#x27;t wake up the wife&lt;br /&gt;-cuts the hairs on my neck that all previous electrics would miss&lt;br /&gt;-comes with nice travel case and I&#x27;ve stuffed it in bags dozens of times with no damage&lt;br /&gt;-blade set lasts 1 year+&lt;br /&gt;-easy to clean and it actually tells you when it needs cleaning</li>
            <li> The recipient states that this razor is like no other electric razor. He gets a blade close shave each time, even after a few day&#x27;s of growth.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very slow comparing to my previous speed-XL. After a couple of tries, I went back to my old one.</li>
            <li> This is actually the first time I had a bad experience with Amazon, so to that I give them credit as mistakes do happen. Notwithstanding excellent customer service, I never received my first package by FedEx. The delivery driver was new to my area, and it was a cluster. Amazon CS took care of business and send me out a replacement quickly, however when I finally got a chance to open it, it appeared that the box had been opened before. Even the sticker part of the box&#x27;s seal had grime on the sticky part. The razor itself was still sealed in it&#x27;s plastic case, but all of the accessories it came with looked like they had been handled before. There were even these small fibers that kinda looked like small facial hair in the box! Yes, it was gross. CS was willing to send me a new one, again, however after pondering it I ending up just going to Target and picking up a NEW one for the peace of mind of it - even though I ended up spending about $40 more, lol!</li>
            <li> I shave my head every 5 days, I like to use a razor for that job but from time to time I get to cut my skin with the razor and that really painful, so I wanted a shaving machine that can put up with this job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving machine is really expensive especially because I got it shipped to south America. Here in south America we don&#x27;t even get this model of shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after reading so many good things about it I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heaved tray it for at least 7 days shaving my complete head every 2 days and my face every day. This shaver works awesome, putting this shaver to maximum pressure having to shave a complete head at once it shows how good this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning its very easy and fast, operating it its just like any other shaver and it takes about an hour to get fully charged. Battery life its awesome too, well the battery its brand new so lest see what happens with time and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complains about this product out of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salud</li>
            <li> Having had several different shavers of varying quality over the years, I was more than a little skeptical of the claims made for this Norelco 3D.  I find the Shaver to work excellently as promised.  I especially like the ability to take it in the shower where a little shave gel, or conditioner can help get the closest to blade shave from an electric I have ever experienced.  Have only owned for about a month so cannot comment on longevity</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this so far. It&#x27;s quiet, doesn&#x27;t make a mess, and shaves well. It&#x27;s not perfect on the neck but it&#x27;s the best of the shavers i&#x27;ve used. The pop out trimmer is useless in my mind.</li>
            <li> The razor was great for my beard, but Norelco changed the replacement head from RQ12 to RQ12+.  The design is different as is the quality of the shave.  The cleaning method requires you to take the entire head off, and you need to be careful so that the parts don&#x27;t fall out.  There are no more of the original RQ12 blades being made, and the only ones available are being sold at highway robbery prices.  I wound up just buying a new Norelco that is not as expensive as the 1250X/40.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to even use the new one yet.  If the new shaver doesn&#x27;t work out, I&#x27;ll probably switch to a Braun Series 7-790cc.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 3D razor gives a good save while not irritating skin much  the closeness doesn&#x27;t match my old activator but razor burn is minimal  compared to acitivators I guess I can get used to a late day shadow</li>
            <li> I am so very glad that I decided to upgrade to this razor.  It gives as close a shave as you can get with an electric and it does not give you the razor burn that some electrics will cause.  It can be used wet, dry or even with shaving cream.  All you have to do to clean it is run the heads under water to rinse it out.  It lasts about 2-3 weeks on a charge for regular usage.  Even when I go for a few days without shaving and have a beard forming it takes it right back off without any trouble.</li>
            <li> after a second check I found the coupon which will save you 30 dollars but the shaver has already been delivered. What should I do?</li>
            <li> I have been a norelco tripple header user for more than 30 years and this 1250x/40 3d shaver is the best i have.  I usually have to shave 2-3 times a day and it takes a bit of time...with this shaver, i get away with shaving only twice and in a fraction of the time.  I have usued it dry and with shaving gel, and what a nice fast close shave.  I also shave my head with it, and it is smoother than if I used a blade.  Great job Philips Norelco...you have a winner here and I will continue to purchase your products.</li>
            <li> It does a great job on whiskers, but cleaning it is a pain.  Each of the three rotary blades has to be pried open after each shave (two tiny indents on each side of the blades must be pressed in and the blades then opened) - not always the easiest thing to do at 6am. So yes, it shaves well, but I would never buy another one - who needs that much of a downside at that price.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black  the product camequikly and was exactly as described.  great price  extremely happy  have had shaving rash on my neck all my adult life... and it is beginning to go!  great product</li>
            <li> I stayed away from electric shavers for years after a terrible experience when I was younger- irritation, rashes, discomfort, etc. My new Norelco has given me nothig but close, comfortable shaves, wet or dry. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Owned sever Norelcos in the past, they were all good, but when the last one I had started to die, I thought, for some reason, to try out a Braun.  I picked the mid-range model, the 500.  Awful shave.  Took 3 times longer and did a worse job than any Norelco I&#x27;d owned.    So now it&#x27;s back to the Norelco line, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I haven&#x27;t had a shave this close and smooth since I used to shave with a razor back in the stone ages.  This shaver is very powerful, and quick -- took about 2.5 minutes to get a perfect shave, and that&#x27;s even around the edges of my beard.  The charging station and remaining power readout are outstanding.  The only downside is the included \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; isn&#x27;t the greatest, but I have a beard/trim razor for that functionality anyway, so that doesn&#x27;t affect me.    Would DEFINITELY recommend this razor to others.</li>
            <li> This unit stopped working after three months.  On calling Philips I was told that it was the base, however none was in stock and they could not tell me when they could ship it.      Called Amazon to complain - the person was very helpful in resolving the issue.</li>
            <li> I use it to shave me head only. Compared with razor blades, this shaver goes toe to toe with any blade. Leaves my scalp smooth, refreshed. Charges fast and lasts about a week with a full charge. Not bad!</li>
            <li> Good price compared to Australian Retail prices, great delivery time from amazon - only took a week for it to be delivered to Australia. Although, Amazon didnt assist in the price matching with another seller at the same time I bought this.. Not impressed  Now, I have a 4yr old cheap $70 Philips shaver with the same cutting outcome and all the hair stays inside the shaver head. With this 3d norelco shaver, the hair falls out and messes up your shirt and you need to clean the shaver every time you use it or even more hair falls out. Beyond ridiculous. I can only imagine what would happen if you add water to your shaving rotuine - a mix of water and hair on your shirt... nice.</li>
            <li> Very close shave. Cleans easy. charge lasts very long. Ate me up the first couple uses, but I think that was my fault for push to hard. Great buy.</li>
            <li> First let me say this shaver is pretty amazing. I have tried many electric shavers in the past and like most, have given up on them as they are either too rough on my face or they just don&#x27;t shave close enough or a combo of the two. This is a rugged, well made shaver. The quality of this shaver versus lesser cost units and brands is evident in every facet of it&#x27;s construction and operation. It works like a finely engineered machine. If you take shaving seriously, this is the shaver for you.    My only concern with this product is with the cost, it&#x27;s not cheap. I know reviews aren&#x27;t really supposed to be based on cost as prices change but you should do some math before considering this pricey shaver.     Lets say you use a high end razor with replaceable cartridges, pick one of the top of the line with 4-5 blades that really shaves super close.    The razor: $10-$15 and comes with 1 razor cartridge  Replaceable cartridges: they seem to cost from $3-$5 each, depending on where you buy them.  So, that means $15 for the razor and $50-$60 a year on cartridges assuming you use a new one each month. Less if you make the cartridges last longer than a month or find a good deal on them.     So, not only does this shaver cost a lot, it costs more than buying cartridges each year to use - they suggest you buy a $70 shaver head each year to replace the one built in. I dunno if that math works out frankly. I hope Phillips doesn&#x27;t send a hit squad out on me. Anyways....      Pros of the Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver:    Very close, smooth shave. The triple floating heads actually let you get anywhere you need to shave.  Easy clean up, pop the shaver heads &amp; rinse under water. I know, crazy!  Charges fast, lasts a long time. Cool digital readouts for charging status &amp; battery.  Can use it in the shower (or so it says, I am not brave enough to try!).  Can use dry or with shaving cream / gel.  Comes with a nice charging stand and a zip up travel case and a small brush.  Very handy for travel, no need to pack a razor and gel / cream.  Has a built in trimmer, very nice and easy to use.       Cons:    It&#x27;s a sealed unit &amp; rechargeable batteries have a life span. One day the battery will die and you will either send it in for a new one or toss it and buy a new shaver. Most batteries like this last 2-3 years tops before they stop holding a charge. That&#x27;s my experience.    The manual says to replace the shaving heads once a year which, I believe, cost about $70. So that means you are spending $70 a year to use this shaver at the optimum performance. I dunno about that math frankly. That&#x27;s more than just buying a year&#x27;s worth of top of the line razor cartridges each year.    Comes with the standard \\&quot;please give this shaver 21 days of usage to let your face get used to it...\\&quot; I am in the first week of that 21 days. Some irritation on my neck from the shaver. Hope it gets better.    To get a really close shave, which I like, this shaver doesn&#x27;t actually save me any time. Lathering up my face &amp; using a razor doesn&#x27;t really take any more or less time plus I still get a closer shave with a top of the line razor cartridge.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my husband. He loves it. He used to have another razor from Norelco similar to this one but a grade lower. The attachment shaver thingy will need to be attached and remove to use. After a while it becomes loose. He loves how this one you don&#x27;t need to remove the shaver part is attached on to the body. The upgrade is worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s for the past 25 years. I&#x27;ve had corded and battery-based units. What first stood out to me was how quiet the unit is. Much more quiet than the corded one that died after 7 years of use. And I love the close shave of these blades. Would definitely recommend. And I loved the price Amazon had.</li>
            <li> I used to just shave every few days.  I don&#x27;t have very thick hair growth, and I have always hated using an electric razor.  Up until recently, I hated electric razors because they were hard to clean.  In the last year, I&#x27;ve had the chance to use several electric razors and I&#x27;ve been surprised with how much they&#x27;ve improved in the last ten years.  Among the 7 or 8 razors I&#x27;ve tried out this year, the Norelco 1250 is by far the best for how close of a shave it gives me.  I had no razor irritation or burn from using the product, and it really glides smoothly over my face.  It handles curves and the soft skin of my neck very easily.  The best part about the razor though, is how easy it is to clean.  I just hold the blades under the water and it&#x27;s cleaned out in less than ten seconds.  I don&#x27;t have to mess with tiny brushes or cans of air to get all of the hair out of the nooks and crannies of it.</li>
            <li> This is my best Philips shaver ever. And Made in Holland!  I have owned &amp; used 6-7 Philips shavers over the past 50 years. I have only ever used electric shavers, never a blade, apart from the odd time when I&#x27;d left my trusty Philips at home.  Without exception they have all been reliable shavers, each newer one an improvement on the previous model.  My previous model a Coolskin, I thought could not be surpassed. I generally used it dry, only using the &#x27;wet&#x27; shave occasionally.   Now I&#x27;ve used the Norelco, the old one will be consigned to the shaver graveyard.  The Norelco is such an improvement the difference is truly amazing. A really close shave, and so quick &amp; quiet.  Full marks to the manufacturers for a real state-of-art shaver.  I am raving to all my mates.</li>
            <li> The product overall is okay, but the battery life is terrible. The company claims you can get 17 shaves on one charge. I only get 5 shaves before having to recharge. I have always used Norelco Shavers with good results,until now. My previous Norelco was an Arcitec, and I was very pleased with it, and planned to go on line and get another like it.I was getting two weeks of shaves on that unit before recharging. When I read about the 1250x/40, it sounded like an upgraded version of the Arcitec, so I thought I would try it. What a disappointment! Yes it is quieter, but I find it is harder to shave above my lip as it has no give, and the poor battery life makes it inconvenient. I would be happy to trade it for the top of the line Arcitec, which had a special price offer, when I bought this one.My mistake.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a more comfortable shave than the older models and it has very good battery life before it needs to be recharged.  It is also easy to clean.  You need to go slowly with it and I take two passes, the second one \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot;, to get a close shave.  I have been using this razor for a few months and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have a Braun 3 Series shaver that has the cleaning system. It cuts well and I was pretty much content with it. However as it started to get older, I knew I had to spend the money to buy a new foil and cutter. My brother had a Norelco and I tried it and liked it a lot. I decided on getting the Senso Touch 3d after seeing a $30 coupon on Amazon which made me choose it over the 2D.   What I like a lot about this shaver are the following. After having a noisy Braun shaver that shed all the hairs to the floor or bathroom sink, it was very refreshing to have a quieter shaver that held the hairs more effectively than the Braun. With less noise, vibration, and lighter, it offers a more enjoyable shave. Being able to rinse it in the sink was also welcome. The Braun cleaning system is very good but expensive. The liquid evaporates inside the cleaning unit as well even when you don&#x27;t use it. The Norelco power indicator is very nice, an it is comfortable to hold.  Cutting: I will be honest, no electric shaver cuts as close as a Merkur razor using a Art of Shaving quality badger brush and their wonderful cream. Don&#x27;t even bother with the cheap cream at the store that has alcohol in it. I also refuse to pay $160 and higher for a high end Braun shaver. I found the Norelco cuts very well. Like many have said, you don&#x27;t have to push hard to get a good shave. I really like this shaver and the way it cuts. It is not super close, but it is close enough for daily use.  I tried the Remington but the high speed of the motor caused more friction and made my face red. The slower motor of the Norelco does the job. This heads are also an upgrade to some of the older Norelco&#x27;s. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Initially it irritated my skin, but that passed in about a week.    Now it is so much smoother than my old razor and still - doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve accumulated quite a few electric razors over the years, with the three most recent being the new models from Norelco, Braun and Panasonic. So, thought I&#x27;d do a comparison to perhaps help those who are debating between these high-end models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first let&#x27;s get a basic question out of the way: do you have to spend this much to get a good shave from an electric shaver? Absolutely not. Lower-end models such as the Braun Series 5, the 7000 and 8000 Norelco series and the Panasonic ArcIV are great shavers. What you get for the extra money is a slight improvement in the shave, a bit better design, and a few somewhat useful bells and whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality - all are very nicely put together. The Braun feels the most substantial; the 3D feels the most \\&quot;plasticy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound - the 3D runs very quietly; the Braun and Panasonic are far more \\&quot;buzzy\\&quot; but not too loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall feel - for me, the Braun feels the most comfortable to hold. Easy to grip even if your hands are wet. The Panasonic is a close second. The 3D feels the most awkward. Not horrible, but not all that comfortable either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave: closeness - this is a tough call, with the Braun and the Panasonic both providing very close shaves. The 3D does a pretty good job, but my face does not feel as smooth as with the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave: speed - the 3D is the clear winner here. Just mows through my beard, with a total shave time of less than 3 min. The Panasonic takes about 4 min for a good shave; the Braun clocks in at about 5 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave: neck - this is the most difficult area for most shavers, and all of these models left a few errant hairs here and there. The 3D did the best but it comes at the expense of some irritation (see the next note). The Braun and Panasonic are about equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave: comfort - Braun is the winner for me, followed by the Panasonic. Zero redness even in the more sensitive spots (jaw line and neck). The 3D left me with some red spots on my neck. Nothing severe, but it is clearly a notch below the others on the comfort meter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shave - this is limited to just the Panasonic and the 3D. I&#x27;m not a big fan of wet shaving, but both of these do a very good job. The Panny works best with a very thin layer of gel-type cream; the 3D works best with a heavier lather (I got good results with Edge). Both provided close shaves, with the Panny a bit more gentle than the 3D. But, the 3D did a better job on the neck and jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update: Just tried the new Remington Alphagel shaving cream and that works very well with both the Panny and the Norelco. The scent is a bit heavy (menthol) but the no-foam consistency is a perfect match for a wet electric shave. Much better than any other shave cream I&#x27;ve tried. I reviewed the Alphagel if you want more info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maneuverabilit - this is where the Braun really shines for me. I have a mustache, and edging it with the Braun is a piece of cake. The 3D takes some practice, but it can do a decent job. Worst by far was the Panasonic - the huge head makes it very hard to create a clean edge around the &#x60;stash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Auto cleaning - I love the cleaning station from Braun. Works well, cleans well, and the razor comes out lemony-fresh. The Panasonic cleaning station is OK, but is louder, takes longer, and the water-based cleaning solution is not as effective. I can&#x27;t comment on the 3D station since the model I bought didn&#x27;t come with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manual cleaning - both the Panasonic and 3D are very easy to clean manually. They actually don&#x27;t need the auto cleaning station (although it is handy for storage for the Panny). The cutters are removable from the 3D (unlike the Arcitec models) for extra cleaning every so often. The Braun can be cleaned with water, but it&#x27;s hard to get it very clean since the cutter block is a single unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots more that I could say about these razors, but this review is already way too long. If I had to pick just one, I&#x27;d go with the Braun. While not perfect, it excels in several areas and feels the best. It also offers three settings (gentle, normal and intensive) that vary the speed of the cutters, a feature the other two lack. I find that very helpful. Plus, replacement heads are easily available and often discounted (as are the cleaning cartridges). But, the 3D and the Panasonic are also very good shavers and will get the job done. If you are willing to spend the money, any one of these would be a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, you have to learn how to use an electric razor properly to get a good shave. Some quick tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Don&#x27;t press hard - use an easy touch. If the heads are getting warm or hot, you&#x27;re pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;2) Shave against the grain when using a foil; shave in circular motions when using a rotary.&lt;br /&gt;3) Stretch your skin taut when shaving your neck&lt;br /&gt;4) Wait at least an hour after getting up before shaving (everyone&#x27;s face gets a bit puffy when sleeping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!ady way too long.

            <li> This is a great razor. Gives a close and comfortable shave. Easy to care for. This is the best Norelco razor I have had. And I have been using Norelco razors for about 20 years. I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he really likes the shave it gives.  It gives a very smooth shave. It&#x27;s comfortable to shave with over the chin and cheek bones.  (It feels good going over my bony knees, also)  The only bad thing about it is that it is so tall in the charger that it doesn&#x27;t fit well on any of our shelves.  It might help if the base had some weight in the bottom as it is easy to knock over.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted an electric razor in the worst way.  Razor shaving irritates him, and since he doesn&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, shaving was a chore.  He had never had an electric before but wanted to try one.  He had been enticed by the commercials for the Philips Arcitec, but since it was pricey, we didn&#x27;t buy it.  At Christmastime, I decided to check out reviews for the razors to find that Philips were a good buy.  I took a chance and decided on the Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d as it&#x27;s reviews were good, if not better than the Arcitec, and it was a better price.  He is very particular about what he wants, so I was naturally nervous that it was not the model he wanted.  He tried it out and from the first day he loved it! The only drawback I see is that it doesn&#x27;t have a travel charger.  It must charge on it&#x27;s cradle.</li>
            <li> Update as of May 29, 2011:  Well, it&#x27;s been almost 6 months, and still shaving bump (ingrown hairs) free.  Still a great shave.  Getting about 28-30 days per charge using the charging stand ONLY when the battery shows flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would still recommend without reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different electric razors over the years, from all of the major companies.  This is, by far, the best of the lot.  Let&#x27;s do some pros and cons, and then I&#x27;ll go into detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Shaves extremely close&lt;br /&gt;Quick charge&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;I get about 3 weeks per charge (shaving about 3-4 minutes daily)&lt;br /&gt;Reminder to clean&lt;br /&gt;Travel lock&lt;br /&gt;NO MORE SHAVING BUMPS (aka ingrown hairs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Feels a bit odd in my hand at first (I have big hands)&lt;br /&gt;No corded shaving, must use charger stand&lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads a bit pricey, but I know where to look to find them cheaper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, let&#x27;s talk about this.  The shaves I&#x27;m getting are extremely close, and seem to be safety razor comparable.  I have a heavy beard, and I have smooth skin well past 8 PM after an early morning shave, and that ain&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging is very quick, but you must use the charger stand, no corded shaving capabilities with this.  I don&#x27;t leave the charger plugged in, I believe constant charging reduces battery life, at least in my experience.  I&#x27;ve gotten 6-8 years from previous Norelco shavers using this technique as opposed to constant charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is very simple.  First you get a little reminder light (looks like a water faucet) every other shave to remind you to clean it.  Just pop up all three heads, run it under water, and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a travel lock, which is basically an extended push of the power button.  This locks the shaver so you don&#x27;t run the risk of having a dead battery on arrival.  Been there and ended up shaving with my wife&#x27;s razor due to not bringing the charging cord (this on a different razor than the 1250X).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffered from shaving bumps, also known as ingrown hairs.  My beard tends to be curly, and the hairs would curve under and cause bumps growing under the skin laterally.  I don&#x27;t know why but this has stopped completely with the 1250X.  Very happy with that outcome even though I hadn&#x27;t expected it.  A very nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does feel a little strange in my hand.  Not bad, just different.  I have large hands, and this is probably the reason.  But I can maneuver the razor all over my face with no problem.  I guess this is more a personal observation than a complaint, but I present it for your review and information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must use the charger stand in order to charge the razor.  No way to just pack the razor and cord and not worry about charging.  But this is a very minor quibble, and not one worth taking a star off for.  As I said, I don&#x27;t leave the charger stand plugged in, I believe that reduces the battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement heads are expensive, but if you look around you can find them for less.  Try a warehouse club for example.  As far as the heads themselves, I believe there is a reminder light that comes on after a year to remind you to change the heads.  Not close to that time period, so no way to tell you if that works.  In my experience though I don&#x27;t wait for recommended times.  If the razor feels \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; I replace the heads.  Better shaving that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I recommend this razor without reservation.

            <li> This Product is wonderfull in what it means packaging, materials, and shape, but my boyfried isn&#x60;t so thrilled about the way it shaves... leaves a lot of uncut hairs, and makes big scars. It&#x60;s true, even in the usage manual sayes that the first shaves will be rough... i hope that his face will accomodate with the shaver and will be ok. A+ for shipping and packaging</li>
            <li> I have been using an old Norelco \\&quot;Advantage\\&quot; razor for over 6 years and decided to upgrade to the 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d. Technology has come a long way! This razor is lightweight, fits nice in your hand and is so much quieter than the old one. The shave is much closer too. This is the best razor I have ever used and I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When my husband finally decided what he wanted for Christmas a week before, Beach Camera in NJ did a great job of getting this razor to me in time. His old Norelco no longer held a charge. He loves the wide shave area on this one; got used to it in a week and has thanked me several times. He hasn&#x27;t tried it wet yet, although it can be used in a shower. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 with very sensitive skin. I recently bought two different manual razors, one that even had an adjustment for the double edge blade. Both cut my face because my skin is so sensitive or thin. A single blade disposable razor cut my face much less than the two much more expensive double edge blade ones. On to Philips Norelco 1250x. Many years ago I used a Norelco rotary razor. It was okay, but the cleaning was a chore. After reading more reviews on the new electric Norelco rotary shavers I decided to purchase the Philips Norelco triple head 1250x. I am so glad I did.     Here&#x27;s how I use it. 1st) Run very warm water from the showhead unto my facial hair for a minute or so. 2nd) Lather a shaving cream like Proraso shaving cream unto my facial hair. 3rd) Pull the one piece triplehead unit off the charged up Norelco shaver and hold the triplehead unit under very warm running water from the showerhead for a couple seconds. 4th) Line it up correctly and push the one piece triplehead unit unto the charged up Norelco 1250x shaver. 5th) Quickly and easily shave all my facial hair off. When I&#x27;m done both my facial hair and thin layer of shaving cream are gone from my face. 6th) I pull the one piece triplehead unit off the charged up Norelco shaver and pull each rotary head from the center up and outward to open up the lid on each rotary head. The blades are secure and don&#x27;t seem to be in danger of falling out. 7th) I then run the opened up triplehead unit under the running very warm water from the showerhead to throughly clean out the cut hair and shaving cream holder as well as the rotary razors. 8th) I place the now cleaned onened up triplehead unit upside down on a thick cloth to dry and I place the hand helded unit in the charger to charge up again.     Pros: My fastest and closest shave ever. I&#x27;ve never cut myself with this shaver. It even shaves right under my nose. It misses nothing. My face feels great afterwards.    Cons: For a wet shave like I do - none.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver while it worked.  As of this morning, it will no longer turn on and the battery charging indicator doesn&#x27;t light up when placed in the base.  It lasted about 11 months.</li>
            <li> This razor provides a nice smooth shave that lasts for days.  It cleans up in little to no time.  I can truly say that this is the best razor that I have ever owned and I would recommend it anyone.</li>
            <li> i was pretty impressed with the product. gives a really close shave and its really fast too! i would definitely recommend this if you don&#x27;t like wasting a lot of time on shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally in a rush every morning, so this razor has been wonderful.  Good, close, and consistent shave in little time.  I love it and would definitely recommend it.  I was worried with oily skin that this may cause problems, but it&#x27;s been much gentler overall than my straight razor was.  I&#x27;ve converted and may never go back.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He says he loves it.  It has good battery life and gives a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the Philips Sensotouch, and it is the best electric razor I have ever owned.  I previously used a Philips Norelco 7 series, but the blades didn&#x27;t flex to my satisfaction.  I always had razor burn when I shaved my neck.  Now, with the Gyroflex 3D, I am completely burn free.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin or troubles with other electric razors.  It may be expensive, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I bougth this from Amazon. Excellent razor for the price. Didnt need all the other fancy stuff, that the other Sensotouch 3d have. When i bought my razor, I got a killer deal from amazon, that featured $30usd off...so the razor only ran me around $130usd. Great razor, easy to clean, keeps a chnage up well. I shave everyday, and usually have to recharge it once every 3 weeks...so not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my 1250X for about 2 months, and I&#x27;m delighted with it. It gives a really close shave, glides well on the skin, and flexes to cover curves on chin and jaw. It&#x27;s so quiet that it seems strange at first.   A battery charge lasts a little under a month for me.  My only squalk is that the charging stand is too big to take travelling, and they could have easily designed it to let the \\&quot;charging collar\\&quot; detach from the base.   An of course, it&#x27;s very expensive. I justified it by telling myself that  something I&#x27;d use every day for several years is worth an extra $50-$75.   The instruction manual is entertaining. They recommend obsessive cleaning that is totally unnecessary, and suggest cleaning the head under hot water, and sternly warn against getting hurt from the hot water. Apparently men old enough to shave still need to be reminded about this. Sounds like lawyers.  I find it to be a quality device that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone willing to pay the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best electric shaver I have ever owned.  I&#x27;ve owned everything from Braun to Remington over the last four decades and none of them compare to my Norelco Senso Touch. It provides a great shave and is so easy to clean.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco is awesome! Before this, I owned a Philips Norelco Smart Touch XL that lasted over 6 years! If this one lasts half that time I&#x27;ll be satisfied. As for the performance it FAR exceeds the Smart Touch XL. I thought my old razor was good and then I found a newer version. Personally I get a shave that is as good as a blade when I use shaving cream with it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it outworks my old razor. The 3d heads are great. As far as the different versions of the Sensotouch 3d, I decided to go with the cheapest version. If you look on the chart at the bottom of product pages, the only difference between the most expensive version all the way down to the cheapest one is VERY minor difference. And these differences won&#x27;t affect the quality of the shave one bit. Like the most expensive one has a zinc finish and a \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; travel bag. Some of them have personal cleaning systems that you don&#x27;t really need. Just make sure you open each head individually after each shave and wash them with hot water. This is what I did with my previous shaver and it lasted a long while. Actually it still works, I just wanted to try a newer version to see if I was missing out on anything and I am glad I decided to try these out. Great razor, great price. Not too big either, it easily shaves every place on my face. The only downside is the pop up razor. Maybe I&#x27;m just used to the pop up on my Smart Touch XL but I was a little disappointed with this one. When you use it, it seems like the 3d rotary heads get in the way when using the pop up shaver. Only a minor mistake and I can always use the one on my Smart Touch but beware this is a big factor in purchasing a razor.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and I shave my head as well... WOW!!! What a great machine... I shave in a fraction of the time it took my old one and this one is very very VERY comfortable.  I love it!! I know it costs more, but it&#x27;s so SO worth it!!</li>
            <li> I received a sensor touch razor as a gift and loved it. After a year I needed to replace the whole head. Blades were not available and the head was discontinued. It was going to cost close to $100. Philips would not do anything and wouldn&#x27;t even put my review on line. I don&#x27;t trust Philips or any company that won&#x27;t allow a negative review.</li>
            <li> Buy him this shaver.  Glee in the fact that his morning shaving time will triple.  Laugh as you imagine him going over and over and over the same spot trying but failing to cut those whiskers.  Delight in the thought of his face turning red with rash.  Imagine how many people will greet him today with a horrified look and ask, \\&quot;what happened to your face?\\&quot;  Yes, if you really want to piss him off, buy him this shaver.</li>
            <li> It is a fairly high quality shaver that gives me a good shave. I use it dry, but like that I can rinse it out after each use. I do not like the tiny little sideburn trimmer as it is too small to do any grooming. All it can do is nibble at the hairs at the bottom of your sideburns. I also do not like that you must put it in the stand to charge it, as I would prefer not to have to have to pack the stand when I travel. Knowing what I know now I would not buy this razor again, that said I&#x27;m not going to throw it out either.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for more than 6 months now, I found that quality of the shave is not as good the Speed XL shaver I had used over the previous 5 years or so.</li>
            <li> I finally relented and gave an electric shaver a try.  Norelco seemed like a good brand so I bought the 1250X.  Nice visual aesthetic but the floating heads always missed the area under my jaw line and in order to get my sideburns I would have to constantly rotate the shaver to get all the hair since the individual shaver heads are relatively small.  Also, it looked like I had a cat scratch my neck everytime I shaved.  Even after a few weeks it still irritated my skin immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like it but I it just wasn&#x27;t a good machine for me.</li>
            <li> Several weeks ago my old Norelco went the way of all gadgets. After researching Norelco&#x27;s new offerings, I decided on the 1250X. It was the right decision. The shaver is lighter, easier to use, shaves very closely and is easier to clean than was my older model. The trimmer is excellent as well. This new model is outstanding in performance and value and is highly recommended by this user.</li>
            <li> The shaver is very quiet and gives a quick clean shave. It is very easy to clean.  I wish that it was priced a little cheaper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for years, and this is a nice one. The heads really pivot to make it fit the contours of your face, just like they say. It&#x27;s really nice to be able to rinse it out after using. Two small drawbacks. First is that you can&#x27;t just plug the cord in to recharge it....you have to use the hokey stand that it comes in. That means it has to sit on the counter, a little in the way.  Second thing is the trimmer...instead of popping out like in the past, it&#x27;s just on the back side, which makes it a little awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;But hey, still a good product. I don&#x27;t regret buying it at all.</li>
            <li> I also have a Braun 8985 Foil electric shaver and wanted to try this rotary type of shaver, especially as a wet electric shaver.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the shaves the 1250x/40 gives me using shave cream.  It is now my primary shaver.  I use the dry Braun to clean up around my sideburns and ears, and any few rough places left over from my 1250 shave.  It is the quietest electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s even quieter than my Dad&#x27;s old Sunbeam that he used many years ago.  Clean up is a breeze.  Rinsing it during shaving, and then raising the three heads and rinsing them, completely cleans the whole shaver.  Recharging is very simple and easy using the stand and cord.  I&#x27;ve had this shaver over a month now and it easily rates the 5 stars I indicated above.  I&#x27;m looking forward to many smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> I shave my head and face every day and really like this shaver. Had a Braum before but this works much better for me.  I highly recommend this shaver.    [...]</li>
            <li> This gives a clean shave all over my face and neck, and the trimmer really works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift. It arrived a day early in perfect condition. It has been used daily since Christmas and all reports from the gift&#x27;s receiver are \\&quot;it give a great shave\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the 1150x for myself and wanted to buy the same for my Father for Christmas. I ordered it and shipped it to his house but when I checked my account, they shipped it to my address instead. Too close to Christmas for a return - Amazon shipped this instead (as the 1150x was out of stock). My Father received it and has had nothing but good things to say. He is extremely picky and has very stubborn hair. He said, he has charged it twice since Christmas and uses it daily. He hair is multi-directional and very thick (as is mine). He is very satisfied with this and says anyone who is on the fence should get it.</li>
            <li> This Shaver Provides a superior shave- I recomend it.&lt;br /&gt;A single anoying issue is the cleaning- all Philips shavers you flip open all 3 heads at once and the cleaning is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this shaver, each head must be opened separatly and cleaned without completly removing rhe micro screen.&lt;br /&gt;It is time consuming in the morning when you are rushing to get to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it has the the 3 heads (separated) moving independely to all directions to provide a close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping that it would be an improvement on my cheaper Braun electric razor that I bought many years ago. Unfortunately this shaver wasn&#x27;t an improvement. It gives a relatively close shave, but it irritates my skin and misses spots. In my opinion a manual razor does a better job. This was my last attempt to switch to an electric razor. I was trying to make the switch because I liked the idea of being able to shave on the way to work, but this razor doesn&#x27;t do an adequate job.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever owned or used. I have not tried it while using shaving cream or wet shave. But dry shaving I never had a closer shave with any other electric razors. I would recomend this razor to anyone. The price outstanding, I looked at several stores in my area and they all wanted 200 dollars or more. The trimmer is a little small and sits back a little to far. But I can deal with that.</li>
            <li> This item works fine as a shaver.  It is better than a prior Philips rotary shaver that I owned.  However I feel  that it is not worth the price of 3-4 shavers to get this shaver.  What is really upsetting is the policy of Philips Norelco to not grant you the rebate that you are entitled to at the time of purchase.  Amazon provided a $30 rebate form at the time of purchase that was directly from Philips Norelco.  Though I sent in all to the documentation, Philips Norelco denied my rebate stating that I already got a rebate at the time of purchase.  However I never had a manufacturer&#x27;s rebate at the time of purchase!!  I have no recourse now.  Amazon handled the transaction just fine, it&#x27;s Philips Norelco that is at fault.  Beware of any holiday or other rebates from Philips Norelco as they will not honor it and not give you a means to appeal.  I&#x27;m not the only person.  A blog that I checked out recently had about 500 people who complained about the exact same thing!!!  I would rate the razer about 3.5 stars for effectiveness on an absolute scale, I would rate it 1.0 stars as value for the money, and I would rate Philips Norelco at 0 stars for its lack of ethics and refusal to honor its legal and fiduciary responsibilities.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best shavers I have ever had. Originally, I had a Phillips Norelco 7130 shaver which has 3 heads but all connected on one platform unlike this one. One of my main complaints with this shaver is the fact that if your hair is longer than a millimeter, you will get pulled hairs all over the place. OUCH! Lots of CRIES for HELP!!! That is no fun. Also, the shaver works in wet situations, but you really need lotion to ensure your skin does not get totally dry. With this new SensoTouch shaver, your problems are solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration on my original Norelco was like holding a jet engine. I could feel the vibration in my teeth as I shaved, and it was not a pleasant experience. I also had to rub over my skin numerous times to get the shaver to pick up all of my hair, and even then I usually ended up using a manual blade to trim any close excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare that to this shaver - The shave is fast. You will not have much extra hairs on your neck after you use this shaver. It seems to glide smoothly over my skin and cuts very close. It works great when going against the grain. It is great on the chin where you will have difficulty with a flat head. All of my family members love touching my face with this shaver - before, my wife would complain that my face would be scratchy unless I used a razor to manually shave close to my skin - now she cant really tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s some fancy technology built into the device that is really for marketing purposes. The 3 heads move independently and while they are very \\&quot;cool\\&quot; - I find that they do not really make a huge difference in the shave on the side of the face.  The whole head moves around which is good for your wrist but again is more of a \\&quot;gimmick\\&quot; than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are not talking about newfangled technology that CREATES A SCANTILY CLAD WOMAN TO REMOVE YOUR HAIR, instead it&#x27;s just some heads that flex to accommodate your face. It has a good heft in your hands and will feel comfortable when you are shaving your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fantastic thing about this razor is that it has a voltage function that allows you to convert from 110 to 240 volts AC which is perfect for international travels. I know some of the other reviewers have commented on the issue with international travel, but I can say this works perfectly abroad as I have used it in other countries. This works perfectly in England, for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge is great - give it one hour from a dead charge and you&#x27;re good to go. It will charge while you leave it for the next day so you are always at a full charge when you pick it up. There&#x27;s a battery indicator which I find to be VERY HELPFUL on my shavers - I do not like to go a few days without charging then have to worry about whether I need to charge this up or not. Regardless, this guy lasts at least 17 days depending on usage (obviously the actual ability is more like an hour nonstop) so you could take it on a vacation and not even need a charger with you! (I don&#x27;t recommend that... sometimes it&#x27;s a good idea to throw caution to the wind - this is not one of those times. Pack the charger.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are very clear. Norelco also tells you to wait a few weeks to let your body get used to it, but I found that my face reacted positively within a few days. YAY NORELCO!  It runs well with water - I was able to use it in the shower and was able to grip the razor without qualms. I found that on previous shavers, it might slip around in my hand on the smooth surfaces. No issue with that one here. Comes with a pouch for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a picky shaver and enjoy shaving with shaving cream, you can even use that here, as the shaver has special stops to prevent shaving cream from destroying the system as it will with other shavers. GO NORELCO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared this guy to my manual razor - Gillette Fusion - which requires that I shave again every few days. I often cut myself at least once or twice while shaving with the fusion, and it is time consuming to pre-lotion, lather, apply evenly, shave off, put on a bandaid, etc etc. The electric shave rolls the skin up and forces the hairs into the blade, which then slices it off nicely without any pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative is that you have to hand-clean each head which is easy to do only sometimes (if it cooperates). This requires opening up each section and cleaning it which, if you are in a rush, feels laborious and time consuming. This is in marked contrast to my original Phillips which was one single head that popped open and allowed me to easily rinse it out. BOOM. Done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a fast operator in the morning, then to make up for this, consider buying this shaver with the Jet Clean system as well, which will set you back an extra $50 plus the cost of the jet clean solution (there are two options for this but I&#x27;m referring to the cheaper one). Consider this option if you do not want to have to clean the shaver manually and you want the ease and comfort of just popping it in the cleaner and only needing to replace the solution every so often. The Jet system will also lubricate and charge the shaver as well, so it&#x27;s a good buy if you can keep it in one place - traveling with it might be a greater burden. That option is found here: [[ASIN:B003V37Z9W Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note-this IS an expensive shaver. Compare it to a shaver that costs $75 or $90 dollars, and you&#x27;re still spending $60 more on a shaver. If you save yourself just 2-3 minutes a day by using this shaver, and you shave every 3 days, that&#x27;s about 6 hours a year. At a very conservative rate of $10 an hour, you&#x27;ve saved yourself the money after one year of usage. That really adds up over the lifetime of this shaver!!! If you save yourself money, time, effort, and convenience on this shaver, then it&#x27;s really a solid investment. WARREN BUFFET WOULD AGREE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful, please consider a positive vote. I am happy to provide answers about the shaver and my experience, so feel free to ask any questions you may have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been overly happy with the cheaper Philips products in the past and had changed to a microfoil shaver which I had been using for the past 12 months. However, it removed my skin as well as hairs when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to &#x27;take the plunge&#x27; and invest in the Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d.&lt;br /&gt;WOW; from the very first shave I was rapt. It is exceptionally smooth on my skin and produces a shave as close as the micro foil did but without removing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also remarkably quiet and the battery life is long.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent shaver since I removed my beard 7 years ago and I&#x27;ve finally found it.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric shaver. I&#x27;ve used Norelco products for a lot of years now, (my last one used the \\&quot;goo\\&quot; cartridges) but this one is by far the best. It is super quiet and the battery life is amazing. Clean-up is simple and quick. Yes you have to open each head individually, but you don&#x27;t have to take the head apart to clean it; just hold it under the faucet and let the water wash it clean.  I&#x27;ve used this shaver both wet and dry and I actually prefer dry. My beard is somewhat coarse and this shaver just works best for me this way. I charged it when I first got it and then used it every day for almost a month before I had to charge it again. Once the battery indicator turned red, I was still able to use it another four days. When the battery drains far enough the shaver just turns off and has to be charged again.   I do miss the \\&quot;goo\\&quot; but by far, this is the best Norelco I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user of electric shavers and I&#x27;m happy so far,  I&#x27;m balding and go through razors, so looked for alternative way of shaving ( head and face). It doesn&#x27;t take any longer and I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself ,bonus...I have never shaved dry before now I do, if I want. Battery  life is great as well,charge quick and the display is clear. Overall I can&#x27;t fault it, the father in law just brought one so it can&#x27;t be all that bad. Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Worked very well until all of a sudden one day the unit failed to charge or turn on. That happened well before I had to change the shave heads. I went back to disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Shaves great, easy to hold, easy to clean and has a pretty good charge time.  After a couple days of shaving to get my face acclimated to the shaver, I was very happy with how smooth my face was.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for decades. I did not replace them whenever a \\&quot;new and advanced\\&quot; model appeared, but when I did, the improvements seemed to be minimal. I gave it one more try with the 3d model which impressed me immediately with the greatly reduced noise and the more effortless shaving. For now I even derive some pleasure from this morning ritual.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product if you dont have time to shave using water and razor. I am always on the run and use this product almost everyday. It is important to shave regularly, cuz if you miss a couple of days, you will get an incomplete shave the next time you use this.</li>
            <li> I loved this razor. It was the most I&#x27;ve ever spent on an electric razor. I hoped the expense was worth it to get a smooth, painless shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a sensitive face, and the dry electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned before, burned my face. They were comparatively cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first Norelco I owned was a cheaper model that squirted lotion. It was very smooth with the lotion. There was no razor burn. Without the lotion, it burned. After a few years, it was hard to find the lotion packets, and eventually became too expensive to buy the lotion packs. So, I went shopping for a new razor without lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gave a great shave without lotion. I didn&#x27;t know that was possible – a dry shave as smooth as you can get without the razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the heads annually a couple years. The original replacement head was the RQ12. The last set I bought cost $48.36. The current price for the RQ12 is $229.99. You can buy the entire razor for less than the replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new, affordable replacement head, the RQ12+, has bad reviews and costs over $50. I refuse to accept the inferior performance of the new head. That&#x27;s not the performance level I expected when I bought this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; twice by Norelco on accessories, so I&#x27;m abandoning Norelco as well. I bought a Braun instead. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I was in love with this shaver for 6 weeks. Quiet, close shave, it did not irritate my sensitive skin. The affair is over now... it no longer charges the razor. In my love blindness, I overcame a poorly designed charger and a trimmer with the sophistication and sound of a Weed Whacker. (I had to use my old Braun shaver because of its superior trimmer). This was my best affair in shaving ever, but we won&#x27;t be getting back together... it&#x27;s a trust issue.</li>
            <li> Some models even tell you when to rinse it out! Along with the battery meter and head replacement lights are great.&lt;br /&gt;The heads look and feel great, the only thing that concerned me was the heads were very easy to push inwards. I felt as if it would not be able to push enough to cut the hairs.. It does, It just takes longer. I have only used it a few times so it should get better, but for now I feel I have to press harder and take longer. Absolutely no irritation or redness. When I&#x27;m done it is a very low shave, way better than any other electric razors I&#x27;ve had before. Even comparable to a razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you can get a better razor around this price range, Try it!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  I have never been impressed with electric shavers in the past, but I&#x27;m tired of bleeding every time I shave with a normal multi-blade razor.  My fiancée convinced me to give it a shot and I went for a much more expensive shaver than I have ever tried before, it was worth it.  The shave is very close and feels great.  I highly recommend this shaver.    ----Update----  This was a great shaver until the replacement heads became outrageously expensive (for the original model) and then replaced with a new model (that isn&#x27;t as good as the original and more expensive).  I just bought a new razor, the Braun 790, hopefully that works out better in the long run.</li>
            <li> I stick with Norelco shavers for about 15 years. This is the most efficient shaver that I&#x27;ve owned. One odd thing is the cleaning - you have to open 3 compartments individually. I still didn&#x27;t get used to it. Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently from Amazon for the right price after doing a bit of research.More importantly it has been a breeze to use,it&#x27;s well made and cleans easily and quickly under hot running water.The compact charging stand keeps the shaver virtually full charged 24/7 even after a 10 minute shave.I am getting a shave much closer than anything I have owned before and that includes Philishave and Braun.The pop-up trimmer works fine and the unit itself is very easy to hold while in operation.For the money I was prepared to spend I don&#x27;t think I could have done better.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Norelco I have purchased. Highly recommend, nice cleean shave. Very easy to clean. The charge lasts longer than any previous razors I have used.</li>
            <li> As a person who has been using a blade for more than 20 years I was not able to shave well with this razor.  With some effort it will cut down my beard to a somewhat close level but I needed to apply balm after to combat the irritation it caused.  My son had much better results.  He regularly uses an earlier version of this product and was satisfied with the shave he got from it.  One thing we both noted was that the charger does not securely hold the razor so it can be easily knocked off its base.     The pivoting head on the razor is the best thing about the razor and is a lot better than my son&#x27;s earlier version.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my father-in-law.  After one month it stopped working.  But it didn&#x27;t just stop working. When I looked closely at the shaver i saw a very poorly constructed device.  How so? I flipped up the shaving heads and turned the shaver on.  The drivers were spinning strongly, but there was no contact between the heads and the drivers when the heads were snapped back into place. And because there was no contact with even one of the heads there was no spinning just the buzz of the drivers underneath going like crazy.  The device did not feel like a precision instrument- and at its price, it should.  It felt cheap, and its 1-month performance demonstrated to me that today&#x27;s Norelco is not the Norelco of old.</li>
            <li> just avery good razor</li>
            <li> This razor does the job very well. When using the dry shave setting (if you are in a rush) it obviously will cause a little skin discomfort, but the wet and shaving cream options make for a great and smooth shave. Like any new razor it takes a few tries to figure out problem areas, but once you get that down it works great. For the price breakdown of disposable or other traditional razors (with new heads) the Norelco is a great investment--needless to say I will never be using a traditional razor again.</li>
            <li> Very good shave! However, it takes some getting used to holding it as compared to previous Norelco units and cleaning it is not as easy as in the older models.You have to open each head independently for cleaning as opposed to older ones that the entire assembly popped open at the at the same time.</li>
            <li> My worst fear about getting an(other) Electric Razor was the inability of being able to achieve results around my neck and jawline. I am ecstatic to state that this razor did an awesome job. My razor previous to this was a Braun 8585 which I stopped using about 3 years ago because it never seemed to work around the neckline/jaw area. I have been using Gillette razors since I started shaving 18 years back, outside of the short periods of time I have given electric razors a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that it can take time (2-4 weeks) for an Electric Razor to start showing good results and I was expecting a crappy first shave. However, I was amazed that not only did I get a really close shave but the irritation to my skin was minimal around the neck/jawline area. While shaving with standard razors I do not shave against the grain because it irritates my skin. I normally shave with the grain (up to down) and then shave sideways (left to right). What I was hoping for is to get a similar result while dry shaving with the 1250x and I can state that it did for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that is a little disappointing is that the jet-clean is not standard for a razor that is close to $200. That being said, as cleaning the razor manually was fairly straightforward I still give the razor 5/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Really close dry shave. My dry shave with the 1250x was as close as a wet shave with my Gillette Pro Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;- For an expensive razor it should have a standard jet cleaning system.</li>
            <li> My personal experience:    i have had it for a week. It is the best, lightest and quietest electric shaver that I have used.(I have owned about 8 Norelcos in the last 30 years.) it is superior to the Braun 7 which is heavier and slower.    The shaver&#x27;s ability to contour to one&#x27;s skin is no gimmick but adds to its functionality.</li>
            <li> My old double edge razor did a better job than this thing.  My three words of advice -- buy a Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 35 years. I&#x27;ve used every major brand made.  Phillips/Norelco has finally gotten it right with the 1250X40 SensoTouch 3D shaving system. I&#x27;m very impressed with this shaver (And I&#x27;m not impressed very easily).  In the past I&#x27;ve bought the top line shaver from the three major shaver manufacturers (Braun, Panasonic, Phillips/Norelco) &amp; tried them out side by side. I&#x27;ve always felt the linear foil screen shavers made by Braun &amp; Panasonic gave a closer shave, that is until now. This SensoTouch 3D shaving system gives just as close a shave as the linear foil screen shavers by Braun &amp; Panasonic. The Phillips/Norelco shavers have always been less irritating to the skin than the foil screen shavers.  So if you have sensitive skin that is easily irritated by shaving, you will appreciate any of the Phillips/Norelco shavers.  This shaver has a quick 1 hour to full charge feature. If you let the battery run down, a 3-5 minute charge will get you a full shave. You must use the charger stand to charge the shaver. This is a bit of a negative for the shaver. I sometimes travel for two weeks at a time, and so will have to carry the bulky charger stand in my shaver bag. (My last Braun shaver had a cord that could plug into the charger stand or directly into the shaver. The cord was small &amp; easily fit in my travel shaver bag. Phillips/Norelco should provide this feature on a shaver this expensive).  There is an LED indicator in the handle that indicates battery charge level when the shaver is turned on.  This shaver is very light weight, easy to grip &amp; feels good in your hand. When I first turned it on, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working properly, so I turned it off &amp; back on again. I finally held it next to my ear &amp; could hear that it was running. This shaver is unbelievably quiet! For my first shave I wanted to give the shaver a real workout &amp; so I let my beard grow for a full two and a half days. It cut through my beard with little effort. One nice feature I have noticed about the Phillips/Norelco shavers is that none of them have ever grabbed or pulled the hair on my face. This will sometimes occur with some shavers if your beard has grown for a few days. It took a little longer to cut my two day beard than my old Braun shaver which has the loud but very fast cutting linear motor. However, I got a very close comfortable shave.  The SensoTouch 3D shaving system excels at shaving your neck &amp; jaw line. This is the biggest challenge for any electric shaver. With the Panasonic &amp; Braun shavers, I frequently had to go over &amp; over these areas to get those stubborn long hairs. The SensoTouch 3D shaving system easily removes the long hairs due to the way the heads conform to your neck &amp; jaw line. This is a major benefit for the 1250X40. The high speed linear motors of the Braun &amp; Panasonic shavers will plow through a thick heavy beard faster than the Phillips/Norelco shavers. However, your overall shave time will be about the same since the SensoTouch 3D shaving system will shave your neck &amp; jaw line without repeated strokes.  The SensoTouch 3D shaving system&#x27;s independent floating heads also makes it easier to shave the area between your mustache &amp; nose. This was a real negative on previous versions of Phillips/Norelco shavers. It is now much easier &amp; with a little practice I&#x27;m able to shave right up to my side burns &amp; mustache without that dreaded \\&quot;ooops\\&quot;.  This shaver is extremely easy to clean. Simply flip up the heads &amp; run warm water over them &amp; they come completely clean. Another nice feature that your wife will love, is that the stubble stays inside the heads. No more dirty sink or countertop.  This shaver can be used wet or dry. Which is best? Although I haven&#x27;t tried this shaver wet, my past experience has always been that a dry shave is closer &amp; more comfortable with an electric shaver. Always wash your face with soap &amp; water &amp; dry completely before shaving. This will give the closest &amp; most comfortable shave.  Will the 1250X40 shave as close as a safety blade razor? No. No electric shaver is able to cut the hair below the skin like a blade razor. However any of the top line shavers made by Panasonic, Braun or Phillips/Norelco will come very close. (Blade razor shave &#x3D; 10,  Phillips/Norelco 1250X40 &#x3D; 9.5)  The Phillips/Norelco 1250X40 is a quick and easy shave system. It will give you a close smooth shave. If shaving ever irritates your skin you&#x27;re going to love this shaver. It is the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  BTW. Every electric shaver manufacturer says to try their shaver for at least 30 days. Your face will have time to adjust to the new shaver. True or False? At first I thought this was just another empty sales pitch. However after many years &amp; many different shavers I find this to be true. I&#x27;m not sure if it is due to the fact of your face adjusting to the shaver or the fact that you gain experience in using that particular shaver. But the quality of your shave will improve over time using a new shaver. So don&#x27;t throw in the towel for at least 30 days.</li>
            <li> I like this! Very useful!&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day. And this stuff make me comfortable life.&lt;br /&gt;I think I bought this one cheapest&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Been using Norelco&#x27;s since I first began shaving.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 7 months and I like it.  Not sure if I buy that 3D is best hype but it does shave better in less time then my old Smart Touch XL razor.    I do dislike the charging cradle though.  It&#x27;s bulky and lightweight and uses suction cups to stabilize itself.  And it&#x27;s a requirement to use the cradle instead of attaching the cable directly to the shaver.  The two times or so a month I need to use it&#x27;s not worth the keep it on display all the time.  It adds considerable bulk to my charger drawer.    Another thing I hate is the hair collection chambers.  A light tap with a finger is enough to send finely chopped hair all over your pants when I am not shaving under a sink - which is often.  It gets tolerable over time.  At first it was difficult for me to clean, but I gotten good at it: with hot water run over the blades while the chambers are closed most of your hair should get pushed out.  Then open the chambers and run the hot water under the blades and all over the chamber floor.  Make sure it irrigates well while drying out.</li>
            <li> I bought that for my boyfriend. i think it is really worth it. i saw so many review about that. Every usersaid that it is good and work well. As well as it has good design!!! After that i decided to buy it. it will be great christmas gift. my boyfriend might love that!!! :)</li>
            <li> First, I highly recommend buying through Amazon.  The merchants who use Amazon to sell their products will give you exceptional service.  Amazon demands the highest quality service be given to customers who buy via the Amazon site and merchants will go the distance to insure customers are happy.  Products are often shipped without shipping charges and products can arrive in 2 or 3 days.  Amazon is the best retailer on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Braun electrical shaver for years, a good and reliable shaver.  However, the Norelco GyroFlex 3D Shaver is a better shaver.  The Norelco is quiet and shaves closer in less time.  The Norelco shaver can shave a wet, lathered beard almost as close as a safety razor blade.  However, wet-lathered shaving requires light pressure and fewer passes to achieve a close shave. The Braun shaver was uncomfortable when shaving my head, the Norelco is so comfortable and quick.  If you want the best electric shaver, buy a Norelco.  Finally, Norelco gave me 6 additional months warranty for registering on their internet site, extending the warranty to 21/2 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an older style Norelco for 5 years and after replacing the blades several times, decided I would give this a try.  After two weeks, I still haven&#x27;t decided how much I like this.  I have medium growth and the shave is definitely closer than my last Norelco and somewhat smoother.  Yet, the motor is less powerful and so it takes longer to shave.      The worst problem, other than the fact there is no cord which several other reviewers have noted, is that the pop up shaver is virtually worthless.  I&#x27;ve used this feature a lot for trimming sideburns, eyebrows and the hair that grows over the ears in between trips to the barber.   I&#x27;m sufficiently disappointed that I&#x27;m actually thinking of returning the shaver and going back to shaving cream and a razor.</li>
            <li> Moved from manual razor to electric after 40 years with the latter.  Although it takes several weeks to retrain the wiskers, the end result is an excellent shave.  Included trimmer works well on sideburns.  Wet or dry, the shave is comfortable and close.</li>
            <li> I surprice myself every morning that I shave, it so close and fast.    What a great shaver</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver. Better than a razor and my last electric. Very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> This is the worst Norelco shaver I have owned. It is poorly built and workmanship is extremely bad. The head is defective and cracked when  I first received the new unit. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day this year. I was so excited for him to open it I did not wait till the real day! He uses it every day and has made several comments about how wonderful it is (better shave, close cut, no tugging or pulling, great charge life, comfortable to use, easy to clean and my favorite so quite!) Needless to say it was worth every penny! I would recommend for any man that uses an electric razor daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Braun foil shaver and was impressed by the closeness.  It just took too long to shave in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a Norelco 6885XL lift and cut shaver approximately 9 years ago.  Replaced blades twice and used it every day...more than most people as I also shave my head every morning.  The speed and closeness of the shave was great.&lt;br /&gt;Move ahead to two weeks ago, the shaver head broke, replacement parts about $70. (Geez does nothing last?  HA HA)  So I started researching the new Norelco line.  Purchased the 1250 and received it in a few days.  Saved $50 over Targets price.  I&#x27;d been shaving for a week with a blade.  Anyway got the 1250 and was immediately disappointed.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how poor of a shave the expensive Norelco provided.  I use Afta pre-shave on beard and head.  Okay I thought I&#x27;ll give it a couple more tries.  Wow I guess my beard needed to adjust or something, this thing shaves my beard in under two minutes and my head in about the same time.  It actually provides as close or closer shave than the Braun foil shavers but with speed.  Cleaning is a simple hot water rinse. If you want the top of the line this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I started shaving in the shower with foam...this thing is an engineering marvel...close as a blade and no cuts.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> I have primarily shaved with a safety razor for most of my life. I buy a new electric razor every 5 to 10 years for touch ups and travel. This new 1250x 3d is the real deal. It does a great job dry and wet is just great. I&#x27;m not buying anymore expensive blades. I&#x27;m going 100% electric with this new razor. I&#x27;m very impressed. The only drawback that I&#x27;ve found is that when used dry I need aftershave on my neck. I&#x27;m sold on this razor!</li>
            <li> This really seems like a great razor and, from most of the other reviews, it would seem to be. But, for me, it doesn&#x27;t work well enough. I was hoping it would be a replacement for a regular razor, but it seems like such a thing is still not possible with an electric. It does a very good, almost excellent job on my cheeks but it is less than stellar on my chin and in the mustache area. For the neck area, it is terrible. I&#x27;ve tried it with and without shaving cream and just cannot get a close shave anywhere outside of the cheeks.    Furthermore, it irritates my neck even more than a regular razor because I have to go over the area so many times. My next plan is to use a straight razor for the neck and try this for everything else.     It does say in the guide that the razor should improve after a while. I&#x27;ve used it three times, so I&#x27;ll give it a little more time to see if it improves.</li>
            <li> PROS  - best shave of all shavers I&#x27;ve owned, including several Norelcos. Fast, comfortable, and smooth.  This seems to be their best set of shaving heads.  - long battery life  CONS  - MAJOR CON FOR TRAVEL: the charger plugs into the stand, which then charges the shaver through some contact points.  You *cannot* directly plug the charger into the shaver, meaning if you want to be able to charge it while traveling, plan on packing the large charging stand too.  It can do quite a few shaves on one charge, so maybe you risk not bringing the charger.  My solution is to bring my older, lower-end Norelco that plugs directly into the shaver.  - small head compartments require frequent cleaning to clear out accumulated hairs.  It&#x27;s not that hard - pop all 3 heads and then use running water in the sink - but it has to be done more often than the lower-end Norelcos with bigger compartments.  Another minor issue: with the lower-end single-head Norelcos, it&#x27;s easy to dab a towel after washing to get most of the water and facilitate drying.  Not easily done with this one with the way the 3 heads open as well as many metal snag points for the towel.  So plan on drying it a long time with beads of water all over the heads and compartments.  Probably not much of an issue at home, but again could be annoying if you&#x27;re packing it after use for travel.  - The heads being so elevated above the trimmer makes the trimmer a little awkward to us, as the heads are often bumping into some part of your face while you&#x27;re using the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have attempted to like electric shavers in the past with no success. Then, I saw this product advertised on television and decided to take yet another swing at electric. Wow! What a difference.  I use it with water and cream, and it&#x27;s better than shaving with a blade. It takes several weeks for your face to adjust to the system, but then it&#x27;s terrific. My only beef is that the company offered a substantial rebate with the purchase and I&#x27;m still waiting after 2 months.</li>
            <li> The shave is SO much better than my previous razor.  My only complaint is the charger.  In order to charge, you have to use the stand with the power cable.  That&#x27;s fine most of the time but it means I have to bring the stand when I travel (unless it&#x27;s a short trip).  That&#x27;s probably not a problem for most users and it didn&#x27;t stop me from giving it five stars.  But it&#x27;s something to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, I,ve been using Norelco shavers for many years ,always just wore them out from so much use. hopefuly this one will be the same..[[ASIN:B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]</li>
            <li> Cons: too pricy...  pros: no solution needed. This is basically why my bf loves it so much is becuz he can just rinse by running water after each use, convenient and quick.             very quick charging, and it can lasts for lots of shaves.             appealing appearance. a good gift for your loved ones.</li>
            <li> I find this razor to be an excellent choice for a beard and skin like mine.  My skin is sensitive and my beard is light.  I get a very smooth shave with no burning.  It is not quite a blade shave but it is very close.  I am pleased with my choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips (Norelco) shavers almost since I started shaving and upgrading every 5 or 6 years.  This one is definitely a quantum step forward.  The others have been fine, but this one is definitely the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Takes a little getting used to, but well worth it.  And I love how easy it is to clean.  Just rinse under hot water.  And it looks like the Alien in Alien when open to dry :-)</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever used.  It gives a very good &amp; smooth shave.  Very easy to clean.  I just wish that the charging stand were smaller than it is:  it would be best if it was not needed and  one could charge the razor with just the cord as my old Norelco could be.  This would make it better  for travel than with its bulky charging stand.  The head cover is hard to remove and sometimes the  head comes off when I remove its cover, but it is very easy to put the head back on.  Also Amazon&#x27;s price is good.</li>
            <li> My son has sensitive skin and has struggled with shaving with a blade because of his acne.  I purchased him this razor and he now has no issues with shaving.  He says its EXTREMELY comfortable when used with the appropriate electric shaving gel and feels much more comfortable about shaving now.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shave I have ever had and worth every penny (or dollar).  Smooth, quiet shave.  No grabbing of hairs.  I have used Norelco for the past 10+ years and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband to replace a 15 year old Norelco shaver that was just worn out.  The Senso Touch is absolutely fantastic according to the user.  He loves it and highly recommends it for a clean, close shave.  He loves the travel case that comes with it as well.</li>
            <li> My husband is not into trying new things, his old razor was about 15 years old and he couldn&#x27;t find the same module so he was nursing the old one along.  Got this as a Christmas present and he loves it.  I seen some comments where people said it took a little time to get used to, but my husband had no problems at all.  He says it&#x27;s fast, glides smoothly and gives a excellent shave.  His charge lasted about 2 weeks or more.  He uses it about every other day.</li>
            <li> Shaves, but not a clean shave. Does not work without charging stand which is a nuisance and takes up too much space. NORELCO NO LONGER STANDS BEHIND ITS DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> The system for recharging  Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> UPDATE October 27, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 years and 2 months of owning this shaver, it died. It now displays a flashing red exclamation point and refuses to turn on. It is now 2 months after the 2 year warranty, so it seems I am completely out of luck at this point. It&#x27;s as if it was designed to fail right after the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent an email to Phillips Norelco describing the problem. I&#x27;ll post an update here if/when they respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no indication in the troubleshooting manual what a flashing red exclamation point means, so I have no idea what&#x27;s going on with it. There is a description about what to do if you find that it&#x27;s lighting up that indicator along with two others at the same time, but it doesn&#x27;t tell you what it is if it&#x27;s just that one indicator and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I handled this shaver with kid gloves. I washed it after every use. I never mishandled it. Never dropped it. It was working fine yesterday, and now it won&#x27;t turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver was actually very good. Easily the best I&#x27;ve ever had. My shave yesterday was as good as the first shave I had with the device when it was brand new. It didn&#x27;t dull in all that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally gave it 5 stars. But I have since demoted it to 3 stars due to the fact that it died after just 2 years. My last shaver was a Braun, and it lasted around 10 years. Even then, it was just the rechargeable battery that needed replacement, and it still worked when plugged into the wall socket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first rotary shaver since I switched to foil shavers back in the mid-90&#x27;s. Foil shavers have been pretty good for me, and the last one I had was the Braun series 5 foil shaver. I used one of those for probably 8 to 10 years, I think. For the past two years, it hasn&#x27;t been able to hold a charge, and I had been using it while plugged in to the wall. When the cord starting to become loose, and the shaver spontaneously shut itself off many times during my shave, it was then that I realized I definitely needed to get myself a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem I had with my Braun series 5 foil shaver was that it took about 10 to 12 minutes to get a good shave. I had to work at it, constantly rubbing my hand against my face and going back over the same area with my shaver. It was a good shave, but it required work. I wanted something that could shave in half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I saw the Norelco 1250x/40 rotary shaver and thought I&#x27;d give it a try and see if rotary shavers were any better than foil ones. This one is their top of the line rotary shaver, so I figured it would be a good test. Alternatively, there&#x27;s the Norelco Speed XL rotary shaver, which advertises its speed over all. But I figured I&#x27;d give the 1250x/40 a try first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now had the Norelco 1250x/40 for over 10 days. At first, I have to tell you, I was not impressed with this shaver. It just wasn&#x27;t giving me a good shave. It took 16 minutes to shave, and even then it left some stubble. I just gave up, so it might have been 20 minutes or more of work just to get it to the point where my old foil shaver could get to. And because I was constantly going over and over the same areas, pressing harder and harder each time, it was leaving me with razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to send it back yesterday, but I decided to give it another try. This time I decided to try using it with shaving cream rather than just dry skin. Would that help any? It actually made a HUGE difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the shaving cream, I was able to shave in just 2-3 minutes. It got my face clean and smooth with just one or two passes. It was one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. It was an even better shave than spending 15 minutes with my Braun series 5 foil (admittedly the foil shaver was dry while the Norelco was with shaving cream). There were only a couple areas which required me to go back over, but it was minor. It got 99% of the stubble in just 2 or 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE... Several days after this review, I&#x27;ve been getting better and better at shaving with this shaver as I learn which parts of my face require a little more care. Now I don&#x27;t seem to be missing any areas at all. I&#x27;m so amazed every morning how good my shave is that I ask my girlfriend to feel my face to see how smooth it is. You can&#x27;t feel anything. It&#x27;s just skin, no stubble at all. Even 8 hours later, much of my face remains stubble free. The chin and neck grow in fast, though, but that&#x27;s biology, not the shaver&#x27;s fault... I&#x27;ve timed my shave with this shaver, and I get to 5 minutes if I&#x27;m being careful to go slow and pay attention to detail. With my last shaver, it was taking 10-12 minutes on average. So this is a big improvement in speed, and it&#x27;s a much closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve decided not to return it after all, and I&#x27;m actually thinking this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. Without shaving cream, it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job at all, in my opinion. That&#x27;s what was surprising to me. I&#x27;ve never needed to use shaving cream before with electric shavers. But it&#x27;s fine. I can accept having to use shaving cream if it means I can get a perfectly smooth shave in just a few minutes. That&#x27;s a trade-off I&#x27;ll take any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cleaning the shaver, it&#x27;s a breeze. I&#x27;m confused why reviewers here think it&#x27;s hard to clean. It&#x27;s not. You run the top part under water for 5 seconds, then you pop open the 3 heads and run them all under water for about 15 seconds. Then you give it a little shake and let it dry on its own. What is so hard about that? Cleaning out my old Braun series 5 foil shaver took several minutes, and it involved tediously using a brush to poke in between the holes in the foil, because oil and hair gunk would block the foil holes after a while. This Norelco 1250x/40 is much easier to clean by comparison. They really designed it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it&#x27;s a lithiumion battery and not nickle cadmium. That means you won&#x27;t get the battery \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot;. You can just charge it after every use rather than worrying about letting it run down completely before recharging it. My old shaver was like that, and I was always worried about running out of charge mid-way into my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another huge plus in my mind is the fact that it&#x27;s very quiet. My old Braun series 5 foil shaver was loud enough to annoy anyone sleeping in the next room. I can use the Norelco 1250x/40 without worrying about waking anyone up. That&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer part is not bad, either. A lot of people were upset that it looked like an afterthought instead of a well designed feature. They thought it should extend out further away from the rotary cutter head. Personally, I don&#x27;t use the trimmer a lot. And if they designed it so that it protruded more than it does now, I think more people would have a problem with that. If you&#x27;re finding yourself in need of the trimmer a lot, maybe you just need to get a stand-alone beard trimmer in addition to this. Even a $25 stand-alone trimmer would be better than the best built-in trimmer you can find out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only negative things I&#x27;ll say about this are: 1) the battery is not replaceable, 2) it&#x27;s unable to use it corded (battery only operation), and 3) the charging stand is pretty easy to topple over. All of these negatives are acceptable to me, since it does give me such a good shave. But yes, having a corded feature would be much more welcomed. And the fact that you need to take the charging stand with you when you go on trips is annoying. I really wish the designers would have done that differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and there is one more thing to talk about. The cost of the replacement heads is $60 at this time. That seems like a lot of money to be paying just for the heads. But I&#x27;m hoping they don&#x27;t need to be replaced every 12-18 months like the manual says to do. My Braun series 5 foil cutter blocks definitely needed replacing every 6-9 months or so. But rotary cutter blades, I&#x27;ve heard, last a lot longer. A lot of people say they&#x27;ve never had to replace theirs. But who knows about the Norelco 1250x/40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ Excellent close shave, with shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;+ Very fast shave in just 3 minutes, with shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;+ Lithium Ion battery.&lt;br /&gt;+ Very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;+ Very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;+ Battery level indicator.&lt;br /&gt;+ Looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Need shaving cream if you want a fast and close shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;- Battery is not replaceable. So, 3-5 year lifetime?&lt;br /&gt;- Battery only operation, lacking a corded feature.&lt;br /&gt;- Charging stand is easy to topple over.&lt;br /&gt;- Need to take the charging stand with you on trips.&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive head replacement.&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE... It&#x27;s been a few weeks now since starting to use this shaver. I wanted to mention that I tried it with \\&quot;Lectric Shave\\&quot; liquid instead of shaving cream. While Lectric Shave was designed for electric shavers, I have to say that I still prefer shaving cream instead. After using Lectric Shave, there was a lot more stubble left, and I had some nicks on my face and razor burn. Shaving cream is a lot better. But Lectric Shave is about 50% better than shaving dry. When you use shaving cream, use it like the manual says: First wet your face with water, then apply shaving cream, then wet your shaver with water, then shave (in that order)... And as for my main review, I still really like the shaver and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this new electric shaver - Philips Norelco 1250x/40 senso touch for about a month and find it excellent so far, easy to use and easy to clean, do not like the recommended frequent change of blades,feel it is a large added cost factor.</li>
            <li> After reading all the other great reviews of this shaver, I couldnt wait to get it so I got it sent here to Australia express post which took 5 days! Its a really great shaver and is comfortable in the hand. I only just recently had to charge it for the 1st time, so it really does last for a lot of shaves.     As this is my 1st electric shaver, I can say that its not as close as a razor but I dont really care because of the speed at which you can have a shave with this thing!! Its really easy to clean too so to some up, I Love It!!!</li>
            <li> I have always used shaving cream with a Gillette safety razor.  I loved the long ago day when the Wilkinson Sword blades came out.  They were super sharp and gave a superb shave, didn&#x27;t pull or hurt your face and didn&#x27;t slice your skin like the old double edge blades.  The one time I tried an electric razor, it left my skin irritated and the shave was nowhere close to being comparable to a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch is unbelieveable.  I have a tough beard and it gave me a shave as close as any I have ever had.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this shaver for 5 years, and just bought it again for my whiskered twin teenagers. I&#x27;ve used many other brands in the past, but this is superior by far. It&#x27;s a more expensive option, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> The best shaver and it saves you a tone of $.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors for over 20 years - this, by far, is the best.  I get sucked into trying / buying a new model every few years on the promises of \\&quot;New and Improved\\&quot;, but until now, never really notices much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think the most expensive version with the submerged cleaner / lubricator is unecessary - just my 2 cents (sorry Norelco)</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for many years and one of my main compaints over the years is the fact that it&#x27;s often difficult to get a close shave with an electric razor. The Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch provides the closest electric razor shave I have ever had and, as an added bonus, it lasts a long time between charges.   I think the main advantage of the Norelco 1250 is the pivot head, which easily follows the curves of your face and allows the razor to get every last hair. The razor fits nicely in my hand and is easy to maneuver. Cleaning is easy. Just lift each individual head, run the razor under water and let it dry. At this point I am able to use the razor for two or three weeks before charging, which is a nice bonus. You also can use this razor wet or dry, which should please those who like to shave in the shower or prefer to use shaving cream or gel.   The only way to charge the razor is through the stand (the jack for the charger is on the side of the stand). So, if you lose the stand, you lose your ability to charge the razor. Also, the razor heads cost about $70 to replace, which is not inexpensive. You can probably find replacement heads online for cheaper and, unless you have a heavy beard, my guess is you can probably replace the heads at longer intervals.  Bottom line, this is a great electric razor. While a bit pricey, it does provide a very close shave and it&#x27;s very easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Searched high and low, read reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, and compared value and effectiveness. This thing shaves so much better than other electric razors, and does just as well of a job as my 3-blade standard razor. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I would give this 5* except for the inability to use while charging.(I knew this going in).  I had the Arctec several years ago and switched to Braun for that reason. The Braun \\&quot;3\\&quot; series with the \\&quot;clean and renew\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t come close to the Norelco.  The problem of charging still remains, if you are traveling for more than a week you have to bring the charging stand along.  At least the Arctec had a travel case that acted as the charger.  As far as performance it&#x27;s excellent, no problem switching from the Braun Foil to the Norelco Sensotouch 3D.</li>
            <li> It held its charge for only 3 minutes, not the 50 promised. The shave was not very comfortable for my husband with his heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t provide reviews for items that I purchase, however this time I am so satisfied with this razor that I will break with that policy.     I have had many electric razors in my 70+ years but I have never had one that is     1. this quiet,     2. that cuts so close...that is to say &#x27;cuts&#x27; ... not &#x27;pulls&#x27;,     3. that is intuitively easy to use,     4. is easy to clean and charge and    5. that does all that it is advertised to do.      This razor is, without question, the best electric razor I have ever owned.  It replaced a relatively new Remington that sounded like a threshing machine and very carefully pulled out the whiskers one at a time.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace another Norelco cordless razor (don&#x27;t recall the exact model, but it used the almost as pricey HQ-9 heads) that I had misplaced en-route to recent deployment.  That razor had served me faithfully for nearly 5 years, and I was only recently noticing the battery to not be lasting long.  I figured, since the $100-something I spent on that razor lasted for 5 years, I&#x27;d drop the extra money on their newer, fancier line of razors.  I was thrilled when I received it.  The razor not only performed noticeably better than the crappy $8 electric razor I purchased while I was waiting for this razor, but also better than my old Norelco model with the HQ-9 heads.  My face was noticeably smoother, and I was happy for the $150 or so that I paid for it so far.  ...Then, after 4 months, my razor died, and no longer charged.  I didn&#x27;t have enough time remaining at my deployed location to go through the exchange process, so I waited until I got home.  Once home, I contacted Norelco through their online customer support (around 17Oct2011).  The Norelco CSR confirmed that my unit was bad, and offered a free replacement.  I thought \\&quot;Wow, that&#x27;s it?\\&quot; as my troubleshooting/replacement process only took a few minutes.    Then came the waiting game.  The next day, I received an email from Norelco advising me that my unit was back ordered, and there was no ETA for it.  Weeks later, I received another email saying it would arrive 11Nov2011.  Then, as that approached, yet another email, this time telling me that its back ordered until 22Nov2011.  This waiting game has gotten quite irritating, as I&#x27;ve been using the aforementioned crappy $8 razor that does a sub-par job while I patiently wait Norelco to come through for me with my replacement razor.  So far, my estimated time for a razor is about 1 month, in addition to the roughly 2 weeks that I was without it.  If I were to purchase another razor again, at this point, I would skip this series, and go back to acordless model using the HQ-9 heads, which lasted me nearly 5 years (before I lost it), instead of 4 months, before dying.  Norelco hasn&#x27;t been too expedient at getting me a product that they actually make.  It makes me wonder if they even sell it anymore, or are more interested in getting new razors to retailers, rather than returning customers, who&#x27;s Norelco product has failed on them.  Oh, and yes, the trimmer on it does suck.  It slides out, but just barely.  It&#x27;s still functional, but not as much as ones that flip out..</li>
            <li> I got this Philips Norelco Shaver with a good price. And The appearance looks great. High Quality with Lower price. This is a best choice for my husband.</li>
            <li> I have shaved using a fusion razor for many years, I have never been a believer of electric shavers. I used the Senso Touch for the first time this morning, i still cannot believe the results, I could have sworn that it was a fusion that I had used. A great product and i am sold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for over 40 years and none of them compare to this. I dropped my previous 8 year old Norelco razor and it never worked the same, even after I replaced the entire head assembly. This model shaves as close as a blade (maybe closer). My only complaint, if you can call it one, is that it shaves so close that I need to use a lotion to soothe a slight razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its design is impressive and a complete departure from previous Norelco designs. It&#x27;s light weight, easy to use and feels good in your hand. The trimmer works well and the clippings from the rotor blades don&#x27;t empty into your hand or into the sink while trimming your sideburns like the previous model I had. It is over-packaged, but, thankfully, the polypropylene package was easy to open and recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a vast improvement over previous models. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind a manual razor is as close as you will get when you shave...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-I like the flexibility in the razor to help with hard to reach places&lt;br /&gt;-It keeps its charge fairly well&lt;br /&gt;-Surface area is excellent&lt;br /&gt;-Easy clean up&lt;br /&gt;-If your into the looks of a razor, then this is the one to get (if that matters)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Price is fairly high, unless you get a deal when it is on sale.&lt;br /&gt;-The trimmer may be difficult to get use unless you take the head off (and extra step)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve tried the Braun and Norelco and I am a fan of the Norelco rotary razors.  The closeness of the shave are fairly close together in my opinion, but the Braun takes a lot more strokes to get the same effect.  The Norelco has more surface area and if you do go over multiple times, it just makes the shave that much closer.  If you had money to spend and had to pick one I like the rotary razor in Norelco(Braun is a lot more in cost).  If you don&#x27;t really want to spend the money then a step down from the top end Norelco or Braun is not much of a drop off.  That is why I gave it a 4 star rating.  It&#x27;s a solid razor, but I feel there are other solid ones as well.</li>
            <li> my bf used to complain about having to use shaving cream + razor every morning so I decided this would be a good idea for him. now his morning routine got cut in half. he loves it!</li>
            <li> Quite surprised at how close this shaver shaves me. Very easy to clean, easy to charge, holds charge very well and for numerous shaves. Much easier than the usual scraping of the face with a razor. Of course, electric shavers do not shave as close as a blade and if going out at night, have to give a quick touch-up.</li>
            <li> I received the Senso Touch 3d for Christmas and I have to write that it is the best shave that I have ever experienced.  I am 55 years old and have used a wide variety of electric shavers and blade shavers.  Never have I had such a close shave with virtually no irritation.  I dry shave so I clean it every two or three shaves.  A hot water rinse of the heads only takes a minute.  I quickly blow dry the blades with a hair dryer on low temperature.  My wife is a hair stylist and she told me about the Wahl Total Clipper Care lubricant and cleaner which I use to lube the cutters after cleaning.  The Wahl spray cleaner/lubricant is half the price of other cleaners such as Remington Shaver Saver and is available at Walmart.  Lubricant reduces any heat build-up and should extend the life of the blades.  I highly recommend this state-of-the-art Philips 3d shaver and although it is expensive, it is the best!</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for several months now and nothing I have used during 60 years of shaving can compare with it.  It doesn&#x27;t bite, pull or irritate and it still gives a clean, quick shave.  It is a breeze to clean, just rinse under hot water and blot it gently with a towel and set it out for a couple of hours to dry.  I generally put it back in the charger after it dries so I can&#x27;t really say how long it will go without charging.  My beard is what I would describe as being moderately tough and I often go 2 to 3 days between shaves.  It is very efficient at cutting this length.  I try to follow Norelco&#x27;s instructions to use a circular motion when shaving.</li>
            <li> Just received this as a replacement for a very old Braun 7 series.  I wasn&#x27;t aware that you couldn&#x27;t just plug the cord into the razor as you can with ever other electric razor I have owned, you have to use a docking stand to charge the thing - inconvenient, over engineered and just plain stupid.  One more thing to have to make sure you have when you travel, and the quality of the docking station material (light plastic) would seem to guarantee that it won&#x27;t last as long as the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not power through any shave with this device, I have a light beard at best, and it took twice as long to get it knocked out as it does with a 13 year old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a few rogue hairs that come in very thick, the shaving head would just roll over these without cutting them, so I popped out the edge clipper, this exposed how weak the razor really is.  You would think I was trying to cut copper wire by the sound it made every time the clipper hit a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge disappointment considering the reviews this razor received.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my partner&#x27;s birthday and he absolutely loves it. He uses it with shaving foam when he wants an extra close shave and swears it works better than a razor.  Can be used daily, though irritates a little until the skin gets used to it (after the first few weeks).</li>
            <li> Received SensorTouch 3D for Xmas gift.  Really liked it overall.  Negatives are that edge of blades don&#x27;t allow for hairs close to nose area and pop-up trimmer works poorly.  Have to use another razor for those areas.  Main issue is that after 10 weeks, razor ceased working ... totally died.  Called Customer Service.  Very nice on phone but replacement handles are backordered without a projected date for manufacturing new ones.  Therefore, I recommend holding off on a new purchase until production issues resolved.  Serious backorder could indicate a manufacturing or design defect since there was no schedule for when handles will become available.</li>
            <li> 3/12/2011 - I had electrics (rotary and foil; Norelco and Braun) when I was a teen and transitioned to a blade over time due to lack of a close shave or too much irritation.  I wanted to try an electric again and based on prior experience, purchased the Philips 1250x.  It does take about two weeks of regular use to allow time for your face to adjust.  During that time, you should expect a bit of neck rash and several missed hairs.  Once your face adjusts, the 1250x does a fine job, though not as close as a blade, so 4 stars for the shaver but minus 1 star for the horrible trimmer.  I have only used the razor with shave cream.  Here are the pros and cons:    Pros  1.  Super quiet.  2.  The 3D flex inward/outward blade head is cool and is responsible for the comfortable shave.  This feature is why I chose the 3D model.  3.  A very comfortable shave that previous electrics can&#x27;t touch.  The three primary differences between the 3D and less expensive 2D models is the 2D blades can&#x27;t flex outward (they only flex inward), the 2D blades have a different shave pattern, and the 2D head must be popped off in order to attach the trimmer.  Who knows, the 2D model may provide a better shave due to different blades and a pop off trimmer.  4.  Made in the Netherlands (take that Made in Germany Braun).  5.  LiPo recharge battery lasts a long time and charges quickly.  6.  The shaver does not get near as hot as a foil shaver.    Cons  1.  The 1250x trimmer is one step above useless.  I almost immediately returned the 1250x due to the absolutely horrible trimmer.  The owners manual states the trimmer is a patented tube design.  News flash, no one will steal your patent, Philips, because it is underpowered, too narrow, and ineffective.  Be prepared to have a disposable just to shape and clean up your sideburns.  Absolutely ridiculous at this price point.  2.  The 1250x does not shave as close as a blade.    **UPDATE** 5/15/2011 - Still love this razor.  I traveled overseas for two weeks and did not take the charger.  Had just enough juice to carry through but Philips needs to boost the battery a bit because it was a close call; otherwise, Philips should have kept the sturdy travel case with built-in charger that came with last year&#x27;s Arcitec.    The built-in trimmer is still absolutely useless.  A complete waste of space and effort.  Keep a cheap disposable razor handy to touch up your sideburns.    The shave is still pretty close but not as close as a blade and it never will be, but it&#x27;s a good shave and very comfortable.  I&#x27;ve gotten used to the blades and there is zero burn or neck rash...there&#x27;s something to be said about Philips&#x27; suggestion to give the razor 30 days so that your beard can adjust.    Buy it...you&#x27;ll love it for the shave and rue the day you met the built-in trimmer.</li>
            <li> Razor burn is going away now that I am using this razor. Closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten with an electric razor</li>
            <li> went and got the whole dame set!!  My son loves it!!  He&#x27;s a Marine!!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the difference in this shaver and the $70-90 shaver&#x27;s I &#x27;ve owed in the past. I am really upset I waited this long to spend the money on a topshelf shaver....its was well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Based on reviews, I recently bought the Braun series 3 and tried if for 4 weeks. I do not understand what people like about this razor. I found it not to give a close shave and it had a difficult time with longer stubble that you may have after a weekend of not shaving. It is possible that my beard growth is tougher than average, but in contrast the Norelco 1250x has worked great. It has been doing everything well, under the nose, on the chin, and even long stubble seem to cut just fine. I am surprised at how close the shave was based on the reviews I have read on these pages. It doesn&#x27;t have the fancy cleaner like the Braun (which is kind of loud in the morning when my wife is trying to sleep), but hot water seems to work well at cleaning and is definitely cheaper than buying replacement cleaning solution. The trimmer is kind of lame, but I have a separate razor for that so it was not a big deal. I must admit the heads are kind of funky on the Norelco, so I am concerned how it will travel, but as far as the shave it is quite a bit closer than the Braun.</li>
            <li> This razor purchased as a Christmas present for my son. It worked as advertised for a short time, and then failed. With my receipt, he was able to promptly get a replacement. He is pleased with the product .    Many thanks,    Verne T. Kelling  Sammamish, WA</li>
            <li> These guys ROCK! The Razor is AWESOME! The service, delivery, EVERYTHING was AWESOME! FIVE STARS for these guys, I definately recommed them!  Jeremy Fort Lauderdale</li>
            <li> Very smooth for an electric shaver. However, it&#x27;s still far from closing on manual blades&#x27; smoothness, so beware sensitive skins! And you must use it everyday for your skin to get and keep used to it.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to electric shaving due to a dermatologist recommendation. I had an old shaver that didn&#x27;t work too well so I bought this Philips to replace it. I have been very happy with it. Very smooth shave, no prickly skin afterwards, no need to press down hard, the flex head is fantastic in going over the chin/neck contours. Cleaning is a breeze. The only minor complaint is the sideburn trimmer doesn&#x27;t really work too well - I&#x27;ve stopped using it.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, easy to grip, quiet, gives a great shave.  Cleaning is easy and simple.  Great battery life</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor a year ago to replace a Norelco 8020X which I loved. The reason I was looking for a replacement was that the shaver heads for the 8020X were now costing as much as a new razor. I decided on the model 1250X. This razor was much bigger and bulkier than the 8020X but I gave it a chance. It did a good job shaving so I kept it. It came time to replace the shaver head, you don&#x27;t just replace the blades on these, and I came to Amazon to shop. The original shaver head RQ12 had been replaced by RQ12+. I purchased it and was not very happy. The new head is not as flexible as the old one and is very obviously much cheaply made. I gave it three shaves and was still very unhappy with it. I contacted Philips-Norelco and told them why I was unhappy with the replacement head. They verified that it was the newer model of the original head and that there was really not much else they could do. They suggest I try a different razor since different models had different types of shaving heads. I decided that since it&#x27;s going to cost me the price of a new razor to get a new shaver head that I would find a replacement head for my old 8020X.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to spend this much money on a razor, but now am sorry I didn&#x27;t do it sooner.  Much sooner.  From day 1 this razor produced a close shave, without pulling or tugging.  It is so quiet that my wife can hardly hear me shaving now.  It is simple to charge, clean and operate.  Even pulling the head off to trim my sideburns is easy.  I could not be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor.  He feels its the best razor he has ever owned and he has had plenty.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to shave and very good</li>
            <li> The best thing about this razor is how you clean it.All you need to do is pop open the heads and run under water.The weight of it is surprisingly light and the body is made of plastic so it feels a bit cheap.I have a hard time shaving my neck and the under side of my jaw line but all the electric razors I owned had the same issue.For the most part,it does do a good job shaving and is a good buy.</li>
            <li> NOTE: I got this razor at Walmart for $80+tax because it was on super clearance for some reason so I gave it 5 stars. Otherwise, it would be only 4 because it is expensive and so are the replacement heads apparently! I have only used it twice so far and I am amazed at the quality of the shave.    I have an uncooperative beard as it grows in, in different directions and I have problems with razor burn and ingrown hairs on my neck even after manual exfoliating after shaving.  I usually shave with a safety razor and shaving cream. Then I have to exfoliate.  I tried a medium end Braun and it took FOREVER to shave my face.  I tried this shaver without shaving cream and it felt 99% as close as a safety razor. I also have almost no razor burn and don&#x27;t have to exfoliate if I don&#x27;t want to.    The first time I tried it,it shaved off 4 days of stubble with absolutely no problem.    The charging stand is rather flimsy (looks like it was designed by an artist instead of an engineer) but it gets the job done.    If you can afford it, I would strongly suggest this shaver.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I really wanted to like this razor. The razor is the nicest looking razor on the market.  At $150 its also one of the most expensive.  I usually use foil razors but I thought I would give this a chance since it&#x27;s from a great company like Phillips.  The razor provided a smooth shave but I found the foil razors provide a slightly easier shaving experience.  The ease of cleaning was good as well.  Here&#x27;s the downside, this razor doesn&#x27;t have the cutting power of others on the market.  You&#x27;ll get a closer shave with a Braun or a Panasonic.  This razor also tore up the bottom of my neck whereas a razor like a Pansonic won&#x27;t do that.  If you have a thick beard this razor will not work for you.  If you have light facial hair or plan on using this razor a few days out of the week you&#x27;re in business.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great! It is the best my husband has ever had. We got it in the mail quickly</li>
            <li> It is a pleasure  to shave with this razor. It is so quite and smooth you hardly know you are shaving. The heads conform to the face easily and it does not irritate the skin, even under the neck. It gives a reasonably close shave the first time around.However if you want a really close shave, as I do, you do have to go over your skin one or more times, but this is no problem&lt;br /&gt; because it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. It just takes a bit longer and you don&#x27;t get as many shaves on a single charge. Charging time is only one hour.</li>
            <li> AWESOME money well spent</li>
            <li> After using a [[ASIN:B000G1785S Braun Series 5 (8985) Men&#x27;s Shaver]] for about 2 yrs,I used this Philips Norelco and have been using for about past 8 months.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, both of them provide a good shave, and if you are debating which one to go for, following may help:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarities:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both electric shavers will give you a smooth shave and not necessarily a close shave. If your beard hair are very thick (and dark colored too), then you may observe slight blackish tinge on your beard line over time. This is due to the thick roots which will be left by either of these shavers. Only traditional shavers can provide you a very close shave in that case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are convenient to use, light-weight, and once fully charged, can easily go through a work week (assuming that you shave once a day only)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement blade heads cost almost same for both, about thirty-five dollars or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades have a pretty long life. The manufacturers ask you to replace in 18 months but they go well over two years sometimes. However, this is also dependent on your beard thickness and density.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Differences:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun works well on face, and chin. It has to be maneuvered around on the neck in order to properly shave that area.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco is awesome on face and  neck, but can cause issues with the chin area. In either case, you get used to it in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco looks more stylish while standing on its base on the sink counter.&lt;br /&gt;Braun looks a bit big due to the its base with the cleaning solution inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco&#x27;s trimmer is more ergonomic and easier to use on sides.&lt;br /&gt;Braun&#x27;s trimmer is a bit oddly placed, since the shaver itself blocks your view while trimming sides...sort of a bad design example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco has to be cleaned with warm water after every use, while Braun can be just put back into its base and the system itself will take care of the cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Braun&#x27;s base is smart enough to figure out the level of cleaning needed. It has three levels, light, medium, and intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the cleaning solution, Braun shaver has bit higher operational cost, but extra convenience in use. You can buy a set of 2 pack cleaning solution for about ten-eleven dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun also comes with a neat form fit plastic case and a cleaning brush, thus, making it an ideal travel mate for business trips. The charger can also be connected directly to the shaver without the need of the base.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco will always need its base in order to keep charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If convenience, ease-of-carrying, and portability are your critical factors, then go with Braun.&lt;br /&gt;If cost is your main factor, go with Norelco.Due to the cleaning solution, Braun shaver has bit higher operational cost, but extra convenience in use.

            <li> Quietly does it&#x27;s job, easy to clean and shaves so close.  I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> Great shaver, my only problem was some of the packaging had been removed suggesting that it had been opened previously.</li>
            <li> While I was initially deterred by the price of this shaver the reviews persuaded my to purchase one.  I have used the high end norelco shavers for 20 years and this one is the best product they have created to date.  I can shave my entire face and neck in 45 seconds and get the best shave I have ever had.  Prior products consistently left stubble in the hard to get places even when I shaved them several times.  This product gets the stubble on the first pass.  The flex head and design is comfortable to hold and easily accesses all the hard to get places on my face.  While the trimmer is noisy compared to prior models, it&#x27;s smaller design seems more efficient and effect that earlier models.  I would give this shaver an A+ rating.  Considering that i shave 365 days a year, a shave of this quality becomes a bargain at the price.</li>
            <li> I am giving this shaver, which I have owned and used for several years, a poor review--not because the razor is not a fine product but because Norelco has recently started selling inferior shaver head replacements at an exorbitant price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Norelco shaver for decades.  My old 6826XL remains my favorite, but Norelco no longer makes replacement heads that work well with it.  Now they are not providing high quality heads for my SensoTouch.  It&#x27;s outrageous.  Clearly Norelco is no longer interested in providing a quality product nor properly servicing their existing customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now looking at Panasonic and Braun electric razors.</li>
            <li> love this shaver.  shaves closer and faster than any electric shaver i have used.  seems to hold a charge longer than most as well and easy to clean</li>
            <li> very close shaving compared to other brand, ergonomically designed, very well built and battery last long.  After the 3rd time from recharging the shaver it just stopped working, I guess there is an issue with the battery.  I will try to return the item since it is still in the guarantee period.</li>
            <li> The best one I has even used. Shave very well, and can be washed. The battery can work hours, so I just charge it every month.</li>
            <li> Had Norelco razors for many years and decided to try a foil electric a couple of years ago.  I bought a top of the line model but was never happy with the shave.  After exhausting the special proprietary cleaning fluid canisters I bought with the razor, I got fed up and bought this razor.  What a relief.  At first it was so quiet I wondered if it was fully working but after my first shave I was really impressed.  No irritation and the heads really do adapt to the contours of my face.  I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor with a shaving cream but this razor is capable and the experience was terrific.  It didn&#x27;t feel like I was cutting anything, but the shave was incredibly close and ultimately smooth.  I really love this razor and actually look forward to shaving.  I never thought I would say that.</li>
            <li> First off, a disclaimer.  My face is not your face.  What works well for me may not work well for you.  Both Norelco and Braun offer money back trial periods, so my main advice is to not overthink the decision or put too much stock in reviews like this one.  I bought this shaver to replace a 2 year old Braun Series 3, which compared to the newer series 7 has the same foils and a slightly different \\&quot;trim\\&quot; middle blade on the head.  So it&#x27;s very similar.  The trimmer stopped working, the cleaning base stopped charging it, and it was time for a new head.  So I decided it was time for a new shaver.   My previous Braun did a great job on my face, but it really struggled with my neck.  It provided a very close shave but also missed a lot of whiskers, so it took a long time and a lot of going back and forth and stretching and pinching of my skin to get everything.   In comparison, the SensoTouch 3D is much faster and misses a lot fewer hairs.  I&#x27;d estimate it cuts my shaving time by about 1/3 to 1/2, also slighty faster than a blade.  It&#x27;s much better at getting stray longer hairs in areas I don&#x27;t always pay attention to than the Braun, although it still can leave some.  Usually if I go over stray hairs a few times this Norelco will get them, where with the Braun I&#x27;d have to break out the manual razor to touch up.  It&#x27;s also much quieter and easier to clean.  The downside to the Norelco is that it just isn&#x27;t as close a shave as the Braun and is a bit harsher on my face. Which is surprising since it requires so much less pressure than the Braun did.  It&#x27;s close, just not as close.  Like another reviewer mentions, I also find it closer than a Gillette Fusion used with the grain.  A manual razor against the grain will provide the closest shave, but also the most discomfort.  The constant nicks, cuts, and mess of doing that is what keeps me coming back to electrics.  Overall, I prefer this shave to anything else due to the consistancy, speed, and convenience.  It literally takes about 20 seconds to clean this after each shave.  This shaver is even easier to clean than my old Braun which had a noisy cleaning system because even using that you still had to periodically clean it manually.  The Norelco also doesn&#x27;t spill as many clippings while you are shaving, but still can spill some.  I shave every day, and a charge lasts me over two weeks.  The trimmer is best described as adequate.  It works, but is probably the weakest of any electric shaver I have owned. If you do a lot of trimming, you&#x27;ll probably want a seperate trimmer.  So if this is the best overall shaver I have used, why just 3 stars?  2 things, price and portability.  I don&#x27;t want or need a wet shave, but Norelco does not give me a choice if I want these heads.  Putting these heads on a lesser dry shaver would probably cut the cost in half.  Also this shaver has an awkward large shape that does not travel as well as a Braun or lesser Norelco, and because of the wet shave ability there is no travel charger.  If you need to charge it, you must bring the also awkwardly large stand.  With the long run time this isn&#x27;t a big issue for me, at least not with new strong batteries.  In a couple years it may be.  There is just nothing overly impressive about the build quality that I feel justifies the high price unless you must have the wet shave ability.  But it is still the best shaver I have ever used, so I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> First use of this razor and I am very impressed and satisfied. I tried the &#x27;dry&#x27; shave and had no irritation afterwards, which I always had after shaving with other razors. Very lightweight and gives a very smooth shave. The price is a little steep for a razor, but I think it will be well worth it. If you can afford it, buy this razor. You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> good shaver, highly recommend. my previous Philips had lack of power. this one is solid, powerful and accurate.  if you want to shave electric this seems to be the way to go (this is the 3rd saver i buy in the last 3 years and only now i am satisfied).</li>
            <li> Shaver gives a comfortable shave and is easy to clean. The charging stand is well designed and takes a minimum of counter space.</li>
            <li> i have used electric razors such as norelco and braun over most of my adult life.  i have never had such a close,comfortable shave as with this new phillips norelco 1250x.  it is as smooth a shave as my gillette pro glide fusion razor.  try it and you will never experience such a delightful shaving experience especially when you use a foam shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my husband.........he really like&#x27;s the close and smooth way it cuts his beard.  He&#x27;s very pleased and so am I.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]I love my phillips shaver I will use it especially during my trip to Europe and other parts of the world. I have had othe tipes of electric razr, but no one like this.</li>
            <li> Good razor. Doesn&#x27;t cut or leave your face dry and red. Isn&#x27;t the closet electric razor I have ever used but the quality and feel of the shave makes it a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This shaver got top reviews from Consumer Reports and deserves them; its a VERY nice machine. I still feel it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my old foil razor, but I&#x27;m getting the technique of close shaves. My old foil razor shaved close but it also ate holes in the foils so I had to replace them about every three months. I got totally sick of that!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this shaver after having only used foil shavers. It gives a very close shave and works very well, especially on my neck. But the razor burn is pretty severe, much more than I get with foil shavers.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. Gets all those whiskers on your neck that go in all crazy directions. Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had for cleaning it as well.  Only weakness is the stand/charger. It&#x27;s an excellent stand until you have to take it on the road.  I&#x27;ve never tried the wet shave/shave cream route so I can&#x27;t comment.    I&#x27;ve always used Braun shavers but this Norelco never pulls no matter how long the whiskers are and the trimmer gets to tight spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Norelco products and this electric razor does not disappoint.  The sleek style had me thinking this razor would be mostly form over function but I was wrong.  The design is intelligent and the pivoting heads provide a smooth and comfortable experience.  An added bonus is the ability to shave wet and dry.  Each head also clicks up/open for easy cleaning under the faucet.  The razor is a bit pricey but it&#x27;s refreshing to see quality craftsmanship.  I&#x27;m glad I opted for the \\&quot;bare-bones\\&quot; model as my counter space is sparce and I&#x27;m really not sure how much better it can get.  Also, the extra cost didn&#x27;t appear justifiable.  UPDATE 10/28/11  After using this razor for several months, it does offer an amazing shave.  The only issue that I have found is that the heads are pretty small and thus can only hold a small amount of trimmed hair.  It&#x27;s not a big deal but most standard 3 head electric razors have a large cavity below the cutting heads that can hold ample trimmings.  This razor must be cleaned more often.  This is likely Norelco&#x27;s reason for offering a cleaning system.  Not a big enough problem to downgrade my rating but something to consider when purchasing. (I&#x27;ve read the cleaning system can be quite cumbersome so I&#x27;m still very happy with my decision to buy the \\&quot;bare-bones\\&quot; model.</li>
            <li> I very rarely give reviews on products unless they leave a great impression on me.  I&#x27;ve been using safety razors for 4+ years since I have a very thick beard, and safety razors were the only way for me to get a close shave.  I decided to give electrics another try (last time was ~10 years ago  At first I thought I wasted my money, but after about a month of my face getting accustomed to the shaver - I absolutely love it now!  I can shave in about the same amount of time as with my safety razor with the same amount of closeness.  I am now able to shave on the go, and I no longer have the shaving irritation as I had before.  I would buy this razor again in a heart beat, knowing what I know now.  If you are on the fence because you have a thick beard and don&#x27;t believe this product will work, give it a try! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Great shaves! I&#x27;ve used Norelcos for 30+ years, and 1259x/40 is another improvement in shave quality. That said, Philips has lost its way with maintenance:   (1) Instructions for cleaning the shaving unit are for rinsing the razor heads closed under hot water \\&quot;for a few minutes\\&quot; followed by rinsing under hot water open \\&quot;for at least 30 seconds.\\&quot; That cleaning takes longer than shaving and uses as much hot water than shaving with a blade.  (2) The razor has a drain duct from the heads down to a little hole the bottom of the razor. (Really!) The instructions say, \\&quot;While rinsing razor heads, water may drip out of the base of razor. This is a normal occurrence.\\&quot; Truth is, it drains out slowly, over hours, and will drip out after taken off its stand for your next shave. If you happen to be sitting down while shaving, it will drip on you. (Really!) --Not house broken. I can hardly believe it. Maybe you should buy this shaver for this hee ha value...  (3) The RQ12 (replacement) razor heads are good but pricey. If I continue to use this excellent shaver for 6 years and replace the heads annually, I will have paid twice the purchase price of the shaver for replacement heads. --I do not much like the increasingly common approach of pricing maintenance items to make the profit for the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips for long time, which I was always happy with philips product. But this is the first time with 3D electric, which is great - very close to skin. loved it.</li>
            <li> As far as electric shavers are concerned this one does rank high.  I have had Remington and Braun shavers and I think this one is better.  The Norelco is still not as good as a regular blade razor.</li>
            <li> Since there are already many detailed reviews, this one will focus on performance and value.  I have a light beard so I&#x27;ve only used electric, and I&#x27;m a Norelco guy.  My previous Norelco was of the standard $40-$70 variety, and gave me 15 years of reliable service before getting noisy, sputtering, and generally being ready to conk out.  Is it worth paying 2-3 times as much for a SensoTouch 3D?  Here&#x27;s my take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes about an hour to be fully charged.  After two weeks of use, the indicator shows it still has more than a third of its power left, so no nuisance there.  I always dry shave, and doing so with the 3D works very well.  I definitely get a closer shave than with the old model.  It took a few shaves to get used to the heads being placed further apart than with a standard Norelco (so they have room to pivot), so there&#x27;s more need to use a circular motion.  The 3D is amazingly quiet, as opposed to the very unpleasant screeching of the old one echoing in my small bathroom.  Far and away the best part of the experience is the ability to easily shave my neck, which gets as full a beard as my face.  This is where the 3D heads shine.  No awkward angles as I aim for curved areas, and no going over the same area until I have razor burn.  My jaw line finally gets a clean shave on one or two passes, especially the area just behind the sides of my jaw that was terrible to aim at before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value vs. a cheaper shaver:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why spend so much on this product?  Because it gives a closer, more comfortable shave, is faster since you won&#x27;t have to go back to tackle missed hairs or stubble in hard to reach spots, and it&#x27;s so easy to clean.  No more removing the head, unclasping a holder, taking the blades out, then brushing it out.  An indicator tells you when to rinse it out.  Ten seconds under the tap and it&#x27;s clean.  The three blade chambers open easily but click firmly back in place every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having gotten by with a lesser shaver for years, I&#x27;d say this is somewhat of a luxury item.  As someone who can afford better (yet is pretty thrifty), the SensoTouch 3D does everything I hoped it would and I&#x27;m very glad I spent the extra money.  If you can afford one, it&#x27;s definitely a good investment.  If it&#x27;s as durable as my last Norelco, I won&#x27;t need another one until 2027!</li>
            <li> I used the \\&quot;old style\\&quot; Norelco for years. I also tried two other brands from time to time, always returning to the Norelco brand. Before this Senso Touch I used a Br.... for 18 months, until the trimmer fell of. It was replaced quickly at no cost, but in the mean time I purchased the Senso Touch.  I now use the Br... at my vacation home and the SensoTouch at home therefor I can compare the the two.  The SencoTouch is, by far, the best shaver I have used. It&#x27;s faster, causes less irritation and shaves closer than any of my previous shavers.  The only two things that I can criticize about the SensoTouch is the high cost of the replacement heads and the trimmer placement. The trimmer placement makes it hard to see what you are trimming.</li>
            <li> It does a very close shave quickly even if you have 3 or 4 days of thick stubble. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this a while ago. Haven&#x27;t had chance to rate this.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to give this a 5 star. The construction feel very solid and it does it&#x27;s job. Shave is easy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it went dead about 14 months after the purchase. Battery is completely dead and not able to charge.</li>
            <li> dont be put off by the price.  Excellent razor and very amazed by its quality shave.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a Christmas present. It&#x27;s my first electric razor, and I really love it. The GyroFlex 3D makes it easy to get all of the contours of your face. However, coming from using a traditional 5-blade razor, I can&#x27;t get a shave quite a smooth using the Norelco, even when shaving wet with shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just the fact of electric razors as a whole, but I kind of miss the feeling of a close shave.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware. Philips SensoTouch 3D razor keeps loosing battery time with each charge.  Starts out with 60 minutes and within 3-5 charges times starts to decrease. I have had the 1290x for less then 1 year and battery indicator now reads 35 minutes left. When razor is out of warranty is become useless.  Service will not do anything till battery indicator shows 23 minutes or less.  By that time it will be out of warranty. Will never buy a Philips Norelco razor again or recommend one to anybody.  Quality assurance people were to call me back on 2 occasions and never did. Words of caution Buyer Beware.  I had to rate razor for this review to post.  I rated it a 1 but in reality it should have a rating of useless.  it might make a nice decoration in a fish tank or as a paper weight. THIS REVIEW IS REGARDING THE SENSOTOUCH 1290X RAZOR NOT THE ONE SHOWN...</li>
            <li> Received this as an anniversary gift from my wife and this was the best close shave I ever got in my life. Its great for dry but i really do enjoy the wet shave as it gives a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;The first shave is always tricky since you have to follow a circular motion along the contours of the face. Once you are comfortable with the pattern you get the best smooth close shave feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair so I use the shaving foam to get a comfortable shave. I did try the dry shave option but owing to the hair thickness left me irritate for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I foam the face twice. Once for the regular shave and the second round for doing the getting around the remaining hair that was left behind. If you are using a shaving foam I would recommend running the blade under the faucet after a couple of strokes just like the regular razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to move in a circular fashion against the grain of your beard and try to stretch you neck against the direction you are shaving while shaving the neck hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might wonder that replacement blade is expensive around $50 on amazon but I have been using for 5 months and so far I have saved $20 on gillettes .</li>
            <li> I have, what was considered at the time, a high end Norelco razor (9160xl) which was in need of new heads (I replace about every 18 months).  The 9160 is 5 years old.  The battery life was OK, but was down to needing a charge every two weeks.  It shaves fine, just not fantastic, and the one nit I have is that if I go 3 days without shaving, it tugs and pulls vs lifts and cuts in spots.  I also have the luxury of a 15 year old in need of a razor, without the same \\&quot;refined\\&quot; criteria that I have.  I have another son, who was shaving with a very old speed xl razor that has no battery life left.  I needed at least two razors, so did considerable research based on the following criteria:  Shaver 1:  Need a good trimmer to allow a quick, but not perfect shave similar to a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow  Has to minimize razor burn and rash on the neck area, but has to get pesky sideways neck hair and the angles without a lot of work  Can&#x27;t shave too low - few spots prone to ingrown hairs when hair is yanked out or cut too low below the skin  Want a shave that is relatively close, and doesn&#x27;t take lots of additional clean up for missed areas  Shaver 2:  23 yr old son is prone to razor bumps - need to be able to minimize that  Has to be able to handle thick, tough beard and shave relatively close  Trimmer for sideburns and/or beard depending on his style of the week  And finally, something good enough to keep him from using razor number one...  I did significant research really trying to find something better than a Norelco.  I have had 3 and while all were good, was willing to look at much higher price if the performance was right.  Panasonic was not seriously considered, especially since I prefer a quick, dry shave, but I looked at it for my son.  Did not appear it was going to handle the razor bumps well, and may tap his patience when shaving wet.  Braun was next.  I really wanted to like the razor.  My research suggested it was a little more prone to complaints of razor burn, and it was not quite as good in the hard to reach areas of the neck. It also does not appear to be good for razor bumps. I checked out the Wahl offerings that are supposed to be much better for bumps, but decided not to go that route.  There were issues with quality that came up.  I was stuck taking a risk on the Norelco 3D for Razor number 1.  Managed to find it for $159 with a $30 rebate just before Christmas, so could not pass on the great deal.  I used it for the first time on the 26th - and promptly bought another one for my son, whose birthday was 2 days later (thanks Amazon Prime for the one day shipping rate).    There are a few differences between the old speed and smart touch xl razors compared to the 3D.  The heads - ultra cut and dual precision - the screen has a different design.  Yes it has triple cut action, but the inner and middle circles are very different, and it appears to make a huge difference in the shave.  It is much smoother.  I have tried to get this razor to tug after 3-4 days growth, but it just cuts right thru smooth and easy.  My 9160 had a good independent head system, but the 3d gyro is better.  Much more flexible and gets to all the places on my neck with relative ease.  I do not have to go over and over areas and contort to get a good shave.  Nor do I have to spend time tracking down stragglers. The trimmer is significantly smaller than any of the prior models.  However, it does a much better job.  It takes a few more strokes to cover the same area, but what it cuts, it cuts much closer and better than the other models.   In talking with my son, he cannot believe the shave he gets. His tough beard is shaved smooth, and more importantly, he has not had an issue with rash or razor bumps in 3 weeks.  I know my wife is tired of hearing from both of us how much we like our new razors, but we are still amazed at how much better the shaves are than what we thought was possible.  Find a deal, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the razor.  He is very pleased with how close it shaves wet or dry. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Well for those of you who have read my Phillips Sonic care review. Wake up all you Caveman. I would like to bring to your attention a couple of things. I am not a very hairy man. I can go without shaving 2-3 days. Not if I have an interview :) I have not tried any other electric shavers this is my first one after using a mach 3 for years. I got fed up with cutting myself and wanted an electric shaver. I usually try to buy the most expensive model but $250?! Out of my price range. When MasterCard had a $10 promo and there was a $30 discount coupon who can say no?! Keep in mind that razor blades are expensive. Well for the review.   I have only used the razor 5-7 times. I tried it on wet once. It&#x27;s a keeper!! no more razor cuts! It does get better with time. Well here is the Caveman motto again. No more shaving like a Caveman. If you don&#x27;t have an electric toothbrush just put both of them in your basket Like Now!  Dry Shave - Yes it takes time to get used to and you need to stretch your skin. The more you use it the better. Sometimes you need to go over your mustache area and you neck to get all the stubbles. It&#x27;s a close enough shave and does do the trick.   Wet Shave - Just as good. I would think it&#x27;s a bit quicker. I have only don&#x27;t it once but because its a closer shave I did have a little more razor burn. I am sure it&#x27;s because I still need to wait the 21 day period.   I am not sure if I should of gone for a more expensive model but this one is awesome. If you need to shave 1-2 times a day and your super hairy I might recommend the Jet Clean never used it but it looks cool!   I am trying to convince my brother to get one. Get one with the Philips coupon before they expire! Manual is for Caveman get into the 21st century. Worlds going to end this year :) Might as well enjoy how rich people shave and brush their teeth :)  Did you add it to your basket yet?!</li>
            <li> Had the shaver for about 2 weeks now and it works great. I love the fact that i can get out the shower, slap some shaving cream on and shave with the razor. It&#x27;s surprisingly very quiet and gives a very close shave. It looks cool and easy to clean too. I had problems with other electric razors not getting the hairs by my neck but this gets most of them, not all but most. I also have problems with ingrown hairs but razor still works good with that too. Recommended to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 27, 2012 UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m commenting on my own review to update somethings about the razor. I&#x27;ve now had it for about 5 months and it still is awesome. I specifically purchased the razor to wet shave with shaving cream and water because previous electric razors that require you to dry dry irritated me. However, I dry shave with this razor numerous times and it still preform amazingly. Closes shave i&#x27;ve received with an electric razor and less irritations. I mention before in my original review that I get ingrown hairs but even dry shaving with the razor works well at around them and kinda prevent them from occur. Still the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. Just wanted to update that.</li>
            <li> The ability to shave wet makes this my best shaver I have ever owned.  Norelco has been my choice for over 50 yrs and has always met my expectations.  Each model provides improvements.</li>
            <li> This is one awsome razor. I have suffered with razor burn for many years untill I got this.  It&#x27;s great I highly recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver daily for about 6 months and it has yet to disappoint me. The first month of use was somewhat frustrating as you have to \\&quot;train\\&quot; your hairs to use an electric shaver versus a regular razor. During this period you will have to go over the same spot several times, and even then there will be patches that will get missed, and require you to go over with a manual shaver. After this \\&quot;training\\&quot; period it works very well. There are still a few times if I do not shave in a day or two and have longer hairs that I will have patches that do not get cut. I have found that using this as a wet shaver (which is a nice feature) works better for me than it does as a dry shaver. This keeps the hairs from falling out of the shaver as some have complained about. To me this is a design feature that is both convenient and inconvenient. It will not hold the hairs in the head, which will keep it from clogging up and extends the life of the razor. On the flip side, this can cause a bit of a mess. It&#x27;s a bit of a trade off to me, and is why I prefer using it as a wet shaver. The stand is a bit unbalanced, but does not take up a lot of real estate on your counter top either. Again, this is a trade off. The carrying case is a nice bonus, however if you are going on an extended trip, it is a hassle to have to take the base along with you (but at least it will not take up too much room in your luggage). Overall I have found this to be a good product. It is not perfect, but sometimes you can&#x27;t have your cake and eat it too.</li>
            <li> I paid a lot for this hoping for a good Razor! Wasted money! I should have bought a bag of BIC RAZORS it would have did just as good! It hurts my face just the same way!&lt;br /&gt;The trimer makes a lot of banging noises! And it does not work very well. And with three cutting heads i can only use one because unless you push hard they don&#x27;t seem to cut. And if you push to hard it hurts your face. I tried to use all three but i was running out of time. In the end i end up using my razor to finish what the shaver can&#x27;t do!  If anyone has the same problem you have 45 days to get your money back. and pass it on! 160.00 for what?</li>
            <li> I admit I was sceptical, but this razor has changed my mind. I thought I&#x27;d never be able to get a &#x27;close&#x27; shave without the penalty of razor burns. I like the idea of an electric razor, but enjoy a wet shave. Problem areas for me is my neck line under either side of my jaw line. I had a 2 day growth when I tried my new Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, wet shave, and I just could not believe when I was done, my face didn&#x27;t hurt, wasn&#x27;t red and beat-up, I missed a couple spots but my problem areas without extra effort was smoother than I had ever been able to get it with any other type of razor. I purposfully didn&#x27;t concentrate on any one part of my face while shaving. I am sure as I continue using this razor the shaves will continually get better, as for now, I&#x27;m so happy with these results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco razors going back over 30 years and this is the best one yet. Compared to my Arcitec it gives a quieter and more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is only the second i have ever owned.  The other one was in my teens and it was a very cheap model given to me by my parents.  This razor works excellently.  The only thing I could complain about and the reason I have gone with 4 stars instead of 5 is simply because it can take a bit of time to get some of the more stubborn hairs gone.  Otherwise, excellent.</li>
            <li> There is NOT, a better razor on the PLANET....</li>
            <li> I have always used Norelco razors and usually love them.  They provide clean/close shaves.  I thought be upgrading to a more expensive model with my next one it would work even better....well it doesn&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave and it is shaped in such a way that you can&#x27;t hit all spots of your face evenly.  Disappointed that I wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> OK, hello..!? it would have been 5 stars but for what follows....&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased this in may 2011 to replace the braun 8000 (or whatever, i can look if anyone really cares) because the braun was really tearing my face up after several years.. it has/had a relatively new cutter foil and block and i run the cleaning cycle every use..&lt;br /&gt;it took a month (as stated in the manual) for my face to get used to this philips razor but once my face and beard became accustomed to it, it worked fine.. quiet and small..&lt;br /&gt;then last sunday BAM! DOA.. nothing.. won&#x27;t turn on.. ok, i meter the charger and its producing about 16 VDC as required..&lt;br /&gt;so i telephoned the philips customer support telephone number and after a few questions the person tells me that i should NOT leave it in the charger when i am not using it..! HUH..!? leaving it in the charger, she says, will destroy the battery.. HUH again..?! BUT the lady is kind enough to say she will ship a replacement out (7 to 10 days) from someplace in ohio and that when i get it i need to return the dead \\&quot;handle\\&quot;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, i suppose the point here is this thing about the battery not being able to take being in the charger.. i guess i&#x27;m supposed to lay it on its side and only charge it when it needs it..? Come ON philips/Norelco, smart battery charging technology is all OVER the place.. for this expensive razor they can at least have a smart charger that stops charging when the battery is fully charged..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, i await the replacement (7 to 10 business days) with a fuzzy face or a torn up face (from using the braun).. seven to ten days.. UPS ground from ohiop should take no more than 3 days MAX..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add here that a funny thing happened on the way to bed monday night.. my philips sonicare toothbrush (about 6 months old) followed the razor into failure mode but this charger is not stupid, its smart and the toothbrush still runs but does not vibrate.. philips seems to have good customer care (same story about a replacement as the razor, 7 to 10 business days!) but at least there is no aggument.. this time i bought a spare sonicare toothbrush.. you know the old line about the \\&quot;heir and a spare\\&quot;..  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: (may 28, 2014) Hello Philips..? yes, your razor has died again..! whats that..? you say its out of warranty..?! oh.. Damn..&lt;br /&gt;so, now what, dead razor and i really need to shave.. well, out comes that old braun shaver and WOW, it still holds a charge and still works..&lt;br /&gt;after a half hour on the telephone with American Express who give an additional year of warranty on anything purchased WITH your Amex card they (amex) says they&#x27;ll consider the claim and let me know in a day or so..&lt;br /&gt;so, off i go to this amazon site again and buy another philips razor (prime will get it to me wednesday) and i&#x27;ll wait to see if amex credits my card account with the cost of the last flaky philips triple wammy superdooper self cleaning razor (again, i must be a masochist!)..&lt;br /&gt;the only good thing about these philips-norelco razors is they give a really excellent shave..&lt;br /&gt;so, dear prospective customers, its up to you whether you want to rely on an unreliable razor (and toothbrush) that is, well, unreliable or opt for some other brand that might be MORE reliable.. you pay your money and you take your chances..&lt;br /&gt;for myself, i will keep my old reliable braun self cleaning razor for that time the philips norelco razor craps out and given its history, it will do so with sad regularity..</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. I was so sick of shaving with a blade and shaving cream so I started researching the top electric shavers. I had no had good experiences in the past with electric shavers but I thought if I spent some extra money and got a better one that it would pay off. I&#x27;m sad to say that I see little difference between this shaver and the cheaper one&#x27;s I used years ago. I&#x27;ve been using this now for a year and a half andit just simply is nowhere near the closeness of a shave I get with a regular razor. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be the same, but I expected it to be better than it is for the price I paid. Oh well. I&#x27;ll keep using it for the convenience, but am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun 790cc thinking it was the best on the market. You see, I&#x27;ve used blades for years but hate the amount of time it adds to my morning grooming. So my search for the best electric razor began. After getting the braun home I was in love with its build quality. You would think this was made by Apple it is so sturdy. Unfortunately, after my first shave with my new shiny razor I wasn&#x27;t too impressed. The cheeks and mandible was acceptable but my neck was really not good at all. After a week of shaving I had got better with controlling the razor but shaving took quite a while and I would need to make several passes to get all the stubble, and still there was some left on my neck that I would quickly clean up with my fusion proglide.    Just for kicks I went out and bought the Norelco sensotouch 3d to compare and the results are interesting. First, the sensotouch is much easier to shave with since it conforms to your face as you move it from one part to the next and it takes fewer passes through the same area to get a clean shave thus greatly reducing the amount of time it takes to shave. (Quite honestly, I spend at most 1/2 the time shaving with the sensotouch as with the series 7) It doesn&#x27;t shave as comfortably as the series 7 but I would hardly say it was uncomfortable and I experienced no irritation or redness.    I really wanted to love the series 7, thats why I bought it first; but in the end, for the money, the Norelco sensotouch 3d does win out. The shave was just as close if not closer, easier, quieter, and faster.     Thanks Norelco</li>
            <li> this is a very eye catching, light in weight and smooth to use shaver. it provides very close shaves especially with shaving foam. it charges fast and has a reliable charge indicator. the only drawbacks i found are the blades are not close enough to the edge (like my old 7775X) to trim off the hairs near the nose. also the three heads have to be individually opened for cleaning. though this is no biggie. overall a pretty good shaver. im glad i didnt spend the extra 100 for the bells and whistles of the advanced model.</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco over the past 15 years.  Loved my first one, second one didn&#x27;t hold up as well but this one just blows them all away.  Best shave ever.  Super close, zero irritation.  Excellent device.  Just love it. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for years but this is the best  so far.  Very smooth and close shave each time.  only negative so far is the high cost of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Back to the clean-shaven look after 10 years of sporting a beard, so i haven&#x27;t used one of these in a while.  I was pleased with how quick (very important to me - no need to go over a spot a hundred times; no stray hairs), comfortable, and close the shave was.  No irritation at all.  It is much better than the old Norelcos i used to use. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So I have always shaved with a razor. However, I hate to shave because of the time, mess and overall discomfort. My beard grows in all different directions, and shaving with a manual razor requires more than one pass in different directions to obtain the perfect shave. This however, leads to irritation, and frequent cuts around my jaw line.     My dad and father in law told me to get an electric and I finally listened. Fueled by the lore of saving money in the long run over pricey Gillette blades, I broke down and bought this pretty expensive razor. My first experienced was surprising. I had a week&#x27;s growth and decided to try it without trimming it down. It not only cut it, but it was a VERY close shave and no irritation. I could have not been more surprised. The next few shaves gave me some pretty good razor burn, but I attributed this to my face not being used to it.     I stuck with it, and a month later... I will never go back to a manual razor. This razor cuts perfect, close and with no irritation. I used to hate shaving, and would go with a stubble beard most of the week just because of that reason. Now I shave everyday, and don&#x27;t mind it at all. My only regret is not listening to my dad 10 years ago. Well in my defense, I am sure the razors 10 years ago were not as good as this one. At least that makes me feel better about being an idiot.     Great razor...totally shocked by how great.</li>
            <li> I use this razor daily, overall I&#x27;m happy with it with some limitations. It is expensive but I felt there would be a payback over buying blades. That&#x27;s were my problem comes in, first it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, second it can burn or pinch my neck. So I end up using a blade at least once a week which keeps that expense. Next Norelco recommends changing the heads once a year,the razor lets you know it&#x27;s time. These heads cost over $50.</li>
            <li> To let you know about my beard and skin I am a white 65 year old with a heavy tough beard. This Norelco beats the best Braun which could not shave me at all. I had been using the Panasonic ESLA 63 for years. Since the replacement foil for the 63 would not fit into the Razor I had to look for another brand. I use both shavers wet with G.... P.... G.... gell.&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco is as extraordinarily close as the Panasonic. The Norelco is quieter and more comfortable as the 63 while shaving my beard much faster. The replacement cutters are also more easily available than those for the Panasonic. One of my biggest complaints about the Panasonic was that the head lock mechanism broke easily after a couple of months. I forsee no such design problems with the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am more pleased with the Norelco than any shaver I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun for several years and thought it worked well.  Lately it just didn&#x27;t seem to be doing the job.  It was probably time to replace the heads and I was out of cleaning fluid so I decided to go ahead and try something else.  I&#x27;ve been using this guy now for a month and can&#x27;t say how much of an improvement it is over the Braun.  Better shave, quieter, and definitely more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of guys, I was at first hesitant to move from blades to electric, but was looking for better solution than scraping my face with sharp steel every day, so eventually decided to \\&quot;try\\&quot; an electric face mower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was perhaps 10 years ago, and since then I have owned several Braun and Remington varieties.  When it came time to replace my latest Lawnboy, I decided to take a closer look at the higher end offerings.  I was hoping to get something that provided a smoother, more comfortable shave.  Efficiency, ergonomics and any bells / whistles would be nice benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was tough making the leap to the higher price points, but the reviews strongly favored going for something like this Norelco, so I pulled the trigger and purchased the 1250X from Amazon.  In the worst case - I figured - If it didn&#x27;t live up, I could simply return it and get another $50 something or other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the Norelco, I charged it up and the next day took it for its first test drive.  WOW, what a pleasant surprise and experience.  It was like the first time behind the wheel of a well crafted sorts car after spending a lifetime driving cheap sedans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is very comfortable in the hand, light and easy to maneuver.  Most importantly, the shave is close, fast and remarkably smooth.  With this Norelco, there isn&#x27;t the tugging and pulling that&#x27;s typical of the lower priced models (even when they are new).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, there is virtually no irritation.  For those who have used other models, you know that it typically takes several passes to get the shave you want.  Not so here.  Even the difficult areas are clean with just a couple of passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need for earplugs.  For those of you accustomed to the jet engine roar of other models, you may enjoy getting fooled into thinking that the battery charge on this Norelco was dying, like I&#x27;ve been several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, we guys have to struggle with shaving nearly every day - don&#x27;t skimp out.  Super quiet, a surprisingly smooth, close shave, comfortable and efficient, this product is true winner and well worth the extra dollars to own it.  I wish I&#x27;d gotten one a lot sooner.risingly smooth, close shave, comfortable and efficient, this product is true winner and well worth the extra dollars to own it.   I wish I&#x27;d gotten one a lot sooner.</li>
            <li> I love reading product reviews.  A few of them are really helpful, many of them are just amusing.  If you want an electric shaver that gives an extremely comfortable, close shave, this is the one.  I&#x27;m not going to get into the discussion about electric versus blades; I&#x27;ve given enough blood in my time, thank you very much.  I have used an electric razor exclusively for many years, and have tried many.  This Norelco is the best I have ever used.    Some reviewers complained that you have to clean the razor too frequently.  You can either brush out the shaving chambers or rinse them under water.  This takes about 30 seconds.  If you want a shaver that you have to clean less frequently, but that gives an inferior shave, there are plenty of them on the market.    Many reviewers complained about the trimmer.  I wonder exactly what they are expecting to do with the trimmer on an electric razor.  The trimmer will even up your sideburns and trim the bottom edge of a mustache.  I doubt very much that it was ever intended to replace a beard and mustache trimmer, which is a completely different grooming tool.  And I love the way the trimmer slides out with the push of a lever.  Some of the older Norelco razors had a spring-loaded trimmer that could pop up at inappropriate times if you touched the release just right.  I think this one is a big improvement in that regard.</li>
            <li> Mistake to have gotten, the replacement blades I would give a -5 if it were available.  They pull do not cut well and make you want to go back to shaving cream and razor</li>
            <li> I haved used this shaver for about alittle over a month&amp;ahalf &amp;i find it a GREAT SHAVER THAN ALL THE OTHERS THAT I HAVED HAD I WOULD RECMONED THIS SHAVER TO ANY ONE bestSHAVER I HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME PATCHMAN.p&gt;s&gt; I GOT SHAVER AT amazon.COM SAVED A LOT OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> This product is not the quality I expected from Norelco.  The shave quality is poor and the pop up trimmer is joke.  There are much better choices then this.</li>
            <li> I had a 10 year old Norelco (6705x), which was pretty decent in and of itself. I was pleasantly surprised to start shaving with this new Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;- I have sensitive skin and it irritates easily, that&#x27;s the reason I moved to electric shavers in the first place. This Norelco is smoother and easier on the skin than the previous version I had (10 years old). To put a number, I think it&#x27;s about 30-40% better in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;- I think it&#x27;s about the same in closeness - I have generally found electric shavers to offer closer shaves than regular blades, but that may be just dependent on how I use electric blades.&lt;br /&gt;- It offers better coverage. Previously, there would small (very small) patches of areas that would remain unshaven and I would have give some final touches with a blade. That&#x27;s much less the case with the new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;- Love the in-build trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;- Battery live is pretty good - you can probably get 10+ shaves in before having to re-charge.</li>
            <li> I own this electric razor, but was a die-hard fan of blade shaving most of my life. Blade-shaving still gives the best shave, in my opinion. However, there&#x27;s a lot to be said for not having to use shaving cream, and being in a hurry, and not having to worry about cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first 9 months with this electric were frustrating. The shave was not nearly as good as a blade -- and if I missed two days without shaving it seemed to NEVER really get rid of the growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one day, it occurred to me to try a different technique. With a blade razor, you get used to making straight strokes -- whether up or down, or sideways. Always straight strokes. The first instinct with this electric is to do the same thing. But it doesn&#x27;t really work for me. You think \\&quot;Well, all three heads are rotating, so there&#x27;s no need to do anything else... right?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried moving the shaver in small circles while using it -- and it made all the difference in the world! For whatever reason, it works great using this technique. It does a closer and faster shave. You should try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be nmentioned in the Owner&#x27;s Manual -- but who has time to read THOSE?  8-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 Stars are only because this will never be as close as a blade razor. But it&#x27;ll do!</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent. It delivers a close shave, is very quiet and best of all was about half the price that I would have to pay for the same product in New Zealand.</li>
            <li> This all black model has the nicest, cleanest aesthetic of all the Norelco higher end models. So many of their models have two toned designs that just look cheap. The shaver works fine, but no better, faster, or closer than the 8 year old $40 dollar model that it replaced. I&#x27;m not sure why these higher end models cost so much. There are also a few flaws with this model that are annoying when shaving. First, the surface around the heads extends out farther than on the cheaper models which means that you can&#x27;t get the blades to cut as close to your nose and ears. Second, the width of the slide up trimmer is narrower than on the older and cheaper models, which makes sideburns harder to trim straight, Third, the ergonomics of the long pointy handle feels awkward. I prefer the shape of the smaller rounder Norelcos, even though I have large hands. Fourth, the instructions states that your beard will adapt to the heads over 21 days which will lead to a closer shave. I have not noticed any improvement. It was reasonably close from the start and has remained so for me. Shaving time started out a bit slow and remained so..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have complained about the flimsy charging stand. It&#x27;s not really as bad as I thought it would be. I just wish the cord wasn&#x27;t so springy. It makes it hard to pack in a travel case. You have to bring the stand when you travel. You can&#x27;t plug the cord directly into shaver as with the older models. This is a real drag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this shaver.  I still do from the standpoint of it&#x27;s aesthetics, but the shaving experience is a let down. I wish Norelco would do a major redesign on the functional aspects.</li>
            <li> Purchased phillips norelco before heading to Afghanistan for the second time the razor has held up through the entire deployment and still works great to this day!</li>
            <li> Excellent razor. Best and easiest shave I have had from an electric razor</li>
            <li> Dont buy this or any Norelco shaver.  Unless you see sense in spending more for future replacement heads than you did for the shaver.</li>
            <li> My wife got this for me for Christmas and it does a great job. The only issue that I had came when I tried to get replacement blades.  They cost nearly $200. I will be shopping for different razor with affordable replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Your comment is awaiting moderation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how good the 12xx series Norelco&#x27;s are, they are useless if they don&#x27;t work. Here&#x27;s the problem with these shavers. The charging stand was designed by an idiot. And, the razor cannot be charged without the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to a massive imbalance when sitting on the stand, the stand uses 3 suction cups to hold it to whatever (very smooth) surface it&#x27;s sitting on. Surrounding the suction cups are three moulded in plastic tabs that do a superb job of preventing the cups from adhering to anything. The shaver is held on the stand by two weak magnets that barely can hold it in place on a completely level surface let alone take even the slightest brush of a hand or towel passing by. The wiz kids at Philips need to take physics 101 and learn a bit more about something called gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More; the stand is really flimsy. If you plan on traveling with it, protect it well. With no protection, the stand is about the same envelope as the shaver and, yet another part, the charger combined. If that&#x27;s not acceptable, understand you can&#x27;t charge this shaver without it&#x27;s stand. If it is acceptable, protect the stand well as it&#x27;s delicate, bulky and required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco did do a fine job of designing the stand in a manner that the shaver will slide through a hole in the bottom of the stand and be cradled very nicely. However, now it won&#x27;t fit in it&#x27;s pouch nor make contact with the charging nubs. I have no idea why this was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 1250x. The first two times I charged it on a perfectly level granite counter, it fell off. It was returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three reasons not to buy this product. 1), the stand is very poorly designed to the point of being useless. 2), the battery life is almost half what older Norelco&#x27;s were. 3), any company who displays the design incompetence embodied in the stand does not merit anyone&#x27;s business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never used the shaver, it was returned before I could get a charge on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion Philips, look at an iPhone.  They are not that rare and you can probably find one in your employee pool.  If you don&#x27;t, it may say something about the people designing your products.efore I could get a charge on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion Philips, look at an iPhone.  They are not that rare and you can probably find one in your employee pool.  If you don&#x27;t, it may say something about the people designing your products.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips shavers for years, this is without doubt their best yet, it is as close as a razor without the burn.    I have sensitive skin, and this razor suits me perfectly.    The only down side is the trimmer, it is too small, the shaving heads get in the way.    Cheers    Chickenman</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun shaver for about 3 yrs.  The price of the cleaning refills was getting rediculous.  I decided to go back to a rotary style and I am very happy I did.  It took about 3 days for my face to acclimate to the change but once it did, I was very impressed.  The shave is cleaner and quicker.  The most amazing thing to me is the noise level, or better stated the lack of noise.  You almost aren&#x27;t sure if it is running at full speed but it is.  Very easy to clean under the tap by flipping up the three heads, then shake the water out and put it on the charger.     I looked at the cost of replacing the head on the Braun and the ongoing cost of cleaner cartidges and figured it would pay for itself in 9 - 11 months of use.  The Braun was not a bad shaver, just nothing better to justify the ongoing costs.</li>
            <li> First I tried the Philips Norelco 8240 shaver when my old electric gave out, but couldn&#x27;t stand how it pulled long stubble that had grown after the last shave a few days earlier.  Very painful.  Perhaps it would have been fine if I shaved every day with out fail, but there are always going to be times when I skip a day or two.      I returned the 8240 under Philips generous 45-day return policy and bought the 1250x/40 despite the big price difference.  I would not give it a perfect score on long stubble as it takes a while to get all the whiskers mowed down and still pulls a few,  but it was far superior compared to any electric I&#x27;ve previously owned and left my face relatively irritation free.  I would definitely say the 1250x is worth the price difference based on its ability to competently handle long stubble alone.</li>
            <li> i read in the other reviews that someone went to walmart and they had some type of clearance on the item.  Well i went to my local walmart and they had it for $99, so i bought it right away. I even checked online first to see if they had it in stock and on walmart site it said same price here ($163.99) but in store it was only $99. So i advise go to walmart and see if its on sale    Ive only had it for 24hours so i guess i&#x27;ll come back later for a full review,but so far so good, seems to cut real close. i had the norelco arcitec previously</li>
            <li> As a mature male, I&#x27;ve become accustomed to a \\&quot;style\\&quot; of shaving and have been using various electric shavers for over twenty years.  I generally replace them every four or five years (shaving heads more often)and recently replaced my 5-year-old Philips Norelco.  WOW!&lt;br /&gt;* Sound level: GONE is the loud buzzing noise that I thought was a part of the shave; the only sound is a relatively soft whirr. (I think the heads may be turning much faster.)&lt;br /&gt;* Facial Contour: This just \\&quot;glides\\&quot; over the cheeks, turns the corners under the chin and around the nose.  And, the more sensitive parts never feel as if they have been \\&quot;sandpapered\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;* Weight: Feels like a feather in the hand -- and across the face.&lt;br /&gt;* Charge: An hour or so of recharge seems to last 3 - 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a nice travel pouch and stylish holder/recharging stand.[[ASIN:B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed AND delighted.</li>
            <li> I have owned several Norelco electric razors over the past forty years and all have been pleased with all of them.  I was considering the purchase of a new razor when I saw a consumer review on the evening news where they rated this razor the best of the group they tested.  I have used this razor for more than a month now and am very satisfied with it and the shave it gives.  The design is some different than my previous ones, but easy to adapt to.  The clean up process is quick and easy.  I would recommend this razor to others.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: My previous review is below, but i&#x27;ve since returned this product due to it&#x27;s design flaws.  Probably the most frustrating thing is the fact that you can&#x27;t get through one, or maybe two, shaves before hair dust is spilling out all over your shirt.  It seems to be due to the small compartments that hold the hair and the large slot openings in the blades.  My old norelco didn&#x27;t have this problem; if hair ever came out (rarely) it was because i&#x27;d gone over a week without emptying it, but at least it holds a weeks worth!  My conclusion was that although the shave is great, it&#x27;s not that much better than my old norelco, and the frustrations aren&#x27;t worth the cost of this expensive shaver.    This shaver is great!  It&#x27;s much better than the Braun Series 7 - 720S which I tried first but returned.  The Norelco is a much closer shave and it gets odd hairs around the neck line with ease.  It&#x27;s very quiet and feels good on the face.  The Pros: it meets all the claims it makes in the product description.  The cons: the flip-up trimmer is not as good as older Norelco shavers; there are 3 seperate compartments that capture hair and it fills up quickly, requiring emptying about every day; my major complaint is that it requires use of the charging stand and does not plug in directly, which sucks for traveling.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry shaving? Wet shaving (with shaving gel) is better with this shaver. You get wonderful clean and soft skin. Additionally, the shaver really noiseless which is good especially at morning.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for the past 20 years or so. This new Norelco shaver is amazingly quiet but gives me a very close and comfortable shave.  I&#x27;m not sure I like the little stand that comes with it, but it&#x27;s necessary to use it in order to keep the charge level up.  It is still very easy to clean--a very nice gift for that guy!</li>
            <li> Very good, very like, the next opportunity will come to buy! Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Very good, very like, the next opportunity will come to buy! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I google best norelco and this what came up. Google was right.</li>
            <li> fancy looks doesn&#x27;t make it a better shaver than old style ones. the older models actually are better in my book and cheaper!</li>
            <li> Great razor. Nice long charge and does trick on short notice. Not as good as a blade but good enough</li>
            <li> great shave but very expensive razor</li>
            <li> Just a tad disappointed.  It does the job but doesn&#x27;t shave as well as my older Norelco Quadra Action.  It is considerably more silent running.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the coolest looking crappy shavers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the is the small trimmer that you push out will take you like 45 minutes to cut your facial hair (and I have very light facial hair, and never thick). In order for it to cut well you have to go REALLY slow and that takes forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, that &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; idea where the neck bends in every which way sounds good in theory but has absolutely no benefit whatsoever.  I feel like nothing has changed between my old philips (10 years old) and this one in terms of cutting ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about this shaver is the easy cleaning unfolding piece for the razor and the battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not worth your 150 $.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Well after using this product for a couple months I fear it will get stuck in the drawer with the rest of the experiments.  Always like a dummy the grass is greener on the other side of the fence, so surely a more costly razor must certainly work better than the economical throw away Remington razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well not so, unless you shave each day with this one it has a rough time if you decide to be a unshaven slob for a day. Such as when you get up Sunday morning you decide not to shave.  Boy come Monday morning it simply has a really hard time giving a shave and this is not really excessive growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So back to the ole Remington that is the workhorse of them all, and mows the lawn with ease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric razors for many years. This new one is great, as it provides a thorough shave, is quiet, easy to clean, and shows how much charge you have left.</li>
            <li> Great shave!  And a quality product.  Easy to use, clean and charge.  I now use my electric razor more than my safety razor.  If it lasts as long as my prior Norelco, over 20 years, the price will have been cheap.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of norelco 1250. This is the best shave I ever got with an electric. I have it almost a year to the day. I had to recharge the battery. It would not work. I called Norelco and they determined it was the shaver. They told me that they would send me the bottom of the razor.  I thought that was OK. To my surprise I received a new razor in a couple of days. I really love this razor. If I have the same problem again, I will have to look at other brands. This is a high end razor and is far from cheap. I think the selling point was that it was made  in the NETHERLANDS.  Hmm I wonder. They were out of stock on the bottom of the razor. I assume that a lot of people were having the same problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I got suckered into buying another Norelco rotary razor.  It looked so sleek and had great reviews, but this electric razor gave me a terrible shave.  I have used electric razors most of my adult life to shave.  My best were the Wahl until they stopped making it... then I used the Panasonic razors.  I used this razor for three weeks and am now returning it for a refund.  After I would shave I kept feeling stuble all day long.  There did not seem to be one part of my face that got fully shaved.  Near my sideburns and nose, these rotary razors cannot shave at all.  I tried to clean it up with the pop-out shaver, but I feel like I am growing a full mustache just under my nose, and my sideburns are all uneven.  The pros of this razor is that it is extremely quiet, and feels smooth on your sking.  But given the fact that it doesn&#x27;t shave your face, these two pros hardly matter.  I will buy the latest Panasonic... hopefully, it works like the previous Panasonics.  I will never buy another Philips Norelco again.</li>
            <li> I am a previous die-hard \\&quot;scraper razor\\&quot; guy with a very heavy beard.  I had tried some electric razors in the past with terrible results; usually significant razor burns and excess stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last several months I seemed to have developed a skin allergy to the lubricating pad now found on most manual razors.  It was getting to the point of considering a beard of which I am not a fan (for myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about this razor and decided to give it a try.  I have been using it about 6 weeks.  I had read in some other reviews that you need to give your skin a few weeks to get used to a new way of shaving.  I had some mild discomfort for the first two shaves and none since.  I use it every day and it has been a delight and pleasure to use with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not shave quite as close as a manual razor but way more than adequate.  My wife says she cannot tell the difference.  The difference to me is that my skin is no longer breaking out and painful.  I never have a razor cut and it is very easy to use.  Have tried both wet and dry but use dry about 90% of the time.  It has been a great investment.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, it had a card in the package that said if you order on line you would get a extra 6 months of warranty.  I did this and received an E-Mail saying so and a special code that I could order supplies for my shaver on line for a 10% discount.  I found the item from the parts lists and it said it didn&#x27;t exists.  I called the company and the sent me to another web site were I found it but it didn&#x27;t show any place where to enter my special code.  I called that company and they said I would have to order from the other company.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what Phillips Norelco is up to!</li>
            <li> This razor makes shaving a pleasure! I would recommend it whole heartedly to anyone one who needs a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This is an update of a review I wrote a few days ago. I&#x27;ve now had the shaver two weeks and am convinced there is nothing better available. If you shave against the grain with a blade, a light touch, and good beard prep, you may get closer, but at the cost of considerably more irritation. I have a $100 Panasonic foil-type razor, and there&#x27;s no comparison between that and the Philips Norelco 3d. The Norelco bests it in every way except for the electronic display and battery life, which are superior on the Panasonic. But the Norelco gives a closer, more comfortable shave by far.  I recommend shaving dry, not only for convenience, but it seems to result in a better shave. In three minutes you get a good shave; if you take added time, you can get a perfect shave. I find shaving relaxing, so if I&#x27;m not in a hurry, I&#x27;ll just chill out and shave till I have a smooth, uniform shave. I&#x27;m still astonished by how well this thing shaves dry. The trick is to run it over the skin just firmly enough that there is no stretching or movement. Unlike with other electrics, there&#x27;s no need to stretch the skin manually. Using circles, find the areas which still have stubble and use circles of different sizes and directions. You will feel it bite the stubble and remove it; I achieve better results without a mirror because I concentrate on the feel. It even does a good job with flat hairs lying on the neck, though extra caution is called for in this area. My skin is fairly sensitive, and any minor redness subsides in a few minutes with no additional treatment.    It&#x27;s easy to clean -- don&#x27;t waste your money on the fancy cleaner. I&#x27;d like a display that tells me more clearly how much battery life is remaining, but perhaps the marketing department at Philips Norelco needed a way to disaggregate their product line and charge more on the high end. Such is life on the razor&#x27;s edge. If you want an electric razor, just buy this thing. It rules.</li>
            <li> Shave is less close than older, standard model. This unit looks cool, the charging stand and battery life is great, it cleans easily. There is only one problem. It does not shave as close as the old traditional Speed XL type. Quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> Purchase this late July 2011 only to find out a few days ago the unit will not turn on.. after searching the web I found many users that had the same issues. So looks like its a common problem for these just to STOP working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only if i had found that info 5months ago i would of went with something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, since i am a international buyer this was not covered under warranty here and amazon kept pushing i try contact philips in Australia but Philips/norelco kept pushing to try get a replacement done via amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multiple emails later i got nothing and ended up with one expensive dead shaver. It cost me about $179+ around $30 DHL priority shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i went with the pull it apart and hope its a dead battery DIY home job. To cut this short i sourced a battery online only for $15 to find out it was not a battery issue after all but something else had failed within the shaver so i smashed it to bits and it went into the bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last time i purchase another Philips Norelco product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;product i purchase was the [[ASIN:B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]</li>
            <li> First, the razor works well.  I have been a Norelco user for about 15 years.  They keep getting better. This one is better than either of the two other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had.  Not only do I my face but I keep going and shave my head with the razor.  It hardly feels like you&#x27;re shaving.    The charging stand sucks.  I give it 1 star because it does charge the razor.  I travel a lot and most times its for two weeks or more.  What a pain to have to take the whole stand on a trip, especially when you want to pack light and not to pay for extra baggage charges.  Every inch of space counts.  The design engineers had their heads way up in the dark on this one.  A simple U shaped cradle with a flat bottom that can sit flat on any surface would be better.      Back to the razor, I thought the 3 separate heads would be a pain to clean, but I was wrong.  It is actually easier to clean than any of my earlier Norelco razors.  You just flip them open shake and rinse.  Something I didn&#x27;t used to do with my other razors because I thought what the heck there was a big holding area there so who needs to clean it every time.  This one cleans in 10 seconds if that and just lay it down on the trimmer edge with the heads popped open and it dries in no time.    My recommendation is BUY this razor and put up with the charger until they make a more compact or travel charger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve traditionally been more of a regular Gillette Mach 3 Turbo kinda guy, but the idea of an electric razor has always appealed to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the quality, if I shave somewhat regularly, this razor does do a decent job, though it takes longer than traditional shaving as I do have to go over the same areas multiple times and that can leave your skin irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For precision trimming of areas like sideburns, there is a retractable electric razor on the backside that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this razor works on dry or wet skin is also a nice bonus. I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that the \\&quot;3D\\&quot; aspect and benefit of having razor heads that can move in three different directions is entirely beneficial, although it did make shaving around my chin a bit easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular model is a great value. The more expensive model just features a different finish and LED on the front and an automated cleaning apparatus, which is a bit overkill when you can just run this razor under the faucet. Overall, this razor does a good job, but I won&#x27;t be giving up my traditional Mach 3 anytime soon.</li>
            <li> In spite of the hype I would say this shaver shaves as well as or very slightly better than my old Norelco does with new cutters installed, certainly not enough better to justify the much higher price.  For previous Norelco users there are a few surprises.  To open the cutter heads for cleaning, the 3 heads open individually instead of all 3 at once.  To charge the shaver it must be mounted in the stand.  The power plug only plugs into the stand, it doesn&#x27;t fit the shaver socket, that plugs into the stand.  If you plan to travel, the stand and charger do not fit into the shaver case, you have to pack them separately. To see the charge level indicator, you have to look fast when you turn the shaver off, and not in a bright light.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. I bought it for a Christmas gift for my husband and he loves it. Gets a very close smooth shave!!!</li>
            <li> What can I say? By far the best razor I have ever owned. It does what it is supposed to and more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for just a month now and really loving the results.  I went from a 15 minute shave and razor burn at the base of my neck with my old Norelco (4 years old) to just about a 3 - 4 minutes with this new 3D.  And I have not had any trouble with razor burn!  I really hope the results continue like this.  I went from a Norelco to this new Norelco so did not suffer any period getting used to the blades.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it won&#x27;t shave with the cord in a pinch, it has to be charged to use it.</li>
            <li> OK... I have used Norelco Shavers for years... actually worn out a few... the last one (8420 if I remember correct) was the wet/dry shaver about 5 years old and it finally gave up on me could not keep it charged. I have been using a blade for the past month as I researched shavers, not willing to shoot out $200.00 right away. I few days ago I bought a 1250 3d (on sale 148.00, glad I waited) and shaved with it this morning... I know there is a time to get use to electric shavers but my neck felt right at home with this shaver, and I have just a slight bit of irritation, nothing like I had years ago trying to get use to the electric shaver I first had. This shaver is the best, smooth, clean shave, easy to use, after a few weeks I can give a better review, but I could not wait to get this out there. IF YOU ARE looking into an electric shaver THIS IS THE ONE. This is a great shaver, you will not be disappointed... I considered the 2d, but had to go with the 3d... thanks Norelco for another great shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 8/15/13&lt;br /&gt;Just had a problem with my shaver, stopped taking a charge. Just stopped Tuesday 8/13/13 and would not take a charge, so I contacted Norelco this morning, and with the Registration of the product they are sending me a new shaver body. It sure was painless, and easy to fix, should have my new shaver in 7 to 10 business days. I STILL think it is a great shaver, the way it shaves in really good and efficient. So for the next few days it is BACK to the BLADE... :-) Thanks Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/26/13&lt;br /&gt;Got my new shaver in about a week, brand new out of the box, works great. Trust this one will last past a year, we will see.</li>
            <li> Had the Norelco Arcitec from 2007 on. It broke after a little fall in the bathroom with the trimmer out.  Did some research in store and via sites like Amazon and found this gem. Amazing shave. The closest I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric. The 3D stuff seems so gimmicky, but something with the razor is definitely doing it right.</li>
            <li> This should not be listed under women&#x27;s razors.  It tore up my underarms, and every women&#x27;s electric razor I&#x27;ve had before was designed to do underarms as well as legs.  This is a man&#x27;s razor, and my husband is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> its alright except for the razor burn i&#x27;ve been getting. However it does say u have to get used to using it and your skin will become accustom to it. Also it leaves alot of hair no matter how many times i go over a certain spot it just doesnt get all the hair. Also if you have bought an electric shaver before youll probably already know this but if your new like me than you should know that electrics dont shave close to the skin at all. If you run your hand over your beard you can still feel alot of friction.  The pros are that it gives a nice looking shave on my face. all the problem starts at my neck re: razor burn, left over hair, stubble etc.</li>
            <li> Was a gift, use it everyday ,no problems</li>
            <li> Have used Philips products for years. Time for an upgrade and liked the reviews I had read about the Senso Touch, so I purchased one. I am not unhappy with my choice. Smooth shave in very little time with easy clean-up.</li>
            <li> Terrible terrible investment. Does not give even a half close shave compared to other shavers. Battery life is good but not a whole lot else. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to an enemy</li>
            <li> it is very easy to use and shaving is very clean. There is no doubt  that I suggest people to buy it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Norelco to replace an identical one I purchased two and a half years ago. For some reason that one stopped working. Then it started working again. I used that shaver in the shower and it was supposed to be waterproof. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t altogether waterproof, and moisture seeped in and corroded the contacts or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give the Norelco SensoTouch five stars but for that issue with my first one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Philips/Norelco shavers for years and finally upgraded to the latest 3D technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best technology for electric razors on the market.&lt;br /&gt;This model actually works both wet and dry but I prefer it dry otherwise I would just buy a regular razor. For that matter it does a wonderful job and it&#x27;s probably as close as you can get from an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Defintely recommend it for those who like electric razors as well as those who are still using traditional ones!</li>
            <li> Although I have used other Norelco shavers over the years, this shaver gives me the best shave I could ask and in less time than any shaver I have used.  I have experienced no skin irritation while shaving, and the shaver is very easy and quick to clean after shaving.  The manual is complete and easy to follow.  Fine product!</li>
            <li> Perfect to shave short beards. Not so good for long ones.&lt;br /&gt;Does not irritate the skin if used with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> As soon as I started using the shaver I noticed remnants of hair folicles all over.  Apparently the shaver head compartments are not sealed very well and the hair folicles seem to easily fall out.  This occurs when shaving or when the shaver is resting.</li>
            <li> This razor works well.  Easy to clean.  The grip is a little odd at first but you get used to it quickly.  Seems like it will hold a good charge for heavy beard daily use.  Trimmer is sub par and it does not capture the small fine hairs on the cheek along the beard line very well, but I still gave it 4 stars for the very close shave and ease of use around neck and under jaw areas.</li>
            <li> My skin has aged and become more sensitive.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s for decades.  I did research to learn about shavers for sensitive skin and this was my choice.  The price from Amazon was the best I saw.  I love it.  I wonder if it will last like my earlier Norelco&#x27;s since it seems more delicate.</li>
            <li> Razor does nice job! Very quiet! Good close shave. Glad I bought it. Wish you could just plug the cord directly into the razor to charge it so you would not need to pack the cradle when traveling.</li>
            <li> I find it is very nice. I buy it for a present to my husband. He like it. The package is ok, The speed is very quickly</li>
            <li> This thing worked great for a hot minute, then the battery died. Called customer service, they sent one right away, alright awesome. Then one of the flex heads popped out and tried multiple times to get it back in place. Would not go. Don&#x27;t waste your time. Norelco really designed an inferior product with this one.</li>
            <li> excellent product works flawlessly a great buy great price</li>
            <li> love it,  works wonderful.  no problem very easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;and have owned many.  would definetly recommend it thank you</li>
            <li> I USED IT FOR TWO TIMES.&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS GREAT AND THE FUNCTION IS PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU CAN CHOOSE IT,</li>
            <li> That last bit was sarcasm, since nobody needs an LCD battery meter and can clean their razor just fine with 10 seconds of running waster.  This can give you a quick painless shave, or if you stretch you skin and push aggressively, can get you as close as a blade.  If you get too aggressive you can get redness, but for normal use this is much more comfortable than blade shaving.  If you have the money, buy the best - no need to skimp on a daily thing like this.  It takes 2-4 weeks for your skin to adjust, so don&#x27;t return if the first few shaves feel strange or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Great shaver but it stops randomly.  We have to put it back on stand and then immediately take it off and it goes again.  That is a nuisance.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was getting tired of the disposable razors I&#x27;d been using, and wanted something that would give me a close shave without too much effort. Plus, I wanted a wet/dry razor so I could use my Jack Black Beard Lube. This had the best ratings for a wet/dry razor, so I went with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only shaved once with it so far, but it was very comfortable and far quieter than the Braun razor I used for many years, and gave me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend last Christmas after a particularly bad case of razor burn from one of his cheap, blunt disposable razors. He of course saw nothing wrong with this until he started using this electric razor. THE DIFFERENCE IS AMAZING. I had done a lot of research beforehand, and I know that electric razors normally don&#x27;t get as close a shave as a manual one but I am not kidding you, this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is well worth the money, my boyfriend LOVES it, uses it EVERYDAY and I have not seen any razor burn, bumps, nicks or cuts since he started using it. Just a silky smooth face. He says it is very comfortable to use, and the wet or dry function is pretty nifty too. It&#x27;s also super easy to clean (i didnt buy the one with the jet stream cleaning system as 1. too expensive and 2. come on, it takes 2 seconds to manually clean it).  Plus it looks pretty sleek and sexy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a purely functional point of view; you can depend on this razor to give you a brilliant, comfortable shave, every time. I guarantee it. As a daily-use razor it is definitely worth every single dollar!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great price. It was the perfect Christmas gift for my husband. He gets a super close shave- almost as good as using a blade!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tug when my scruff is long which is great. I love that it has an easy grip too.</li>
            <li> Good, close, shave wet or dry .&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean. Fast charging.. Light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a long time , nice charger stand.&lt;br /&gt;Shaver holds a great charge I have been keeping track and I have not had to recharge in 14 days!!!! and counting!!!</li>
            <li> Bottom-Line: On balance I am very disappointed in the \\&quot;SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver,\\&quot; so much so that I think I&#x27;ll be going back to the tried and true Advantage 7735X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have tried a number of razors--any number of traditional one-to-four blade straight (disposable) handles, as well as electric units from Remington and Norelco.  All of them irritate my skin to some degree and leave razor bumps (Black men are more susceptible to razor bumps than white men because of the course curly nature of our hair). Traditional razors tend to irritate my skin the most, and through experimentation over the years, I have found that Norelco brand razors tend to irritate my skin much less than all the others.  So, I have stuck with Norelco for the past fifteen years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, a \\&quot;SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver,\\&quot; by who else, Norelco fell into my hands and I put it to the test. Since I shave my head and face at least three times a week, it is important to me that any razor I use shave closely without, again, irritating my skin.  After several weeks of use I have been very disappointed in the \\&quot;SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver\\&quot; performance; after I shave my scalp is often dry and somewhat flaky in need of lotion, but no shaving bumps so that is a great outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Impressions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the Advantage 7735X, which comes with 5 lotion packs by Nivea that  are easy to insert into the back of the razor, the SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver does not come so equipped.  And that for me is the main disadvantage of the razor; while the Advantage 7735X shaves closely, without lotion, and even better with it, without some sort of moisturizer the \\&quot;SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver\\&quot; fails to shave as closely as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use shaving cream with the SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver, but that can get a bit messy (I only tried it once)  and the shave was not much better and the reason I use an electric razor is so I do not have to use shaving gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the design of the unit, it is cutting edge and stylish.  The razor fits easily into the hand and while running the SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver is quieter than the unit it replaces.  The small collapsible trimmer in the back of the unit works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver is cordless and comes with a charging stand that can automatically switch to the prevailing voltage, so traveling overseas will not be an issue.  It also comes with a carrying case large enough to hold everything that comes with the razor, including the charging base, and a small cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned three other Norelco razors, and the only one that shaves as close as the Advantage 7735X was the Advantage 5655.  On balance I am very disappointed in the SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver, so much so that I think I&#x27;ll be going back to the tried and true Advantage 7735X, or perhaps try a new lotion pack model; the lotion packs agree with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the really good news for my fellow razor bump suffers: I have not had a single bump since I started shaving with the SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver that at least is plus for the razor.electric razor is so I do not have to use shaving gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the design of the unit, it is cutting edge and stylish.  The razor fits easily into the hand and while running the SensoTouch 3D 1250x Electric Shaver is quieter than the unit it replaces.

            <li> This is my fourth or fifth Norelco shaver, and like the all of them it works as advertised.  This one seems to require use of a pre-shave more than the others have.  Pre-shave isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve normally used because I don&#x27;t like the fragrances of any of them, but I may have to try to find one.  Shaves are very close, comfortable and last all day.  Not as close as a shave with a razor, but more convenient.</li>
            <li> This might indeed be a good shaver, but we have no way of knowing, because we can&#x27;t use it!  What we thought we ordered and what we received were two different things.  We ordered the shaver, including (and I quote)\\&quot; SensoTouch 3D 1250X/40 razor, charging stand, soft pouch for travel and storage, protective cap, power cord, and cleaning brush.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we received was a shaver head, in a small box.  Then, a few days later, the shaver handle, again, in a small box.  No instructions, and, most important, no charging stand or cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an effort to actually use it, we have ordered a stand and cord from another supplier.  We hope this will make the unit useable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I would not recommend buying this unit from this seller.</li>
            <li> The 1250x/40 will give you the worst skin rash you have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;It is also 300% over priced. The shaver operates at a very slow speed.&lt;br /&gt; It feels like a toy, But it WILL remove skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor because my old braun broke and I was looking for some thing that could be cleaned and rinsed with plain old water instead of having to by special cleaning kits. It does a great job shaving those areas under the chin and near the neck that are hard to get. I like how the SensoTouch adjusts to the shape of your face to get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> The razor provides a clean shave but my neck was irritated a little longer than the product claimed.  It claims to work well in the shower but the shave was less effective. It also doesn&#x27;t work well if i haven&#x27;t shaved in a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my braun foil shaver that broke...I had to return this in the end. The reason I had to return it is I have a short beard and I could not cut in well with this rotary shaver. Its hard to get straight lines with it. You might think then why not use the trimmer part of the shaver...I tried that and it just does not cut well or give clean lines. The trimmer on the brauns is much better than this one. I wanted to like this shaver but it just does not work for the shaving I need it for. I think if you shave your whole face this will be a good shaver still.</li>
            <li> Very good. This razor works well.&lt;br /&gt;On this deal it is your good choice.&lt;br /&gt;Easy about work to do. good</li>
            <li> My hubby uses the shaver every day. He thinks it is great!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent razor. It is a very smooth shave.  Particularly, a good choice if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Been using for about a month now.  I basically bought this to shave my neck 3-4 times a week. I have a thick, coarse beard.  I read LOADS AND LOADS of reviews and comparisons all over the internet.  I decided on an electric razor instead of a safety blade and eventually came down to this one because it was on sale for about $40 less than the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that with my beard, this does NOT shave all of my hairs on my neck.  I always have to flip up the small &amp;#34;straight section&amp;#34; on this shaver to pickup where the circular area does not get.  It&#x27;s always in the same place too.  That said, it&#x27;s not a big deal, the fact that it comes with the little flip-up straight section makes it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is really easy.  You flip open the blades, run under water, and you&#x27;re done.  You don&#x27;t need solution or the self-cleaning thing, it&#x27;s pointless.  With my thick neck beard - I literally take 1-2 minutes doing circles, 30 seconds pickingup the extras with the straight part, then 15 seconds cleaning in running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a charging stand - awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this overall.  I may update my review down the line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice razor, no question.  It&#x27;s very quiet and fits the hand well.  But it isn&#x27;t anywhere near the shave that my Braun 790 was.  I&#x27;ve used it three weeks, as per directions but it just doesn&#x27;t cut as well-although I do have heavy whiskers and may not be average in that way.  It&#x27;s a nice razor, as I said, but if I had it to do over again I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it.  The vendor and delivery were super fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> using to shave head with very very little irritation (slight irritation to me is normal).  this works on shaving the face as well. easy to use and fast charging.</li>
            <li> I did something unusual this year for my husband.  I didn&#x27;t get him a Christmas present, (like he asked) the after Christmas looked for sales, did my homework, found the BEST electric razor available.  And it was on after Christmas sale!!!  HE LOVED IT!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really very pleased with this razor.  I love a traditional wet shave with a double edge and a quality shaving cream. But my daily routine just doesn&#x27;t allow the time for that every morning. So now I treat myself to a nice wet shave once or twice a week use this razor the rest of the time. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve owned that I can say that about. It is of course no where near as close a shave as a DE or Straight blade. But I find it is the closest most comfortable alternative in electric I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Works great,Good smooth shave and even has a larger head than my previous Norelco&#x27;s.  I feel for it after a couple shaves and love it. I will say this is the Best Norelco I have owned in the last 48 years of using Norelco!!!!</li>
            <li> I used Phillips before ,then BRAUN and was very happy with both,BRAUN left the cosy sporty shape and new design is too bulky so I decide to try new Phillips,I am very happy now as its very light and shave smoothly,also its good value for money here on Amazon.I have recommended this shaver to few of my friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing shaver that is so much better than Norelco&#x27;s much cheaper versions.  The #1 issue being that they&#x27;re not exactly cheap.  But given it&#x27;s expected long life, with quality shaves throughout, it&#x27;s probably still worth it.</li>
            <li> Decent razor as long as it works. At some point in time Norelco has basically decided to stop selling cleaning fluid for the thing so part of the reason for the large base is obsolete now. It was kinda cool to be able to drop this thing on it&#x27;s charge base and it would clean for the next use. The other catch to having that giant charging base is that if it stops working, you can&#x27;t use the razor anymore. Even though there&#x27;s no issues with my 1250 I can&#x27;t use it... because the battery won&#x27;t charge.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible design flaw. Because of the flaw this razor has never been any good as a travel razor. Two to three days and it needs charged and I&#x27;m not hauling that giant base with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is, the $30 razor I carry with me on trips shaves just as good as this thing does. I could buy a handful of those for what one of these cost.</li>
            <li> I finally got a good razor that will take my fuzz off.and give me a smooth shave.I like the rotary heads for shaving. They are small enough to reach into those crevices on my map. I like the ease of cleaning - image using water to clean an electric razor. It works and it does a nice job of it. Now, if the replacement heads are easy to obtain I will certainly have a keeper..</li>
            <li> Great razor, BUT weak battery.  I have had 2 razors die in the past 2 years.  Philips has a stated 2 year warrantee but customer service said it is from the &amp;#34;date of manufacture&amp;#34; unless you can produce the original receipt, regardless of whether or not you&#x27;ve registered the product online, which I did.  I&#x27;ll never buy another Philips product.</li>
            <li> It simply did not remove my hair.  Sounded great but either the item was broken or there was no power.&lt;br /&gt;Also the clipper part was designed poorly that you had a hard time angling it.&lt;br /&gt;I returned the item as a result</li>
            <li> Do not pay full price for this razor, there are better ones out there.  If you buy be sure to use a pre shave product, like Lectric Shave, to halo lubricate your skin.  It&#x27;s very easy to torch your skin with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I find the stand and the charging to be fine. It does hold a charge for about a week and the trimming blade is useful. Once you get use to shaving in the circular motion it is a lot quicker than a straight razor.  However I find myself constantly going back to the straight razor to get one spot that 1250x can&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> Received as a gift from a deceased uncle less than 2 years ago.  Battery died and Philips service line told me without receipt, no service.  They told me to go to a battery store like Batteries Plus.  Guy at battery store said battery is not customer replaceable.  Told me to go to electronics store.  There, he took it apart and said it&#x27;s made cheaply of plastic and will no longer be waterproof after he solders new battery in.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after much footwork and cost, it works again.  Certainly not worth the $275.00 price tag for cheaply made, poor customer service item.[[ASIN:B006W2SYGM Philips Norelco 1280X/47 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor  with Jet Clean System, Frustration Free Packaging]]</li>
            <li> The razor seemed to be of poor construction; it had a plastic toy-like feel to it.  The shave quality was below average; it didn&#x27;t shave areas on my face particularly well.  I returned the razor, and purchased a new cutter and foil for my 7000 seriec Braun, which I am now using.</li>
            <li> Its quality very good.Philips is always good.It cuts soft and is a very very nice gift.My friends very like it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t attempted a wet shave with this yet, but I have been very happy with the results of a dry shave as well as the ability to easily clean the unit when done.  I think this was almost top of the line when I bought it, and I got a good promotional price.  I wouldn&#x27;t have paid full price for it.  Charger stand is cheap.</li>
            <li> I have used many electric shavers over the years.  This is the best so far.  After using it, you have a very tight shave.  Great battery life, nice design.  Love it.</li>
            <li> [EDIT 8-2015] Philips Norelco has disappointed me with support for this expensive shaver. You can no longer find RQ12 replacement blade cartridges anywhere short of online sites that appear to have been prescient and hoarded them. Why not support this shaver with replacements? WHY? Mine is less than two years old and I refuse to spend another $150 on another when this tool that works so well. I wonder if someone is sharpening these little blades? Maybe I can start a business....  Shame on you, Philips Norelco for making a good product, only to abandon it for the new model. Will that shaver also only get a year or two of replacement blades? Underhanded business model.  Second electric, and the best shave I&#x27;ve had. I have parts under my chin where a regular razor blade, even the gigantic, multi-blade razors don&#x27;t get, requiring multiple passes and red, raw skin to be clean-shaven. This razor gets them after only a few passes, and leaves me clean-shaven and pain-free.  It does pinch me a little lower on my neck, but I&#x27;ll take the pain for smooth skin. Dry powder sticks seem to work better for me than wet-shaving, though. Your mileage may vary.  I still HIGHLY recommend this shaver. Battery lasts forever, too!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my friend and he thought it was cute and better than any shaver that he used before.</li>
            <li> I decided to drop the extra money to buy the higher end 1250x over a year ago, after having one of the $40 Norelco models that lasted me almost 3 years. I figured with a lifespan like that, it would be worth spending the extra money on a nicer razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was dead wrong. Even though they recommend you replace the heads on this razor once every 12 months, mine aren&#x27;t lasting more than 3-4 months at a time. At $60 per RQ12 replacement head, this razor is just unjustifiably expensive as a long term shaving solution</li>
            <li> I currently own four norelco razors, all of which are readily available for convenient use.  I&#x27;ve found that this is the one I use the most which speaks for itself.  One of the others is more comfortable to use, but this one does a better job of shaving, especially if I have missed a day or two of shaving.  My main complaint is the tiny beard dust holders.  I just make it a practice to rinse them with hot water every couple of days and leave them open to dry.  It gives a really close shave and is so much quicker and easier than using a blade.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver last Sep 2013. Was impressed with this, shaves well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in less than 3 months, i keep getting error msg to replace the shaver head.. sometimes it just wont turn on..&lt;br /&gt;I did change another head but the problem came back after a month. Dont know what is wrong with it, spent hours googling for technical support but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product quality has serious issue as I&#x27;m an overseas buyer and my purchase is not eligible for warranty..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the product that breaks down within 6 months, i&#x27;m very disappointed. Will never buy any Philips product again.</li>
            <li> Great product, best on the market from my experience. Philips could’ve done a better job with the charger. I don’t like the fact that you have to travel with the whole charger with you. Luckily the battery holds at least two weeks without recharging, so this works for me. I would totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this about a month ago and charged it up, and am still running it off that one charge. Easy to clean (simply fold up some tabs, rinse with warm water, and put it in the stand leaving it open until it dries), shaves wet or dry without any problems, and most importantly feels good to shave (hardly ever pulls a hair). Definitely the best razor I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for me to rate this.  My husband has shaved his head for more than 45 years.  In the early days he occasionally used a straight razor to get a nice, close shave and often used a regular non-electric razor.  For many years now he has been using the Norelco 7310XL.  When he tried the 1250X/40 he said he preferred the old shaver, the 7310.  I&#x27;ve been doing some of the head shaving lately (he no longer wants a really close shave) I feel that the trimmer on the 1250X does a better job than the 7310 in cutting the hair on his head and beard.  Cleaning the heads is also easier since they can be rinsed in water.  If he wanted a close shave and if I were the one doing it, I think I&#x27;d opt for a Foil razor which requires long, straight strokes &amp; should produce a closer shave. Apparently, the Foil razors are noisier, so that would be one drawback.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my creature of habit (aka Husband) who had been using the same razor for over 8 years. He was reluctant to use it, but now he absolutely loves it. The LED charging indicator is pretty cool and it charges right from the base. I would definitely recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> Over the years I always like to have the best electronics including toothbrush and electric shavers. Reading all the reviews. I decided to try this. This is the best shaver Philips makes, the 1290x and other similar model costs more, because of the cleaning station and longer battery life. Before you waste your time reading this review, read my review on Braun Series 7- 790cc or BRAUN SERIES 7 799CC-6WD shaver, it is cheeper and is the clear winner. I am not sure if anyone can ever make a better electric shaver than the Braun Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On with this shaver, it is a very good electric shaver compared to the panasonic. they are almost same in my opinion. I have used both. This does a decent job but does not provide a close enough shave. I also don&#x27;t like the round heads compared to the straight head. I shave every day and i usually use a safety razor to shave. You can never get a closer shave with any electric razor. But it does take time to shave with safety razor and it does require some getting used to. So i bought this electric shaver to use 3 out of the 7 days to save some time in the morning. The first experience with this shaver was bad, my skin was getting very irritated, i guess i had to get used to it at first. Then after three weeks it was a little better, but my neck would still get irritated a little. Also it didn&#x27;t shave very close, i was already rough around 12pm.&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for about 2 years but i can&#x27;t comment on the durability because i rarely used it. But it has a premium feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;Here are the pro:&lt;br /&gt;*Nice look and feel, looks stylish&lt;br /&gt;*Good battery life&lt;br /&gt;*Better than most electric shavers&lt;br /&gt;*Quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Not close enough shaves&lt;br /&gt;*Causes skin irritation, especially neck and sensative areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, save your money and buy the BRAUN series 7 and trust me, you won&#x27;t regret it. The cleaning system for the BRAUN is awsome.</li>
            <li> I have owned four&lt;br /&gt;electric razors and by far this is the best one with its close shave . No Problems Yet.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a replacement for my 8470XL, ruined by an over zealous TSA agent, who thought it looked like a gun - dismantled the top and misplaced the entire head assembly -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of replacing the missing parts, I decided to upgrade, and I am so very pleased with that decision.  This shaver is absolutely superior to my previous Norelco in terms of closeness and efficiency, design and ergonomics.  I have been a Norelco customer for many decades and have NEVER been disappointed with their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say this latest shaver is a positive continuation in Norelco product development .</li>
            <li> My husband asked for this for Father&#x27;s Day.&lt;br /&gt;He uses it and loves it.  It gives him a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would do a good job shaving and last for a long time.  This razor doesn&#x27;t do any better job of shaving than my cheaper one I had for many years(20+)  I wish I would have just gotten a cheaper one.  On the plus side is it looks nice, holds a longer charge, and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> Received this product quickly and everything was perfect. Love this Razer very close to shaving as close as a blade. I would have no problem recommending this company.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I even shaved my head off with if &amp; it worked beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Caution it doesn&#x27;t work on a stubble more than 3 to 5 days old.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer too is super good &amp; efficient.</li>
            <li> Actually I have a love/hate relationship with this product or rather electric shavers v blades.  I&#x27;ve been using a lower cost electric on those days that I just feel lazy and need to trim things up a bit but decided to go with high quality and see if I could get away from blades.  This product is really light weight, very low noise.  It is iffy on cutting all hair, but it is a very close shave.  I&#x27;ve found that it actually takes more time to use this than a blade.  Shaving the moustache area is still a challenge for me.  The directions say to go in circular motion, but the area above the lip is really small compared to the shaving head area.  Each time I use this, I keep thinking to return it because of the time it takes but the convenience and ability to shave quickly if I want seems to outweigh the negatives. If I do a quick shave, it wouldn&#x27;t reach the standard that I have to have a really groomed appearance, but is good enough to get out in public.</li>
            <li> works great. fast charge. holds a charge well. clean smooth shave. easy to clean. nice design. i just wish the charge stand fit in the case with the razor.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever used.  Shaves extremely close in all directions and leaves NO whiskers around this sink.  I would give it 6 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful shavor.my friend love it very much. I feel honor  when I give it to my friend as a gift.</li>
            <li> I finally replaced an old Norelco rotary shave with this one. It gives a closer shave with less irritation that my previous one and a single charge lasts me for about a month.</li>
            <li> It works well and is easy to handle. My husband has Parkinson&#x27;s and he finds out easy to hold. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I used to use a Braun 760 before buying this. It just took too many passes even after a new blade so I decided to try the rotary style razor with high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a hard time with any razor and my beard on my neck, as most do. Straight-edge absolutely destroys me and electric razors tend to be much easier on my skin. That being said, I still get razor burn if I press too hard to do too many passes on my neckline with this razor. I just haven&#x27;t found the PERFECT razor that will get the crop circle of beard that grows on my neck. This razor does cut through everywhere else very quickly and with ease. I was really amazed how well it did on my cheeks/chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first turned this one on, it was so quiet that I thought it might be faulty or maybe I needed to change a setting. My old Braun 760 sounded like a lawnmower. This thing is QUIET.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also wish the sideburns trimmer was a bit wider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I haven&#x27;t tried this as a wet shave yet. Might try that next time*</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco razors my entire shaving life. I just upgraded to the senso touch and am thrilled with it. It does everything advertised. The shave is even closer than with previous model 9160xl  which I thought could not be improved upon. The senso touch works well without irritation even when dry. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m a woman, I got this electric shaver for my son since he goes through razors left and right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He ended up passing on it in that he said his beard is too thick and electric shavers hate him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I gave it to a co-worker who at first didn&#x27;t want it either for the same reasons but I talked him into trying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two days of using it, he&#x27;s sold. His assessment: \\&quot;It didn&#x27;t tug or irritate my skin like other electric shavers. It isn&#x27;t quite as close a shave as a razor but it is close enough for me. Its a little noisy but maybe that&#x27;s just me. But its good. I like it. I&#x27;d buy it if you hadn&#x27;t given it to me. Rating? On a 5-star scale? 4-stars.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it. A man&#x27;s opinion about a man&#x27;s electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I like the razor, but it is expensive and the rplacement  head is also expensive.  It does not stay sharp for long also.</li>
            <li> Still works! What to not expect from Philips Noreclo...</li>
            <li> This product is so great I logged into amazon.com specifically to give it my recommendation.  Here are a few specifics: shockingly quiet, super close shave, very comfortable, and easy to clean.  This product should get some sort of design award for its cool/sleek look. Even the small details are done right... for example, I saw a review that said the &#x27;simple packaging&#x27; was not true -- but it is!  I simply sliced open the tape covering the seal on the cardboard box and inside the razor was packaged in a custom eggshell with no tape or annoying plastic packaging.  On top of the great product, I got an incredible price... $20 off retail price plus $50 instant coupon for a savings of $70.  I salute Norelco and, of course, Amazon.  Cheers.</li>
            <li> This razor is much better than the previous models, my only complaint, and the reason I gave it 4 stars is because it fills with hair very quickly, causing the shave to be much worse after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful shaver, exquisite workmanship, the voice is  small than Braun 380s-4, but Braun shave clean than this one.i like it .</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this razor based on the reviews. Suffice to say, it doesn&#x27;t cut anything. You can pass over your stubble multiple times, almost nothing best shaved. The precision trimmer on the backside works okay, but it makes no sense to buy something this expensive just for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the first electric razor I&#x27;ve tried but it is the first in this price range. It&#x27;s equally useless as the $30 models.</li>
            <li> This thing works great.  Light, quiet, no pull and it gives me a great shave.  I use it dry and it runs circles around the old Braun I have.  Glad I bought it.  The trimmer is a bit cumbersome to use but that&#x27;s a minor issue.  Got to remove the shaving head, which takes all of .5 seconds to remove, and replace when done trimming.  Would recommend to anyone.  We&#x27;ll see how it holds up.</li>
            <li> Worth the money does a great job.</li>
            <li> I prefer the older style Norelco razors but this one will suffice.&lt;br /&gt;At least it is easy to daily clean.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have ever used. It replaced my Braun and is much quieter and shaves closer. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> very good! same as described!</li>
            <li> I love this because I can use it in so many different ways.  I can have a dry shave like with other Norelco products that I&#x27;ve used for the past 35 years.  Ever since I was old enough to shave, my skin just does not work well with standard razers--I bleed all over.  So over the course of my life the shavers have kept me whole and healthy.  AND with this product, I have opportunity for a dry shave or I can use water, or I can use lather or I can use lotion.&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who likes an electric shave this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> My husband has Parkinson&#x27;s disease and it was very hard for him to use a razor with a blade.  This makes shaving a breeze for him,</li>
            <li> So far this has been the best electric razor I have ever had. I bought it almost 2 years and it still works flawlessly. I&#x27;m in the Navy... so  took it on a 10 month deployment using it every day... never failed. It always giving me a close perfect shave every time requireing a charge every 2 to 3 weeks. I replaced the RQ12 head once and clean it with water every time I use it and that&#x27;s it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Shave just a little better then my old Norelco, but not to any great degree.&lt;br /&gt;Design of cutting system for keeping the heads clean is very poor.&lt;br /&gt;Razor is overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;Charging system and stand is nice, and easy to use.,</li>
            <li> For the money paid for this razor, it should come with hands to shave me. It works fine with gel of shaving cream, but using it dry does not give me a clean shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a great job. My face was a little tender after using it for a few weeks but got better after a couple weeks. A lot closer shave than my old electric shaver and the battery lasts weeks.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied, a product of excellent quality. I put 5 stars for all categories. I have recommended this product to my friends</li>
            <li> The best shaver for nowadays. First 2 weeks it slightly irritated my skin, but then everything became OK. I absolutely recommend this shaver, if U can afford it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given up on this after about 6 months of use.  It irritates my neck and leaves stray hairs here and there.  Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> This razor works great!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver. After using razor blades for decades, I switched to the Norelco 1250 Sensotouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it did take me time to adjust. My neck broke out at first. And the razor pulled hairs occasionally.  But no longer. Here&#x27;s why:  The beard and skin did take some time to adjust from manual to electric, just like &#x27;they&#x27; say. And I had to figure out 1) which pre-shave to use and 2) which aftershave lotion worked best, and 3) how to use an electric shaver, especially which directions to shave and which part of the face to shave first. (See tips below that helped me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose between this Norelco rotary and the Braun 7 foil. Deciding factors:  the Norelco is comparatively quieter; it&#x27;s easier to clean (which becomes even more important when traveling); and it&#x27;s smaller than the Braun. FOR ME, I feel like I made the best choice. BTW, I have a medium (not too heavy) beard and don&#x27;t have too many problems with ingrown hairs or serious breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-- Battery is great. You can charge as often or a little as you wish (lasts about two weeks between charges); charging frequency doesn&#x27;t affect a  lithium battery.&lt;br /&gt;-- Shaver washes easily and quickly (about 15 seconds); no need for the jet clean system, but it might be a nice luxury.&lt;br /&gt;-- Fast, easy, and often... After getting the hang of it, I can now shave in a couple of minutes. And even after shaving in the morning, I can shave early evening for very special occasions, then shave again the next morning. Shaving often is not only ok, but is even better with an electric. With a manual razor, I couldn&#x27;t shave more than once in 24 hours, and I always skipped a day whenever I could. Now I can shave with a shirt on and with no mess!&lt;br /&gt;-- Quality...Shaver seems well made and sturdy/solid. Fits very comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;-- Portability... Fine and sturdy for travel. No charging stand or cord is needed unless gone for more than about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;-- Lownoise level - when compared to all foil shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm...Hard to say. The replacement head will cost about $52 (Amazon), but that&#x27;s only once a year. Maybe I&#x27;ll wish I could plug the cord directly into it, so I wouldn&#x27;t need the charging stand when traveling. But their latest stand folds more flatly than their previous stand, so if that&#x27;s an issue, be sure to get the latest version. (Other than the folding stand, the current 1250 is the same as before.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS that worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave with your skin as dry as possible. With my schedule, when I shave in the morning, I need to shave within 15 minutes after showering. To speed the drying of the skin and beard, many men use an alcohol-based pre-shave lotion. The alcohol dries the skin and makes the hair stand up and, therefore, helps the shave glide across the skin without dragging.  Alcohol works for most guys, but my face didn&#x27;t like it. So if your face hates alcohol, try powder. Remington makes a wonderful, inexpensive powder stick, FACE SAVER, that is quick and easy to use. Sounds weird and messy, but it works fine. It&#x27;s talc based, which is fine for me. It&#x27;s always not easy to find, but some stores carry it and it is easily available online, including Amazon. Some people use a cornstarch-based baby powder. But for me, the Face Saver is a perfect way to get a quicker, slicker shave, even after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave the neck and sensitive areas first, while the shaver isn&#x27;t too warm. Shave with the grain at first. Don&#x27;t press too hard. After shaving, apply face or even body lotion. Use a fragrant-free lotion, if your skin is sensitive. For me, CeraVe and Lubriderm work fine. Lab Series Ultra Razor Burn Lotion also works great. It&#x27;s expensive per bottle, but a bottle lasts a long time. And -- this is probably optional -- I use a simple exfoliating face wash in the shower 2 or 3 times a week. Sounds like a lot of fussy trouble (NEVER thought I&#x27;d do anything like this), but it&#x27;s really not a big deal. Doesn&#x27;t take any longer, just keep the tube in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last tip:  Have patience. It&#x27;s true what they say - it may take a couple of weeks for your face to adjust and for you to figure out what you&#x27;re doing.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> The shave is as good as any Norelco shaver, but it is much easier to clean and maintain!  It holds it&#x27;s charge sufficiently so you don&#x27;t have to keep returning it to it&#x27;s stand.</li>
            <li> This Norelco replaces my old Braun 8585. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the Norelco, it shaves very close, and very quickly. It&#x27;s pivoting head is amazingly comfortable, and it&#x27;s easy to clean...it even tells you when. Quick charging, efficient. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with Norelco electric shavers forever, more than 50 years.  When my 10 year old started getting slower speed, I decided to order a new one.  I looked at the conventional designed Norelco&#x27;s and discovered that they were either made in China, a problem for me, or didn&#x27;t have a travel case.  So I bit the bullet and ordered the Darth Vader looking model, I&#x27;ve had it a couple of weeks now, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Great shave, fast, comfortable, what more could I ask for.  My only issue is that it&#x27;s size takes up a large part of my travel kit, but a small price to pay for a great shave!</li>
            <li> Service was great. Shaver, terrific!!</li>
            <li> very powerful electric razor,just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;its very comfoortable.&lt;br /&gt;i love it.&lt;br /&gt;it can work 2week that you charge it full once</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent, yet pricey razor.  Performance degrades after several months and Phillips recommends you replace the shaver head annually.    This is where the problem begins - on the Phiillps website the MSRP for a replacement head is $64.99, but they are no longer being made so the few available ones are being offered at inflated prices.  The CHEAPEST one available is $106 with shipping.  To pay $106 for a replacement head when a new unit costs $179 is just plain nuts. I bought a Chinese knockoff replacement on ebay for $30 which fell to pieces when I tried to replace the head.    Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Good product.</li>
            <li> This shaver without a doubt gives me the best shave that I have ever received from an electric razor, and I look forward to many, many more</li>
            <li> This razor provides a great shave. It is well ballanced and a snap to clean. I am glad I upgraded.</li>
            <li> The razor is easy to use and works on wet or dry face.  I really like how easy the blades are to clean.  Just rinse off and it is ready to go.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SHAVED W/NORELCO/PHILIPS RAZORS FOR OVER 30 YRS.  THIS ONE IS THE BEST BY FAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. While I had some initial skin irritation switching from a Braun, it quickly adjusted. Very precise cut. I bought it more than 2 years ago, and checked the head prices back then. Something like a $49 recommended price I believe. I thought that was adequate for a higher-end razer. However, now the replacement head is $89. EIGHTY NINE DOLLARS. E I G H T Y  N I N E dollars for a replacement head that costs $5 to make. And you are supposed to switch the head ONCE A YEAR. The cost is getting out of hand with this thing. I&#x27;ll sell mine and switch back to a Braun or Panasonic. This pricing is just ridiculous. How can you jack up the prices on replacement parts so much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And check this out:&lt;br /&gt;This is the site where you are supposed to buy it:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.buyphilipsparts.com/item/10113411/Norelco/422203618491/Shaving_Head_Rq12_Service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here it still says $64:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/RQ12_52/norelco-sensotouch-3d-shaving-unit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of electric shavers, I find them to provide a less than perfect shave - leaving blotches of hair and not being close enough, this electric shaver, however, is in my opinion the closest you can get to a razor shave.  I have been using it for the last month and I think that I&#x27;m now ready to provide an accurate and detailed review.    I have used these criteria to review this product:  Quality of shave, Ease of cleaning, Comfort level, Battery usage and Overall value for money.  The electric shaver in question excels in most of these areas:    Quality of shave  The new \\&quot;3d\\&quot; head, although gimmicky in title, is very percise and does not leave any area untreated, however, just like any other electric shaver, this too doesn&#x27;t provide the close shave that can be attained by an actual razor shave.  4 Out of 5    Ease of cleaning  The detachable head is extremely easy to clean and really does come out clean when you are done, no place for the hairs to hide so to speak  5 Out of 5    Comfort level  The shaver fits perfectly in the hand and has a good feel to it, it feels like some thought was put into it&#x27;s design and top quality materials were used in the manufacturing process.  This can also be observed by the incredibly silent operation, even after a month.  4 Out of 5    Battery  The battery lasts enough for a several shaves, and charging an empty battery is incredibly fast, can&#x27;t ask for more in this department.  5 Out of 5    Value for money  Here&#x27;s where it falls short - the price is high, and if you can afford it you get an high quality electric shaver at a premium, but for most of us, this is just not worth the money.  3 Out of 5    Conclusion  As a whole, this is a very good electric shaver and if the price were to go down slightly, it&#x27;s star rating would improve, but for now it gets a  4 Out of 5      If you liked this review, please mark it as helpful!</li>
            <li> The razor works very well for me and cleans up easily since heads are not directly connected to motor, washing is easily accomplish.    The trimmer doesn&#x27;t work as well as past Norelco models I&#x27;ve owned, but all else is much superior.</li>
            <li> This Phillips norelco, doesnt work for me, not even de shrimer cuts any hair... i dont recommend it... (sorry for my bad english)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a long time to get one of these new philips Norelco and when I was about to order from elsewhere, i found the best deal on amazon and went for it. When I received it for this Christmas, I tried it with a lot of excitement. To my disappointment, i ended up with a lot of nicks and burns all over my cheeks and my throat and neck area became very messy and irritated. I was guessing that one of the blades section it came with might be the culprit. It&#x27;s on it&#x27;s way back through the return process.</li>
            <li> I received the Norelco 1250x as a Christmas present and was quite excited.  I have long had my eye on a new electric shaver and this one fit the bill.  After a couple of shaves I can tell you that it shaves as close and misses as few hairs as any shaver I have ever owned, even foil shavers.  Because of this I experienced slight irritation along the neck...but at least no hair.  However, I have noticed that the irritation has dissipated with continued use.  The Norelco is very quiet and ergonomic which is always a plus.  The only real drawback has been the beard trimmer which is subpar at best and the reason for 4/5 instead of 5/5.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised.  Shaves close without skin irritation.  Easy to clean.  Can use dry or wet with equally good shave.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this shaver, I dont shave everyday sometimes once a week, and I dont even have to use a trimmer,  this shaver is great on long hair.  the trimmers not to good, but you dont really need it.  otherwise this is a great shaver</li>
            <li> This product was a gift for my husband and he loves it.  It works just as the mfg. states.</li>
            <li> The order and delivery was handled very well.  Delivery took a bit longer than I anticipated but arrived in excellent condition.  Would continue to do business with this company.</li>
            <li> Works great on both face and head. Pretty easy to clean. Only issue was the manual was for a different razor</li>
            <li> I have always prided myself with a close clean shave,but do not want the fuss of shaving with a blade! I thought I was gettinng it with my 2 year old self cleaning BRAUN PULSONIC 7.But when the trimmer broke and i needed to send it off to be repaired I would need another shaver.So instead of buying another too expensive BRAUN,I opted to check out the NORELCO 3D line. WOW what a differance!! I bought the 1250x/40 and have never had a closer shave! and save your money on the self cleaning models,because all you need to do is run it under hot water and it is as good as new. NORELCO has come a long way from the triple headers of the 70&#x27;s. I am not sending my BRAUN out for repairs!!!</li>
            <li> Over the last 3 months I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic LA-93K, Braun 760cc and the Noreclco 1250x/40.  I&#x27;m 33 years old and I&#x27;ve been usuing an electric razor almost for as long as I&#x27;ve had to shave.  For the last 6 -7 years I&#x27;ve used top of the line Braun razors and prior had tried a Norelco, the wet / dry version that dispensed shaving lotion.     I started my search for a new razor when my old Braun, top of the line at the time, Model # 8589 started to faulter. I&#x27;m a very tough customer as I&#x27;ve got extremely sensitive skin in my neck area.  The whiskers also grow in all different directions which causes ingrown hairs. My neck area requires multiple passes which adds to the irritation.  I&#x27;ve never had a razor that didn&#x27;t irritate my neck and leave some stray whiskers behind.  The problem has only gotten worse with age.  I&#x27;ve tried shaving with a Gillet Fusion straigh razor, it irritated my neck area more than any of the electric razors.    I started my journey witht the LA-93K - I read the reviews on Amazon as was extremely excited to give the razor a shot.  I shaved with it dry, wet and with shaving cream.  I had to make a lot of passes with the razor in the neck area and it still left hair behind.  My neck area became very irriated after shaving due to the multiple passes.  I had to pull out my old Braun to clean up after shaving with the LA-93K.  The razor was very loud and the shave head was bulky.  It did however seem to cut closer than the Braun or Noreclo, five O&#x27;Clock shadow stayed away longer.  I returned the Razor to Amazon after 3 weeks of use, the return was very easy, was very pleased with Amazon&#x27;s customer service.    I then gave the Braun 760cc a shot.  The head seems to countor to my face better than the LA-93K but from a performance stand point I didn&#x27;t see an improvement over my old Braun or the Panasonic.  It actually seemed to irritate my kneck more than my old Braun.  I tried all 3 shaving settings.  The shave was more comfortable for me than the LA-93K but not drastically differet.    My last stop was the Norelco 1250X/40 - I was desperate at this point.  I had shyed away from Norelco in the past due to the circular motion needed to shave with the rotary heads, in the past this had cuased more irritaiton than the foil shavers.  I was surprised by how well the shaving heads countored to my face.  I tried the shaver with shaving lotion, worked great, glided and really seemed to limit the irriation.  Using the Panasonic with shaving cream seemed to actually add to the irritation.  The razor is very quite compared to the Panasonic and Braun.  For me it does a better job if gettin the pesky whiskers and irritates my skin less.  It is extremely easy to clean, I wouldn&#x27;t spend money on the more expensive models, they all have the same shaving head and performance, the add ons are the cleaning station and more advanced display screens.  It doesn&#x27;t give me a perfect shave but closer to perfection than the others with less irritation.  Each shave has gotten better, I&#x27;ve used the razor around 10 times so far.    I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews and researched a lot of razors over the last 3 - 4 months.  What I&#x27;ve learned is a razor is a personal preference and everyones skin, hair growth pattern exc... is different.  So you&#x27;ve really got to give razors a shot and see which one works best for you.  All these models have trial periods and I didn&#x27;t run into any issues returning the Panasonic or Braun.  For me, the Noreclco was the winner of the big 3.</li>
            <li> This razor is quieter &amp; more comfortable than my Norelco 7775X.  However, it does not shave as close.  I find that comfort &amp; closeness are trade-offs to some degree.  This razor is not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I have had this Shaver since Decenber, I bought when Amazon had them on sale for $157.00 and a $50.00 manufacters rebate. so my total was $107.00. I was using a norelco 8160xl which I liked. I have been using the SensoTouch since December. I would rate it slightly better than my XL, It runs quite and gives a closer shave. I would have been disapointed had I paid the full price though.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with a great product, superclean shave - however it strikes me as extraordinarily retarded that you can only charge it with the stand.  There should also be either a small place where you can plug it in directly (like many other, much cheaper models) or if it needs to be sealed for wet/dry then a small plastic collar adapter that will touch the charging contacts - allowing it to be plugged into the wall and charged in a hotel.      Yes, I know it&#x27;s charged for up to 17 days worth of shaving but for this kind of price they should have done the QA to consider this and provide us with either this little collar thing or even better, make it detachable from the stand itself.  This way it can be charged in tighter spaces and also while on longer trips.      Or even better... make it charge via USB.  ;-)</li>
            <li> This item is the best shaver i have ever had. totally recommend to anyone thinking of purchaseing an electric shaver not to bother with any other and go straight to Philips and buy one of the 3D sensotouch.</li>
            <li> I now have the shaver 8 days.  I first tried the shaver on a dry skin and I did feel some razor burn in my neck area with some redness.  Oh, let me add I have been using a Norelco triple header for 25 years.  I then started using some hand soap and water in a lather on my face.  This process has given me the BEST shave in 25 years.  Rinsing out the shaver after each use is no problem.  The trimmer is superb.  Norelco has a winner.  I highly recommend the Norelco SensoTouch 3D to anyone looking for a good razor.</li>
            <li> This is what an electric shaver is supposed to be.  It&#x27;s simply the best. Take a chance.</li>
            <li> What a great razor. I always had sensitive skin. Well, no more with this razor. The 3D senso touch is awesome, quick, easy to clean, provides a great shave. High recommended</li>
            <li> It looks cool, but my old Norelco felt better in my hand, more control.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Find this product on sale is all that was needed, because it is the perfect gift for any man this season.</li>
            <li> This razor is fabulous! I own a prior Norelco model and have used it for the past 5+ years until it finally failed. It worked so well, I decided to stick with the brand, but upgrade to a higher quality model. That has paid off. I&#x27;ve never gotten a closer shave with an electric razor before this one. Also, skin irritation is a thing of the past. The feel of the razor in the hand is very comfortable and easy to hold. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought the same model two years ago.  I dropped my original and water shorted it out.  I love this razor!</li>
            <li> husband loves this razor. He has been using it for years now and loves the small trimmer for his mustache</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been a Norelco man for many years, wanted this model when it was time to replace his old one. He likes the fact that it can be cleaned under running water, recharges quickly. Great quality product.</li>
            <li> I do not like the 5-o&#x27;clock shadow the shaver leaves me afterward. Give me back the hand-me-down that my grandfather used before I started with it 15 years ago. And, I have to use a safety razor to get close to the edges of my hair lines, i.e. sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as good as my old razor but it&#x27;s still a 5. You can&#x27;t use this while plugged in to charge and the sideburn trimmer is not as good. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a fine razor, well balanced, nice &#x27;touch.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Never really appreciated how easy, fast, thorough, and comfortable an electric shave could be until I tried this one. I would not hesitate recommending it! Great discount and money back guarantee got me to try it.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver that I have ever had, but you get what you pay for. I have noticed that the replacement shaving unit is VERY expensive and not available at many local stores. That&#x27;s why I try to get two years out of my razor heads.</li>
            <li> I bought it for him for Christmas. he hates it and uses a razor instead and ends up with nicks all over. Back to the drawing board!</li>
            <li> I have been using Electric Shavers for years because manual blades tend to irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Usually buy a new shaver every three years and I check reviews to get the highest rated each time.&lt;br /&gt;Tried the latest Braun, Panasonic, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;Ib short, this is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. It does not require more than a couple of passes over each area for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;It is quiet and easy to clean. Works great in shower with soap or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed.</li>
            <li> I have had probably five or six Norelco shavers in my life time and this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the few extra dollars to get something that floats/contours on your face, easy to clean and&lt;br /&gt;the charge almost lasts forever.  Sorry I cannot compare to others, but have always had great luck&lt;br /&gt;with Norelcos.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here expect it works fantastic.....very close shave, quiet, quick recharge, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but the high price keeps me from doing so.......even though it&#x27;s a great shaver I do think it&#x27;s overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;If not for a gift card I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d of purchased such a high priced shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice otherwise...</li>
            <li> I recommend this electric razor, it is the best I have ever used...  It is easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> Nice shave but look forward to a better experience by continuing to use this SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor  I will follow up later on my use of this &amp; expecting a better shave in time.</li>
            <li> IT would be a great razor if the 3-D heads had not been discontinued. Further, Norelco apparently has no plans for a replacement. So you are paying the price for a 3D but as soon as the head wears out, you&#x27;re screwed. Thanks Norleco, way to treat your customers!</li>
            <li> shave is okay BUT cleaning is too much effort. You have to open and clean each head separately</li>
            <li> ,powerful, and easy to clean. Really pleased with this shaver. It is well worth the expense because of its superior performance</li>
            <li> Much closer shave than my older Panasonic wet/dry I&#x27;ve had for years. Was a little reluctant to use an electric shaver with rotating heads because a decade ago it was hard on the skin, but not this new anorelco wet/ dry! I use Electra shave pre- shave lotion and it does fine without having to use shaving cream. Much quieter too. Just wish the little pop-out  trimmer was a tad better.....TKS</li>
            <li> Just got it today,So far shaving level is smooth as hell no cuts u cant even feel the hair like ,and its quiet Fully recommend will leave another review for durability in a few months</li>
            <li> I had a previous Norelco which is preatty good, but decided to upgrade. This new 3D series, IS better. Shave seems a bit closer and is much quicker, more efficient. The only down side is that the trimmer is much narrower. All in all, it´s a great product. This is the cheapest model of the 3D series, but the specs are the same as the most expensive, only the looks change.</li>
            <li> Received the product quickly and for a great price.  After using for several months, the razor does not cut as good as my 6 yr old razor.</li>
            <li> I convinced my wife into letting me spend some extra cash on a really good razor as it was that my old one was nicking my face. It&#x27;s got great features and ease of use.  Price is a little outrageous though.  I think it should cost maybe 120.  But who am I to set the bar.  Beware the cost of replacement heads when purchasing this razor! They are nearly 70 dollars!!! It&#x27;s an entire replacement of the head, not just the blades.</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of electric shavers over the years. The past few years I have been buying the top of the line new shavers available from the top brands. I have tried the Braun Pulsonic, the Panasonic, and Philips/Norelco. After all the hype, I thought the Braun stunk. It took me forever to get the close shave I want and I was also getting cuts. I also hated the self cleaning unit since it was large and bulky to carry on vacations. The Panasonic top of the line shaver was much better and I was pleased with it. Then, I admit, I was influenced by TV ads to try the Norelco Senso touch model. I had tried the Architec a couple years ago and I was not at all pleased with the results. But this Senso Touch is the best electric shaver I have ever used. I get very close shaves in less time than with the Panasonic for example. The only complaint I have is with the charging unit. I don&#x27;t understand the need for such a unit instead of a simple cord. That is the only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Wihin the last year, I tried the top of the line Remington and Braun electric razors, and now the Norelco Sensotouch 3 D. What a difference, a quick clean shave, and no long hairs left.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for years. This model from Norelco gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric razor. Clean up is also a snap, just run hot water over the heads. Yes, this is somewhat pricey, but to me it was worth it. Also the Li-ion battery does not suffer from memory like the old ni-cads.</li>
            <li> Shaver was received as expected in condition (new) expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver gives a good, close, comfortable shave and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery appears to last a long time on a single charge. Received shaver on 3/2&lt;br /&gt;and am still on first charge. I shave every day with the shaver. I have tried&lt;br /&gt;other brands and have had the best luck with Norelco.</li>
            <li> One of the few shavers I was happy with.  Gave me a nice smooth and clean shave.  Defiantly worth the price.</li>
            <li> After my Braun series 3 decided to wig out, I spent some time on Amazon reading review after review on electric shavers and even digging through Consumer Reports.  Having been a Braun fan for most of my life, the last experience just didn&#x27;t set with me all too well. On the other hand, spending nearly $170 wasn&#x27;t high on my priority list either. After much anxiety, I bit the bullet and decided to purchase this Norelco shaver. Boy am I glad I did.     This product, hands down, is the closest shave I&#x27;ve had from an electric shaver. Another big plus is that it is 1/4 of the noise of my Braun. In fact, I can wake up in the morning, head to the bathroom and feel as though I&#x27;m still being quiet while shaving -- a plus with an infant in the house. I was very impressed at how smooth it glides on my skin and how it got to every size of hair. The other thing is that it takes one pass to clear my stubble as compared to my Braun which I felt I had to go over the same area twice. Thus, my shaving time was cut in half. Another benefit is that I don&#x27;t end up getting the five o&#x27;clock shadow as bad as I usually do. My four year old made the comment the other day that he liked that I didn&#x27;t have a &#x27;sharp beard&#x27;.     I wouldn&#x27;t spend the extra money to get the jet wash unit.  Frankly, I just run it under some hot water and it does the job just fine. So far the battery life is exemplary.  This was a great purchase and the packaging and delivery were right on target.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Philips razors and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint. It was better then my last one, and the battery life is great.  On the old style the clasp to open it was at the front and i would keep hitting it by accident.  This new style is much better, it hasn&#x27;t happened yet. It also gives a much better shave. I leant it to my dad to try and now he wants to buy one lol.</li>
            <li> I have previously used a Norelco 74xx series and a Braun. Got this one yesterday and love it..There is a huge difference in the smoothness when shaving - this one just glides over the skin without irritating even a bit. The noise level is also very low.</li>
            <li> Have had many year of experience with the Norelco brand shavers and have been satisfied with their peformance. The model I was using had 4 years of good service and I replaced it 1250x/40. The new razor is great and I am sure I&#x27;ll get many years of great service. Keep it up Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for over 40 years, and while this model (I have model #1260x) shaves okay, the design is ridiculous! First, and I can&#x27;t understand why I have not seen this problem listed before, for any of the SensoTouch models; the stubble does not stay in the shaver!! It is constantly falling out as you shave,especially if the razor heads are turned downward at all, which happens often, including when you try to use the absurdly positioned trimmer, and it makes a big mess!  You also have to clean this shaver after every use because of the very small collection chambers.  I spoke to an extremely unhelpful customer service supervisor named Claudine, and all she could tell me to do was to clean the shaver, in the middle of a shave;...... really??  I will be returning this razor and absolutely do not recommend it!</li>
            <li> This shave has given me great shaving comfort and ease.  No longer deal with a razor blades and septic sticks.  I would recommend the Norelco Senso Touch to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to electric shaving. For decades, I have used a Norelco (Philips) to rough-in and a Braun to finish up. Braun still gives a slightly closer shave, but they are not ideal as a solo unit if you have a heavy beard.  After using a variety of Norelcos since the early 1970&#x27;s, I can state unequivocally that this is by far the best yet. It is easy to see why; you see those big circumferential slots in the second concentric ring of the heads? Those allow longer hairs to easily gain entrance into the cutting heads and be dealt with. The 3D is the only shaver in the lineup thus far to have them.  Combined with the inward-and-outward flexibility of the 3D&#x27;s heads, this is a major advance. With my previous Norelco&#x27;s, I would consistently have long hairs under my chin or around the \\&quot;Adam&#x27;s Apple\\&quot; that would require five or six passes to chop down. Sometimes, I would have to revert to using the sideburn trimmer to get them. After using the 3D for three weeks, I have seen no trace of any hair eluding the wrath of the 3D&#x27;s cutting blades.  Hopefully, the \\&quot;large-slot\\&quot; heads will work their way down the product line; until then it&#x27;s well worth paying the extra money for the 3D.</li>
            <li> The GOOD news: This shaver which looks a bit like a small Martian creature gives me the most rapid and close shaves ever. The BAD news: The shaver comes with a combined holder and charging unit which, when the shaver is docked, is unstable on my bathroom counter. The least jostling causes the unit to fall over and half the time it ends up on the tile floor. The fourth time this happened the plastic shaver head protector shattered with no damage to the shaver itself.   The unit comes with excellent instructions that indicate that the shaver should be washed with hot water after each use and that no blotting of the shaver head is allowed for fear of lint getting into the shaver head. They also recommend replacing the shaver heads yearly -at a cost upwards of $50.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve used a lot of different Norelco shavers, in some cases bringing them in to local shops to replace the batteries. My beard, thin but wiry, is too challenging for most other brands. However, I was never completely happy with the previous Norelco that I bought several years ago (an XL model) and I really wanted to try one of the 3D styles.   The 1250x/40 was perfect for me because I shave my face dry, so cleaning isn&#x27;t a big issue. I had no real interest in paying the extra $100 (plus supply costs) for the cleaning unit when just blowing out and rinsing the heads after a shave is about all that I needed. The one benefit of the top model that I do miss is the accurate display of remaining shaves. That would be an issue when I travel a lot (more on that later). I wish Norelco would make that model available without the cleaning unit.  Though this really shouldn&#x27;t matter, this has to be one of the most attractive shavers Norelco has ever designed. With the curvy black body and nicely coordinated charging stand, the 1250x wouldn&#x27;t look out of place on Darth Vader&#x27;s bathroom vanity. It&#x27;s a real beauty. The slip-over cover for the 3D heads was the first I&#x27;ve owned that didn&#x27;t break after the first few months.   This was also the first Norelco shaver that provided good results from day one. Though Norelco says that it takes about 30 days for your face to get used to its shaving heads, I think the reality is that it normally takes that long for the blades to wear to a point where they seat correctly in the shaving head. (You experience the same \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period when These seemed to be perfect from the first, possibly explained by the fact that the blade replacement cost is roughly double what Norelco charges for non-3D models. The shave is very close, even and comfortable. It isn&#x27;t necessarily faster than other Norelco models, but the results are notably better.   Compared to most of Norelco&#x27;s other shavers, the 1250 is very light, apparently because it uses a smaller battery. For me, it holds a charge for about 3 weeks of daily shaving. Getting the last green light of the charge indicator means I have 3-6 days left before a recharge--not a particularly accurate indicator. If you&#x27;re traveling a lot that can be an issue. For user safety reasons, the charger plugs into the shaver stand and not the shaver itself, meaning you have to bring both along when you travel and there&#x27;s no way to run the shaver directly on AC. There&#x27;s a nice travel case for the shaver, but nothing for the stand, which takes up nearly as much space and not really meant for a travel bag.   There were a couple of minor, but very nice touches that I really liked. The suction cups on the base of the charging stand keeps it solid and secure in spite of the fact that it&#x27;s very light. The other is the velcro strap to keep the able on the power adapter coiled neatly when it&#x27;s not in use.   Because of the limited charge and need for a charging stand, this might not be the ideal traveling companion for road warriors, but otherwise I would give this shaver my highest recommendation. It&#x27;s one of the best values in Norelco&#x27;s product line and I found an excellent deal on this site.</li>
            <li> The product is very nice, and the express is so fast. I help my friend to buy it. My friend think that it is worthy to recommend to them.</li>
            <li> I received this razor for Christmas and had not shaved in a couple of days. It is exactly as described. It was a very close shave and the best part was there wasn&#x27;t any tugs or pulls like previous electric razors I have used. Great Job Norelco</li>
            <li> I switched to electric some time ago when my neck kept getting razor burn.  Regardless, this is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve had.  It&#x27;s lightweight, conforms to you face very well, and really does get the longer hairs with ease.  With other razors I had to keep going over the same spots but this one does it in only a few swipes.  Easy day!  I did not get the cleaning station and I have yet to see what happens when I use shaving cream with it... likely it will not go very well, but I&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
            <li> A year ago my Spectra broke.  So, I got a cheaper Norelco ($80.00) and have been unhappy for the last year.  You only get what you pay for.  I&#x27;ve used a Norelco for over 20 years and the Senso Touch 3D is a great shave.  I have a beard which means I shave only my neck, the hardest part of the shave.  And this razor does it perfectly.  It even shaves cleanly along the beard line without pulling any hairs from the beard.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I only have one caution.  This is not a good razor for travelling.  If you lose the charging stand or break it you forgoe the opportunity to charge the razor until you replae the charging stand.  Yes, it looks good.  But whoever designed the concept did not take into consideration that things can get broken or lost.  There is no more plugging the charger directly into the razor.</li>
            <li> My husband has never liked an electric razor because he has a tough beard.  This one does the trick. He is very pleased and so am I</li>
            <li> It shaves great but I have all these hair particles all over my bathroom counter. You must clean it after each use. This leads to my major issue. The blade retension system sucks and 2 blades have fallen out over 2 months. I have a granite floor and one bounce is all it takes to ruin one blade.  Enough said it&#x27;s $53 for a new blade set.</li>
            <li> I will be brief. While the aesthetics of this 1250x/40 is very pleasant, its day-by-day use is impractical. Not recommended at all to anyone who really needs a shaver!  I bought mine three weeks ago, and I am an international buyer. Unfortunately, I tore the packaging away before boarding the plane back to Brazil. Keep the packaging because you will need it to get a refund/return the product!  1. the charging stand is bulky, fragile and does not secure the shaver firmly. To make it even worse, the stand is required to have the shaver charged, since the power cord won&#x27;t plug directly to the shaver. Thus, if you travel a lot, you will have to carry the shaver, the charging stand and the power cord, but keep in mind that only the shaver fits the carrying pouch!  2. the shaver makes a mess! I will copy Neil E. Lazinsky&#x27;s post here: \\&quot;the stubble does not stay in the shaver!! It is constantly falling out as you shave, especially if the razor heads are turned downward at all, which happens often, including when you try to use the absurdly positioned trimmer, and it makes a big mess! You also have to clean this shaver after every use because of the very small collection chambers\\&quot;. In summary: you  will have hair debris spread all over while shaving!  3. the blades won&#x27;t reach just below the nostrils. Due to a very large plastic border around the cutting heads, I simply can&#x27;t get the shaver to reach the stubbles by my nostrils. I have to resort to my 12y old philips shaver to get the job done...  That&#x27;s it for now. I will keep this review updated as I keep using the product. I hope my unit won&#x27;t stop working all of a sudden as many have reported...</li>
            <li> Had to return it.  My dad said it was mostly plastic and not metal.  He said it took him excessively long to shave his head and face and would sometimes cut.  We bought a Norelco in Costco for have the price.  He says it is better but thinks these razors are not the quality they were years ago.</li>
            <li> Easy to charge, close shave, I don&#x27;t need to bring charger and chord for short trips.</li>
            <li> Great razor,  Very smooth.  Easy to clean and charge.  Highly recommend this product,</li>
            <li> The best electric shaver you will ever find</li>
            <li> Great gift for my friend!</li>
            <li> I had an older Norelco which now needs some parts which are no longer available :( .  I decided to go ahead and get the top of the line 3D shaver and give it a try.  I can truthfully say that even though it was quite expensive, it can give me a very close shave without burning me, I do use Willaims Lectric Shave liquid.  I am so glad now that the parts needed for my old shaver were not available, had to get the new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with the new shaver, you need to open the blades and clean after each use.  Easily done, keeps your blades sharper longer and is also waterproof.</li>
            <li> Great quality. battery has lasted better than any other razor.  Easy to clean close shave.  Beard trimmer works well.  Very easy to hold with the contour</li>
            <li> nice razor, replaced my norelco 8850 from 11+yrs of service, this thing has more flexibility to contour the face, does even better in shaving and i like it.  battery lasts me about a month, less than my last one but i&#x27;d attribute that to this has 1 battery and my other one had 2.</li>
            <li> had it for more than a month now, only used it in dry mode but works perfectly..v easy to clean..just rinse and done</li>
            <li> Had the razor for about 3 months...only charging when it indicated it needed it...and it stopped charging all together.  Indicator lights on the handle would flash randomly but would not charge.  Contacted Panasonic via online chat and they sent me a replacement handle without much fuss (although I have to ship the original back to them...prepaid at least).  Unfortunately the new handle displayed the same problem so I&#x27;m thinking the charger is bad.  However, the tell me that parts and accessories are not covered under the warranty.  So I&#x27;m like, the only way to use the razor is to charge it with the charger Panasonic included with the razor, but that&#x27;s not covered......seems pretty ridiculous.  The representative then tells me, well as a valued customer they will make a one-time concession and send me a replacement in 7-10 days.  So I&#x27;ve not had a razor now for a week because they mis-typed my address shipping the new handle....and now another 2 weeks for a charger.  That&#x27;s hard on someone that shaves every day.  The razor works OK when it actually charges...but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready to recommend it at this point.</li>
            <li> I have owned Norelco shavers all of my life and this one is the best ever.  It realy give you a close shave.</li>
            <li> i ordered this product from amazon a couple of weeks back.As usual excellent service delivered to Australia in a week.It has been many years since i used a philishave.In fact my first electric razor was a double head back in the 60&#x27;s. I have wet shaved and in more recent years used a Braun series 5 for the last 7 years and a Remington before that I am 62 semi retired and was not interested in the self cleaning model as i have &#x27;PLENTY&#x27; of time to clean the unit.As usual i read all the reviews before purchasing;looked at the opposition and asked my son who lives in Singapore what he thought of the latest model as he has one.&lt;br /&gt;  on my first shave i thought i may well have to give it a few weeks to get used to the different style of blade as opposed to the Braun and so did not exspect too much initially.I do not have a tough or thick beard but tender skin.(there is no rash whatsoever from the Philips)&lt;br /&gt;  I have used this razor 3 times and am totally blown away by it&#x27;s performance.It definitely does shave as close as a blade or at least the closest thing to it! There is little effort required with pressure to my face as the contour of the razors 3 heads just follows my skin.I timed the shave each time and 2 minutes exactly is the go (The Braun took 4 and i pushed it hard missing bits and pieces everywhere &amp; i did change the blades every year) I can not speak highly enough of this razor and how light it feels on the face ;while doing an incredible job!not missing any facial hair.I have yet to master under my nose even though it shaves close;just feels awkward&lt;br /&gt;  I can understand now why Philips has stuck with the technology of the floating head and round blades over the years.The $60 investment each year for new shaving heads replacement is a small price to pay for such a great unit</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he loves this!!!  He always uses it and it eliminates messes around the sink!! It has cool lights and electronic light display. I would definitely recommended this product.</li>
            <li> On the product page for Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black it says under \\&quot;Amazon.com Product Description\\&quot;; \\&quot;Cordless, Travel-Friendly Design&lt;br /&gt;The SensoTouch 3D charges in one hour and provides up to 50 minutes (or a maximum of 17 days) of shaving time. A display lets you know how much power remains in the lithium-ion battery and when you need to replace the blades.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not true. This model does not indicate shaving time nor how much power remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice if they mention that this info is not for this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Amazon after I bought the razor and found this out. Answer from Amazon Rep \\&quot;Sorry we base or description on Manufacturer website. But our razor is cheaper. You like to return so do it\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry but it says Amazon.com Product Description not Norelco Product Description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it says under the same headline \\&quot;The SensoTouch 3D is completely cord free, has a travel lock, and comes with a protective pouch, so you can toss it in your bag, briefcase, or suitcase when you&#x27;re on the go. Additionally, the razor features a worldwide voltage function that adjusts automatically from 100 volts to 240 volts AC, making the SensoTouch 3D ideal for international travel\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I guess the never looked at the product. If I follow the advise and toss my SensoTouch 3D in the bag including charger I still wont be able to charge it since their is no way to plug the charger into the razor. It would be nice if they mention you actually also need to take the razor stand with you or you can not charge the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design flaw by Philips. I just hope it&#x27;s easy to buy a new stand in case the plastic breaks. No way to charge without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s right by Amazon how they handled this</li>
            <li> received on time, works very well, close shave. Happy with the 1250x/40 shaver. Have always used a Norelco Shaver. and will always do so.</li>
            <li> This shaver is wonderful!  Top-notch design and easy to use.  Shaves super close.  As an owner of 3 Norelco razors over the years, this is the most impressive by far.  Super long battery life too.  A great buy!</li>
            <li> The style was good for this razor but the shave was inconsistant and we needed to use a regular razor what a disaapointment. This happened with both wet and dry shaves. It left alot of hair, I am an afro american male It might work for other ethnicities.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco died (after a good, long life), so I upgraded to this one. I&#x27;m very happy that I paid a little more because this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. It makes for a very close, comfortable shave, is easy to clean, has great battery life, and is fairly compact.</li>
            <li> big difference between senso 2D and 3D really liked it. very smooth, less burn and clean shave. I would sure suggest any one to try 3D one. bit price but worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace an aging Norelco Speed 8150XL shaver that I&#x27;ve had for many years now.  The SensoTouch is much quieter which is nice; especially when getting close to my ear I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going deaf anymore.  The heads cut well, I think just as good as the 8150.  One thing I have noticed though is that I need to wet shave now rather than dry shave like I did with the 8150; I get too much irritation on my neck dry shaving with the SensoTouch.  And I still get the irritation after the recommended \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period.  It is no big deal as I just use shaving gel for sensitive skin and afterwards I have a smooth as butter face and neck with zero irritation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my dad, he had been using the same electric shaver and kept complaining to my mom that it irritated him. Knowing he would not spend this type of money of himself I went out on a limb and bought it after reading the other great reviews. He totally loves it and unlike some of the reviews listed it did not irritate him at all during the first couple of weeks. He says it is very smooth and that you can&#x27;t feel it when you&#x27;re shaving. Having owned other Norelco products the brand still has not let me down and I am glad my dad got a great gift out of it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I get a close shave with this razor and the replacements heads cost 169.00 + shipping, more than I paid for the razor itself...buyer beware</li>
            <li> I was super excited to order this razor because I had never had an electric one before and always wanted one. While it lasted, it was fantastic.  Worked great wet or dry, with or without shaving cream.  And then one day ... nothing.  No charge, no light, no sound ... nothing.  And because I&#x27;ve had it over a year, I am out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking for a great disposable electric razor and money is not an issue, this is definitely the one for you.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Amazing razor for the price. Been using it for almost 2 years, blades are still sharp. Never pulls hair. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have used this style (triple head) razor for many years and at least 4 prior designs from Norelco.  No doubt this gives best, closest, non-irritating shave.  Only negative is the size of charging cradle which makes for a space hog in suitcase if you travel with it.  Not clear why design went to the two contact points rather than a plug but assume has to do with maximum battery config.  Very happy with purchase for it does what is intended - give a terrific shave.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this shaver now i dont see him with much facial hair anymore, before he looked like a bear but this shaver solved this problem.</li>
            <li> I have tried both this shaver and the Braun Series 7-790 shaver and there is no comparison that the Braun is a higher quality product.  The Philips was difficult to shave and keep straight sideburns due to the circular design.  Also, the overall quality of the shave was better with the Braun.  One downside of the Braun is that it is designed not to be used with shaving cream/gel while the Phillips can be used with both.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> The Norelco Sensotouch 3D model 1250x is a good shaver. It works better than my old Norelco smart touch XL. I usually only shave ever other day and this shaver seems to handle that well. My old one did not. I have only used it in dry mode so I don&#x27;t how it works in wet mode. It shaves very close for an electric but it is still new. Have to wait 6 months to see how it holds up. It is a bit awkward to use in the neck area (the reason for 4 stars and not 5). As with the old Norelco you can accidently shut it off with your thub when shaving. Overall it is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this, he gets a very close shave!</li>
            <li> The product has a good performance, but Philips does not satisfy with the global guarantee, I request the Global Guarantee last two weeks in South America, and Philips didnt help me with that. Pls take attencio about that.</li>
            <li> Good things about the shaver: it&#x27;s does the job (eventually), and it&#x27;s very easy to clean. Can be used wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing: on my thick beard it can take 10-15 minutes to get a consistently close shave.</li>
            <li> This thing gets so close, has little irritation, the charge is long, and it feels high quality. Yes I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased my Norelco 1250 November of 2010. In July of 2012 it stopped working. It would not charge. I have owned at least 15 Norelco razors. I alway purchase the top model. My 1250 was used and cleaned every day. I alweay let the razor fully discharge. I had to buy a new 1250 razor. Thgey told me I would received a relpacemant but it was back orded and I had to wait 5 weeks. I asked how can Norelco not have there own product in stock. No satisfactory answer. For 150.00 + tax it should not stop working. I have had xl model and the worked after 20 years. This is a poor model Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I have the earlier model which is 2d I replaced the head after a year and then after 2 years then I guess the motor slowed or the battery wasn&#x27;t as strong so and it pulled So I purchased the 1250x 3d model because they said it did a better job on the neck hairs.  it shaves without the pulling on the face  and neck but not any better than the old model.  I have to look for the missed hairs all over, so I&#x27;m a  little disappointed in the shaver.  The trimmer is noisy but works very well on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;The Package got to me, and the inside package was dented and the styrofoam holder was cracked I do hope that the shaver wasn&#x27;t damaged it didn&#x27;t look like it.  Maybe I should have sent it back but didn&#x27;t want to go thru the trouble if it worked alright.&lt;br /&gt;I did try the shaving creme with the shave and it woked alright and being able to us a hot towel was comfortable but doesn&#x27;t make for a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased the cheaper models (Plug in) and they tear the beard out so I guess you get what you pay for or less than what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I came from a lower end Philips rotary head shaver and decided I wanted the more flexible head.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver was a definite step up, with the Norelco head flexing around the chin and jawline really well.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is good, with one charge giving me two weeks, with one 2-5min shave per day. The charging and cleaning indicators are really useful.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the device is really easily, involving open the three shaver heads and running it under water.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving experience is good, involving minimal pressure, except for the stubborn longer hairs, which can be removed with a little bit more effort.&lt;br /&gt;I do most of my shaving dry, as I am to lazy to use foam or gel. This shaver does a great job and hasn&#x27;t caused me any shaver rash or discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it with foam and it glides really well and maybe does a slightly better job, if not taking a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;The in built beard trimmer is pretty useful and tucks away, so it is almost forgotten.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with electric razors because my beard is rather light.  If I forget to shave the fine hairs were not getting trimmed so I was using two different electric razors. Also I&#x27;ve used electric razors for many years and typically my skin has to adapt to any new products.  If you have a light beard with fine hair this is the razor for you.  It gives me the best shave I have ever had and gets even the finest hairs.  On top of that from day one it has been comfortable.  It is quiet, efficient and even the trimmer is interesting because the razor is so quiet you can hear it as it finds and cuts hairs, it makes a little popping like sound.  I am not young and I get hair on my ears and I know I got them all when I don&#x27;t hear any noise.  It is worth the few extra bucks over any thing cheaper. I tried it with shaving cream and it was interesting but I cannot say it was any better, the shaving cream was old I may try it with a gel type later.  I&#x27;ve had it for two months now and I am just as happy as day one.</li>
            <li> It was hard to consider switching over to this from my trusty Gillette, but the cost of the replacement blades was getting ridiculous. This norelco works pretty good. Took about 3 weeks before I got used to it though, so keep that in mind before you give up early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a couple of issues - despite the sensotouch blah blah, it still can&#x27;t get all the hair on the face. There are still some areas that just don&#x27;t get shaved easily. Yes, running this over and over on the same area will eventually get that remaining stubble, but that is not really desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason I&#x27;m taking away a star is because of the non-availability of the replacement blades for this. While I don&#x27;t need it yet, I will, soon, and am worried that I won&#x27;t find replacement blades. Ugh!</li>
            <li> If you plan to trim your beard or moustache, keep shopping.  The design is great if all you want is to shave your legs with no detail.  The designers of this razor must have been a woman since it ain&#x27;t designed for a man&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> I had an old Philips Philishave and decided to take the plunge for a new one after the power cord was developing dangerous cracks in its insulation!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I did!!&lt;br /&gt;This shaver actually has allowed me to toss the &#x27;blade under the shower trick&#x27; and just use the Philips shaver in front of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has quite sharp blades which means that it cuts really low and gets all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably get an extra replacement head if ordering again, but then, you don&#x27;t really know what improvements might be there in 3 or 6 years time.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway 5 stars from me. really nice shaver and good value.&lt;br /&gt;JB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**8 months later....absolutely no complaints. Still cuts really close and is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Pro: The only really good thing about the 1255x is the noise: 67 db at 6 inches is about a quarter as loud as the Braun Series 7 (79-80 db); with the Braun Series 5 in the middle.  (The decibel scale is logarithmic, not linear.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Abrasion - This was the show stopper.  On my third use, I had substantial abrasion under my chin (also some abrasion on earlier use).  With an electric shaver, it is important to stretch the skin you are shaving and to shave against the grain, as it were.  (Using a Braun, I have cut myself under my mouth, when I failed to stretch, but I have never had significant abrasion.  Rotary shaving is multi-directional, while the Brauns make shaving against the grain easier.)&lt;br /&gt;Charging - This shaver charges only on its stand, which seems OK when you are at home.  When traveling, the stand will be an inconvenience, and it might get broken.  The instructions say to unplug the small wall-wart when not charging - do not charge continuously - another liability.  (I dump my Braun into the more convenient, connected charger/cleaner whenever I am at home.)&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning - Flip open each of the three heads and clean under running water.  Then leave the heads open to dry.  This means you cannot pack it up for travel, and it is more vulnerable to damage when open.  Cleaning in water and air-drying cannot be good for cutting edges.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer - the only trimmer I have tried that is unacceptable for getting those hairs that sneak out my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other:  Fully charged in 1 hour.  Put finger behind a rotor to improve shaving of upper lip.  Can shave wet (not tested); this might be the forte of the shaver, but I want to shave dry.  The 1255x appears to be the same as the 1250x, but with an extra head included.  Philips/Norelco recommends using for three weeks - without using another shaver - as a fair test.  I judged the 1255x could not get as good as the Braun Series 5 with such a test, so I quit.  I was relieved to get back to theBraun.  YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Related products I have reviewed:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0020MMCB6 Braun Series 3 370 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] (Pete: 2-stars)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]] (Pete: 4-stars)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003YJB026 Braun Series 5-550cc Shaver System, Black and Silver]] (Pete: 4-stars)</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver ever created by mankind. I have VERY sensitive skin. Shaving has always hurt even shaving with the grain. This one makes it easier and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much. The only thing is around the adam&#x27;s apple and near my ears but that&#x27;s impossible with me. I have trouble with a straight razor. So, I can&#x27;t really hold that against it. Anyway, well worth the purchase. I love how I can wet shave with it. It&#x27;s easy to clean without the station. I didn&#x27;t get the station. You use hot water when the three circular blade compartments are closed (like it is when you shave) and then cold water when you open the three blade compartments. That&#x27;s it. I wish I would have found this sooner.</li>
            <li> Bought this back in March. Worked great out of the box. 4 months later - here&#x27;s what I think. Pros - still sleek and quiet, does a good job on cheeks. Cons - Don&#x27;t like popping the heads open individually to clean - can&#x27;t seem to get them or keep them clean, leaves long hairs on side burns and under nose, hate the fact that I can&#x27;t plug directly into shaver - need to take stand on trips to recharge. Summary - thought rotary heads would get trouble spots better, was wrong. Going back to foil (Panasonic or Braun).</li>
            <li> First the good:&lt;br /&gt;- The quality of the shave is excellent (I shave in the shower with the water running)&lt;br /&gt;- The length of the battery life is also very impressive. (I&#x27;m frequently away for 2-3 weeks, and I do not need to bring a charger with me).&lt;br /&gt;- The ease of cleaning is also excellent; I simply open the heads and run the shower on them for a few seconds, cleaning everything, after I&#x27;m finished shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad.&lt;br /&gt;- After about 10 months, the on/off button began to stick for me.  Finally it got to the point where I was not able to turn the shaver on or off at all.  Philips quickly sent me out a new shaver as it was under warranty, so good service.  However, now about 11 months later, the exact same problem is occurring with the replacement I was sent.  The on/off button is starting to stick/fail to function.  For the exact same problem to happen twice with different models tells me there has got to be some kind of manufacturing problem with the device.  I don&#x27;t see too many other reviewers complaining about this problem (which surprises me), so perhaps it has something to do with the water where I am (slightly high in calcium), or the fact I shave in the shower.  (Note the instructions clearly do say you can use it in the shower and the shaver is supposed to be waterproof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the high quality shave, and the good service, manufacturing defects mean I cannot recommend this product and I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun shaver for a long time - but the shaving head became faulty - so I have tried the Philips SensoTouch 3D.&lt;br /&gt;The Philips is much much quieter than the Braun, with much less vibration too.&lt;br /&gt;I also found the shave to be much closer than my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;However, the Philips is noticeably larger.&lt;br /&gt;Especially the shaving head - it is much larger.&lt;br /&gt;And you have to shave using an unconventional \\&quot;circular\\&quot; motion.&lt;br /&gt;However, I cannot complain - as it is superior to the Braun - without a doubt.</li>
            <li> Short hairs were easy to cut, and this razor provided a comfortable and close shave. Shaving without water was actually really convenient and helped me get ready faster in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extendable hair trimmer is a convenient and not very powerful, but it works alright for cleaning up side burns with a few presses on the same spot. Also, if one has a longer stubble, one might use the extendable trimmer to do a first pass or to get a pesky long hair or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long hairs on my neck were not cut well by the rotary blades. I tried pulling my skin tight, different patterns, and even flipping the razor upside down to use different blades. I would have to press considerably hard with the head on the skin, pluck those hairs, or use the extendable trimmer in these situations (many times it was a combination).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body of my razor got a white tinge that wasn&#x27;t cleanable after two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor battery is very good. It lasted me over three weeks from shaving every three days or so. I think it would have lasted longer. When charging the product, my razor emitted a high frequency ringing sound. Pulling the razor off the dock and putting it back on a few times caused the ringing to stop, but that noise did annoy me.</li>
            <li> If you like the stubble look this is for you,or if your a female perfect for your legs.  Men need not apply!  Nowhere near a blade!</li>
            <li> it was very good quality and packaged well, it was a present and it arrived right on time and I got it for a great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time electric shaver user--and always Norelco. This is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. The heads follow the contours of my face better than any conventional three head shaver could. As others have mentioned, clean-up is always very easy. Haven&#x27;t tried wet shaving with cream yet, but I&#x27;m getting such a nice shave without that I probably won&#x27;t bother. My only observation is that the sideburn trimmer is not quite as usable as the one on my other razors. It&#x27;s a little harder to use it to trim back the bulk of my sideburns, but that&#x27;s a minor complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a bunch of different 3D models but they primarily differ in the features that don&#x27;t directly relate to the shave, such as the battery life indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never tried an electric, this would be a good choice. Don&#x27;t go cheap. There are $50 coupons floating around for the 3D models.</li>
            <li> It just does not shave well. Perhaps it was made on a Monday or Friday as the old saying goes but I have bought many products from Amazon and this is the first negative I have ever responded with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rev. V.Neil Wyrick</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Very quiet, great shave.  I love this.  Retains charge for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, better than the other 7000 or 8000 philips series shavers I had.  Worth the money, and excellent service from Amazon as always even delivering to Australia. The same model shaver sell for over AUD400 in the local dept stores here in Sydney, Amazon is the way to go</li>
            <li> I found the three top of the line electric shavers - Braun Series 7, Panasonic es-la63, and Phillips Norelco 3D -  to be so similar as to recommend any of them as excellent shavers, but each has its strengths and weaknesses. Too many reviewers are only comparing the closeness of the shave, but that&#x27;s only one factor of several that may be most important. Here&#x27;s my breakdown:    Closeness - Let&#x27;s start with the most popular category. If all you care about is how close you can shave, then I rate the wet-shaved Panasonic and Norelco even, BUT ONLY when coupled with a shaving oil/gel combo such as [[ASIN:B005ACNPLO Remington Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel 5 oz. (Pack of 2)]] (there&#x27;s a cooling menthol version as well). Another way to accomplish the same thing is by using [[ASIN:B0023XF60Q SHAVE SECRET SHAVING OIL- THE BEST SHAVE EVER! 18.75ML]] topped with [[ASIN:B0032ANCUU Edge Shave Gel, Senstive Skin, 7-Ounces Cans (Pack of 6)]]. These provide the closest shave possible, but, of course, it&#x27;s messy, takes a lot of extra time, and can be a general pain. There&#x27;s no advantage in closeness to using non-oil shaving cream by itself.  Going dry-shave, I may give the tiniest of edges to Panasonic over Braun and Norelco, but all three are awfully close  - to each other and in quality of shave.    Speed - If you&#x27;re in a hurry and want to get in and get out with a dry-shave as quickly as possible, the Norelco wins. The Panasonic is next followed by the Braun.    Comfort - I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but the Braun wins out (unless going wet-shave with the oil/gel as described above). The Braun has three speeds so you can go slower for sensitive areas and intensive on less-sensitive places. I just leave it set on intensive all the time and have no problem. The Panasonic is next followed by the Norelco third. The wet-shaving Panasonic and Norelco are the most comfortable of all if you want to put up with the oil/gel prep and clean-up time.    Cleaning - Any auto cleaning system is easier than manual cleaning. Just pop in the shaver and press a button. That said, the Braun is the only system with alcohol in its cleaner to sanitize as well as a detergent to clean and oil to lubricate. Norelco&#x27;s apparently has detergent and lubrication. From what I&#x27;ve been able to tell, the Panasonic solution is only a detergent. Manually, the Norelco is easiest to clean and you can duplicate the auto clean by pouring some of its [[ASIN:B002DHVAZW Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution]] in a dish or mug and whirring the shaver in it for 30 seconds after shaving. The Panasonic and Braun can be rinsed off under a faucet. The Panasonic&#x27;s special cleaning speed makes it slightly easier to manually clean than the Braun.    Maneuverability - If you have a moustache, goatee, beard, long sideburns, or whatever this is a very important category. The Braun is king here with the Norelco second and the larger-head Panasonic last.    Noise - You can hardly hear the Norelco at all. The Braun is a little buzzy and the Panasonic loudest although not irritatingly so. Still, a sleeping spouse nearby will appreciate you using the Norelco most.    Travel - The Norelco is last in this category because you&#x27;ll need to bring the charging stand with you. The Norelco soft case does not hold the stand so that&#x27;s a bit of a drawback. The Braun&#x27;s harder case gives it top honors over the Panasonic&#x27;s soft one, but the Panasonic has an on-off lock that the Braun lacks. Perhaps the Braun doesn&#x27;t need it because the case is harder, and also because the Braun is the only shaver that can run while plugged in with a depleted battery. The other two require a 5-minute charge to give you a few minutes shave. A fully-charged shaver gives you about 50 minutes in each.</li>
            <li> I no longer use my straight razor with shaving brush/shave soap.  This shaver shaves very close and even gets the long hairs on my neck that my Braun electric shaver could not get.  I highly recomend this shaver, you will be happy with it.</li>
            <li> My husband is SO picky about ANY electronics he gets and he really loves this shaver. He says it delivers the fastest cutting speed he has ever experienced, and he is careful to always buy the shavers highest recommended on Consumer Reports. He likes the added perk of the stand having tiny suction cups on the bottom so that it doesn&#x27;t slide around on the counter. He claims of all the shavers he&#x27;s bought, this one is his favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver with a lot of excitement and after reading scores of reviews. But, after trying it out for a few days, I have decided that this will be my first Amazon Return. The shave quality is ridiculously bad in the neck area, even on plain non-groovy areas of the chest (yes, I had to try it). I had to move the shaver in many different angles and it still decided to leave behind a lot of isolated hair! It just seems like it is lacking the power to do the job right. That being said, I think that most $50 electric shavers will provide a better shave than this fancy GyroFlex gimmick. And my experience supports that argument. Do not waste your time and money if you have fairly thick hair.</li>
            <li> I talked to a Philips company rep today about one of their products. He told me that Philips will not and does not support any of their products that exceeds the warranty period. It does not matter if you have an extented warranty or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically I was told that if you expect Philips to support one of their products that you bought from them you might have to hold your breath a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have a policy to not buy any product with a Philips name on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck if your product never fails.</li>
            <li> When my Braun 5000 series shaver died I wanted to get back to the rotary shavers by Norelco. I had never liked the shave I got from my Braun. Since getting the shaver 3 weeks ago my shave times have been cut down by two-thirds. Rarely do I have to go over an area twice and it picks up the hair on my neck as if it were my cheek. It is super quiet and easy to clean. I shave 3 times a week and I am still working on my initial charge from when I received it 3is weeks ago. The shaver is not perfect: the trimmer is a little lacking, the power button is right where my thumb usually rests when shaving, and you can not shave and have it charge at the same time since the only way to charge it is through the charging base. There is no charging plug on the razor itself. I have already recommended this to a friend. I just hope this has the same durability as previous Norelco products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I tried the Panasonic which cut the beard but took multiple passes for a close shave and it was extremely noisy!  So I ordered a new 1250-40 model norelco and now I get the quiet shave and efficiency in beard handling.  Yes you do have to go over some area a few times but that&#x27;s only for the first 10 shaves than your beard adjusts to the rotary shaving and its just a couple of passes to catch everything.  Cleaning the unit is a bit awkward in that you lift each individual head to clean out the hairs (but at least it collects the cuttings unlike the Panasonic which just let them fall in the sink as you shaved).  I like this razor - its my third norelco in 30 years.  Guess I am hooked!  One other noted feature is the SensoTouch 3d heads which move around all the curves of you face and jaw to get to the finny growths on the neck line and around the jawline.  Recommend this over the Panasonic hands down.</li>
            <li> Well, to be frank I bought this razor because I needed a high end electric razor for my chin and mustache areas, Had a $45.90   Amazon Rewards credit to spend. The Amazon Rewards knocked the price down, well, $45.90. Coupled with the Norelco rebate making   the SensoTouch 1250x/40 $75.90 cheaper. Plus, amazon.com as always had the best price on this model and just about everything else under the sun.  The razor arrive within 48 hours. The shipping was free because I am an Amazon Prime customer.  After charging I was surprised to find it shaved under my chin, something no other electric could ever do. The mustache and chin were well shaved with this razor. Had a problem with the sides of my face due to, well, having a somewhat flabby face.  This model was made in 2010 making it about two years old. This ain&#x27;t new but it the latest thing Norelco has to offer. The $30.oo rebate means that there are new models on the event horizon after Xmas I assume. There are no free lunches and no real bargains out there. Razor technology has reached its highest level. Don&#x27;t see a new and improved mousetrap/razor.  The only foible I found with this razor after a few spins around the block (my face) is with the clipping device. It is poor. My cheap Norelco razor for $39.95 has a much better clipping device than this pricy 1250x/40.  All in all I got a pretty good deal with my Amazon Rewards cash. Free shipping.  Less tax to pay too. Have sent out the form for the $30.oo from Norelco already.</li>
            <li> I had an old Braun. I normally use Fusion Manual. But my farther bought one of these and said it&#x27;s really good.  I have to say not quite as close as a blade, but very good. Operation is quiet  I am a bid Amazon buyer, but I found mine on Ebay for $165 with and extra head so I had to go that route.  If you can spend for it- this may be the best electric out there.</li>
            <li> This is the third Norelco razor I have owned.  This one is by far the best, sleek design, comfortable shave.  Amazon had the best price I could find.  I would recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Pros:  1. Shaves Great  2. Ergonomic  3. Looks cool  Cons:  1. Replacement Heads for $60/year!  2. Cant shave with cord when battery is low.</li>
            <li> First time I used it I knew I made the right choice. Great close shave, easy clean can&#x27;t ask for more</li>
            <li> Purchased the 1250x as an upgrade to my 2 year old philips norelco that looks similar in form. The heads on the old one were getting gross and instead of paying for new heads (which can cost as much as upgrading) got this 1250x instead.  PROS:  *Sleek design  *longer battery life than previous generations, good for travel  *can be used wet or dry  *easy to clean flip out heads  *shaves very close without any \\&quot;tugging\\&quot; of the hairs or skin!  CONS  *the pop-out trimmer is actually less useful than the previous gens for me, it is also a bit smaller in size which I see as a disadvantage. The previous models pop-out trimmer actually flipped out and was a decent size. The 1250x trimmer slides out and seems smaller in width which makes trimming sideburns etc actually take longer. As a precision trimmer it works OK, but I much prefer the old trimmer size and pop-out method.</li>
            <li> Smooth, fast, no neck burn, quiet, close shave.  Easy to clean.  Trimmer is only mediocre; both lack of reach and cutting action (less effective than my 10 yr. old Norelco trimmer).  Pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I have owned several electric razors in the past. Went back to \\&quot;manual methods\\&quot;. Doh !  Recently purchased this,,,,,couldn&#x27;t be happier !  Great shave in minutes !  Love using it in the shower !  Great !</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Panasonic 2 blades shaver with this 1250X.  It is a lot more quiet.  I shaved for 4 days and the battery indicator drops by 1 bar out of 3, I think it is  reasonable, although my Panasonic usually could last for 2-3 weeks per charge.  It provides a quick and clean shave.  In order to have a clean shave, the Panasonic design needs to you pay attention to where and the movement to shave.  Rather this Philips 1250X, I could just randomly move it in circular motion, and it does the job, i.e. I pay less attention and have the same result.  Grab design is good, and easy to hold.  It gives me face burn especially at the neck area a lot for the first few shaves, but it is going away.  Overall, it is an excellent shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only catch is the replacement shaver head is very expensive, $60-70!! Beware.  Hopefully I don&#x27;t have to replace it every year as recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for about 30 years, about 25 with various electric razors (usually Norelco). I upgraded this time from the standard Norelco, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;ve had the razor for almost a year, and it still works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves easy, with little irritation. The separate floating blades seem to make it work better and easier than the locked in blades found on most electric razors. It recharges very easy, although if I traveled I may not like the charging stand (although for most travelers it shouldn&#x27;t matter, I get at least ten shaves between charging, probably closer to twenty). I also like being able to clean with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are buying for a husband or father who already uses and electric razor, he will be happy this Christmas. Look for the $20 coupon being offered by Norelco right now (just saw the ad on TV). I think they call it Upgrade and Save. They had the same offer last year which I redeemed, and the check did arrive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any guy who knows how to use an electric razor will love this one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my boyfriend. He likes it, so I like it.&lt;br /&gt;The whole kit includes everything you need to shave.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for the past 20 + yrs. The last being the 8151XL model. It was a good razor but didn&#x27;t get the stubble as I would have liked. I purchased the 1250X/40 model based on tv ads. I purchased this razor on 11/24/12 and I must say, it is the best razor that I have ever used. It does exactly what is advertised. I use a preshave and wet my face when shaving. Takes about 5 to 10 minutes to shave which is about 20 minutes less time than what I was used to. Just wish the replacement blades/head was a little cheaper. I purchased this new razor through Amazon at about $65.00 less than retail including a rebate. Could not have asked for a better experience with Amazon.  Would recommend the razor and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to break away from using a standard razor blade and went with the electric razor when it was on sale. The shave is inadequate in many ways. The razor head is huge and covers a broad area of the face which makes it difficult to see what you are doing causing you to stop and remove the electric razor to see your progress. Because of the plastic around the rotary blades it is difficult to get to the edges of your shave which they tried to solve with a secondary straight razor for the sideburns but still is not good for upper lip area and anything beyond the sideburns. The problem is the shave is not going to be even. I have relatively \\&quot;tight\\&quot; skin and somewhat thicker facial hair and shaving both dry and wet not only took longer than a normal non electric razor but I had to use a normal non electric razor to take care of all the areas missed. Between the bulky head and the uneven shave it is just not a good buy.</li>
            <li> this razor performed as advertised, delivering a smooth and thorough shave.  it hugged the curves of my partner&#x27;s face.  there were no nicks, no misses and the shaver cleaned easily.  I would highly recommend it, especially at Amazon&#x27;s competitive price.</li>
            <li> My past shaver was a cheap Panasonic wet/dry dual blade (ES4026NC).  It was a bit noisy and vibrated a lot.  Shave wise it didn&#x27;t catch strays that well unless I pre-trimmed with the pop-up trimmer.  My once a week or month shave would take up to 30 minutes, at the end of which I would have a cramped neck and sore face.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to splurge this xmas and get myself the 1250x (1255x was the specific box item) from the large bulk membership-required store.  It included an extra replacement shaving head so it was a better deal than elsewhere.  First thing I noticed about the shaver was the cool battery meter.  Instead of the individual LED bars this shaver has a black-out panel that only lights up when charging or when turning on/off.  Very stealth!  Speaking of stealth, this thing is super quiet.  After charging the unit fully I powered it up and proceeded to shave my slobbish face with 1/3\\&quot; hairs.  Pressed the power button... \\&quot;Is this thing on?  Why&#x27;s it so quiet?\\&quot;  Indeed it was on.  Using the recommended circular pattern I watched my face transform from ruffian to gentleman.  Wow, no pre-trim necessary!&lt;br /&gt;Some areas did require more than one pass but I was able to finish shaving in personal record time.  And no neck cramp to boot!  With the impressive results and ease of use I could see shaving being a daily or weekly routine.  More importantly the gf approves of the clean shave instead of prickly stubble or ruffian appearance.  As with all shaving systems they say it will get easier when your face gets accustomed.  I&#x27;m pretty impressed after just one shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice looking, smooth electric razor. It does the job. No skin irritation noted, can be used on both wet and dry skin. I can say that I am not impressed because for this money you kind expecting good quality. I used Norelco SmartTouch-XL 9160XL for 5 years and did not feel significant difference between them except that 9160XL I got for $75. Well, this one was with coupon for $100. So 4 stars for the price, otherwise excellent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know how to shave with electric razor and just want something new I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Description matched performance and appearance. Would highly recommend this razor, especially for people (like me) who are used to a blade and shaving cream. The closeness of the shave does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> It was speedy, no chafing, felt smooth when finished.  I&#x27;m 82, have had several electric razors in the past, and this is far the best.  My previous Norelco looked like this one, but didn&#x27;t give as good a shave.  When I put this one in my old washer, it worked ! !  Had to hold it in with a rubber band but that was a simple fix.  No need to try other brands,  this one gets in every situation and trims the sideburns too.</li>
            <li> Great ....the idea you can shower with it ... recommend it if you are a machine shaver use after shave its a must</li>
            <li> Very happy with this shaver.  I have had Braun and Panasonic shavers in the past and wasn&#x27;t too interested in the 3 head style.  Now that I have bought one, I am very happy with the close shave it gives.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric rajors for over 20 years and this is by far the best. Very smooth yet powerful shaving!! I have had it only for a month now and cannot tell about its durability or long-term performance. But right now it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric razor for my husband after reading several reviews from several websites.  This was on sale at Amazon along with a coupon, so it was about $70 cheaper than at Target or other stores.  My husband says it is a great razor, so we are happy with the purchase and the price!</li>
            <li> Produto excelente. Muito silencioso, não irrita a pele, e deixa a barba muito similar a gilete. O melhor barbeador el&amp;eacute;trico que j&amp;aacute; usei.</li>
            <li> this is my first try at a electric, I am getting older, and the razor, I used all my life, is now starting to take chunks out of my sensitive skin. this razor, does not cut, or irritate me. that was what I was looking for. but it certainly does not shave as closely or as quickly as a razor. does a very bad job on neck area. as it is not important to have such a close shave anymore, it is fine. if you are one that needs a very close shave, the razor is better. the build is very nice, it is not cheaply made. I hope that the blades last, as they are expensive to change. has good battery life, and recharges fast.... as I say, this is my first, so I have no others to compare to..</li>
            <li> Good but not great shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually spend around $60 for a shaver but decided to upgrade and go for a better one.  This is definetely a better shaver than my last $60 shaver but for twice the price it isn&#x27;t twice the shaver. I was expecting to be blown away by a great shaver and wasn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s still good.  I give it four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Close shave&lt;br /&gt;- Quiet&lt;br /&gt;- Good battery life&lt;br /&gt;- Quick charging&lt;br /&gt;- Fits good in the hand&lt;br /&gt;- Can clean by running water over the heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Only operates by battery.  Unlike my previous Norelco, I can&#x27;t run it off the cord.  Once the battery is dead, you have to wait for it to charge to operate again.&lt;br /&gt;- Messier. Some whiskers end up on the counter instead of inside the shaver reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;- Have to clean more often (but at least it&#x27;s easier to clean).&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer is not as good as my cheaper Norelco, but as others have said, I didn&#x27;t buy it for the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;- Bulky for travel. Have to take shaver, stand, and cord/adaptor when traveling.  I usually take my older Norelco instead where I only need the shaver and cord.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I&#x27;m sensitive and get razor burn pretty easy. I&#x27;ve never gotten it with this. My only complaint is that it takes forever to shave with it. I&#x27;d take a little razor burn if i&#x27;d get done shaving sooner. :)</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  However, the recharge stand is bulky and oddly shaped, and thus difficult to pack for business trips.  ....and, the catch is that the shaver cannot be recharged without using the stand, i.e., there is no plug on the shaver to recharge it (the electrical contacts are at two metallic points on the side of the shaver, which is contacting with the stand).  This is done to prevent you from shaving while plugging in the shaver, that is, if for some reason the shaver batteries die and cannot be recharged, you MUST throw away the shaver...and thus buy another one.  But it will not be a Phillips, this does it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the shaver shaves very, very well.  So far, the batteries are behaving fine.  Fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father who recently had a stroke and was having trouble shaving his own face. My father is able to handle this shaver due to it&#x27;s light weight and slim design. Needless to say we&#x27;ll take any help we can get and this item has been a huge improvement for my father. As I said , it&#x27;s very light, very slim and the battery charge lasts through over a dozen uses (which for my father now are long, slow shaves). I am very glad I chose this product over all the others and I would highly recommend this to anyone. I am buying one for myself soon too :)</li>
            <li> It really works well.  I have been disappointed with all previous electric razors; however I prefer them when I travel—just easier.  I bought this for an upcoming trip and followed the instructions and it really is quick and easy.  Doesn’t feel like it is doing anything but it is.  I recommend if you want an electric.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. I came from about 20 years of using Panasonics and find that the Norelco 1240/50 to be a worthy successor. The only issue I have is that it&#x27;s a bit challenging to accurately shave up to the bottom of my sideburns. I suppose I&#x27;ll either figure it out or just use a razor blade to finish off. Having said that however, this shaver gets a lot closer than any Panasonic I&#x27;ve ever used. Also the shave lasts longer, no shadow till much later in the day. It&#x27;s also a very quiet machine which was a little hard to get used to initially. The Panasonics are like lawn movers in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I like this far more as a wet shaver than dry, it doesn&#x27;t get as close in dry mode, but this might just be a personal thing.&lt;br /&gt;Reason I can&#x27;t go 5 stars is the sideburn/edge trimming issue, and I&#x27;d like it to be able to dry shave better.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m happy with this item.</li>
            <li> Good price for this electric razor. The best shave of my life. Does not hurt you. You can do it every day and your whole life is going to turn better.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent purches.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buy in China.Very satisfied.I do not know what to say.Words are not enough,I must be crazy to write whose down.</li>
            <li> i have been using a razor for quite awhile now and if your buying this to replace that...forget about it. if your buying to take on trips or for in the car to clean up before work..date..etc then itl work just fine. pulls a litl bit too so i returned it and i im back to my old ways.</li>
            <li> Have used it for 3 weeks....the battery has not needed a recharge yet...but I only shave every 2-3 days.  But that is what I love about it...my foil shavers would just yank my whiskers out when they were long.  I had to use a beard shaver first then the foil shaver.  Then follow up with a regular razor to get a smooth finish.  That&#x27;s 3 shaves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor easily handles the long whiskers and does 90% of my face very close.  I still clean up a bit with my regular razor...but just a few quick spots that aren&#x27;t really needed if I was in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great dry or wet in the shower too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok but i dont think the shave is as close as my old norelco. not really what i exspected.</li>
            <li> Very deep shaver once your beard is used to it. I have a hard bear and must shave daily. Dry shaving leaves my skin red, corrected using shaving gel and after save</li>
            <li> It is Philips, matches my expectation. smooth, quiet, but solid. Shipping was fast, the travel case is something good to have. Generally like it very much.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be an upgrade from the d model, but honestly after using it for a few months I want my 2d back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the way the trimmer is designed and the charger is nicer but I felt I got a better shave with the 2d this replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sensotouch 3d does a good enough job, but if I was going to buy another electric razor I would go back to the 2d models.</li>
            <li> I love my first time ever electric razor.. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. I can finally shave every day with little to no irritation.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product, It gives a close shave and does not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricy, (almost $200), but it is of good quality. I had it for about 3 months now and I cant complain about it.</li>

            <li> The  outsiade  pack  is  good  and  have  foam, but  the  box  of  shaver  is  damaged, I want  to  know  Why?</li>
            <li> Was using a Remington for years and needed to step up. Purchased this Norelco after extensive research. Not sure why, however the razor absolutely chewed up my neck. Brutal. After four days I couldn&#x27;t take it any more and returned the machine. Bought a Braun 5 Series and couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JL, Portland, OR</li>
            <li> Razor works fine. It certainly is more difficult to clean than other Philips razors I have owned in the past. If I had known about the difficulty of cleaning at the time of my purchase I would never have purchased the razor</li>
            <li> Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be disappointed but I am.  I am a loyal Norelco user for years.  I upgraded to this shaver in 2012, after a year the unit stopped working completely, I contacted Phillips, they asked a lot of questions about how I recharged the unit.  I answered correctly as I am one of those people who reads manuals and follows directions.  They shipped me a new handle, now after two more years the unit still runs but will not charge.  Time for a new shaver again.  I will still buy Norelco since I like the features and other shavers I have purchased have lasted far longer.  I actually have a rechargeable unit that is probably six or seven years old that is still running, that I use as a spare.  Shaving quality and comfort of this particular unit were acceptable, not great but not bad,</li>
            <li> It is water proof! very nice slim body, good job Philips, I got 2, never let me down. 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco for many, many years. My last one was the 2D but this 3D is the best razor I have ever had. It shaves closer in all area and takes less time than any other.  I am very well satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> The product (1255X) is different from the one it was supposed to be (1250X).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the aesthetics of this 1250x/40 are very pleasant, the 1255X is ugly, outdated and probably built of lower quality materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t get the product displayed, but another one.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a year with no issues.  Very easy to clean.  Travel with it is a breeze.  Shave is great.  Trimmer works well.</li>
            <li> i like it very much. this thing is doing his job very good. also price was very good, 50 $ discount.</li>
            <li> It gives me a really close shave, but it takes a lot of time to do so. Also the construction feels very flimsy for what I paid for.</li>
            <li> The last time I used an electric razor was on a US Navy Destroyer back in the 50&#x27;s &amp; 60&#x27;s, a necessary, unpleasant task, with the only alternative a messy razor and shaving cream. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in the comfort--not to mention convenience--in the 2 experiences: It&#x27;s like comparing a VW to a Royles Royce. The shaving head conforms perfectly to the contours of your face, takes about half the time of an regular razor, and requires only seconds to clean--just flip up the shaving heads and brush/wash out the residue. I have experienced no skin irritation at any time using this product, and gone are the painful nicks of a razor blade and the drying effects of shaving lotions. I do recommend the 3D model due to its movement in 3 planes, which results in excellent conformation to the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other electric razors and had poor to total garbage for results. This razor is smooth on the face and actually cuts most of my whiskers off. Very good razor.</li>
            <li> It just have little razor edge and batteries run low after a month that I don´t use it</li>
            <li> I use this razor everyday and it does a good job, but doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade. It is an improvement over the traditional style of Philips Norelco 3 head razors, which I had used for decades. Since I got it for 99.99, I would say that it was worth it, though I would hesitate to spend more for it.</li>
            <li> I have used various Norelco shavers for about 25 years. The 1250x/40 worked well and was easy to clean - until it stopped working after only 2 years! When the shaver did work, I think that the shave was not close enough; I was expecting it to be much closer - more like a blade and less like I shaved 12 hours ago. Anyway, when placed in the charging cradle. the shaver doesn&#x27;t charge anymore. I replaced the cradle as well as the cord to no avail - the shaver still refuses to recharge. Does anyone have any ideas regarding an easy fix? Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written an Amazon review before... But this product falls prey to &#x27;Freebie Marketing&#x27; gone wrong... As of this writing (3/24/15), the replacement head costs more than the actual razor itself.</li>
            <li> Hard to get a close shave even with a new set of heads. Got better shave with my old Norelco 9190. Unfortunately the switch gave out.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor ever. Important note if you buy this, you should replace the cutters every 10 months or so as they do dull.  With fresh cutters, this razor cuts nearly as close as a blade - WOW!</li>
            <li> This is the finest electric razor I have owned. I have read complaints about it this model making a mess out the sink and counter from dropping clipped whiskers. This is not the case. The razor is very easy to clean by rinsing in the sink after each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will give you a shave comparable to a sharp flat edge blade but razor burn is likely without using a shaving gel or oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco 1250X for about a month now.  It&#x27;s the fastest razor I have ever owned to date.  It&#x27;s quiet and holds a great charge.  I&#x27;ve only charged it 1 time &amp; it&#x27;s still going.  I have a clef chin which has always been hard to shave and this gives me a really close shave.  It is such a close shave that it takes some getting used to.  It&#x27;s super easy to rinse out &amp; clean too. I highly recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of an electric razor. I have heard and read many reviews about different razors, and how it takes time to get used to the difference between the electric and the basic razor. I was very impressed with the way the Norelco worked with just water, but i found it was much better when using some shaving cream (because i didnt have any electrashave yet). My face felt amazing. I would dare to say that the shave i got was even closer than the kind i normally get from the Gillete Fusion i was using prior. I&#x27;m not sure if it was worth the price, but i would never go back to a regular razor ever again.</li>
            <li> I had not owned an electric razor in many years but have been amazed at how expensive shaving with a blade razor has become.  Have been using the Philips Norelco 1250 for about 2 months and have been pleased with the quality and closeness of the shave.  It will not shave as close as a blade but it gets pretty close and without the occasional nicks and cuts suffered with a blade.  Up front cost is a little steep but over the long haul I feel sure I will save money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for 1 and 1/2 months and love it. I used a braun for 8 years and was satisfied. This Norelco destroys my old shaver.  It&#x27;s light and charges really fast. It keeps a long charge through shaves. I&#x27;ve only shaved dry so can&#x27;t say anything about the  wet shave.  The trimmer in the shaver is horrible.  It&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t have much power.  If you&#x27;re looking for a combo I recommend a separate \\&quot;man&#x27;scaper.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> three heads do not rotate, but are fixed in place and each head will only cut certain size hair,  very poor design , very poor performance.  Would never recommend anyone buy this Product</li>
            <li> This unit is much better than previous Norelcos I&#x27;ve owned especially in \\&quot;angled\\&quot; spaces - I certainly would recommend it as a replacement.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to see this razor was made in the Netherlands! I thought it was trick before I knew where it was made and liked it even more when I found that out. The only thing that could possibly make it any nicer is if it was made in the U.S.A. If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality razor this is it. It gives a really close, smooth shave. I was so glad I did my homework. The real beauty of this machine is attributed to the 3d heads so that it just glides over the contours. Definitely the one to buy.</li>
            <li> Quiet! No loud annoying angry mosquito buzz. Shaves close without irritation. Happy with my purchase. Only negative,and it&#x27;s minor to me, is the three heads open from the center outward. To wash the heads requires twisting and turning the shaver under the faucet. Alas, nothing is perfect. At least nothing I can afford. I&#x27;m sure you would be pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> We have had this razor for a few days &amp; so far both husband and son think it works great. They have been using it dry, but will try wet w/shaving cream soon.&lt;br /&gt;The razor looks like something from a sci-fy movie when you open it to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;The charging base has cool suction cups on the bottom so it stays where you put it, and charges in one hour, much better than the last Norelco we had. We recommend this razor to everyone.</li>
            <li> Everything is fantastic about this product -- except for an absolutely horrible charger.  If you travel, it will break: guaranteed.  It is only meant for a fixed location.</li>
            <li> This is the best electic razor I have ever used.  It gives a close shave, has a long battery life and is so easy to clean.  I would highly recomend this razor.</li>
            <li> I shave every couple of days and this shaver works great in shower with shaving cream.  Smooth, never pulls and cleans so easily by just rinsing heads.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> excellent electric razor. ease of use, and the fact that I can use with shaving cream make for a close shave.</li>
            <li> Best electeric shaver Ever Very fast shave Cleans easy too Holds a charge for a long time Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was literally losing my hearing from my old Panasonic foil shaver, so sound was my primary concern.  I was skeptical of getting a rotary, but the marketing was so convincing, and the reputation for being quieter, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  I&#x27;m happy with it.  It&#x27;s stylish (so what), easy to clean, shaves like a charm, and is SO QUIET!!!  I can actually carry on a conversation or listen to the news while I&#x27;m shaving now!  I keep mine in a cabinet, delicately balanced on its fragile little charging stand, so I have no concern over the travel ability or not plugging directly into the shaver.  If I travel it will be less than two weeks, and since this thing will hold a charge for a long time, I shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about the charge. I have only used it dry, and the shave is not as close as a blade - thankfully!  Blades give me ingrown hairs if I use them regularly, so one reason I use an electric is to NOT shave so close to get ingrowns.  I could use this wet, and I may eventually, and I suspect it would shave very close to blade closeness then - but I use a real blade anyway for &amp;#34;date night&amp;#34; with my wife, when I really need to be smooooooth!  Update after several months...  The pop-up trimmer is pretty pathetic, very narrow, and difficult to get to grab the hair you&#x27;re cutting - it takes as long to trim my sideburns as it does to shave!  Also, I am feeling skin irritation a little more than I did with my old, loud, foil shaver.  But I still love how quiet it is, and it still does the job.  Update after two years...  Well, I can no longer recommend this product.  I went shopping for a replacement head, and the price was astronomical for the original equipment kind - almost as much as the shaver cost!  The new variety of replacement head is widely reviewed as inferior, but more modestly priced.  I said forget it and bought a new Braun, after checking on the availability of replacement parts!  So I just reduced the start from 5 to 2.  I&#x27;ve never done that before, but you need to know.</li>
            <li> Shaver is a good shaver, its nice to shave in shower (I shave my head with it too) works great, easy to clean, charges nicely.  Only issue I have had with it is the charger makes a bit of a wine noise sometimes.. Philips is sending me another charger... so no worries there.</li>
            <li> After getting used to the features of the shaver, I&#x27;ve found it provides a close shave, is exceptionally quiet, and easy to clean. The trimmer is a bit awkward, but better than other shavers owned in past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, the pricing through Amazon beat all other retailers!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cordless and because I can&#x27;t use a regular razor to shave for medical reasons. I love the fact that it is cordless but a far as a close shave it leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver as a father&#x27;s day gift for my husband.  He loves it!  It was an upgrade from a 5-year old Norelco 7000 series model (or something similar).  He says the 3d pivoting head provides the best shave he has ever had.  I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I loved this razor when I first got it - best electric I&#x27;d owned: a quiet, smooth wet shave and a very acceptable dry shave. However... Within 5 months the smooth shave was gone completely, replaced by a head that was biting and tearing my skin. It needed to be replaced a full 7 months before the supposed life of the head! New head &#x3D; brand new shave again - for 5 months. This razor has driven me back to shaving with a blade. My ratings reflect the fact that when everything is fresh and new, the razor works extremely well and is easy to use. But the head wears out too quickly and despite the elegant aesthetic design requiring the entire very expensive head to be replaced two to three times a year (instead of just the blades) is a major industrial design flaw.</li>
            <li> This replaced my two year old Panasonic Shaver. The Norelco is much-much quieter and easier to handle. Charges quickly and I can get a week or more out of a single charge. Others have brought up the issue of difficulty packing the charger stand for travel, which is the ONLY fault of this shaver. It fits the hand easily and shaves quickly. Using a circular motion while shaving improves the results to near that of a razor. I didn&#x27;t want or need the self-cleaning model which adds more cost and accessories.</li>
            <li> I find it very convenient compared to shaving with a razor. Saves me a lot of time. Is very good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Shaves nice and smooth.  Cleans quickly by opening up the petals and rinsing with hot water.  Also very quiet, not the buzz saw of my old one.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor 2 years ago and it keeps performs like new every day.  100% quality product.  When this razor does die then I will definitely buy another exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Gave to my son for Christmas and he can&#x27;t say enough good about the ease and comfort of this razor. Smooth face comfort.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES it!!!  He says it is the best electric shaver he has ever used and he has used electric shavers his whole life.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco razors since the early 50s and this is the best razor they have ever built.</li>
            <li> So far, good wet/foam shave.  Have not tried dry.  Had been using blades for past 10 years.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my Husband. He charged it right away and used it right away. He said it gave a great shave for a electric razor, the best one he&#x27;s every had.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my farther. It is absolutely a great deal! It shipped fast and packaged well. The product works very good also.</li>
            <li> christmas gift for my father in law, it has all the features of his old norelco shaver with some additional features and a new swivel to the heads to make shaving the chin easier, it also comes with a travel carry case and a very nice charging base. He even convinced me that I need one for myself!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor I have ever used.  It truly cuts almost as clean as a hand razor.  My only criticism is that you need a bulky plastic holder in order to charge it.  I really don&#x27;t want another piece of plastic to store.  Philips could have made it a little better if they at least made it into a holder for the razor that could adhere to a vertical surface.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for and he&#x27;s very happy with it. It works really well. Easy to use and it&#x27;s very fast and quiet.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t come with all the bells and whistles as the superior models, but it works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Get any 3D model, and you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;Great job Philips and AWESOME JOB Amazon for sending this in time for Christmas. You guys ROCK!!!</li>
            <li> What you have to ask yourself is: will this Norelco shave better than the one I already own? And maybe a related question: do I want a better shave, or just a new novelty?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gents, I have to say that I don&#x27;t find any real difference between how the model 1250X/40 shaves as compared to my six year old 9195XL. So I am returning the new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very important - get the most out of your Norelco:&lt;br /&gt;1. Shaving technique is paramount.  Using circular motion is the only way to get the closest shave from a Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;2. Change those heads every year - you will feel like you just bought a brand new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to make your Norelco battery last longer, every six months or so make sure you let the battery run down to below \\&quot;0\\&quot; on the charge indicator - until it stops. (This also applies to cell phones or any other rechargeable battery device.)</li>
            <li> I admit that while the design of these shaver had caught my postive attention at first, the purchase price dissuaded me from making the purchase. Recently, after consistently bad shaves with my current shaver, I decided to \\&quot;bite the bullet.\\&quot; Wow, am I impressed! I regret now ever having waited. The manual says it can take up to 21 days for your beard and skin to become used to this shaver, so one should be patient about being satisfied with the initial shaves. My first shave had my face feeling like a babies bottom. It probably took me about a minute to complete the shave. The clean up of the shaver was easy as could be. You simply pop the shaver heads up on their hinge and run warm water through the heads and the well which collects the whiskers. Other positives is that the shaver is very easy to hold with a very light weight. A full charge does take just about an hour as described in the manual. There are several indicator lights on the shaver guiding you when to replace the shaver heads, when to recharge the shave, and when the shaver needs to be cleaned. I would do a TV commercial for this shaver.</li>
            <li> im not sure how it&#x27;s felt when my bf used it but its like a lovely gift on valentine&#x27;s day so far, and im sure that any bf would like it! looks so cool to me! :)</li>
            <li> Bought this razor using gift cards from Best Buy to get Amazon gift cards and it is the best razor ever.  Use dry or in the shower with some Body Wash Gel and smooth as my Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy all over again!!</li>
            <li> Light and cuts clean, flexible. He uses it every day and complain how cheap it is. Good present for father&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different electric razors over the years and have tried most all brands including different versions of wet/dry  but none have given me the close comfortable shave that this one has. Still it is about twice the price of other razors so I was concerned when I bought it about how long it would last. Last week, for no reason I could discern, it stopped charging. To say I was unhappy is an undertatement.  I had owned it about a year and decided to try contacting Phillips customer service. The most I hoped for was perhaps a suggestion of things I could try that would fix the problem.  It was easy to find the website and very quickly I had selected the live chat option and was explaining my issue with a customer service rep.  After some question and answer I was pleased (and a bit surprised) when I was asked for my mailing address and told a new handle would be sent to me.  It arrived by Fed Ex in just a few days and it works perfectly.  They clearly stand behind their product and that kind of support and the overall quality of the device confirms that it was a good decision to buy this razor.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best shaver for men. It is pricey but if you can find a deal on it buy it. I will never go back to cheaper non flex shavers it makes all the difference and the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> I decided to replace my old Norelco razor that had the lotion and ability to wet shave because Philips Norelco stopped supporting it. I was hesitant to purchase this razor because the last one I bought like it was a terrible shave and irritated my skin. Something the lotion helped with. I am really very happy with this razor. It shaves close and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I am quite happy. The only con is that the razor heads can move such that I have caught some of my face between the heads on the corners. I just need to be more carefull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this razor for a couple of weeks, but so far it does everything I want in a razor.  It&#x27;s especially effective in the hard to shave areas at the interface of my moustache and my nose.</li>
            <li> This razor is smoother and shaves closer than any razor I have ever used. The battery life could be a little better.&lt;br /&gt;I give this razor an A+.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;ve always used norelco, but recently read that foil razors are better for sensitive skin and tried one that was good.  I went with the norelco because it was able to shave hard to reach places better.  In the end it wasn&#x27;t worth the constant razor burn and extra time to shave as it often missed hairs.  So I&#x27;m returning it and getting the foil.  Maybe next time norelco.</li>
            <li> Smooth close shave, very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent 0 skin irritation</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after using a Braun for several years and finding it irritated the skin on my neck.  The Philips 1250 is much quieter than the Braun and causes me less irritation. The downside is that, with the irregular head shape and recommended circular strokes, it takes a little longer to get a good shave. I think that this is a good shaver and competitively priced. It has the same 3D heads as any of the Philips 3D line and is the cheapest. Recommended to those who like, or would like to try, rotary electric shaving.</li>
            <li> Never used a electric razor before this one.  Great razor</li>
            <li> I like the shape of the razor. It cuts without pulling and contours to the face well. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I&#x27;ve used my old $50 Norelco.  It is less fancy but the shave is just as close and just as fast.  For that reason, I would recommend the cheaper Norelco.  I still think that Norelco is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Been using this piece for about 8 months now and earlier versions of philishave models for more than 10 years. This is truly the best of the lot I have experienced to date. Does it shave better/ closer than the previous ones? Not significantly :) yep that is a fact. At least not when shaving dry. So why is it better? Several reasons, but the most imp is - comfort. It glides much better over my face than any earlier model I&#x27;ve used for dry shaving. None of the earlier models had a wet shaving option so I wondered why would anybody want to shave wet when shaving dry is so convenient and quick. But now dry shaving is the weekday routine when I&#x27;m rushing to get ready for office and don&#x27;t have much time. But on weekends I prefer a wet shave with Gilette series shaving foam. Aah! Now that is where the difference is really tangible. The comfort is like 3 times more with some warm water and foam. It&#x27;s actually a joy to shave like this as opposed to the daily burden of a dry shave. The finish is twice as better/ closer and the post shave irritation is so much lesser. Other conveniences of this model include the various glowing indicators telling me when the razor needs to be cleaned, charged, etc. The battery life is great! I get about 15+ shaves per full charge. So, if I&#x27;m headed out on a week to 10 day trip no need to carry the charger. It is super easy to clean after a wet or dry shave. I use an old tooth brush to clean it after every wet shave. I don&#x27;t bother cleaning it between 5 to 6 dry shaves, because I don&#x27;t have the time and I don&#x27;t think it is needed else it would indicate that, which it does once in a while. The noise and vibration of the motor is also extremely low, in fact if I have the exhaust on in the bathroom I can&#x27;t even tell that the razor is on or maybe I have a really noisy exhaust :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, while it&#x27;s an older model of the new 3D series it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good but not great razor. I have been using it for quite a while&lt;br /&gt;and it does a fairly good job. My objection to it is that if it does only&lt;br /&gt;a mediocre job on my weak beard how does it do with a heavy beard?&lt;br /&gt;This one is at least 4 or 5 years old and there may be a&lt;br /&gt;better one now.&lt;br /&gt; Listen UP</li>
            <li> Yes, this razor sells for too much money considering it barely outperforms my old razor that is a Philips Norelco 8240XL. Yes, I expected more, performance wise, based on Consumer Reports review, but I was disappointed. Anyways, if you decide to purchase this razor, look for the lowest price around, before you do so.</li>
            <li> I gave this razor a good review initially, but after using it for over a year I have downgraded my rating because it does not work well shaving the hair below my chin.  Those hairs eventually become long and unsightly and I have to use the push out razor to cut them off.  I love the design, the easy cleaning, and the job it does on the rest of my face, but the neck - not so much.</li>
            <li> I never spent so much on a razor before, but I am glad I did! After years of using the cheaper razors, and never getting a good shave, I finally stepped up to the big time. This razor gave me the best shave I have ever had! Very smooth and non-irritating. I would highly recommend this razor. Yes it&#x27;s more, but you definitely get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> This model is a bit expensive, but is worth it, no pull or razor burn. I would recommend it even at the higher price than other models..</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it six stars.It is so superior to any other shaver I have used. Shaves fast,shaves smooth,and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> over the last 12 years I&#x27;ve purchased roughly 6 electric shavers all hoping they will be the cure to leaving my skin smooth and irritation free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this one does leave me with a rash underneath my jawline and neck. I find I have to lightly go over the same spot a number of times just to remove all the facial hair... perhaps this is what&#x27;s adding to the irritation??.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideally I would love a shaver that didn&#x27;t shave so close to the skin level and had a feature that could change how close you&#x27;d like to shave. (this one doesn&#x27;t have that feature)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives. I&#x27;d agree that this shaver is a top quality product and will likely suit the bulk of the population - but if you do have sensitive skin perhaps keep looking?</li>
            <li> Good razer doesn&#x27;t pull hairs like my old one. Wish I could plug it in and use it as well though</li>
            <li> My old electric razor gave me razor burns on my neck.  As the blades got older it got worse.  My neck looked like it was scratched by a cat.  With the 3D razor I have NO razor burn!  I like how the heads contour to the face and I think the the 3D swivel action along with the blade configuration is what makes it all happen.  It takes an hour to charge and lasts me over a month so no need to bring a charger with you.  Extended trips...the charger takes up about as much room as a phone charger.  The three light indicator degreases as the battery life drops and then changes from white to amber red as it gets really low - another nice feature.  The unit is light, fits the hand very well, has a convenient pop up trimmer, and can be used, wet, dry, and in the shower.  Shaving is a pleasure with my new 3D. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month and have been left with nothing but disappointment. Why?&lt;br /&gt;The 1250X SensoTouch 3D began by giving me rashes but I thought that was to be expected trying to get used to a new electric razor, but the rashes, pain and burning continued. The rotary heads are not smooth but pull against my whiskers,especially my upper lip. The rotary heads are not close enough to the edge to do a good job of shaving the upper lip next to the nose, and the heads scrape against the upper lip hair (hurting) and I have to keep going over the same area over and over to get a close shave but it causes a rash and hurts in the process. Because I have to keep going over and over my beard to get a close shave, I find that all that metal on my face heats up and causes a rash and hurts my face, especially my upper lip. For the price, all I can say is this product is ornamental, charges well and is quiet...but I am left to go back to my $30 Panasonic that shaves better, even though it is loud, but my little Panasonic does a better job. BTW, watch out who you get in Customer Service at Philips/Norelco...I did not have the best experience on my second call.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco 7810XL  needed replacment.I purchased the 1150/40 Senso Touch[[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]] and tried it for a few days (not the 30 recommended) and decided that it was OK but not a great leap forward from the 7810XL.So I decided to take the plunge and spend well over $100 for an electric  shaver and got this 1250/40,3D. Only used it for a week but am very glad I spent the extra dollars for it. The third dimension of movement for the shaving heads really does make a difference , particularly on the neck area. My shaves are averaging about two minutes and when done I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what takes some getting used to though.This model(and the 1150/40 for that matter) are not your old fashioned lawn mower type of electric shaver. You know ,turn it on,run it around your face a few times ,turn it of,clean it once a week or so ,and move on. These shavers are much more of a precision instrument,which rewards you with a wonderful shave,if properly maintained. You need to be a little more careful handling it,pay attention to cleaning regularly,like daily,and it will provide a much superior shave as a reward. Cleaning the 1250 ,I would add ,is a snap. Open the three heads brush the interior base ,run the heads under water ,and leave the shaver in the stand with the heads open until dry. Whole process takes less than a minute. One other thing,you really do not need to use any pressure with this shaver while in use. That is what the 3D is all about.Just hold lightly to your face and let the shaver do its thing.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Norelco.</li>
            <li> Picked this up @ Wally World on 9/21 for 149.97!  Shaved with it 3 days in a row, no irritation! That is not something I could have done with a blade....  and considering how easy it is to clean after use, by simply running it under hot water?  Done and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I would (or could) say this about any razor, but I truly love this Norelco 1250x.  I could not be happier with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, avoid the \\&quot;cleaning system\\&quot;, and get this razor.  It&#x27;s all you need, less money, and easier to use.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on Electric Razors before buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is the best value in the Phillips Norelco line.  You do not get a better razor when you buy the higher end models.  2 models up you get about 20% more battery life which is not a substantial difference but in my mind is the only worth while difference.  The LCD and the cleaning system are novel at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is very easy to clean and the display makes it very easy to tell what the battery level is.  I would recommend this unit to anyone.</li>
            <li> Does the job better than my previous Norelco. Only 4 stars because to charge the battery you have to charge through the stand. At home this is fine but to travel it is too bulky. That&#x27;s when I use my older one which charges directly into the razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many of the $40 to $60 Norelco shavers over the years, and they&#x27;ve always gotten the job done.  However, now that I&#x27;ve tried a high end Norelco, I will never go back.  The shaving experience and the results simply can&#x27;t be compared.  Shaving is much quicker and requires less passes over the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face ends up much smoother with less work, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have had it for 3 years now, it is still working.</li>
            <li> My problem is not with the shaver.  The unit is excellent in almost every way.  My problem is with Phillips.  The little plastic protection cover for the blades is very weak and flimsy, and breaks easily.  The airlines and I have broken two and they are $15 each.  They are worth maybe $0.50.  The replacement blades can be anywhere from $60 to $150 depending on where you buy them and they last about a year if you don&#x27;t take them on planes often.  The airlines dropped my suitcase breaking the blades.  At the time it was cheaper to replace the shaver than the blades.  Now it seems the blades have come down to a little more reasonable price, but the fact remains that this is a shaver that works well but must be kept in a very safe place and handled carefully or you&#x27;ll start spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Great smooth shave. Much better than the ArciTec model i had.Philips is an outstanding company having pioneered lot of new products over several decades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a noble quest for the perfect electric razor after finally giving in and shaving my beard of forty years. Needless to say, when you&#x27;ve spent your whole life NOT shaving, grinding away at your tender face with a blade does not produce agreeable results.So I decided to try this Norelco SensoTouch 3D razor based upon the postitive reviews of you fellow-Amazonites. I have learned a very important lesson...some faces are just not meant to be shaved with a rotary razor. I used this with shaving gel and dry, but never got very good results, and it even began cutting my face in certain sensitive areas, namely above the lip. I gave it the ol&#x27; college try for two weeks, trying to get to the magic 45-day trial period nirvana, but I&#x27;m a big baby and couldn&#x27;t stand the constant assault on my mug. I contacted the folks at Norelco, who blew an incredible amount of smoke up my kiester, telling me that this SensoTouch 3D was their finest razor ever, and I should be delirious with satisfaction. I insisted that I wasn&#x27;t, and no longer wanted to apply tissue to stop the bleeding every morning. They insisted I wage war on my face for the full 45 days before I could send it back. Then, Amazon came riding up on the white steed and told me that if I was not satisfied, then send it back for a full refund. Thanks Amazon! I have since purchased the Braun Series 3 Wet-Dry foil razor (from Amazon) and it has changed my life. I can hardly get a full night&#x27;s sleep because I can&#x27;t wait to leap out of bed and stampede to the bathroom to shave. Close, comfortable shave with gel. To conclude, I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product, but it just wasn&#x27;t a winner for me. If you buy it and can&#x27;t make it to the 45-day trial period, return it to Amazon within 30 days and try something else. Best of luck to you all.</li>
            <li> Smooth and quiet.  You can barely hear it.  Close shave.  The trimmer isn&#x27;t all that great, but the floating head shaver is great in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Made well and robust so far; not worth the cost though. Will go back to buying 2-3 cheaper ones for cost of this. Blades are blades and they get dull. The head is very flexible and comfortable. First time i paid more than $50 for a norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Wont do it again.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this shaver. I had been using a blade before this and the shave is a little bettter with that. However, it is also rougher on the face. After using this shaver for about three weeks I find it to be nearly as good as the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery seems to perform as claimed. I don&#x27;t get 17 shaves per charge but I get 14-15. Recharge in about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is very easy. Just rinse under hot water and let it dry. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any build-up in the heads.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]This is at least my third or fourth electric shaver.  Most of them have been Phillips Norelco, None of them shave as well as a blade type shaver.  I will continue to use this last one because of the cost.  Hopeful I will change my mind over time.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years, but have always purchased the lesser expensive models. This time I decided to bite the bullet and go for one of Norelco&#x27;s premium electric razors. I was not disappointed. This razor is unquestionably the most efficient electric razor that I have ever owned. I have always had a problem with whiskers that tend to grow parallel to the skin, and true to claim, this razor actually gets them and most often on the first swipe! Thanks, Norelco - you have ended years of frustration! My only criticism is that the charging stand that has to be used is bulky and does not lend itself well to traveling.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Sensotouch 3D electric shaver was just the razor my son was hoping for. He absolutely loves it.  He has used it dry and wet and in both cases it works beyond what he had hoped for.  Now he&#x27;s a cut above.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver...does an excellent job at SHAVING.  However, I&#x27;m not impressed with the pop-out hair trimmer for trimming facial hair.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to cut at a detailed level...cuts more than you expect, and it makes weird noises when it cuts anything...hard to explain.  But I like the shaver so much that it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> very happy with this norelco model. prefer real blade and cream but use an electric a few times a week to save time.  bought this to replace a near top of the line braun and think this is better</li>
            <li> This razor is not bad. I have only used the cheaper electric razors in the past, including the $50 Norelco triple head shavers and those $10-$20 Remington shavers. I have never been impressed with those as the screens wear out quickly leading to a lot of cuts and irritation.  I have never used the most expensive electric shavers so I could not compare this product to those, however I have used this product for about 4 months and find it very satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-This razor is water resistant. It can be used in the shower with soap or a gel or foam for lather. In a pinch you can use it with just water but having a gell or foam really makes for less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;-You can use it dry and because of the battery it is cordless meaning you can use it in your car or on a bus or train or something.&lt;br /&gt;-It is relatively quiet. It doesn&#x27;t sound like you are tattooing your face each time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;-Battery life is pretty good on this. I charge it probably once every two weeks or less depending on how much its used. Also it charges very fast. If the battery is low or dead you can give it a charge for a few mins that will get you through at least one shave.&lt;br /&gt;-Super easy cleanup. 99% of the shaved hairs stay inside the well under the cutting heads and can be flushed away in seconds if shaving in the shower it cleans as you shave but rinse when you are done anyway.&lt;br /&gt;-Blade life is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Minor irritation, however this is to be expected when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-Like all electrics it will never cut as close as a safety razor but it will get pretty damned close to it.&lt;br /&gt;-Some spots like directly under the jaw bone it seems to have a lot of difficulty in cutting and the skin must be pulled tightly and the razor passed over several times. typically i use a gillete mach 3 to touch up any areas missed.&lt;br /&gt;-In some spots if the skin is especially soft it will not cut the hair, no matter how many times you pass the cutting heads over. in those spots if needed you can whip out a safety razor and knock it out in about 2 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;-Charging must be done on the base you cannot connect the cord directly ( assume this helps keep it water resistant)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the version with a cleaning kit. Totally unneccesary. You can rinse it off after each use and the blades have low friction coatings so nothign is sticking and the cleaning stuff is just a waste of money for a nifty but useless gadget. The carrying case works fine but will not hold the charging cord so shove the cord in a bag or something you won&#x27;t need it often anyway.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years, most have been good, but not great. That is until I purchased this one.  Incredible shave, charge lasts quite awhile. The only problem is that you have to take the whole charging unit with you when you travel. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for years and I found this rotary shaver is designed to give a smooth shave in dry or wet conditions.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors all of my life.  I am now a senior citizen.  This Norelco razor simply will not give me a decent shave, even after shaving for 10-15 minutes.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I´ve got a older model of Philips Razor and I buy this one because I think could be better, but the reality is not, is the same shaving sensation and do the same job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this machine is lighter, the grip is better, the charging time is better than de older model, the charge last longer and the cleaning process is easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is a good product, improved but not change in the shaving sensation.</li>
            <li> Very nice does the job extremely well and the battery life is pretty darn solid.  I can go almost 14 days using the shaver 1x in the morning and occasionally in the evening when I am heading out on one charge.  Like many of these products, you will / should replace the blades maybe once a year or little longer, to keep it performing top notch.  but have had for a while now and no issues.</li>
            <li> Great product overall.  I will say it takes time to get your skin adjusted but once it does the product does well.  Of course everyone&#x27;s skin and hair is different.  Battery last a long time.  As far as cons since it is round and not flat like other razors you aren&#x27;t able to get some spots so I keep another razor that&#x27;s flat so that I can get those tough spots that this one misses.  also if I could do it again I would go ahead and upgrade to the package that comes with the cleaner as cleaning it manually can be a chore and not do very good job.  overall I would buy this again and I am quite happy with the one I bought.</li>
            <li> He was used to the old razors with the gel inside the razor.  That gel was impossible to find locally.  This razor does a good job shaving close without tugging.  The razor can be used both wet (indie the shower) and dry.  Will be a useful appliance. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> i AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE SHAVER, IT SHAVES A LOT BETTER. CLOSER. FASTER, THAN MY CHEAPER PHILLIPS NORELCO.  THE TRIMMER, HOWEVER, IS TOO SMALL AND AWKWARD TO USE.  I WILL USE THE TRIMMER ON THE CHEAPER SHAVER INSTEAD,</li>
            <li> I bought the shaver for my husband because he thought the cutters would be closer to the edge and would shave closer under his nose but not so. With arthritis in his hands it is harder to empty it. This one you have to lift up the three cutters separately to empty and the other one that he had he just lifted the whole top and empty.&lt;br /&gt; It is a nice shaver but for price wise I don&#x27;t think it was worth it for him.</li>
            <li> This razor works exactly as all the promotional information states.  It is smooth, quiet and handles all the bumps and curves with ease.  Cleaning and charging are easy tasks.  The shave you get is not as smooth a blade can produce, but the cut is good enough to look clean shaven.  What more can you ask for in your busy day?</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. I love it and have had some of the best shaves ever. Quiet, easy to clean and holds the charge well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT..I find that the On/Off switch is positioned right where I hold the razor and I turn it off continuously by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that I would give it a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Purchased it because it is supposed to be quiet.  It certainly is.  Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> i already had a philips norelco razor (about 4-5 years old) and decided to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; it. i have to say that this razor is superior in comfort but not too convinced if it provides a better overall shave. at any rate, if you need a razor that works on dry/wet skin, without cuts and fast, this will suffice.</li>
            <li> My husband likes the convenience of no cord when he saves and the way it makes his face feel.  Really has enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> This is the quietest shaver I have ever owned and I have owned many of them. I usualy get Panasonic or Remington or other brands but this is my first Norelco. The shave is smooth and does its job without any iritation. Charging the razor is a simple matter of easily sliding it into a small stand. A power cable is connected to the stand. The charging stand is light and folds up to occupy very little space when not in use. A complete charge takes less than a hour and the shaver displays the status. A case is provided for the shaver which would be handy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A user guide is provided to explain usage and cleaning. The guide covers 6 model types so it can be a bit confusing at first but all the needed information is available and in detail. Overall, this shaver was a good purchase and exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> the product is of excellent quality, meets my expectations and is exactly what you expected, widely recommended this product. Excellent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great razor, but I like the feel of the Arcitec model better.</li>
            <li> Previously bought 1150, very loving husband. Philips product quality is good. Bought the 3D version of this, used as a new year gift.</li>
            <li> I always wanted an electric shaver, but had so many negative comments that I dared not currently shaved faith with mach 3 and ought to look good doing it first from top to bottom and then conversely, was tedious and took a long time to clean the machine, 3D came out and I see this comments but not amazon just anywhere, it had great reviews, but reading two exclusivamentes where one said that he was shaving with razor and test this well I&#x27;m nothing like razor if you like to run and then I read where someone else also shaves like me and the machine remained the same, I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Today I can say that I impreciono, first things easy and fast shaving, second how fast your cleaning and finally as remaining after shave, is exactly like my Mach 3 razor, so I recommend it apart, is satisfaction guaranteed with 21 days for testing and up to 45 to return if you do not like, obviously I did not return. (&amp;#34;Siempre habia querido una afeitadora electrica, pero habian tantos comentarios negativos que no me atrevia, actualmente fe afeitaba con la mach 3 y para quedar bien debia hacerlo primero de arriba a abajo y luego a la inversa, tardaba mucho y era tedioso limpiar la maquina, salio esta 3D y dije veamos los comentarios no solo de amazon sino en la web, tenia excelentes comentarios, pero al leer 2 exclusivamentes donde uno decia que se afeitaba con hojilla y al probar esta quedo bien dije nada mejor que hojilla si le gusto debe funcionar y luego lei otro donde alguien tambien se afeita igual que yo y con la quina quedo igual, dije la compro.&lt;br /&gt;Hoy puedo decirles que me impreciono, primero lo facil y rapido de la afeitada, segundo lo rapido de su limpieza y por ultimo como quede luego de afeitarme, quede exactamente igual que con mi afeitadora mach 3, por eso la recomiendo, aparte, tiene satisfaccion garantizada, con 21 dias para pruebas y hasta 45 para devolverla si no te gusta, obviamente no la pienso devolver.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I needed to replace a 10-year-old Norelco shaver. I first tried a Panasonic, but sent it back because it was big, loud, took longer to clean, and didn&#x27;t shave my beard any closer than the Norelco. Then I got the 1250X/40. The pop up heads make it quick and easy to clean. The floating heads follow the contours of my face better than any shaver I&#x27;ve had before (about 6 of them over 40 years). It&#x27;s quiet and has a helpful indicator of the battery charge level, something my previous Norelco lacked. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with it. As a bonus, it cost less than the Panasonic I tried.</li>
            <li> I am in the military and needed a good quality shaver that would last a deployment and field time.  I took this to Afghanistan and it worked well.  I mostly shaved with it dry and it worked well.  It keeps a charge for a while and I never had an issue with power on this one.  I used canned air to clean it and the little carrying case allowed easy carrying in my assault pack.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad, a 50+ year old man. After several months of use, he said it is a great razor compared to what he used before. It is very comfortable and not that expensive.</li>
            <li> This is actually my first time using a electric razor, and i love it so much!!! I don&#x27;t know how other brand works but the performance of this razor is amazing! Try it and you will not disappointed</li>
            <li> My husband was looking for a new shaver, and had mentioned about the tilting heads.  He keeps a mustache and chin beard, but shaves the cheeks and his head.  I researched several shavers and decided on this one.  He is tickled to death!  Says it is so easy to use, and cuts the hair down to \\&quot;baby-butt smooth\\&quot;.  It really is great.  Thank you VERY much!!</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable and close shaving electric razor that I have ever owned.  The battery just goes and goes and goes, amazing.</li>
            <li> This provides a really close shave. I have tried several electric razors over the years and thought nothing would ever get close to a blade. This one does. Great with or without form.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver, so i don&#x27;t have a reference to compare with, but I really amazed how good this shaver is, as I have a sensitive skin and this shaver did not cause any irritation. I decided to abandon my normal razor and stick with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, i was afraid to buy it as I found that the replacement head costs about $189.99 for the RQ12 considering that it costs more than the actual shaver $179.95 (January 2015).&lt;br /&gt;Second, I was a little bit skeptical about how close shave I will get from this shaver compared to a classical razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I decided to take the risk and try it, and I found that this is the best shaving experience I ever got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very quite&lt;br /&gt;Excellent size and ergonomics&lt;br /&gt;and the most important is you will get a perfect shave even the little stubble will be shaved&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The replacement head costs a fortune as it is overpriced and Philips tries to shift their customers to use the RQ12+ instead of the RQ12 which is completely different head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;Buy it and you will enjoy shaving and hopefully, Philips continue manufacturing the RQ12 replacement head with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I got a little confused, cause I&#x27;m dumb, I thought this was the highest level shaver. It&#x27;s not but that don&#x27;t change the fact that its a quality tool, homeboy gets the job done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my Braun 5710. I liked its fancy look, but 3D shaving is very far from 3D, you cant shave near the nose and the shaving is not smooth at all, but shaves pretty clean. I wear mustache, so it was a problem to shave near them and to trim them. I don&#x27;t know battery life, because after one shaving I return it to the seller and bought Braun 7 Series shaver.</li>
            <li> I started using an electric razor about 15 years ago when I had decided that it was a more civilized way to shave.  I had gone through three Remington Titanium MS3 2700 Washable foil razors.  These units gave me a close shave and I was pretty much satisfied with them.  Recently, I felt that it was time for an upgrade.  I had seen the Norelco 1250x40 Senso Touch 3D Electric Razor and was impressed with the design.  I recently purchased it from Amazon and have been pleased with the entire experience.  The unit arrived in just a few days.  I charged it up and proceeded to take my first shave.  I must tell you that I am totally impressed with the experience.  Norelcos are quiet to begin with but this unit is exceptional and the shave was superior to any electric that I have ever owned.  I had also read that some people were dissatisfied with the trimmer; I am not.  I think that it works very well. I also had no trouble with the blades getting near the hairs near my nose.  I had read about the dry vs. wet shave discussion.  I prefer shaving oil.  I find it to be vastly superior to any type of liquid pre electric shave formulation or shave cream.  I had read about shaving oil on the internet and decided to try it.  I purchased Shave Secret and noticed an immediate improvement.  I was not impressed with the price, though.  I was paying good money for what seemed to be a minuscule bottle of baby oil.  I tried some actual baby oil and found that to be too thick.  I then tried a few drops of some Avon Skin So Soft Bath Oil that I had used as mosquito repellent.  It was absolutely fantastic.  Just make sure to keep your face wet.  Its all that I will ever use.  The combination of the Norelco Senso Touch and the Skin So Soft make shaving an absolutely enjoyable experience.  As far as saving me time shaving, I find just the opposite.  I enjoy it so much that I have added a few minutes each day.  Finally, the shaver is expensive but I think that it is worth every penny that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> For upwards of $200, I would expect more from an electric razor.  The razor looks good, but thats about all it does good.  I used it once with very short stubble, it didn&#x27;t shave worth a crap, and it cut the hell out of my neck area.  It also irritated my skin and gave me ingrown hairs.  Guess I will stick with my Gilette Fusion, it shaves very well, with little or no irritation.  I cannot and would not recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> The razor has a problem staying in the lame cumbersome charger that comes with it.  It does not have a pop up side burn trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot connect the cord directly to the razor if the battery is down.  Do not try to cut a beard over a couple of days growth.&lt;br /&gt;I am very displeased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a present for my father. He is very loving, very pleasant surprise. He said it is very good, very comfortable.</li>
            <li> this razor does it job quite well, i like that its useable wet and dry, and it hold a charge for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Just stopped working after 7 months of use.  It has a 2.5 year warranty but Philips customer service is the WORST!  Have been waiting for a replacement shaver under warranty for almost a month.  All I get are promises but nothing gets done.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY PEOPLE!  BUY SOMETHING ELSE!  It doesn&#x27;t even have a close shave comparing to other competitive products.  Braun series 7 for example has a much closer shave.  So the shaver itself gets one star, but Philips customer support and their warranty promises are just empty words so no stars for them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve HAD ELECTRIC SHAVERS BEFORE,BUT ALWAYS HAD TROUBLE WITH MY NECK.THIS SHAVER TAKES CARE OF THAT AND IT&#x27;S EASY TO CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE LAST ONE FOR ME.AMAZONS PRICE WAS LOWER THAN THE SHAVERS WEBSITE,VERY REASONABLE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is an original replacement heat, feels and cuts like a cheap razor, I am using my old 3 yr old head</li>
            <li> I probably should have wrote this review a few months ago but I have some weird morale conflicts with writing negative reviews. After contemplating, I decide to just go ahead and write a quick description of my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I want to state that I usually buy 1 to 3 products from Amazon Prime a week. Every product I have purchased has been exactly what I expected and the review systems has always lead me to making intelligent and safe purchases. When I began looking for a new (and also my first) electric shaver, I spent several weeks researching and comparing products and the norelco just seemed to be the right buy. I consulted with my hairy men friends and business associates and they told me that they have used multiple brands in the past but Norelco was always the champion in competitions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I went ahead and purchased this little guy and off the bat I was very satisfied. I received the well packaged box, opened it up, ran to my home restroom, and released myself of my facial furriness. I have to admit, the shave was very nice and clean. My girlfriend even complemented me since this was her first time ever seeing my face completely shaved. I then waited about 2 weeks and went to town again. The shave was equally as impressive and easy as the first shave. I was actually so impressed, I went back onto amazon and purchased the Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro. After receiving my new shaver, I retired my original and more expensive shaver for emergency&#x27;s only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I unplugged my SensoTouch and stored it safely into my bottom drawer for hibernation. Several months later, it was time for wedding season. I pulled out my SensoTouch the night prior, plugged it in, and went to sleep. The following morning I went into the restroom to get my shave started and realized, my beautiful animations informing me that my razor was ready for action, was actually missing in action. No information informationshowing, no blinking lights, nothing. I tried unplugging and plugging it back in (This usually works with my windows laptop), but nothing. I tried adjusting the arrangement of the razor with the charging dock, but nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decide to just use the other cheaper razor and just get a close shave instead of the clean shave. I wasn&#x27;t a happy camper and I was more than frustrated. I had to get going so I decided to call norelco on the way to the wedding and try to get some instructions or help. Customer Service told me that my razor that I literally used twice, was now out of warranty and they couldn&#x27;t assist me. I was astonished and they would provide me with absolutely no help. I called in the next day and got the exact same response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for nearly $200 dollars, I received 2 $100 shaves.  I don&#x27;t blame Amazon for this issue but I must say, I feel really cheated by Philips. I haven&#x27;t bought a replacement for the Senso but I will definitely not be investing in another $200 dollar Phillips product in the future. Please be weary of the warranty and be sure to frequently test your product before you warranty expires or you will be in the same predicament that I&#x27;m in.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard, but tender skin. With this razor I obtain a close shave, but with very little if any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> This is bye far the best razor I have ever used, would not even think about buying one of those $60.00 ones ever again, I just can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to get one, the next best thing or as good as shaving with a disposable razor, thinking about getting another one for my vehicle, you can&#x27;t beat the price - thanks Phillips great product!!</li>
            <li> Great product, I like it and brought 3 more for family and friends as gift. they all love it as well.</li>
            <li> Fits curve of face well.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m very surprised to see that this shaver has gone up in price by 30 dollars since this time last year. I&#x27;m due for a new set of heads, and even they are quite expensive. However, it&#x27;s easily justified IMO. I have always gotten ingrown hairs, and this razor has gone a long way in reducing them. In fact, they are almost completely eliminated. I only get them once in a while now, and nothing changed except the razor. You get a truly close shave, but without any irritation. This is a great unit, I only hope I get at least 5 years out of it.</li>
            <li> EVEN BETTER SHAVE THAN MY LAST NORELCO</li>
            <li> Probably one of the worst shaver I have purchased. It burns my skins doesn&#x27;t gives a close shave. Made a mistake that I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;After ordering so many electronic shavers I reached conclusion that nothing beats Gillette.</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this razor&#x27;s durability. This was purchased as a Christmas gift 2012. For the price thought this would be a durable razor to last for a few years. While it works, it&#x27;s great but don&#x27;t  count on it lasting just because it is expensive.My husband travels and this one stayed home and was used a couple of times a week. Maybe used 75 times and was cleaned after using. As a few other longer term users are reporting this one is now toast.  Wish I could say it was just the blades dulling out and not being able to find replacement blades. In our case, the razor overheated while charging and blew up. This razor was treated with care and didn&#x27;t travel.  A high end razor should last longer than a cheaper one and replacement blades should not be obsolete or overpriced while they are still selling the product.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - Since I left a negative review I wanted to update. After realizing we had a two year warranty I contacted Phillips for a replacement. After some negotiation they did send us a replacement razor. Body only no new charger or blades which is all we needed. Replacement came quickly and included a postage paid label to send the damaged unit back. It has lasted almost a year now. So based on that I am upgrading my review from a 1 star to 3 stars. The working razor itself is a 5 but the durability of the first one was poor. I have to give their CS a 5 also.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaving razor from phillips.  I purchased the newer model at Costco and ended up returning that one because it did not cut the hairs on my face as well as this model.  I then purchased this older generation model from amazon.  Phillips no longer makes this model so you cannot get it from them, you have to get it from amazon until amazon sells them all and after that they will be gone.</li>
            <li> The 1250X/40 is a great razor. Close shave, light and very quiet. When I purchased it though I didn&#x27;t realize I was getting a model that did not have a self cleaning system which I like very much. I have a Braun 7 Series as well and while I like the shave and comfort of the Norelco a little better I&#x27;ll probably go back to the Braun as it has the self cleaner. If that feature isn&#x27;t that important to you I think the 1250X/40 beats the Braun 7 Series by a hair (sorry for that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shane</li>
            <li> Very good; significant improvement in comfort and shaving efficiency.  I would give it five stars if the cleaning process were not so cumbersome. I did not purchase the system-too expensive. As my basis for comparison, it replaces a Philips-Norelco SmartTouch XL which I purchased in 2005</li>
            <li> Hard to tell how many electric razors I&#x27;ve bought through the years - 50? 75? Whatever. This is the best I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;So quiet you figure it can&#x27;t have much power. Yet it&#x27;s as smooth and comfortable as one could hope for.  A really close shave with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;  That being said, there are a couple less positive things that are worth mentioning. The trimmer is, perhaps, a bit below average.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make a particularly clean cut for sideburns. And the protective cap was surprisingly difficult to pop into place, and eventually chipped... a little piece of it actually fell off. It seems to be designed so you have to kind of &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; it into place, where usually you just pop it right onto the razor head. Not a well thought out design.&lt;br /&gt;  But... I didn&#x27;t buy it for the accessories, I bought it for the shave.  And in that regard, it&#x27;s top notch.</li>
            <li> At first i bought this razor due to the high ratings, I thought that maybe i should update my old razor with a high-end product like this one. Took my chances and bought it, i was quite happy with the product during the first two months, however it started to \\&quot;not turn on\\&quot;, at first i thought it was the batteries, but after 1 or 2 weeks the razon stopped working at all even after a full night charge.  I dont recomend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update  Jan 24/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent the razor to a local repair shop and they confirmed that the main board was damaged so nothing can be done but purchase a new razor, still, i dont recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I just got it a week ago and I am very happy with it. Shaving is easy and smooth. I had a few Norelco razors in the past and this one is the best!</li>
            <li> Strange design, but easy to get used to. Fast, smooth shave. Trimmer is tiny, awkward to use and noisy whenever it cuts hair. Must clean each unit separately after every shave as there is no room for cut hair to accumulate. Bulky. Expensive.</li>
            <li> The good: quiet... long battery life,nice close shave, easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:  irritates the skin...causes itchy rash on neck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a week and it&#x27;s the best rotary shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  Just switched back from a microscreen.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but starting a blood thinner, my doctor said &#x27;No more blade shaving!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my eye on this model for quite awhile, but just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend so much while not being sure I would even like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a great combination of a $50 off offer from Amazon and another coupon for $30 off from the manufacturer, it made the decision more palatable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say though....THIS WOULD BE WELL WORTH THE MONEY AT FULL PRICE ! [now that I&#x27;ve used it a few weeks]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe it shaves so closely....better than a blade. In or out of the shower, dry shave or wet shave with foam, gel, or just water! AMAZING! Now I&#x27;m a Norelco &amp;#34;lifer&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> I have been through several electric shavers and was about to give up on them because they just didn&#x27;t perform they way I wanted. I have to say, this is the best electric shaver I have owned as of yet! I think this shaver is much better than the Braun series shavers and is what saved me from going back to a manual shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;-close shave with least irritation compared to other electric shavers&lt;br /&gt;-looks nice, and battery lasts me about a week without charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the shaver can only be charged with the stand which is big and clunky making not so great for traveling&lt;br /&gt;-a little too pricey&lt;br /&gt;-the trimmer does not work very well</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about a month now, and really love it. Quick to charge, easy to clean and gives a terrific shave. I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> I tried other electric shavers years ago, but didn&#x27;t like them. I have been using Norelco shavers for the past 25 years now and they just keep getting better. I do have two gripes about this razor though:&lt;br /&gt;1) You have to put the razor on its charging stand in order to charge it. It would have been nice to be able to plug the charging cord directly into the razor. It would have given the razor more portability. Instead you have to lug the razor, which is larger than I expected, plus the cord, and the stand with you when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;2) The razor itself is larger than I expected. My last Norelco shaver, which was very adequate, took up a lot less space in my suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;My wishlist for Norelco - A smaller version of this razor which does not require a charging stand.</li>
            <li> My son just used this razor, and he loves it. He says he would highly recommend this item for shaving.</li>
            <li> The most gental and smoothest shave from an electric I&#x27;ve eved had.&lt;br /&gt;The most expensive razor I.ve bought, but worth it,</li>
            <li> This razor is so much better than its predecessors.  The shave is smooth and not abrasive at all.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had an incredible deal on this at the first of the year.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is amazingly quite and it feels really smooth on my face when I shave.  It&#x27;s almost like a facial massager. It&#x27;s the best shaver I have ever used and I have used a few other electric razors and many of the new multi-blade manual razors.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times now and seems to work great. It is very easy to clean and very quiet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a blade shaver all of my life but have tried from time to time using an electric. Never has one shaved as comfortably, closely and easily as does this.</li>
            <li> This razor is quieter and provides an even better shave than earlier Norelco shavers that I&#x27;ve owned. With the head in place the pop-up trimmer is a little awkward. I like the easy water cleanout of the heads.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.  Wished I had stayed with the more traditional Norelco design.  This one seems more fragile, is less comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t appear to give a better shave.  The travel case is flimsy which is worrisome given the seemingly more fragile design.  It does have an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; lock which is nice for packing it away but this is probably needed with the less sturdy case.  In addition, charging requires a clumsy stand to set the razor in rather than simply plugging into the bottom of the razor.  This is bulky and poorly designed for travel.  It is recommended that the entire head be replaced annually versus just the cutting heads with the traditional model.  This one was probably $50 or $60 more than my last Norelco and I don&#x27;t believe it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This was everything my Dad was looking for in a razor.  He just loves it!!!  He never complains about shaving any more.</li>
            <li> Just bought this shaver from Walmart on the clearance section for $49 and let me tell you I was shocked at the price discount on it!!!! It is an amazing shaver through and through...I have had many electric shavers and always had to resort to the blade razors to make sure it left my face clean. This shaver is different it is outstanding in the close shave you receive from it. The battery life is great 50min unplugged and a 1hour charge. It is also extremely light weight and not bulky fits great in the hand. I would highly suggest anyone looking for a new shaver to look or buy this one no questions asked. . . .be sure to check Walmart in your area to see if it is on clearance as above stated I got mine for less then a quarter of the price. Happy shopping!</li>
            <li> Works very nicely.  I will buy another one and will recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I was unable to register the product at Phillips / Norelco!</li>
            <li> I just bought the 1255x shaver and decided to put up a review on it as well as this model, as this is the smae shaver minus the extra head and silver exterior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is probably the best shaver (shaving-wise) i have had in all 10 years i am shaving so far!&lt;br /&gt;It has a solid build that when dropped, does not break like my old shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It is waterproof (a must for anyone who hasn&#x27;t yet tried shaving underwater). It is particularly good for me as i have delicate skin and begin to get all sorts of spots on my face soon after i shave. I got this shaver at costco for $115 after mail-in-rebate which is a pretty sweet deal considering that the shaver itself is worth more than that and it comes with a extra shaving head replacement! I love the moving heads that help catch all the hairs on your chin, neck and under the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem i have with this shaver is that it is much bulkier than my last shaver and it does dispense shaving cream. Hence the four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that i would recommend this shaver based on performance to anyone that is looking for a high quality shaver for delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I shaved with a Norelco 9160XL for about 10 years before getting this one. I&#x27;ve had this one about 1 month. I like the old shaver better and would probably think seriously about getting it repaired if I hadn&#x27;t bought this one. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this new shaver is nice but not what I would consider an improvement over the old one. Some Cons: the new one cuts just as close but takes more &amp;#34;strokes&amp;#34; over an area to get there, so a shave takes about 25% longer. The new one requires you to charge it using the charging stand, you can&#x27;t just plug the charging cord into the bottom of the shaver like the old one. The new one doesn&#x27;t feel as good in my hand when shaving, a personal preference or course. Pros: Its quieter (but the old one was already very quiet). That&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Great shave&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son for his Birthday Day he loves it.</li>
            <li> The shaver works great. However, I only give it one star because the replacement heads, which used to be affordable, are now outrageously expensive. I chatted with Norelco and they said the RQ12 shaving head has been replaced with the RQ12+, which is almost double the price on their website (and as I write this, not available on Amazon.com).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t trust Norelco with another purchase ever after pulling this dirty pricing trick.</li>
            <li> It works very well and the battery charge seems to last for weeks.</li>
            <li> My husband says it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s ever had! Shaves close and very quiet.</li>
            <li> Does a good job. Good shave wet or dry.  Good price.  Good battery life between charges.  I would recommend. Good buy.</li>
            <li> This is undoubtedly the best and quietest shaver I have ever owned! It seems to give me the closest shave.</li>
            <li> This razor can be used in the shower or at the sink &amp; with or without shaving lotion. Leaves a clean shave and unless you are experiencing extreme temperature change after shaving the Senso Touch is delicate on your skin. If you need to shave quickly under normal circumstance with the avoidance of razor burn this could be the razor for you as it has worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Having sensative skin this has been the best electric razor that I have owned.</li>
            <li> this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned! It&#x27;s quiet, fast, and cuts extremely close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important, It is so cheap, it is priced  385-626 U.S. dollars in China.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my 85 year old father &amp; he has loved it.  This has made him very happy!!</li>
            <li> While this was an upgrade from an electric shaver I&#x27;ve used for the past 10+ years, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase. No electric razor could EVER be as good as a straight razor, but this is a quicker, cleaner alternative for daily shaving before work. By 3 or 4pm, there is definitely a bit of shadow, but that&#x27;s fine for my needs.</li>
            <li> This was a good shaver - not great, but good. I used it for 2 years until it broke (just stopped working one day). I shaved in the shower, so I did not expect much more for an electronic I exposed to the water about 500 times. It gave a close shave, but the rotary head did not last long. I had to change it about every 6 months.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SHAVE. Easy to clean and maintain. Well worth the price. Finally made the right choice in cordless razor. Top Rated</li>
            <li> this more expensive swivel head is not as good as the older cheaper model.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace my old, worn out Philips Norelco razor of over 6+ years.  Since I have had a great experience in the past, I was eager to continue with the Philips brand.  I am very pleased with this razor thus far (over 30+ shave&#x27;s).  It cuts clean, and close, and doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; the hair as much as my old razor did.  I find that the razor head is a bit larger than the previous models, as well as the cutting surface on the head being a bit father inside, leaving a small gap of plastic on the outside.  This makes it harder to reach tight corners of my face (such as directly underneath the nose to cut all the hairs of my mustache).  A little persistence helps me get these hard to reach areas.  I am very pleased, and although I cannot speak of the durability quite yet, I believe and hold faith that this razor will continue to give me the convenient, close shave I have been used to for years.</li>
            <li> its great and does a wonderfull job shave very closely as goor as razor blad and no skin aerations .&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and gives a very smoth shave pluse it is always ready with the recharging stand in place</li>
            <li> This razor runs quietly and gives a close shave. I would recommend it. However, it looks like the head of a praying mantis.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any improvement over my Speed XL , if you are not interested in shaving in the shower, except that it is more abrasive to my face.  UPDATE;  08/03/15   I am retired and did not shave every day but this razor has gotten better and better and now gives an exceptional shave--maybe the blades had to set or something.</li>
            <li> My husband really loves this razor.  It does the job on his tough beard.</li>
            <li> WIth the Norelco,  you can shave blind,  and this 3 D one,  you can be skiing, LOL,  I&#x27;ve used norelco since I was 15, going on 60,  you can never go wrong with this,  a bit high,  but worth every penny,</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy to get this razor. I mean look at the thing... its beautiful.... in a manly sort of way of course. My first shave went like this: I tried a dry shave. It didnt take me long, and the places where it worked i was very pleased. But certain areas on my neck took a while to get. In all fairness the hair on my neck just on the right side never cooperates. But this razor couldnt ever get those little hairs. Stingy Buggers! After about three shaves with this, the razor burn started really flaring up. I tried using light pressure and many other things, but nothing helped stop the razor burn. Then i tried wet shaving with it and tried shave creams, FaceSaver, and a conditioner, but none of this helped either. Razor burn razor burn razor burn. Bad. Also, those little hairs on my neck NEVER cut. So after a month, i returned this and got my money back. Its to bad, cause this thing looks amazing. I have very sensitive skin though, so maybe thats why it hurt so much. Who knows. The perfect shave continues for me though!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. He absolutely loves it!&lt;br /&gt; I touched his face after he tried it today.... OMG! It felt so smooth and really close to a blade shave! I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed so far.</li>

            <li> I love this razor, because it is very light but works great. I should have bought it a long time ago. It shaves very clean and nice. Great company to buy from. I would highly recommend it to every guy to have one.</li>
            <li> Is very nice, comfortable, International brands,Cheap,  good value,&lt;br /&gt;Is very nice, comfortable, International brands,Cheap,  good value,&lt;br /&gt;Is very nice, comfortable, International brands,Cheap,  good value,</li>
            <li> My husband, who has used electric razors for years, absolutely loved this razor.  Comfortable to use, and the shave was very close.  He couldn&#x27;t be happier with itl</li>
            <li> Bought this product, I began to use it, use them very smoothly, very clean shaving, I will come to choose this product. will recommend to my friends to choose this product.</li>
            <li> I Have used Norelco Razor&#x27;s for over 35 years bought this one to replace one I have owned for more than 10 years (it still works but was starting to slow down) I think I will pass it along to my son when he goes to collage. I have been using this razor for allmost a month now, It shaves better then my previous one ever did. The heads flex very well and stay flat to your face making quick work of shaving. I find it to be very quiet with very slight vibration. I have not tried using it wet yet but because you can get this one wet daily cleaning is a snap just open the heads and rinse off. 1 minute tops done! Anyone thinking about purchasing this I can&#x27;t see being disappointed.</li>
            <li> gave as a gift to my son and he loves it. he used his dads now has his own and is happywith it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who is a marine and must be clean shaven everyday. He absolutely loves it! His face is crazy baby smooth, and his sensitive skin has completely cleared of all ingrown hairs and blemishes. I would definitely recommend this! As long as your hair is short. The razor can tug at longer hair.</li>
            <li> This razor gives me a shave so close that I think I will never need to use a safety razor again.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor.  Really does a good job and so easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price, works as advertised. Close shave, tends to pull hairs on neck - but instructions says may take a few weeks to adjust.</li>
            <li> Lifelong Norelco user -- SensoTouch 3D provides THE best Norelco shave I have ever gotten. Don&#x27;t quibble over this, act to get one today, this razor is truly outstanding.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old shaver, panasonic 8103s, this new one is smooth and quiet, and more clearly than panasonic&#x27;s ,  i like it</li>
            <li> Why choose this rating - The product is EXcellent&lt;br /&gt;What did you dislike - Nothing&lt;br /&gt;To whom would you recommend this product - Anyone interested</li>
            <li> Its really great, it exceeded my expectations. Shaving has never been so smooth and convenient. I recommended to many of my friends to buy it.</li>
            <li> Prior to this one, I had the Norelco Cool Skin 7775X; if you don&#x27;t recognize that particular model it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s probably almost 10 years old.  It was a good shaver, but I FINALLY couldn&#x27;t find any more shave lotion to go with it.  So it was time to upgrade.  Norelco had been good to me so I decided to give it another go and found this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it to shave my entire head and face with no soap, no lotion, no nothing and it was the most smooth shaving experience I&#x27;d ever had.  Zero irritation, zero redness, no razor burn.  And I didn&#x27;t even have to use any shaving lotion!  If I had tried to do that with my old 7775X, it would have felt like each individual hair was being plucked from my head with a pair of tweezers.  The experience was only bearable with lotion; not the case with this shaver!  My face and head are nice and smooth and it was extremely convenient not having to lotion-up my whole head and rinse the shaver heads every 10 seconds.  It even gently cut my thick beard hairs and I didn&#x27;t even have to use the trimmer attachment first!  And it had more than plenty enough battery to do my entire head, face and neck and still had power left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only shave once every 2 weeks, because I hate doing it.  It&#x27;s time consuming, uncomfortable, messy and annoying.  This was honestly the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  And I did it in record time too.  So if you&#x27;re like me, and you want a quick, comfortable shave without the mess... look no farther.  This is your shaver.  Expensive?  Yes.  Worth every penny?  Also yes!  GET THIS!  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  it offers a quick and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  it offers a quick and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> What a great shave! Getting into my 30&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been looking for a real shaving saver since I am growing more hair than ever :)&lt;br /&gt;I was looking at Straight Blade and an Electric Shaver and after reading online, despite straight blade being cheaper - went for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. The unit is extremely quiet and of great design. I am a hairy guy and it gets through my whiskers in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the trimmer option too and used it around the side burns and did a good job</li>
            <li> Giving a 1-star review because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Having purchased this product just over a year ago, the &amp;#34;replace head&amp;#34; light is flashing, which is fine, but the problem is that the original head is no longer available and have been replaced by &amp;#34;RQ12+&amp;#34;.  If you check out the review comments for those heads, there are a lot of negative comments.  If Philips made the original head available for purchase too (at a reasonable price), then fair enough.  But one year after purchasing this product I do expect to be able to purchase a replacement head with the same design as the original head.  Actually I would hope to be able to still buy it *several* years after purchase.  The product information says that the redesigned head is superior but, based on the reviews, I don&#x27;t think so, so I would buy the original if I could, but I cannot.  No consumer choice &#x3D; very bad.  Oh wait, I found the original heads on Amazon.  Nearly two hundred dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  When I first bought this shaver there were so many different variants (with/without cleaning, and many other options), that it was pretty confusing.  NOW, it seems that Philips Marketing have nothing better to do than to come up with new names for a product that they already shipped.  Series 8000 now, apparently.  Just as if it wasn&#x27;t already confusing enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Going back to the head thing, this product, if you buy it new on Amazon, shows that the heads are the original ones.  So what, the original head design *is* available and still in production, but only if you buy another brand new shaver??!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the actual product worked well so far, but his one-star review is well-deserved because of the above.</li>
            <li> Did well but there are still little spots were hair will be after shaving. After shaving use back trimmer to cut left over hairs.</li>
            <li> I have to tell you that I consider this shaver useless to me. I waited many years before I would break down and buy an electric shaver. When I read the other reviews on this shaver I figured it had to be great! I bought it immediately. I have to tell you though this shaver does not give me a close shave. It is terrible and leaves many hairs unshaved. I usually have to shave again with a regular shaver. I will not use this shaver!</li>
            <li> This is the worst Norelco shaver I have purchased over many years.  It is not as good as my multiple year old Norelco 8240XL with the original cutters that cost about half the price.  Actually Norelco&#x27;s new shaver performance seems to be going down with time.  It takes a long time to get an even shave and it is next to impossible to shave neatly near the hair line with the extra large plastic shells holding the three blade assemblies.  Cleaning is more of a chore with the blade assemblies on a hinge and each cutter buried deeply within the assembly.  In terms of closeness of cut it about equals my the 8240XL model with its original cutting heads.  In fact I still use it, after, the new unit to finish many shaves.</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver. My husband has tender skin and a totally tough beard. This is the 4th or 5th shaver I have bought him in 8 yrs. They just don&#x27;t make them strong enough for him.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor to replace an older model Norelco that I had for several years because the battery completely died.  The 3D is a nice looking razor and does the trick for giving a close shave in just a few passes.  Because of the pivoting heads, it&#x27;s not as good on the detail as my old fixed rotary was.  The built-in trimmer also leaves something to be desired. However, it does do its primary purpose of shaving the face pretty well.</li>
            <li> Best shave ever after many years of non rated shavers.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using it every time ....... great!!&lt;br /&gt;Joe</li>
            <li> Nice price, excellent shaver .&lt;br /&gt;But I found the warp a little damaged on receiving it,maybe I should choose gift warp?</li>
            <li> This thing is so quiet, so powerful, so versatile and so smooth that I&#x27;ve never experienced an electric shaver like it</li>
            <li> 5 Stars, not because I liked it, but because Philips Norelco offers a 21 day trial and will refund your money if not completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact that this razor can be used wet or dry, but after 3 weeks of daily use, I still could not get a close enough shave and my shaving time  doubled. I was using and now still use a Mach 3 and Schick Quadro alternatingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasted a full calendar week of use for me, and I also had the trimmer attachment to trim my goatee, which I did once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts are this: it&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleft Chin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that I have a cleft chin and I did not even try to shave off my goatee. Razors like these are particularly terrible on my cleft, because I cannot quite get my chin as flat as this razor needs it to be to shave well.</li>
            <li> my man said its the best razor he ever used. battery holds unbelievably long without charging, shaves well, skin is smooth as baby. easy to clean, easy to use. best gift for a man.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this razor.  Uses is most of the time.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of electric razors. It shaved pretty good but not real close. My wife bought this for my b-day about a year ago. I used it about once a week, used a blade razor most of the time. It has now quit working, I&#x27;ve charged and cleaned it every other week (after 2 or 3 uses). Charged and cleaned before our vacation last week. It quit on vacation, so I thought somehow it hadn&#x27;t been charged enough. So when we got home, I charged it again. Now it does nothing. It acts like it is not receiving any recharge. ?? Really expensive for what I got from this electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have a very sharp face features, so most normal shavers would irritate my skin quite easily!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one on a special. It&#x27;s got the basic feats of the more advanced models, without the cost and unnecessary added luxuries.&lt;br /&gt;It has a smaller battery, but at this point (about a year after purchase), the unit has plenty of battery left to shave one week without charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit&#x27;s battery is of good quality, and the unit itself feels pretty solid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no general dislikes on this shaver, except that it is possible to irritate sensitive skin; though skin will be less irritated than with other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;I dry-shave with this unit, and many people are amazed at the hairlength, which is very comparable to blade shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really know how to clean the blades. Eventhough they are self-sharpening, I do notice they wearing out a bit over time. I do not have the expensive cleaning/docking unit that comes with the more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, if I would need to buy a new shaver again, I&#x27;d buy this one again!</li>
            <li> My husband probably waited too long to replace his old Norelco, (they last forever), but he couldn&#x27;t be happier with this model.</li>
            <li> Sideburn trimmer is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have used norelco razors for many many years and never had any complaints until the last two razors I have Purchased.  You cannot properly trim with these new style trimmers.  I have to keep and use my old style razor with trimmer  to complete my shave.  Truly B.S.  The Razor shave the best of all the ones I have had Previously though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST GET THE SIDEBURN TRIMMER SITUATION FIXED OR I WILL BE TRYING A DIIFERENT RAZOR SHORTLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE USED NORELCO EVERY DAY FOR 50 YEARS AND NOW I CAN ONLY RATE THEM AS IT&#x27;S JUST OKAY.  WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT YOUR ENGINEERING AND OVERSEAS PRODUCTION?</li>
            <li> The Phillips Shaver is very quiet and smooth. Although it feels a little cheap plastic, but the overall performance is great. I like the trimmer built in so that it can function well with the shaving head removed. The charging dock is a little cumbersome to carry whilst traveling.</li>
            <li> Not at all happy with this razor.  I will being going back to Remington because I get a much closer shave without so many passes over the same area.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver and ended up returning it, but not through any fault of the device itself (I was looking for more of a beard trimmer, which this is not). It&#x27;s sleek and comfortable and can give you a great close shave. I only had it a few days as, again, I was looking for more of a beard trimmer and this is not that product. My only gripe is that the charger has a short cord, and so it sat perilously close to the edge of the bathroom counter. Otherwise, quality product that I would recommend to anyone looking for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This shave is excellent. It gives you a great shave the first time. No need to go over it again and again.</li>
            <li> Smooth shaving and without the usual razor burn I have encountered in the past with electric shavers. It is a wet/dry shaver. Thus far, all my shaves have been dry. The 3D feature is comfortable and the three heads really cover a lot of ground and make my shaves fast. Cleans easily with water. To sum it up, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This razor, with the floating heads, gives a much closer shave then the older Norelco style, I was previously shaving with.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I was happy with the older model, but when my family gave me this razor as a gift, I was very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;The charger is sort of janky, but the charges last about a month (shaving once per day), So it is not much of a detractor.&lt;br /&gt;The pop up shaver is small, but does the job for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought two razors are Philips, a 1150 and a 1250.As a New Year gift for my friends, they liked.I think there is nothing wrong with my choice.</li>
            <li> Cute and looks good. I bought it for my friend, It&#x27;s light and cute. you can take it when travel.</li>
            <li> Its an expensive machine but well worth it if you loathe the irritation from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives a close shave, looks cool and I consider it to be an excellent investment. I just wish I had bought the version with the cleaning module.</li>
            <li> Not a huuge fan of the circular blade concept, but as long as you don&#x27;t let the hair grow to long this unit definately does the trick with ease.</li>
            <li> Great shave with this razor. It&#x27;s replacing my old Phillips Norelco and it does a much better job! Nice shave!</li>
            <li> Used a Norelco for years but this is the best ever.  Very quite and smooth.  Floating heads work very well. Provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Meets the primary purpose very well, a close shave. One must be careful how you hold it because I sometimes inadvertently turn it off while shaving. Heads have to be cleaned much more often than other Norelco shavers because there is essentially no capacity to hold the shaved hair particles. Good razor, not sure it is worth the high price vs other Norelco razors</li>
            <li> Did not get as close as a blade. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> I love it，but it is a little expensive， I hope it can be cheaper，the cheapest price of it is $100</li>
