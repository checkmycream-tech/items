            <li>I know that the Bundle Monster organizers are very good and have great reviews, but another thing that I love about the Pueen organizer more than the Bundle Monster is the design.</li>
            <li>I have Konad and Cheeky stamping plates and this Pueen set is amazing, I think is as good as konad in everything.</li>

            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this case.</li>
            <li>I love this case.</li>
            <li>So glad I switched to this.</li>
            <li>The bag is cute, does hold my nail plates and it looks like lace</li>
            <li>but if u have the one with cornes you won&#x27;t be able to fit it them in the case.</li>
            <li>I have like 50 or so plates, and this makes it so easy to view and store them all.</li>
            <li>Really easy to flip through all the designs and save room while protecting them now.</li>
            <li>holds all my stamp plates in one places, easy to flip through all the designs and save room while protecting the plates.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s cheap and easy), it works for all of my plates, but</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and so cute.</li>
            <li>It is well made and holds the plates securely, so they don&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li>This fit all 4 of my stamp sets.</li>
            <li>Im super OCD about the lay out of things</li>
            <li>Came fast and is a zipper bag looks durable and easy slide in pockets.</li>
            <li>cuz you can bet I tested that first!</li>
            <li>this case is nice, solid &amp; pretty!</li>
            <li>This case is great for ur round image plates</li>
            <li>Perfect, doesn&#x27;t fit larger or stamp plates that aren&#x27;t round.</li>
            <li>the more plates I get the more heavy the binder gets</li>
            <li>so when Pueen came out with a lace one I was definitely more intrigued…I didn&#x27;t realize though that the lace pattern is a printed pattern, I was expecting an actual layer of lace for some reason</li>
            <li>but I really like it!    </li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t actually lace which is okay.</li>
            <li>Very convenient!</li>
            <li>It has a nice zipper all the way around so there aren&#x27;t any chances of your plates sliding out…I even opened up my case and held it upside down</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really imagine that they would rip.</li>
            <li>Shipped Fast &amp;Looks</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this case because I am a Nail Blogger and my nail plate collection is growing fast!!</li>
            <li>…so I decided to purchase this, and it was worth the extra money.    </li>
            <li>and kind of shook it alittle and only one plate slightly moved, but didn&#x27;t fall out.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the texture on the outside.</li>
            <li>I love that the pages are made of a thick, sturdy material, so</li>
            <li>It is holding all three brands well, though it is a bit heavy when full.</li>
            <li>I really like that the Pueen organizers have slots on both sides of each sheet (can hold 168 plates) as opposed to the Bundle Monster organizers that are only one sided (BM organizers can hold 168 plates as well, but there are only 84 slots).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as descibed but not cheap</li>

            <li> Why would you not buy one of these if you start buying stamping plates?! I love flipping through and deciding what to use. Buy one!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this case!! Second time I&#x27;ve bought them. I can keep all of my stamps organized and it stays looking nice every time. Im super OCD about the lay out of things but this is def great for someone like me.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Would buy again. Great seller. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Love it! Quick delivery and so cute.</li>
            <li> this case is nice, solid &amp; pretty! It&#x27;s exactly as descibed but not cheap quality very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I have Konad and Cheeky stamping plates and this Pueen set is amazing, I think is as good as konad in everything. The plates are excellent quality and the images are sharp and stamps perfectly. Thousands of designs for the nails!</li>
            <li> I am using it to hold my Bundle Monster, Cheeky, and Pueen plates. It is holding all three brands well, though it is a bit heavy when full.</li>
            <li> good quality, easy to find your stamping plates and holds a lot of plates</li>
            <li> Perfect size!  Holds all my plates, even different brands.  Fits my Konad stamper, too!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I received the Pueen stamping plate holder two weeks ago.  It is well made and holds the plates securely, so they don&#x27;t fall out.  Unfortunately,  either due to continuous use or weak plastic,  couple of pockets have developed cracks.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this case. I have like 50 or so plates, and this makes it so easy to view and store them all.</li>
            <li> I wish it had larger pockets on a few of the pages to accommodate multiple size plates. Does its job. I don&#x27;t really like the texture on the outside. Wish it were just plain black but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect, doesn&#x27;t fit larger or stamp plates that aren&#x27;t round. I have 5 different brands and it fits all those.</li>
            <li> beautiful case, well made, and fits all of my plates in them great! (even the random rectangle plates I have can be easily tucked in the back behind the pages) Iam especially happy that the zipper is well made and operates smoothly...cuz you can bet I tested that first!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this case because I am a Nail Blogger and my nail plate collection is growing fast!! I have been using a 1/2\\&quot; 3 ring binder with base ball card sleeves and the no-slide drawer liner, and I really like it (it&#x27;s cheap and easy), it works for all of my plates, but the more plates I get the more heavy the binder gets…so I decided to purchase this, and it was worth the extra money.

I know that the Bundle Monster organizers are very good and have great reviews, but another thing that I love about the Pueen organizer more than the Bundle Monster is the design. I&#x27;m not a fan of crocodile print anything…so when Pueen came out with a lace one I was definitely more intrigued…I didn&#x27;t realize though that the lace pattern is a printed pattern, I was expecting an actual layer of lace for some reason (maybe that was my bad on not fully reading the description? Idk…) but I really like it!

I just recieved this case today and I plan on doing a YouTube review of it within the next week or so, so if you would like to check that out my YouTube channel is [...]</li>
            <li> I love this case. I had a binder with baseball card sheets but it was not sturdy and they would slide out. This is perfect all the plates are very snug. So glad I switched to this. It is smaller than the binder and easier to travel with.</li>
            <li> The bag is cute, does hold my nail plates and it looks like lace but it isn&#x27;t actually lace which is okay. Came fast and is a zipper bag looks durable and easy slide in pockets.</li>
            <li> This fit all 4 of my stamp sets. Very convenient! Really easy to flip through all the designs and save room while protecting them now. I deducted one star because the material can mar if it gets in contact with remover, but they all do that.</li>
            <li> Shipped Fast &amp;Looks Great !!!!!</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend loves this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds and protects as well as organizes all her Stamping Plates in style.&lt;br /&gt;Nice pattern and is good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Reccommended.</li>
            <li> this is well made and great quailty. holds all my stamp plates in one places, easy to flip through all the designs and save room while protecting the plates.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, very happy buyer! (:</li>
            <li> Beautiful case and plates fit perfectly.  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Fits all my Winstonia and Konad plates beautifully!</li>
            <li> These fit my plates and hold them perfectly.</li>
            <li> This case is great for ur round image plates but if u have the one with cornes you won&#x27;t be able to fit it them in the case.</li>
