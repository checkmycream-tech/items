            <li>Excellent makeup remover, lovely light scent.</li>
            <li>I love Caudalie Clensing Water!  </li>
            <li>It is so gentle and it removes makeup, even waterproof makeup wonderfully</li>
            <li>Not at all greasy, works amazing, feels good and refreshing on the eyes.</li>
            <li>I may try the new version too, but why change when you find a product that works great!  </li>
            <li>Very light formula and non oil based.</li>
            <li>Smells very good and natural.</li>
            <li>I love this product because of the ease of use.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better?</li>
            <li>I would probably rinse it off after using it to remove makeup, just to be sure of the cleaning effect.</li>
            <li>Love this makeup remover</li>
            <li>I still love the product because it removes makeup well and doesn&#x27;t leave your face or eyelids greasy/oily like most makeup removers do.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really advertise it, but this is great for removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>i love how my makeup just slides off</li>
            <li>love using this \\&quot;make-up remover cleansing water\\&quot; every day.</li>
            <li>It is so refreshing and hydrating.  </li>
            <li>Mild and effective.</li>
            <li>So easy I can&#x27;t make excuses any more for skipping that part of my regimen before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product works great for me.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I clean my skin and use this, and more make-up reside comes off.</li>
            <li>I have used so many removers over the years, but this one is worth the price!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and takes everything off with one application.</li>
            <li>Even after you&#x27;ve cleaned your face completely, this amazing liquid finds more make up, more dirt.  </li>
            <li>I notice a huge improvement in my complexion when I use this product.</li>
            <li>It is lightly scented and not oily at all.</li>
            <li>I second all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a product I need about a teaspoon of every morning and every night to keep my skin clean, not stripped, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is a product I need about a teaspoon of every morning and every night to keep my skin clean, not stripped, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is also a quick and easy way to wash my face before bed.  </li>
            <li>Super gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It just feels clean.</li>
            <li>Skin becomes clean and it feels grace rather than</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear perfume except on special occasions so</li>
            <li>just right... smells like clean natural air with healthy growing plants (not floral) to me, but more so.</li>
            <li>And it leaves the skin fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Very gentle but gets the job done!  </li>
            <li>My new favorite beauty product.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t think its worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>Non-stinging and smells fresh-</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think that my nose is \\&quot;used to\\&quot; powerful scents or</li>
            <li>At first, I thought that was because I was using it every morning and every night whereas with my old product assortment (none of which I particularly enjoyed using), I was not as consistent and would go to bed with makeup on or skip cleansing in the morning.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought that was because I was using it every morning and every night whereas with my old product assortment (none of which I particularly enjoyed using), I was not as consistent and would go to bed with makeup on or skip cleansing in the morning.</li>
            <li>It is easy on my old skin and takes mascara off without hurting your eyes or being greasy.</li>
            <li>But for everyday quick evening makeup removal or quick morning oil removal, it&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what is described.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any more makeup or gray dirt on the white washcloth</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even bother my super sensitive skin in the slightest!</li>
            <li>Compare to the only other water-like makeup remover I tried and liked, the Camomile eye makeup remover from bodyshop, this product works more efficiently and does not contain benzyl compounds and other chemicals which may be more harmful to skin.    </li>
            <li>, that means it&#x27;s easy, non-greasy and instant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few of their other products, all of which I&#x27;ve liked but the cleansing water is by far the best and the one of their facial skin care line products I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry eyes and this product is so gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>I used a Neutrogena makeup remover wipe and it picked up soooooo much leftover</li>
            <li>But it won&#x27;t get off the mascara really stuck to your lashes.</li>
            <li>Then I run it with light pressure over my entire face, including eyelids and lashes.</li>
            <li>Original Cleansing Water is terrific.</li>
            <li>Takes makeup off better than any other remover that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>And it won&#x27;t deep clean.</li>
            <li>The cleansing effect is probably better than the more expensive brands I tried before.</li>
            <li>I have tested a deep cleanser afterwards, to see how much more gunk might be left on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh on your skin at all and really feels like you are just using water.</li>
            <li>This new stuff literally doesn&#x27;t remove *anything.</li>
            <li>Now, to find a new brand...</li>
            <li>That little bottle lasted almost 4 months with gradually increasing use but the bottle you get from here could last a 6 months or much more, depending upon how much you use each time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I do not use this to remove my makeup when I wear it, I will use one of my regular cleansers first along with my cleansing brush, and afterwards will give my face a pass with this.</li>
            <li>a light green mildly-fragrant solution.  </li>
            <li>Can use directly on eyes.</li>
            <li>I live in a very low humidity area.</li>
            <li>I live in a very low humidity area.</li>
            <li>Apparently, they have changed the formula from the one I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li>But since then, there have been weeks when I have fallen back into my old ways...</li>
            <li>But since then, there have been weeks when I have fallen back into my old ways...</li>
            <li>Better than all the expensive brands by far!</li>
            <li>I wet a new cotton ball with this stuff, swiped again, and it picked up nothing.</li>

            <li> I wet a new cotton ball with this stuff, swiped again, and it picked up nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but it should last for a long time for the 6.7oz bottle.</li>
            <li> I just apply a little from the bottle, which has a small hole in the top, to a makeup pad (I use a white round cotton pad).</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and this seems to calm my skin when it is activated by extreme weather (hot and/or cold).</li>
            <li> I usually get this at Sephora, but they have the new version of this.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my already dry skin.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> I follow with the also beautiful-smelling Caudalie toner and moisturizer, then Retin-A (prescribed by my dermatologist).feel tighter and had the deep-cleaned shininess I get once it&#x27;s dry.    </li>
            <li> Even with that, it removes the \\&quot;excess\\&quot;: any that has fallen off onto your face or undereye and any that is loose on your lashes.</li>

            <li> * time of the month but can happen at any time - typically one to three big cysts at a time).    </li>
            <li> I can not and will not live without this product!</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to my little toilette.</li>
            <li> ever!!&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle, non irritating, not greasy and removes even waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very practised in describing smells so bear with me.</li>
            <li> But if you hate perfumes of any kind, you won&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> there are a bunch of other make up removers that do just as well that are cheaper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth the price--- a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Does not leave your skin oily like other removers.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, this leaves a heavy residue of eye make-up.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other eyemake up removers, this one is not greasy and heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li> That is the only explanation for how useless this recent bottle has been.</li>
            <li> BUT&lt;br /&gt;Makeup Remover Cleansing Water is harsh and  </li>
            <li> A few minutes after using it all the skin it had touched turned pink/red.  </li>

            <li> I love this product because of the ease of use. I do not like to wash my face with a regular cleanser every day, it is too drying and can cause irritation. I received this product as a GWP product. When I used it, I was hooked. It has a very pleasant smell and feeling. It can make my face feel refreshed and hydrated. Just soak a couple of cotton balls, swipe all over face (even eyes) and you will see all the oil and dirt come off.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do not use this to remove my makeup when I wear it, I will use one of my regular cleansers first along with my cleansing brush, and afterwards will give my face a pass with this. It will give some hydration and even remove whatever makeup residue is left over from the cleansing.</li>
            <li> Will never use another makeup remover. Better than all the expensive brands by far! Highly recommend this item! Smells very good and natural. Water based. amazing!</li>
            <li> Just got this product at Sephora today, tried it and loved it. It is so gentle and it removes makeup, even waterproof makeup wonderfully, that means it&#x27;s easy, non-greasy and instant. And it leaves the skin fresh and clean. The cleansing effect is probably better than the more expensive brands I tried before. What&#x27;s even better? Compare to the only other water-like makeup remover I tried and liked, the Camomile eye makeup remover from bodyshop, this product works more efficiently and does not contain benzyl compounds and other chemicals which may be more harmful to skin.    The product instruction says that you don&#x27;t need to rinse it after removing makeup. I would probably rinse it off after using it to remove makeup, just to be sure of the cleaning effect. I haven&#x27;t tried it as a toner but I probably will.   It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but it should last for a long time for the 6.7oz bottle. I would recommend it to everyone, esp those desire non-greasy feelings from makeup removers. Thumbs up for this product!</li>
            <li> Good product and does get the job done. I accidentally got some in my eye and it wasn&#x27;t very pleasant. I like that its not oily. I would recommend this to people but i don&#x27;t think its worth the price. there are a bunch of other make up removers that do just as well that are cheaper.</li>
            <li> Original Cleansing Water is terrific. Mild and effective. BUT&lt;br /&gt;Makeup Remover Cleansing Water is harsh and  stings when using on face.&lt;br /&gt;No expiration date on bottle..could have received an out of&lt;br /&gt;date product. Won&#x27;t buy the makeup remover cleansing water&lt;br /&gt;again. $28 is  too expensive for such an inferior product.</li>
            <li> As a makeup remover - the best!  As a refreshing skin cleanser - the best!  I can not and will not live without this product!</li>
            <li> really great no residue way to remove make up</li>
            <li> Apparently, they have changed the formula from the one I&#x27;ve been using for years. This new stuff literally doesn&#x27;t remove *anything.* I took off my eye makeup with this stuff, washed my face, and there was still a TON left. I wet a new cotton ball with this stuff, swiped again, and it picked up nothing. I used a Neutrogena makeup remover wipe and it picked up soooooo much leftover makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I have a sneaking suspicion that this is actually *just water.* That is the only explanation for how useless this recent bottle has been. Now, to find a new brand...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but this was very irritating to my face.  A few minutes after using it all the skin it had touched turned pink/red.  The redness went away overnight, but the irritation was unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This product has definitely lived up to my expectations. It removes my make up, cleans my skin, and actually improved my overall complexion. It didn&#x27;t even bother my super sensitive skin in the slightest!</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Takes makeup off better than any other remover that I&#x27;ve tried.  Also, smells great and leaves my face feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price--- a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what is described. Very nice feel after using it.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup remover it&#x27;s the best.  Very gentle but gets the job done!  Does not leave your skin oily like other removers.</li>
            <li> I usually use this as a makeup remover or for a face refreshment in between washings in the summer time. I have been using it for a few years now and it seems like they may have changed the formula a bit? The last bottle I ordered doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well (still works, just not as well) to remove my eye makeup. I still love the product because it removes makeup well and doesn&#x27;t leave your face or eyelids greasy/oily like most makeup removers do. It just feels clean.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  I have Rosacea and this seems to calm my skin when it is activated by extreme weather (hot and/or cold).</li>
            <li> Not at all greasy, works amazing, feels good and refreshing on the eyes.</li>
            <li> I usually get this at Sephora, but they have the new version of this.  I may try the new version too, but why change when you find a product that works great!  It is easy on my old skin and takes mascara off without hurting your eyes or being greasy.</li>
            <li> Great make up remover that is very effective for all types of make up I use (non water proof) and has a delicious scent! Very light formula and non oil based.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I love that it is organic. It is not harsh on your skin at all and really feels like you are just using water.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye and makeup remover. They don&#x27;t really advertise it, but this is great for removing eye makeup. It is lightly scented and not oily at all. I&#x27;ve never found anything better.</li>
            <li> Great makeup remover - I use with qtips to remove eye liner - very easy on the eyes.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I clean my skin and use this, and more make-up reside comes off. It doesn&#x27;t dry my already dry skin.</li>
            <li> The Caudalie Cleansing Water is the best makeup remover ever!!&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle, non irritating, not greasy and removes even waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product!!!!</li>
            <li> Even after you&#x27;ve cleaned your face completely, this amazing liquid finds more make up, more dirt.  And it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  Terrific!!!</li>
            <li> Super gentle and effective. Love this product. I have very sensitive skin and this product works great for me. Worth the price</li>
            <li> I second all the great reviews. Sephora was out yesterday so I came hear hoping for a Prime offering before I leave the country for 3 weeks. So I just have to leave a review even though I haven&#x27;t bought it on Amazon. I have sensitive dry eyes and this product is so gentle but effective. I don&#x27;t have to scrub my eyes to get mascara off. I have used so many removers over the years, but this one is worth the price!</li>
            <li> If you have dehydrated skin start using this in place of water and cleanser because your skin will thankyou for it.  I am in my 60&#x27;s and mistaken for 40&#x27;s.  YES, IT WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the name.  Claudalie...all beautiful...a light green mildly-fragrant solution.  However, when it comes to removing make-up, this one is not the best.  As other reviewers have stated, this leaves a heavy residue of eye make-up.  Not a fan.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  Unlike other eyemake up removers, this one is not greasy and heavy feeling.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> i love how my makeup just slides off</li>
            <li> Excellent makeup remover, lovely light scent. Can use directly on eyes. Along the same lines as Bioderma and the YSL water based makeup removers. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Non-stinging and smells fresh- one of my favorites of all I have tried. Easy to apply and takes everything off with one application.</li>
            <li> My new favorite beauty product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months. I started with a small bottle that came with [[ASIN:B00JHIBHLC CAUDALIE 2014 Favorites Set]]. That little bottle lasted almost 4 months with gradually increasing use but the bottle you get from here could last a 6 months or much more, depending upon how much you use each time. I&#x27;m expecting about 9 months out of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using this \\&quot;make-up remover cleansing water\\&quot; every day. I actually look forward to my little toilette. It smells wonderful. I&#x27;m not very practised in describing smells so bear with me. It&#x27;s not overpowering but not so faint that you can barely smell it. It&#x27;s... just right... smells like clean natural air with healthy growing plants (not floral) to me, but more so. But it doesn&#x27;t smell like the scent of your cut flower stalks or anything you&#x27;ve ever actually smelled. You just have to try it. But if you hate perfumes of any kind, you won&#x27;t like it. I don&#x27;t wear perfume except on special occasions so don&#x27;t think that my nose is \\&quot;used to\\&quot; powerful scents or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removes anything except stubborn waterproof mascara. Even with that, it removes the \\&quot;excess\\&quot;: any that has fallen off onto your face or undereye and any that is loose on your lashes. But it won&#x27;t get off the mascara really stuck to your lashes. And it won&#x27;t deep clean. But for everyday quick evening makeup removal or quick morning oil removal, it&#x27;s gentle and effective. I just apply a little from the bottle, which has a small hole in the top, to a makeup pad (I use a white round cotton pad). Then I run it with light pressure over my entire face, including eyelids and lashes. You don&#x27;t have to avoid your eye area; it won&#x27;t sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see what it has picked up on the white cotton pad. It&#x27;s plenty. I have tested a deep cleanser afterwards, to see how much more gunk might be left on my skin. I didn&#x27;t see any more makeup or gray dirt on the white washcloth I rinsed the deep cleanser off with, but my skin did feel tighter and had the deep-cleaned shininess I get once it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a red-haired, fair-skinned woman who&#x27;s 43 and has acne-prone skin. I live in a very low humidity area. I have noticed a reduction in acne since I started using this. At first, I thought that was because I was using it every morning and every night whereas with my old product assortment (none of which I particularly enjoyed using), I was not as consistent and would go to bed with makeup on or skip cleansing in the morning. But since then, there have been weeks when I have fallen back into my old ways... skipping mornings and some evenings... and my acne is still improved. So now I think it&#x27;s the product itself that reduces my acne (worse around *that* time of the month but can happen at any time - typically one to three big cysts at a time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I need about a teaspoon of every morning and every night to keep my skin clean, not stripped, and comfortable. I follow with the also beautiful-smelling Caudalie toner and moisturizer, then Retin-A (prescribed by my dermatologist).feel tighter and had the deep-cleaned shininess I get once it&#x27;s dry.

            <li> If this is used after dropping a makeup, dirt will still come off. Skin becomes clean and it feels grace rather than anything.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is peculiar. However, the invigoration excels a smell. Moreover, it is convenient that it isn&#x27;t necessary to wash away, either.So,It is the best for a long-distance flight,also.</li>
            <li> I love Caudalie Clensing Water!  I&#x27;ve tried a few of their other products, all of which I&#x27;ve liked but the cleansing water is by far the best and the one of their facial skin care line products I can&#x27;t live without.  It is so refreshing and hydrating.  It is also a quick and easy way to wash my face before bed.  So easy I can&#x27;t make excuses any more for skipping that part of my regimen before going to bed.  It is also convenient when camping or traveling.  I notice a huge improvement in my complexion when I use this product.</li>
