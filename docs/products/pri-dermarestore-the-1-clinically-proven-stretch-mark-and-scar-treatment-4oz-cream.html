            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wash the smell off my hands effectively.</li>

            <li>A really nice product.</li>

            <li>so I say to each its own it may work for others</li>
            <li>maybe the 100% honest thing that will work is probably laser removal</li>
            <li>We will continue using as the product does smell nice and has presented no issues with skin sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>I know that you shouldn&#x27;t be ashamed of them but lets be honest here everyone/most people hope and wish there was a remedy.</li>

            <li>and I am loving that my stetch marks are disappearing.</li>
            <li>I have tried using bio-oil, rose hip, pregnancy shea butter</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a skinnier kind of gal, when I was diagnosed with diabetes</li>
            <li>I honestly have to say I like what I see.</li>

            <li>it also has a nice sent</li>
            <li>Nice size bottle too.</li>
            <li>I did receive this cream at a reduced cost for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>wife was thrilled that she had got ridden of her stretch marks, and so was I.</li>

            <li>And I never gets any kind of reaction to products</li>
            <li>Because it gets results that you can see with your own eyes.</li>
            <li>honestly i didnt use</li>
            <li>I read many good reviews on the product; therefore, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I used it very abundantly twice a day for about 3 weeks and then switched to just after I showered and rubbed it in all the way and the results have made me feel much more confident.</li>
            <li>Worth the try!!!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this awesome and effective product!</li>
            <li>Amazingly, after a month, all of my stretch marks have magically disappeared and I&#x27;m feeling very confident on going to the beach and pool now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this excellent product!</li>
            <li>I am really very happy with the result of this product and i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Me being a large guy myself, I also have stretchmarks on my shoulders, as my shoulders outgrew my skin, which makes this product even better as this means that both of us can reduce the amount of stretchmarks on our bodies and finally be happy with what we look like again!</li>
            <li>I have used many products for fading scars and dermarestore is absolutely the best one yet!!</li>
            <li>I will buy it again because it is good :) :)</li>
            <li>It has a very strong scent...</li>
            <li>It has a very strong chemical smell and I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li>I was right!!!</li>
            <li>The DermaRestore is very effective, works quickly, and you gradually notice changes.</li>
            <li>I love how nice this works</li>
            <li>smells good, leaves skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>continued use will prove to be more effective.</li>
            <li>This cream is awesome to help clear the skin, get rid of marks and scars...</li>
            <li>but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good!!!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t use it because the smell gives me headaches because it is so strong!</li>
            <li>I have tried many stretch mark products and this has been the best so far!</li>
            <li>Marks have subsided and skin appears clean and bright</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, i would totally recommend this to anyone trying to get the perfect skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dermarestore for 4 weeks now And tried so many brands before but this one is the best so far</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after having my first child and have been very pleased with its results!</li>
            <li>First when I saw that its GMP certified I was quite happy about the product.</li>
            <li>I am an avid dermaroller user and this cream goes great with derma rolling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li>but this would of been great to have bought &amp; used during my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Very smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>(...... however my stretch marks were very light before I started using this product</li>
            <li>And my skin is very smooth now.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that they will eventually become very light to be noticeable.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, it has helped me tremendously and is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I think you need to use more than 1 bottle to see difference but for the new stretch marks is good!</li>
            <li>Huge difference!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Happily satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>but surely I noticed my stretch marks are going away.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Worked better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>After 2 months I can already see results and already feel much better about my scar.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to read instructions and warning before applying .</li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>I probably should have known better</li>
            <li>Definitely under rated, best stretch mark cream I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Recommending to others, without a doubt.</li>
            <li>Okay let&#x27;s start off with my situation...</li>
            <li>I tried many lotions but none seemed to work.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would be able to reclaim my body after the kids</li>
            <li>I have been eating healthy &amp; exercising</li>
            <li>but this product has not been able to improve my stretch marks</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t called yet though, mostly because I doubt that the product is working.</li>
            <li>It is up there with Barmon&#x27;s Stretch Mark cream and better than Palmer&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The dual use for scars makes it more of a buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this and keep posted if I see any more changes.</li>
            <li>and I didnt even want to look at my belly any more.</li>
            <li>I held off to review until I was sure of the results.</li>
            <li>I am confident most will disappear.</li>
            <li>Others may have better luck</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>Gained some weight so lovely stretch marks decided to pop up.</li>
            <li>I think don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li>No results, used for many weeks applying twice a day.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely satisfied with the outcome – it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Hopefully with continued use I will see more results.</li>
            <li>I have used many stretch mark creams before</li>
            <li>I have tried many creams before stating to help stretch  marks go away and none of them have ever worked like the dermarestore works.</li>
            <li>and I have recommended it to many of my friends who have had child and suffer from stretch  marks also.</li>
            <li>I will be using more of this and continue to use it until I get the results I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>what I did was took a look at the ingredients and was blown away that more people don&#x27;t try this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I sure believe in DermaRESTORE.</li>
            <li>I GOT MORE STRECH MARKS WITH</li>
            <li>But wait there&#x27;s more...</li>
            <li>ok there isn&#x27;t more, it did what it was suppose to do</li>
            <li>Hope and patience always pays. :)</li>
            <li>I WILL UPDATE once I have more information.</li>
            <li>Maybe if two bottles were used better results would come.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks are fading more and the texture are smoothing out.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and hope to see a better improvement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll will be sure to update.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m also working out more</li>
            <li>and I hope for more.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the level of customer service to handle my concerns,</li>
            <li>I have heard about this cream being used by a host of satisfied women in my community.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to say this product really works.</li>
            <li>Love this dermarestore</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after a more extended length of time.</li>
            <li>She says that it works and she has much more confidence now.</li>
            <li>Maybe you need to use more than 1 bottle in order to see results .</li>
            <li>Love the product - it works as it claims.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks got way better</li>

            <li>Hope others have better experience than I did with this product.</li>
            <li>but Im sure that this will if not eradicate all the lines</li>
            <li>It takes a while so don&#x27;t expect it to just magically</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:) :) :) :)</li>
            <li>Most of my life(since a weight loss at age 12)</li>
            <li>I have been using the DermaRESTORE - Stretch Mark and Scar Treatment - The Latest in Skin Repair, for 6 weeks</li>
            <li>just yet more time is needed</li>
            <li>When I apply the lotion twice a day (am and pm), my stretch marks look a lot better.  </li>
            <li>If I skip a day or two, they seem to be more pronounced.  </li>
            <li>it works better than cocoa butter you get at the stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will take more time for them to fade</li>
            <li>After applying it twice a day since i got it, i&#x27;ve noticed that my scars don&#x27;t look so prominent anymore.</li>
            <li>and she already seen her skin improve dramatically, her skin is now 80% more clearer.</li>
            <li>It is like magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>She no is able to go out and where a bikini as if she never had kids.</li>
            <li>DermaRESTORE is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m able to show her my stomach as proof</li>
            <li>Just look at reviews on Amazon and see how many people are raving about this.    </li>
            <li>Getting rid of stretch marks is something most mothers have thought about.</li>
            <li>There is no question that the ingredients in DermaRESTORE are assembled with your healthy skin in mind.</li>
            <li>I am now an official member of the Sexy Legs Club ya&#x27;ll</li>

            <li>She feels more secure and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is strongly scented and will cling to you &amp; your clothing for a day, but the smell is not objectionable IMO.</li>

            <li>Ok, I will be the first to admit.</li>
            <li>Well worth money!</li>
            <li>significantly lightened the scar</li>
            <li>In about a week I saw a significant difference.</li>
            <li>stretch marks have faded significantly since I started using this product 4 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>so when she gets excited about something it is time to take a notice.</li>
            <li>And I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant lightening.</li>
            <li>and so far very pleased.</li>
            <li>So when the chance came to review this product I was really excited.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a significant change on my hips and thighs stretchmarks.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it at the store and it worked</li>
            <li>I saw the difference in significantly diminished stretch marks on my stomach.</li>
            <li>After using it for a while my stretch marks had faded significantly.</li>
            <li>I am using it for 4 weeks and my stretch marks have faded significantly.</li>
            <li>, I was pretty upset about it because those two things are my favorite things to do</li>
            <li>Significant reduction in appearance of stretch marks after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I purchased DermaRESTORE after trying two bottles of mederma, and not noticing any significant improvement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super sensitive to smell, and was glad to find it wasn&#x27;t too strong smelling!  </li>
            <li>Worked amazingly well on a new scar.</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs into my skin and goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Starting to work good, waiting on my free bottle</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not that comfortable posting the pics, but if you have mild stretch marks.</li>
            <li>It really works and good, fast result.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive and I can honestly say that I didn&#x27;t have any side affects from this product</li>
            <li>They are not gone completely, but come on, this isn&#x27;t magic!</li>
            <li>used this derma cream right after my derma roller and am seeing great results a month later</li>
            <li>I would most certainly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a treatment for stress marks or scars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I chose right!</li>
            <li>I have seen 0 stretch marks, I can personally say this is the best product, I recommended this to several friends I knew who were pregnant and were astounded with the results!</li>
            <li>Certainly not the best, but you can say that it’s better than many other products.</li>
            <li>Needed something for a bright red scar.</li>
            <li>my stretch marks are not as bright and are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>Very well i know many people think this doesnt work,</li>
            <li>After gaining 6 sizes in a short period of time, I have a fair amount of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Saw absolute no results, if anything I think it created more stretch marks</li>
            <li>I rushed and bought this product as soon as I came to know that this effectively work on old scars.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this product I love</li>
            <li>Just for reference, one bottle is actually still descent with a good amount of cream still in it</li>
            <li>so glad this is working thanks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily I&#x27;ve done my research and found this latest skin repair cream and let&#x27;s face it, the price is very reasonable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks :-)</li>
            <li>and it is true.</li>
            <li>and hopefully I won&#x27;t be able to see my marks much longer .</li>
            <li>Theres a very noticeable difference in the area now and my hubby even tells me how much better it looks.</li>
            <li>I have stretch marks from some weight gain on my thighs and butt.(sad but true)</li>
            <li>I like to use this cream after I put on some vitamin C serum so that I can get my full results.</li>
            <li>and i have seen a whole lot of improvement in the visibility of my stretch marks :)</li>
            <li>This item works really good would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>After countless research, I discovered lots of good reviews on this product so I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>Good product, still in the initial stages of visible change though.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine recently told me how good this product was</li>
            <li>This product is true, it works wonders on stretch marks and burn marks.</li>
            <li>If you have many stretchmarks over a wider area, you should make a $30 investment in a good dermaroller, like Shessentials dermaroller, and forget spending this much money on a tiny amount of cream.</li>
            <li>but this was good enough for me.</li>
            <li>It also moisturizes my skin, leaving me nice and soft.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>No bad smells.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t stain my clothes and there is no bad fishy smell either.</li>
            <li>Smell is not bad.</li>
            <li>This product works great on old and new scar.</li>
            <li>This was the first product that I tried and I&#x27;m glad I chose right.</li>
            <li>Use cream only two weeks, but I like it, is well absorbed and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The best thing is you can hardly tell that you even had stretch marks in the very first place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing and smooth and you can almost feel it working right away.</li>
            <li>but my other stretchmarks are fading so for that i am really happy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, I don&#x27;t like spending more than $20 for something that seems like fancy lotion, but it&#x27;s not, this is a true repairing product.  </li>
            <li>do to quick growth during weight lifting and mass gain.  </li>
            <li>I am 7 months pregnant and wanted to get a head start at my stretch mark/scars recovery process.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks have reduced tremendously.</li>
            <li>It took my stench marks from &amp;#34;Hey.&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;LOOK AT ME!&amp;#34; Since using this product, my marks became more an more noticeable and did not fade away, even after using the entire bottle.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and</li>
            <li>My pregnant wife loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but it does work quickly.</li>
            <li>After seeing this product here i bought it for my pregnant wife so she could use it after giving birth.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 27 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>Now i ordered my second bottle, i hope they get better and better.</li>
            <li>I would do something about them, so I bought the Palmer&#x27;s stretch mark cream for pregnant people -</li>
            <li>After using this product I was astonished by how quickly it worked and helped my stretch marks go away and made my self esteem boost as well.</li>
            <li>, i am 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li>Stretch mark started while i was 7 month pregnant, and i started using Clarins and that was not helpful at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used many different products and this product has provided better results for me.</li>
            <li>But still working quickly</li>
            <li>My scar is big and I just took my chance with this product, it turns out it is effective and cheap for its price.</li>
            <li>When I was pregnant I use a lot of oil for my skin.</li>
            <li>I am about 34 weeks pregnant now.</li>
            <li>but it fades away quickly and it doesn&#x27;t stay on your clothes.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s 3 months pregnant</li>
            <li>I noticed results quick with this product.</li>
            <li>Seeing mild effects.</li>
            <li>Overall, the lotion has made my skin more supple, and my stretch marks are more faded.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found</li>
            <li>there is a scent but its not overbearing and it quickly fades once the cream is applied.</li>
            <li>I started using the cream about a month after I gave birth and didn&#x27;t notice a significant change right away.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li>Carried differently, more pointy and high.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a huge difference with just my first bottle.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference within 4 days, and my wife stopped kidding me about using it after the first week</li>
            <li>DermaRESTORE is a product that you can apply directly on any marks you would like to minimize over the course of so many days, you should see a significant difference.</li>
            <li>Another reason why this product is good is this product doesn&#x27;t break the bank and one bottle goes a long way too.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, product i have been using for two weeks now and has worked better then anything i have used so far and has faded all my stretch marks most you cant see now.</li>
            <li>They are much less noticeable and I feel a lot more confident!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to do much for the really old ones, but works great on the new ones!</li>
            <li>So far no side-effects just positive results, will be ordering more once this runs out!</li>
            <li>I got another bottle not because I really need it, because the first bottle work its magic.</li>
            <li>Slowly but surely showing effective!  </li>
            <li>it was way to strong the chemical smell and after awhile it just wants to make you vomit.</li>
            <li>I did receive my first bottle free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my actual experience and honest opinions of this cream.</li>
            <li>Try dermarestore first!</li>
            <li>On my second bottle it works great and faster with 1.5mm derma roller from new spa...</li>
            <li>I did the old cocoa butter lotion while pregnant because I was told that, that would reduce them, but to no avail they are there and there are many of them.</li>
            <li>I love the smell &amp; how it&#x27;s not messy &amp; dries up quick.</li>
            <li>:  I managed last summer to slam my leg into the top of a staple sticking out a picnic table bench at night and made a good 3mm or so dent that bled fairly well, not good times.  </li>
            <li>Bought for teenager who has bright red stretch marks from fast growth.  </li>
            <li>Its amazing I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of different products</li>
            <li>not everyone can have such amazing results</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks I began to notice great results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to see amazing results...</li>
            <li>WEll i have suffered with stretch marks for some time,However this product here was worth</li>
            <li>DO NOT USE ON FRESH SCARS .</li>
            <li>wanted to warn you about applying it on fresh scars.</li>
            <li>Had an old stretch mark on my boobs.now look more clearer .</li>
            <li>For what you pay, I would say its worth it.  </li>
            <li>It helped me hide many of the unappealing stretch marks and scars and works great.</li>
            <li>I find this useful</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I am using DermaRESTORE, they are completly gone!&lt;br /&gt;Definately worth a try</li>
            <li>IDK, either way it is a nice product I just did not see any actual improvement</li>
            <li>honestly I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in my stretch marks  </li>
            <li>and I must say that it was worth buying..</li>
            <li>Honestly this is the only product that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>My skin absorbed the lotion well.</li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>I have stretch marks from childbirth so far not to many things have worked.</li>
            <li>so I would remember to apply it, but it is totally worth the time and effort.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying to reduce appearance of your stretch marks from pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>but, not as red, which is nice.</li>
            <li>As far as a product can go derma store has gone I love ordering it and continually use it every day.</li>
            <li>Found Dermarestore when searching \\&quot;scar treatment for old scars\\&quot; on amazon and they were at the top with over 100 reviews.</li>
            <li>and so far I have to say that it&#x27;s &#x27;okay&#x27;.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER you can lighten it to where it won&#x27;t be as visible as when it&#x27;s fresh.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I would usually be wary of companies that &#x27;bribes&#x27; their customers, but given how great this product is in my opinion, I don&#x27;t mind and actually command them for their good marketing strategy!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get your hopes up though because it will NOT remove all your scars, but more than enough to make a significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve been pregnant with my first child I got stretch marks on my belly.</li>
            <li>SAW QUICK RESULT WITHIN FIRST 2 WEEKS BUT</li>
            <li>Dermarestore Stretch Mark and Scar Treatment really has significant and beneficial effects on the skin.  </li>
            <li>other then that good product 4/5 because of smell.</li>
            <li>Very much wishful thinking for any kind of these products to actually work,</li>
            <li>I just restarted the process of rolling and applying the product right after and for a week after so.</li>
            <li>And she was definitely right</li>
            <li>I battled with my weight right up until I had my daughter 10 years ago, so my stretch marks are abundant(its quite embaressing</li>
            <li>right on both hips</li>
            <li>I have stretch marks and for the longest time I searched and searched for a product that would be right for me and reduce the appearance of my marks.</li>
            <li>Beleive me, anything that takes SOME of the stretch marks away is a step in the right direction.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product right away.</li>
            <li>I started using this product right away.  </li>
            <li>and he was absoloutely right.</li>
            <li>and they sent a replacement right away.  </li>
            <li>Arrived right on time, no delays whatsoever.</li>
            <li>bought the DermaRestore because of the positive reviews I wish that I saw the review from  - June 19, 2014 Trash!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very helpful, clean and leaves no marks.</li>
            <li>As with other creams, the more consistent you apply it the better the results.  </li>
            <li>It smells pleasant, and I like the fact that it has natural essential oils and extracts in it.  </li>
            <li>I started using Dermarestore and after a few weeks I have seen a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better in general and the stretch marks seem to be fading.</li>
            <li>After using this magic concoction of pure goodness, my stretch marks from college have faded away into near nothingness.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks are natural, I have never gained/lost significant weight and have never been pregnant.</li>
            <li>right now i have finished my first bottle</li>
            <li>It works very well with pregnant women</li>
            <li>The pump bottle is nice, but I cannot tell how much cream is really left because of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to to continue for a few more months to see if any more progress is made.</li>
            <li>its not something that&#x27;ll work super fast.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving it, it&#x27;s almost completely removed all my stretch marks</li>
            <li>it works good, it wont desperate, but its good.</li>
            <li>I started using this product a month back and have seen good progress so far.</li>
            <li>Some will say that it works super fast.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks are fading away, I&#x27;m pretty sure a few more weeks</li>
            <li>My stretch marks have not yet improved in texture, but the color is becoming more like the surrounding skin tone, so they are less visible.</li>
            <li>and it works very very well.</li>
            <li>It has a very light smell which is a giant plus as well.</li>
            <li>I received this very fast, i have started to use it but still no results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Consistency is key with anything you have to make sure you follow the directions and consistently use it in the right way</li>
            <li>It seems fine so far, my skin isn&#x27;t bothered and it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for the product!!</li>
            <li>I am definitely noticing super fast results and I am very excited about this treatment,</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that I can see it&#x27;s making a difference.</li>
            <li>I searched thru many products and reviews here on Amazon and finally decided on DermaRESTORE.  </li>
            <li>and I saw results fast!</li>
            <li>Granted, I haven&#x27;t used it 2 times a day consistently.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t entirely too sure.</li>
            <li>I have many stretch marks on my belly, legs and upper arms.  </li>
            <li>I started using this cream on my arms first</li>
            <li>I am now over 20 years old and still short with the same stretch marks, but ever since using this product I can honestly say that I am not afraid to take off my clothes in front of my handsome fiancé.</li>
            <li>Plus my skin has never been so smooth and soft if for nothing else</li>
            <li>Love the way this product leaves my skin, would definitely recommend for anyone having skin problems.</li>
            <li>The first 3 products I bought didn&#x27;t work at all, I was devastated and thought and thought that I was gonna be stuck with my stretch lines forever.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to ladies who have stretch marks!!</li>
            <li>It couldn&#x27;t be any more obvious that you&#x27;re putting chemicals onto your body with the way this stuff smells.</li>
            <li>Im almost done with my first bottle</li>
            <li>I use this product religiously twice a day (morning/nighttime) and I&#x27;m truly satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I have seen women trying many different methods, from herbal to faith healing, to restore their skin shine and texture.</li>
            <li>you go through of not having been able to have the skin you had prior pregnancy.</li>
            <li>After my first child I had a lot of stretch marks on my belly.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase and I am on my 24th day already.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost beach body ready!</li>
            <li>My gf been using this cream consistently.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t believe it would work, but I went ahead, bought it</li>
            <li>but In the third week I notice they were blending more</li>
            <li>After using jut one bottle I realized I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied, so I know to order 2 bottles next time .</li>
            <li>and if you didn&#x27;t know exactly where it was  </li>
            <li>Will continue using this first bottle and see what miracle will happen.</li>
            <li>Really improved my strechmarks and helped with my scars, also cant beat the price!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really think this was going to work, but since it was made in the USA, I thought I could trust it!</li>
            <li>With my first pregnancy I had gained 82 pounds.</li>
            <li>so im going to try a different product to get rid of it:)</li>
            <li>so the results i have really suprise me !</li>
            <li>At first, I was disapointed in the product as I saw no results.  </li>
            <li>and I actually think my stretch marks became more pronounced and darker in color.</li>
            <li>I got these for my wife after she had or first child because she wanted to try and get rid of the stretch marks.</li>
            <li>thank you so much!</li>
            <li>and it is starting to fade away, i hope after 2 or 3 months it will vanishes :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have light visible scars than the old more visible red ones I had.</li>
            <li>thanks Derma Restore!</li>
            <li>and i just finished my first bottle</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S OK NOT REALLUY SEE MUCH DIFFERENT</li>
            <li>I started to use this cream about three weeks ago on fresh stretch-marks on my belly just after having a baby and the stretch-marks look much lighter now</li>
            <li>This scar treatment worked pretty well&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works !</li>
            <li>So, before i tried this product, i&#x27;ve been putting on different brands of stretch mark repair stuff on my belly for more than a year.</li>
            <li>For the first 2 weeks I used Dermarestore 3 times a day , then I tapered off to 2 times a day , to once a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to keep in mind that stretch marks are permenant skin damage and that any product you try is not going to completely erase them</li>
            <li>I have tried many different lotions, creams and serums, but none of them seemed to work.</li>
            <li>If your looking results in real time, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li>It probably works better with a derma roller which is my next purchase when I get paid!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says and I can already tell a difference in my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I was a bit sceptical since I have tried so many different products</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone interested in scar removal.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;vegot my sexy back</li>
            <li>After having my first baby, stretch marks are what I dreaded.</li>
            <li>It might change for few more weeks if I really get outstanding results.</li>
            <li>I really would recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li>After first couple days of using it, I noticed it working.</li>
            <li>the medications made me gain a ton of weight extremely fast!</li>
            <li>At first I had Stretch marks covering my stomach and sides.</li>
            <li>exactly where I want to be yet</li>
            <li>I use to work out a lot during my days in highschool and that left me with many stretch marks on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>what I like most of all they have a satisfaction guaranteed or your money back</li>
            <li>I am almost done with the first bottle and I am going to get another one.</li>
            <li>When I started using it, I had to smell it first.</li>
            <li>but I feel like people should be aware of this.</li>
            <li>All of these products are usually mediocre at best</li>
            <li>After the first use I already started seeing a difference.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much DermaRESTORE for everything!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and can really see an improvement!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a very efficient product!</li>
            <li>Hopefully i can see some very soon!</li>
            <li>This was the first product that I tried to remove them</li>
            <li>did a Google search for stretch mark removal and after sifting through many scam websites, I finally found myself on this Amazon listing.</li>
            <li>you recover your self-esteem and not feel that you have only creams to rely on for the hopes of a better appearance.</li>
            <li>I am so blessed to be able to purchase this for a markdown price in return for my objective and equitable review.</li>
            <li>works pretty well...</li>
            <li>I am exactly 6 months post baby and started using at 3 months.</li>
            <li>What was a deep reddish scar has lighted and looks much better.</li>
            <li>After using the product I&#x27;ve noticed a better improvement in the appearance of my stretch marks (Arms / love handles) I&#x27;m not sure if the derma roller was the reason</li>
            <li>I lost a lot of weight in a short amount of time after a lapband operation, and I ended up with a lot of embarassing stretch marks even though I felt so much better about my weight loss.  </li>
            <li>The pump does not release alot of product, so you have to pump a few times to get a good amount.</li>
            <li>I am very excited to see the final results.</li>
            <li>i am very heated up right now.</li>
            <li>DermaRESTORE had such an amazing action while coping with my pregnancy stretch marks!</li>
            <li>No bad smell, absorbs well, very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>I was finally able to remove a portion of this large white sticker, but the label came off with it.</li>
            <li>I bought more than one bottle and just finished the whole first bottle and am just now starting to see a difference</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some other products but did not seem to have these kind of results.</li>
            <li>After that I have gifted this products to my other pregnant friends.</li>
            <li>My scar is gone completely, I&#x27;v been suffering with this huge scar on my forehead, and thanks to this product</li>
            <li>I love that is made from vitamins and minerals because the less chemicals used on your body the better and this product is exactly chemical free that will help you get your skin back to normal.</li>
            <li>Well finally I found this product and saw all the good reviews it had, and decided to give it a try one last time.</li>
            <li>Love it and so thankful for the fast results after only using for about two to three months!</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really think it helps much, but it definitely is worth a try.</li>
            <li>As a male using this, it works on most of stretch marks around the hips and arms but not so much on the.. gluteus maximus (booty).</li>
            <li>This cream is just as good as the expensive ones and sometimes better than some.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews &amp; there was a lot for stretch marks &amp; decided to try based on positive reviews.</li>
            <li>But for now I have positive hope for this.</li>
            <li>I’ve had my stretch marks for over 8 years now and pretty much given up hope of repairing them.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few other stretch mark creams, but this one works best for me.  </li>
            <li>and she never fails to remind me how much of a difference she sees with her stretch marks now.</li>
            <li>There might be some minor insignificant improvement, but nothing more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure for a scar that hasn&#x27;t been there for a long time, it would work wonders since it made a difference on mine.</li>
            <li>I had pretty much given up hope...</li>
            <li>I have really deep stretch marks all over my abdominal area due to pregnancy and have been undergoing fraxel and carboxy treatments and use a bunch of creams in conjunction to those treatments and decided to give this one a try as well since it had great reviews.</li>
            <li>the results are evident even within 2-3 weeks, really helpful product.</li>
            <li>First thing about stretch mark I have heard is that they don&#x27;t really go away</li>
            <li>After having her first child, she had stretch marks on her stomach and it really upset her.</li>
            <li>After 15 years and hundreds of dollars later on many products, with little to none results whatsoever, January 20 I discovered DermaRESTORE on Amazon I sew great reviews and said why not so I purchased this product and received it 2 days later.  </li>
            <li>And I must also say that the picture shown on the product by the manufacturers is a real “mild” case looking at what the product has done in our more serious case..</li>
            <li>However, when I am looking down at my own body, I can still see them.  </li>
            <li>I wouldnt recommend this to a pregnant woman only because i dont believe in putting anything on yourself or taking anything while pregnant.</li>
            <li>I am 5 months pregnant at this point and so far I have not  noticed any stretch mark.</li>
            <li>The strong chemical smell made me too nervous to use, especially around my baby.</li>
            <li>Well a few weeks beyond the 4 weeks (honestly i didnt use it consistently)</li>
            <li>have a large butt</li>
            <li>She had extremely large stretch marks all over the body and had lost hope trying any product until I found Dermarestore for her.</li>
            <li>and i thought it certainly couldnt hurt.</li>
            <li>After being in an accident, I had received large scars.</li>
            <li>But this is a miracle worker for women after giving birth or losing a large amount of weight.</li>
            <li>I have certainly seen an improvement.</li>
            <li>I feel like myself again when wearing certain clothes.</li>
            <li>While it may more than 1 bottle to really see the difference, progress is still to be expected after using 3/4 of the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to get a new one and apply it differently to see if it works better.</li>
            <li>She has previously used a different brand of lotion, from which she received great results in days.  </li>
            <li>For a nice and by using this merchandise every single day, for nearly 3 months.</li>
            <li>After the first three weeks, you could totally see a significant difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope to be able to report back in a few more weeks with increased positive results.</li>
            <li>I was ready to give up.</li>
            <li>but this cream really do it..</li>
            <li>I can really see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>This has done absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve the look of his or her stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone seeking a dermatological solution for improving scar tissue as it worked in my experience!</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re so much lighter now</li>
            <li>Mind you, they are still there, but you have to look really closely to see them.</li>
            <li>This stretch mark cream really does work</li>
            <li>I had been using this product from sometime now, and it really works.</li>
            <li>We were bought surprise how fast it worked.</li>
            <li>The shipping was Farley fast and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>After my 4th child, I had HUNDREDS of stretch marks, and decided to give this dermarestore  a try because I was really self-conscious about them.</li>
            <li>it has really helped mine</li>
            <li>but my clients often do and one day a client said they ordered this product off of amazon and it was really working so</li>
            <li>As a mom with stretch marks, this product really helped and boosted my confidence.</li>
            <li>It was very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the DermaRestore, they no longer exists on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for 4 months straight.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>DermaRESTORE really does what its name says.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It has a very chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference</li>
            <li>Highly recommend DermaRestore to anyone who has stretch marks and is looking to improve the look of them!</li>
            <li>I will continue using it to see how much my marks will fade.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this wonder product.</li>
            <li>Totally risk free.</li>
            <li>Helped fade stretch marks very well.</li>
            <li>but dermarestore worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>and my stretch marks really have reduced in color.</li>
            <li>I could see the difference very soon.</li>
            <li>Absolute garbage that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>She really doesn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>The cream really does lighten the marks.</li>
            <li>Before having my son I was very paranoid about acquiring stretch marks after giving birth to him.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got absolutely did wonders for me.</li>
            <li>We had tried a couple of the OTC creams and they just weren&#x27;t doing much of anything.</li>
            <li>After using a whole bottle, no results.</li>
            <li>I like this product and its really working.</li>
            <li>It was just like a magic, it worked so well on her skin than we expected, after using three bottles within 6months.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t begin to explain</li>
            <li>I am very self-conscious about my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I am a light skin asian woman who just had a baby.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as fast for me as for everyone from what I read on their reviews.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say this has worked for me.  </li>
            <li>The wound has healed but I don&#x27;t really like the scar.</li>
            <li>Not much done so far..might need more time.</li>
            <li>I used almost the whole bottle before my girlfriend commented on how they were fading.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice because I see it every day, so the change was gradual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend it for anyone with fresh scars, but for the people out there like me with decades old growth spurt scars, I would still recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping it would work</li>
            <li>Its just not working as fast as i thought it would.</li>
            <li>Its very embarrasing if you have a belly baring shirt</li>
            <li>Thanks DermaRoller for taking my stretch marks away.</li>
            <li>and I noticed absolutely zero difference.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of their stretch marks.</li>
            <li>but this one really does work and</li>
            <li>Thank you, I really appreciate this product.</li>
            <li>My strength marks have lighted up so much.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find a product that worked fast and had no side effects.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look as intense as before.</li>
            <li>When I got this at a promotional rate to give opinion on the product, I am so ecstatic to test it out if it really works.</li>

            <li>This product was very helpful</li>
            <li>I really get fat, so</li>
            <li>This is absolutely some sort of hand cream.</li>
            <li>and currently they&#x27;re smooth and bearly visible from a distance.</li>

            <li>and I noticed absolutely zero difference.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks have lightened up and the skin is much softer.</li>
            <li>but I have used for 6 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference yet</li>

            <li>I just dont want them to show too much.</li>
            <li>This product really works</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to use it, thinking I&#x27;d be scarred for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THE REVIEWS ARE FAKE BECAUSE THEY OFFER A FREE BOTTLE AFTER YOU WRITING A GOOD REVIEW -  </li>
            <li>I have tried 4 different types of Stretch marks  either oil or cream after i gave birth, so far this one works better.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of natural things like aloe, but overall I could not pronounce most of the items and had to look them up.</li>
            <li>Honestly this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Greatly soften the appearance of a five years old scar and slowly fading it away.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much just a typical lotion that costs a lot more.</li>
            <li>wow!!!</li>
            <li>They are pretty new</li>
            <li>So, I got this for a friend (who was extremely self conscious about her stretch marks after have kids) and this worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product because it really works, my skin is much firmer then before I used this product and my stretch marks are much lighter then before .</li>
            <li>After 1 week, I noticed a significant difference and the scar was starting to fade.</li>
            <li>but as for me maybe I would have to continue to use it to see a big significant change I been using it for 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I will also say we have been doing one set of stretch marks with DermaRESTORE and another set (other side of the body) with Mederma Stretch Mark Therapy, and the DermaRESTORE side does look better.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product recently, and up till now it is working miracles; my stretch marks have faded significantly and are almost unnoticeable now.</li>
            <li>I apply it twice a day like it says an I&#x27;m already excited for next swim suit season!!</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products but none seem to work.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products to help with stretch marks/ scar treatment.</li>
            <li>Have tried so many other products</li>
            <li>The marks have reduced in shades, but not disappeared, but I am purchasing it again, since I think other creams are costly and do not have satisfying reviews for the cost.</li>
            <li>The price is the cheapest on the market and shows more results then any other scare treatment product.</li>
            <li>I am posting this as my initial review for this product because I am excited.</li>
            <li>It worked better than some other treatments I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong but it glides on very smoothly and isn&#x27;t super thick and goopy like other creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li>After a week of use we began to see a massive improvement with the stretch-marks around her stomach becoming a lot fainter, with some having disappeared completely.</li>
            <li>The MEDERMA is no miracle cream either, but at least, you see some result and  most importantly, it leaves your skin incredibly SOFT.</li>
            <li>Not worth continuing to see if magically it started working in another two weeks.</li>
            <li>After my last child I was faced with the fact that I had a stomach full of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Two full bottles is just enough !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty young</li>
            <li>, I am pretty self conscious about them.</li>
            <li>and I have used many others before with not success...</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd pregnancy so my skin stretched more than the first.</li>
            <li>New respect for stretch mark creams!</li>
            <li>I love this product i have previously used Bio oil and even tried coconut oil .</li>
            <li>I use Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter which costs a lot less and has a better scent to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that if I were to continue using the product they would be even less visable.</li>
            <li>I would say this has worked better for me than previous products I have used</li>
            <li>Many of my scars and stretch marks have faded and are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I just opened my 3rd bottle yesterday, and am just happy that something work, no matter how slowly 😊</li>
            <li>I used cocoa butter the entire time I was pregnant with both of my daughters</li>
            <li>However, the company that sells this DermaRESTORE product is very generous and may offer you a complimentary second bottle!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed some of my older, lighter stretch marks fading.</li>
            <li>Overtime and steady use of DermaRESTORE</li>
            <li>I have found this treatment to not only diminish the appearance of my existing stretch marks, but to also act as a preventative measure for the future, which is just as important in the reduction of stretch marks!</li>
            <li>Having been embarrassed to take my shirt off for the last couple years, this is a tremendous relief and I will continue using this lotion until they&#x27;re gone</li>
            <li>it getting older.</li>
            <li>I had applied many different things to it in the beginning, including shae butter, and aloe and definitely noticed no improvement.</li>
            <li>and I am seeing steady improvements.</li>
            <li>Most likely you would need to purchase a second bottle to see your stretch marks begin to fade away.</li>
            <li>You could see the progress within a few months it had definitely made a good portion of the stretch marks fade away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back to my bikinis for sure by next summer!</li>
            <li>I had some stretch marks, mainly on my chest and thigh areas.</li>
            <li>I have been applying the DermaRESTORE mainly once every two days (after showering).</li>
            <li>I’m going to come back for my second bottle for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend you try this.</li>

            <li>They did not miraculously disappear over night, but each week they get a little better.</li>
            <li>I have little and light stretch mark, but given this is my first baby</li>
            <li>i have very high hopes that after a few more weeks, my skin will look and feel like its old self.</li>
            <li>I have been using these for a few weeks and can already tell a huge difference!</li>
            <li>My skin was left dry, clean, and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I was proud of having a baby, but was ashamed of the way my skin looked.</li>
            <li>but it does leave my skin really really soft which i really like</li>
            <li>Although I was skeptical of this product, I went ahead and purchased it based on the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>My five year old son has even noticed how much nicer my stomach looks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any results I would say this product is for someone who is buying 3 bottles and that really wants to clear up stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Each day I do see the redness of my stretch marks change from pink to light skin tonal color.</li>
            <li>So far, I am really liking this product, and the results am getting.</li>
            <li>I was very self conscious about it.</li>
            <li>After 4 children, she was very self conscious about stretch marks.</li>
            <li>It really matters for me that it works even for my old stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I only used it on fresh stretch marks</li>
            <li>and I waiting to see my results after using it for a few more months.</li>
            <li>I should have done more research on this product because it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky and smells pretty good.... but sadly to say this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li>We will know more in a few months and I&#x27;ll update  my review.  </li>
            <li>; had written, all of them pretty much reviewed the same products--hair towels, weight loss supplements, printer cartriges, etc.</li>
            <li>Why I bought this product because it contains a proprietary complex of rare essential oils, vitamins, and uniquely effective extracts designed for optimal results.</li>
            <li>Just apply it regularly everyday and your scars will fade away after 3 weeks, like mine :)</li>
            <li>so i know that my stretch marks are still pretty deep and this cream did not help fill them out much.</li>
            <li>After using this for a few months, my scars have substantially minimized and I have been extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>While it does not seem to have affected the lotion&#x27;s effectiveness, it made me question for a couple of days whether the color change was normal.    </li>
            <li>I tried so many creams to lighten up my stretch marks, and so far this is the only cream that actually worked for me!!!</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this product would work that I even bought a second bottle after I ran out of the first one.</li>
            <li>They stand behind their product, and the customer service is good as well.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a good idea before they got even worse</li>
            <li>the odor was to strong and it lingered on my effect areas for a long time, so much that i was starting to give me a headache.</li>
            <li>After only four weeks, I can easily see a difference and my marks have finally started to fade!  </li>
            <li>I love this product it helps tremendously with my stretch marks, which have over the years gotten progressively worse.</li>
            <li>I am using my second bottle right now.</li>
            <li>I think that if I had used it the right way the entire time the marks would be even lighter.</li>
            <li>I bought it straight away after seeing all those positive reviews and the low price of $28!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this product around a month ago for my partner as she has recently had our first child and has been struggling with the stretchmarks that she has gained through pregnancy, within the first two weeks, we saw massive improvements with the stretchmarks around her stomach, and they had become so much fainter.</li>
            <li>I use it for a few weeks now and the stretch marks seem to disappear, not completely yet, but you can see huge a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I admit I was doubtful at first but with diligent use I have definitely noticed improvement and feel pretty confident that even more is to come!</li>
            <li>and i have new ones ( not anymore tho!)&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>I have not seen new stretch marks</li>
            <li>I learned to live with them, but then I decided one day</li>
            <li>My mother doesn&#x27;t get wrapped up into the new products coming out or anything like that</li>
            <li>Since I have used it I haven&#x27;t noticed any new marks.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it hardly smells and the skin absorbs it really fast, so it&#x27;s really comfortable!</li>
            <li>My mother surprised me with a bottle of DermaRESTORE, and after just a few weeks of using it, my skin looks much better, and smoother.</li>
            <li>and I personally used this product and it worked better than expected .</li>
            <li>I guess reading most recent reviews does not work, especially if everybody tries to give it a second chance and goes for a free bottle.</li>
            <li>only complaint I have is that when I used mederma I got a compliment from a girl that I smelled good, and with DermaRESTORE</li>
            <li>The reason i give it four stars is the bottle is small and if you use as instructed(twice a day), you can easily go through one bottle in a month if you have a large area to cover.</li>
            <li>The coloration became significantly lighter, going from a dark purple to a light pink.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and not a strong smell like I&#x27;ve had before in other brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been diligently using it and have seen no results, my skin is just very soft.</li>
            <li>The product is very nice, i ended up getting quite a few stretch marks on my thighs from pregnancy and after using this cream for a few weeks I can already tell they are getting lighter.</li>
            <li>bought the DermaRestore because of the positive reviews, but I&#x27;m starting to think that most of the reviews are fake because they were offer a &#x27;free bottle after writing a review&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I now wear sleeveless, albeit around the house, but even this is a huge improvement as I&#x27;ve spent my whole life in short sleeves.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>but Im sure i can find other lotions that can do this same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 yrs old &amp; have 3 kids all by C-Section &amp; I had practically given up on these stretch marks!</li>
            <li>I would assess that 65% of the scaring has completely lightened up to my skin&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream for exactly 3 weeks and 5 days, and it simply gave me hope</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use stretch mark creams in the past, including Mederma&#x27;s Stretch Mark Therapy and this product worked much better.</li>
            <li>Was really surprised how well this worked!  </li>
            <li>I had some pretty deep stretch marks from pregnancy, I started using this soon after delivery.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife as she was left with a stretch mark after having our first child.</li>
            <li>Well, it definitely helped in the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>While I normally like to go all natural, this has quite the list of ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ashamed of the marks and how vivid they are.  </li>
            <li>now my stretch mark started to vanished and the old scar start to disappear!</li>
            <li>IVE USED THUS FAR!</li>
            <li>My only comment/mini-complaint is that when I first started using the lotion, it was a off-white color.</li>
            <li>my first pregnancy I used body shop cocoa butter, but as surface area started getting larger, I got more lazy to apply.</li>
            <li>there are such rave reviews, but my friend due a week before me with her 1st has many stretch marks with this product.</li>
            <li>The first time I received the product in the mail, there were traces of cream that were outside the container</li>
            <li>For the old ones it needs time!</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of products in the past, but this is the first product that has done anything worth mentioning!</li>
            <li>My scars aren&#x27;t completely gone, but I feel normal again.</li>
            <li>I tried several other products in past,  but never got these kind of significant results.</li>
            <li>stretch marks faded significantly (even improved old, red stretch marks on my inner thighs).  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t see any change in my stretch marks- the old ones nor the new ones.</li>
            <li>With the changing of her body she gets new ones frequently.</li>
            <li>I had new ( 8-12 months old ) stretch marks on my things.</li>
            <li>I used this after I had my son and it, improved the look of my stretch marks, new and old.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty faint and rather nice.</li>
            <li>This is my first pregnancy and I am trying to be conscious about a lot thing related to the pregnancy; including stretch marks.</li>
            <li>There was what I thought some slight results, but I found that the cream itself leaves a skin colored residue that was short term (like foundation) and no long term scar reduction of any kind.</li>
            <li>After a month of use, my old and new stretch marks and scars are nearly gone.</li>
            <li>skin is different and you may get more or less results, but</li>
            <li>I purchased this product around 3 weeks ago for my wife as is currently 8 months pregnant with our child and has been concerned with the stretch-marks that she has gained recently.</li>
            <li>After my surgery I had a large scar on my back.</li>
            <li>I should also mention that when I bought the bottle, there was a little sticker saying to call for a free bottle.</li>
            <li>But I mainly ordered this to help with a huge dark scar on my back from a surgery I had about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>After a while, most of the stretch marks have at least faded to a white color, they are certainly still visible.</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin a nice smooth feel, doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell</li>
            <li>I was so self conscious about all my strechmarks, but no matter how much I worked out and dieted with the sole intention to get rid of it, it would never disappear.</li>
            <li>but DermaRESTORE is the only one that produces amazing results!&lt;br /&gt;For only just a few weeks</li>
            <li>(Medxpress did clear me when I went there</li>
            <li>We would recommend to anyone trying to clear up stretch marks</li>
            <li>but then just completely stop.</li>
            <li>I put on twice a day and would reccomend this product for anyone with old stretch marks..</li>
            <li>I had become self conscious about it and wanted to try something to minimize the scar.  </li>
            <li>, I started rubbing this product on my almost 3 week old scar</li>
            <li>And yes it has worked as far for me, and I hope this will continue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 20 years old, my mother never got stretch marks</li>
            <li>A natural product.</li>
            <li>It helps me reduce my old stretch mark.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Derma Restore has completely lightened all my stretch marks and they are no longer visible.</li>
            <li>I am so pleasantly surprised with how well it works.</li>
            <li>The marks aren&#x27;t completely gone, but the product did deliver in its promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In there defense my stretch marks are about two years old</li>
            <li>I would use it just for the soft skin.</li>
            <li>I was worried that since they were old stretch marks that I wasn&#x27;t going to see any results.</li>
            <li>I have used this on my chest and stomach for 4 days so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a month now daily and have notice that my stretch marks are getting much lighter and some have even gone away.</li>
            <li>Im 20 years old and weigh 145</li>
            <li>But so far I like what I see</li>
            <li>they want to go away naturally.</li>
            <li>I had leftover stretch marks from losing alot of weight and this has helped considerably.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably because I haven&#x27;t used it correctly (as the bottle lasted only two weeks), but the product hasn&#x27;t worked very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>As far as buying another bottle I dont think I will buying any</li>
            <li>It is working so far</li>
            <li>Within the last month, I have really noticed a visible difference - the scaring lightened in pigmentation from a blackish/maroonish color.  </li>
            <li>The post delivery stretch marks leave a scar in the minds of beauty conscious women.</li>
            <li>I have been trying it too and it leaves my skin soft moisturizer hydrated.</li>
            <li>I know stretch marks won&#x27;t completely disappear, but it is making a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks are completely gone in a month...</li>
            <li>I had surgery five years old</li>
            <li>I brought it for my wife after she had developed some stretch marks and some darkar patches of skin around her tummy.</li>
            <li>I tried several stretch mark creams, but this one so far absorbed into my skin the fastest and left my skin moist.</li>
            <li>and im a 16 year old</li>
            <li>this stuff made them go away just about completely within thew two months or earlier!&lt;br /&gt;be</li>
            <li>My mom got me dermarestore and even though it took about 7 months of use, its completely gone now.</li>
            <li>and I had 25 year old stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I had scar near a tattoo that I was using the cream on.  </li>
            <li>I have bern using it on two surgical scars that are over 35 years old.  </li>
            <li>I imagine it&#x27;s different for different people with different skin completions but in any case it&#x27;s worth a shot for a reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li>but I think its to early to tell.</li>
            <li>my old ones</li>
            <li>Currently, I don&#x27;t see any differencs, but that&#x27;s reasonable since I just started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my nine year old stretch marks are halfway gone already.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them since my early teens</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had these since I was 14 years old or so.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels soft as a baby.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift because I lost a lot of weight really fast and was left with stretch marks around my armpits and stomach.</li>
            <li>i am 16 years old</li>
            <li>My stretch marks are 7 yrs old.....</li>
            <li>and it really does have the potential to do what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I got really busy with summer stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to get get rid of strechs, so far no changes, but for marks and scars</li>
            <li>This product has improved my old stretch marks a lot.  </li>
            <li>I am liking it thus far....</li>
            <li>I used to have a lot of problems with such products as my skin is very oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 2 children (3 yrs old and 5 months old) and used everything under the sun..</li>
            <li>the only thing that really hides them is getting my skin tanned, because</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can use this without breaking out.</li>
            <li>The only thing that really works for me is Mederma</li>
            <li>also used this on my 7 year old son who had appendicitis and has a  1 1/2 inch scar on his stomach.</li>
            <li>no help for the stretch mark as far as I can see....</li>
            <li>I am glad at least didn’t cause any rash or any skin abnormalities.</li>
            <li>My wife has a scar that made her self conscious</li>
            <li>/&gt;DermaRestore couldn&#x27;t be any easier to use and it is working wonderfully so far.  </li>
            <li>I am still using it on old scares.</li>
            <li>so they might be too old for this product to have any affect on them.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this for about 30 days so far and already noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>This product actually showed results fast.</li>
            <li>and i would say that anyone who wants to get rid of stretch marks should definitely use this product.</li>
            <li>Nearly a month and no evidence of change</li>
            <li>but so far after months of using it I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t erase my stretch marks completely.</li>
            <li>I will still be using it on my stretch marks to see if they will disappear completely.</li>
            <li>My marks aren&#x27;t completely gone</li>
            <li>I have been so embarrassed by my stretch marks that they negatively impacted my life in too many ways to mention.  </li>
            <li>and so far it seems it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li>I just started using this lotion initially bought it for stretch marks I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference on them</li>
            <li>My stretchmarks are 20 years old.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to feel self conscious about myself doing them.</li>
            <li>and so far the discoloration from the strech marks are completly gone .</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>However, I saw results within the first week and now after several weeks of using it they are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>but if something is good ill pay anything.</li>
            <li>Immediately after giving birth and returning home, I noticed that I had no new stretch marks and the ones from my first pregnancy were completely unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hypertrophic scar on my upper back, but I think is good for stretch-marks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using DermaRESTORE for a little under four weeks now, and the results have been significant.</li>
            <li>now after a little over 6 months my strech marks have pretty much vanished</li>
            <li>Now they are turning much lighter, smoother, and less defined after only a few uses of applying this cream , and to be honest, I often forgot and didn&#x27;t apply it twice a day, every day.</li>
            <li>but now almost a year later and not even using the product daily the deep red marks I had are completely fading and only getting better.</li>
            <li>The cream does not have an unpleasant odor which helps enjoy the process that much better.</li>
            <li>Instead of looking red, they become white and has a less visible and more scarrish appearance.  </li>
            <li>I saw no difference at all using an entire bottle and following the directions exactly of applying it twice a day.</li>
            <li>my stretch marks after my 2nd baby were dark and now after 1 week they are so light and</li>
            <li>I use it twice daily as instructed, and apparently the color of the stretch marks is much lighter and skin gets smoother.</li>
            <li>I am not sure yet, but most likely I do not see any effect.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak for light scar tissue at this point, but effects are DEFINITELY noticeable for dark scar tissue.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many different scar creams in the past and</li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because a friend of mine used it in the past with amazing results, and after the first few weeks, I can say that it is the same!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and I am actually looking forward to wearing my two piece swimsuit again.</li>
            <li>Stretch marks have been a big problem for me since I was in high school.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who has pregnancy marks or just regular marks.</li>
            <li>To be clear, I am using them on the new stretch marks only.</li>
            <li>Definitely helped with stretchmarks and a little with scarring.. looking forward to my next bottle :)</li>
            <li>i read the negative comments and even then i still ordered because i was so desperate to find something that would just work and it had so many good reviews too that i bought into that.</li>
            <li>You normally will spend around $100 on a stretch mark cream that probably won&#x27;t work, but this one is only around $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>color of her skin is back to normal now and the stretch marks are also showing signs of disapperance.</li>
            <li>Yet after a few days, the lotion became a darker color, more like a yellowish white (which is not atypical for lotions).</li>
            <li>I have tried it for a little over a week now and already starting to see results, also makes make skin feel smooth with no odor</li>
            <li>I am definitely gifting this to my other pregnant friends during their baby showers.</li>
            <li>I have been going to the gym religiously for about 25 years and due to some quick growth I have sustained some stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I got new stretch marks in my inner thighs, that&#x27;s why I got this product.</li>
            <li>stretch marks covered my entire belly and were scattered on my hips and upper thighs as well, and because I am very fair-skinned</li>
            <li>feel like stretch marks are is dependent on diet, genetics, hydration, and how much weight you can gain gradually, I gained excessively, 60lb with the first two and will probably be close to that with this one too.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my scars pretty much vanish from my arms and legs from small injuries.</li>
            <li>The product does not leave my skin feeling soft or smooth, but it&#x27;s not greasy or thick either.</li>
            <li>The deep, purple deep stretch marks are becoming lighter, the little ones are fading before my eyes.</li>
            <li>It actually leaves me feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>She has tried treating them with other products but none had consistent results.</li>
            <li>So ive been using this product for about 6 months on my stretch marks around my breast and hips and after 2 months I SAW A MAJOR DIFFERENCE and</li>
            <li>Due to my post-pregnancy stretch marks on my belly and breast, I felt really self conscious</li>
            <li>product contains Aloe Vera Gel, Stearate, Green Bean, Algae Extract, Emu Oil and many other ingredients that contains healing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other reviews complain about the smell, and although it definitely isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; smell, it&#x27;s not bad enough to dissuade me from continuing to use the product.</li>
            <li>We both saw less and less of the stretch marks and from that experience, I can say that I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other creams with no results in 3x the amount of time so that is definitely a positive.</li>
            <li>At this price, the striae will be generally gone within a thirty days.</li>
            <li>But I feel a general sense of a change.</li>
            <li>I can say with absolute and complete honesty that DermaRESTORE worked miracles in decreasing the appearance of dark spots on my legs.  </li>
            <li>my skin clear again i definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>After trying several expensive brands from skin care stores and vendors from the mall, I experienced minimal results.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets about purchasing.</li>
            <li>It’s barely a month now after the DermaRestore treatment was introduced to me by a friend.</li>
            <li>These spots are so soft at the moment, that you couldn’t possibly tell that once there were stretch marks there.</li>
            <li>It would probably work on newer stretch marks but not on my old, white ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has reduced my deep, 15 year old stretch marks</li>
            <li>Now it is barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;First of all, my stretch marks are very deep, visible and I am completely ashamed of them.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>My stretch marks are fading and are no where near as red as before!</li>
            <li>This product has a chemical scent but the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, i have old white stretchmarks, so far no big results</li>
            <li>Just the first couple weeks ive noticed a change, my scars are not completely gone but it definitely made a big difference</li>
            <li>I have seen some improvement in my stretch marks and this is the only product that have worked so far.</li>
            <li>I had 2 babies in the same calendar year, so my stomach looked like I had been attacked by a wild animal.</li>
            <li>i have old sretchmarks that are white</li>
            <li>she used these and they helped a lot you can barely notice them now.</li>
            <li>Reducing old stretchmarks from multiple pregnancies.</li>
            <li>When I wear my  bathing suit in the summer time, it&#x27;s so apparent and humiliating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, after 7 months of use, they are still there but barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although your stretch marks won&#x27;t disappear completely, you will actually see them getting lighter within a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for over a month now and some of my stretch marks are completely faded.</li>
            <li>Now, after 7 months of use, they are still there but barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>DermaRESTORE has actually faded the stretchmarks that were not fading and made my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I can not believe that after having 9 kids, I barely have any stretch marks at all.</li>
            <li>If it worked at all, it was BARELY, and that was after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 22 year old male and have been applying this twice a day</li>
            <li>I bought my 1st bottle last month and used it for nearly 3 weeks</li>
            <li>Only thing it does it makes skin soft.</li>
            <li>Now a week later they are almost completely faded.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s apparent that I can&#x27;t fully get rid of them.</li>
            <li>and although my stretch marks are still apparent I saw lightening in the color of the marks, and a decrease in size of the marks.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had improvement on some of the smaller ones so far..</li>
            <li>My body is slowly starting to look back to normal.</li>
            <li>Bathing suits are not  a welcome thought in my mind when I see my labor of love marks.  </li>
            <li>I got a little scar across my right leg from an accident in wood working.</li>
            <li>They really need to change this into a tube.&lt;br /&gt;-The smell - it&#x27;s not an bad scent, but it&#x27;s pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>After my pregnancy i had a few stretchmarks that are disappearing right before my eyes.</li>
            <li>its just a waste of your money guess I&#x27;ll continue searching until I find the right product for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s without noticing, the previous ones for the first would widen or elongate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>DermaRESTORE is a pale yellow cream that absorbs quickly into skin after application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable in comparison to other creams, does not have an obtrusive smell and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>other reviewer says this really works.</li>
            <li>This cream has really helped with the biceps and chest area that have been damaged due to years of lifting and growing frame.</li>
            <li>Other ones ive tried show results really fast than stretch marks are visible again without use, or just dont work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other creams with much disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He is excited to see the marks around his belly disappear as he loses weight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 26 years old guy and purchased this product in order to treat stretch marks on various parts of my body, such as the middle-back, waists etc.</li>
            <li>it hasnt gotten rid of my old ones that are white and very deep</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for only a month on old stretch mark and scars from surgery that happen with my last pregnancy August 2012.</li>
            <li>They have gradually vanished and I was so afraid that they were going to last for good.</li>
            <li>After struggling with my weight for years, I was finally able to get rid of the pounds but was left behind with the stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Everything would work a little bit at first</li>
            <li>My bottle didnt come with any information so a little research might help ;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got excited and recommended this treatment to my friend&#x27;s and family that are bothered by their mean stretch marks as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have major stretch marks on my upper arms and now that I have lost weight they have not dissapeared.</li>
            <li>That little container goes fast!</li>
            <li>Not only did this help reduce the appearance of any stretch marks drastically, but it also made my skin feel healthier in general.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s not a long term treatment, I still decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it for a long time but so far it&#x27;s acceptable</li>
            <li>After our first child she tried out a few and they did not work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You only need to apply a small amount to your scars (I had to use quite a bit to even slightly cover mine because I had so many, so this lasted me about a month).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a year on newly stretchmarks and now they&#x27;re still there and harder to take out.</li>
            <li>I am 29yrs old, have tan &amp; dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very sceptical first few days, but later I realised my stretch marks became lighten and less visible.</li>
            <li>She normally uses the product after each bath and never combines it with any other product.  </li>
            <li>and they are very noticable because i am mix of white and black.</li>
            <li>When I bought this one I expected it to be the same old rubbish product that says it fixes stretch marks!</li>
            <li>Now they&#x27;re light ish pink to my skin time and hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, I have ordered 3 already and am going to keep on purchasing them, as I wouldn&#x27;t purchase any other brand or product!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Been using this for some time and have noticed good improvements in my skin.</li>

            <li> Best Stretch mark and scar treatment repair product available on the market.</li>
            <li> am thinking even a good product that works like this still takes time to do its thing, and it also helps to have someone who is impartial to notice the results over that period of time.</li>

            <li> All the good posts are because people get a free bottle for posting a good review.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wash the smell off my hands effectively.</li>
            <li> but my opinions are 100% my own.</li>

            <li> A really nice product.</li>
            <li> Best stretch mark cream I&#x27;ve used, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> so I say to each its own it may work for others</li>
            <li> maybe the 100% honest thing that will work is probably laser removal</li>
            <li> We will continue using as the product does smell nice and has presented no issues with skin sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> I know that you shouldn&#x27;t be ashamed of them but lets be honest here everyone/most people hope and wish there was a remedy.</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> Which is nice because it&#x27;s summer.</li>

            <li> I have tried using bio-oil, rose hip, pregnancy shea butter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a skinnier kind of gal, when I was diagnosed with diabetes</li>
            <li> I honestly have to say I like what I see.</li>

            <li> it also has a nice sent</li>

            <li> I did receive this cream at a reduced cost for an honest opinion.</li>

            <li> honestly i didnt use</li>
            <li> I read many good reviews on the product; therefore, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I used it very abundantly twice a day for about 3 weeks and then switched to just after I showered and rubbed it in all the way and the results have made me feel much more confident.</li>
            <li> Worth the try!!!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this awesome and effective product!</li>
            <li> Amazingly, after a month, all of my stretch marks have magically disappeared and I&#x27;m feeling very confident on going to the beach and pool now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this excellent product!</li>
            <li> I am really very happy with the result of this product and i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Me being a large guy myself, I also have stretchmarks on my shoulders, as my shoulders outgrew my skin, which makes this product even better as this means that both of us can reduce the amount of stretchmarks on our bodies and finally be happy with what we look like again!</li>
            <li> I have used many products for fading scars and dermarestore is absolutely the best one yet!!</li>
            <li> I will buy it again because it is good :) :)</li>
            <li> It has a very strong scent...</li>
            <li> It has a very strong chemical smell and I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> I was right!!!</li>
            <li> The DermaRestore is very effective, works quickly, and you gradually notice changes.</li>
            <li> I love how nice this works</li>
            <li> smells good, leaves skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> continued use will prove to be more effective.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome to help clear the skin, get rid of marks and scars...</li>
            <li> but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good!!!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t use it because the smell gives me headaches because it is so strong!</li>
            <li> I have tried many stretch mark products and this has been the best so far!</li>
            <li> Marks have subsided and skin appears clean and bright</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, i would totally recommend this to anyone trying to get the perfect skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dermarestore for 4 weeks now And tried so many brands before but this one is the best so far</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after having my first child and have been very pleased with its results!</li>
            <li> First when I saw that its GMP certified I was quite happy about the product.</li>
            <li> I am an avid dermaroller user and this cream goes great with derma rolling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li> but this would of been great to have bought &amp; used during my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Very smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> (...... however my stretch marks were very light before I started using this product</li>
            <li> And my skin is very smooth now.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that they will eventually become very light to be noticeable.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it has helped me tremendously and is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I think you need to use more than 1 bottle to see difference but for the new stretch marks is good!</li>
            <li> Huge difference!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Happily satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> but surely I noticed my stretch marks are going away.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Worked better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> After 2 months I can already see results and already feel much better about my scar.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to read instructions and warning before applying .</li>
            <li> It was okay</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> I probably should have known better</li>
            <li> Definitely under rated, best stretch mark cream I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Recommending to others, without a doubt.</li>
            <li> Okay let&#x27;s start off with my situation...</li>
            <li> I tried many lotions but none seemed to work.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be able to reclaim my body after the kids</li>
            <li> I have been eating healthy &amp; exercising</li>
            <li> but this product has not been able to improve my stretch marks</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t called yet though, mostly because I doubt that the product is working.</li>
            <li> It is up there with Barmon&#x27;s Stretch Mark cream and better than Palmer&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The dual use for scars makes it more of a buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this and keep posted if I see any more changes.</li>
            <li> and I didnt even want to look at my belly any more.</li>
            <li> I held off to review until I was sure of the results.</li>
            <li> I am confident most will disappear.</li>
            <li> Others may have better luck</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> Gained some weight so lovely stretch marks decided to pop up.</li>
            <li> I think don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li> No results, used for many weeks applying twice a day.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely satisfied with the outcome – it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Hopefully with continued use I will see more results.</li>
            <li> I have used many stretch mark creams before</li>
            <li> I have tried many creams before stating to help stretch  marks go away and none of them have ever worked like the dermarestore works.</li>
            <li> and I have recommended it to many of my friends who have had child and suffer from stretch  marks also.</li>
            <li> I will be using more of this and continue to use it until I get the results I am looking for.  </li>
            <li> what I did was took a look at the ingredients and was blown away that more people don&#x27;t try this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I sure believe in DermaRESTORE.</li>
            <li> I GOT MORE STRECH MARKS WITH</li>
            <li> But wait there&#x27;s more...</li>
            <li> ok there isn&#x27;t more, it did what it was suppose to do</li>
            <li> Hope and patience always pays. :)</li>
            <li> I WILL UPDATE once I have more information.</li>
            <li> Maybe if two bottles were used better results would come.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are fading more and the texture are smoothing out.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and hope to see a better improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll will be sure to update.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m also working out more</li>
            <li> and I hope for more.  </li>

            <li> She got incredibly self conscious around the 4 month stage.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a peculiar scent to the product that isn&#x27;t overwhelming, but can linger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a burn scar on my arm for years, but this product still was able to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Its smooth, effective product go and get it</li>

            <li> Just patience is required to see how much more it can be done.</li>

            <li> just yet more time is needed</li>
            <li> When I apply the lotion twice a day (am and pm), my stretch marks look a lot better.  </li>
            <li> If I skip a day or two, they seem to be more pronounced.  </li>
            <li> it works better than cocoa butter you get at the stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will take more time for them to fade</li>
            <li> After applying it twice a day since i got it, i&#x27;ve noticed that my scars don&#x27;t look so prominent anymore.</li>

            <li> It is like magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> She no is able to go out and where a bikini as if she never had kids.</li>
            <li> DermaRESTORE is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m able to show her my stomach as proof</li>

            <li> As long as you follow the instructions right for the cream, it works great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the lotion/cream has a nice texture and it absorbed relatively quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Am so excited that the scars and stretch marks are fading out.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 4 weeks and there is a significant reduction in the redness of my stretchmarks.  </li>
            <li> This product helped me to reduce my stretches significantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks and my stretch marks have faded significantly.  </li>
            <li> A long way to go before they dissappear but a great start.</li>
            <li> In full disclosure I am writing this review to receive a free additional bottle of the product.</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to stretch marks from working out and lifting weights and using DermRestore after month significantly diminished mine.</li>
            <li> Faded the stretch marks on my hips and thighs significantly and nothing else has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> Ok, I will be the first to admit.</li>
            <li> Well worth money!</li>
            <li> significantly lightened the scar</li>
            <li> In about a week I saw a significant difference.</li>
            <li> stretch marks have faded significantly since I started using this product 4 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> so when she gets excited about something it is time to take a notice.</li>
            <li> And I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant lightening.</li>
            <li> and so far very pleased.</li>
            <li> So when the chance came to review this product I was really excited.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a significant change on my hips and thighs stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it at the store and it worked</li>
            <li> I saw the difference in significantly diminished stretch marks on my stomach.</li>
            <li> After using it for a while my stretch marks had faded significantly.</li>
            <li> I am using it for 4 weeks and my stretch marks have faded significantly.</li>
            <li> , I was pretty upset about it because those two things are my favorite things to do</li>
            <li> Significant reduction in appearance of stretch marks after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased DermaRESTORE after trying two bottles of mederma, and not noticing any significant improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super sensitive to smell, and was glad to find it wasn&#x27;t too strong smelling!  </li>
            <li> Worked amazingly well on a new scar.</li>
            <li> It quickly absorbs into my skin and goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li> Starting to work good, waiting on my free bottle</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not that comfortable posting the pics, but if you have mild stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It really works and good, fast result.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive and I can honestly say that I didn&#x27;t have any side affects from this product</li>
            <li> They are not gone completely, but come on, this isn&#x27;t magic!</li>
            <li> used this derma cream right after my derma roller and am seeing great results a month later</li>
            <li> I would most certainly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a treatment for stress marks or scars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I chose right!</li>
            <li> I have seen 0 stretch marks, I can personally say this is the best product, I recommended this to several friends I knew who were pregnant and were astounded with the results!</li>
            <li> Certainly not the best, but you can say that it’s better than many other products.</li>
            <li> Needed something for a bright red scar.</li>
            <li> my stretch marks are not as bright and are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> Very well i know many people think this doesnt work,</li>
            <li> After gaining 6 sizes in a short period of time, I have a fair amount of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Saw absolute no results, if anything I think it created more stretch marks</li>
            <li> I rushed and bought this product as soon as I came to know that this effectively work on old scars.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this product I love</li>
            <li> Just for reference, one bottle is actually still descent with a good amount of cream still in it</li>
            <li> so glad this is working thanks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily I&#x27;ve done my research and found this latest skin repair cream and let&#x27;s face it, the price is very reasonable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks :-)</li>
            <li> and it is true.</li>
            <li> and hopefully I won&#x27;t be able to see my marks much longer .</li>
            <li> Theres a very noticeable difference in the area now and my hubby even tells me how much better it looks.</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks from some weight gain on my thighs and butt.(sad but true)</li>
            <li> I like to use this cream after I put on some vitamin C serum so that I can get my full results.</li>
            <li> and i have seen a whole lot of improvement in the visibility of my stretch marks :)</li>
            <li> This item works really good would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> After countless research, I discovered lots of good reviews on this product so I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> Good product, still in the initial stages of visible change though.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recently told me how good this product was</li>
            <li> This product is true, it works wonders on stretch marks and burn marks.</li>
            <li> If you have many stretchmarks over a wider area, you should make a $30 investment in a good dermaroller, like Shessentials dermaroller, and forget spending this much money on a tiny amount of cream.</li>
            <li> but this was good enough for me.</li>
            <li> It also moisturizes my skin, leaving me nice and soft.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> No bad smells.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t stain my clothes and there is no bad fishy smell either.</li>
            <li> Smell is not bad.</li>
            <li> This product works great on old and new scar.</li>
            <li> This was the first product that I tried and I&#x27;m glad I chose right.</li>
            <li> Use cream only two weeks, but I like it, is well absorbed and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The best thing is you can hardly tell that you even had stretch marks in the very first place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and smooth and you can almost feel it working right away.</li>
            <li> but my other stretchmarks are fading so for that i am really happy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, I don&#x27;t like spending more than $20 for something that seems like fancy lotion, but it&#x27;s not, this is a true repairing product.  </li>
            <li> do to quick growth during weight lifting and mass gain.  </li>
            <li> I am 7 months pregnant and wanted to get a head start at my stretch mark/scars recovery process.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks have reduced tremendously.</li>
            <li> It took my stench marks from &amp;#34;Hey.&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;LOOK AT ME!&amp;#34; Since using this product, my marks became more an more noticeable and did not fade away, even after using the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and</li>
            <li> My pregnant wife loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but it does work quickly.</li>
            <li> After seeing this product here i bought it for my pregnant wife so she could use it after giving birth.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 27 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> Now i ordered my second bottle, i hope they get better and better.</li>
            <li> I would do something about them, so I bought the Palmer&#x27;s stretch mark cream for pregnant people -</li>
            <li> After using this product I was astonished by how quickly it worked and helped my stretch marks go away and made my self esteem boost as well.</li>
            <li> , i am 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li> Stretch mark started while i was 7 month pregnant, and i started using Clarins and that was not helpful at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used many different products and this product has provided better results for me.</li>
            <li> But still working quickly</li>
            <li> My scar is big and I just took my chance with this product, it turns out it is effective and cheap for its price.</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant I use a lot of oil for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am about 34 weeks pregnant now.</li>
            <li> but it fades away quickly and it doesn&#x27;t stay on your clothes.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s 3 months pregnant</li>
            <li> I noticed results quick with this product.</li>
            <li> Seeing mild effects.</li>
            <li> Overall, the lotion has made my skin more supple, and my stretch marks are more faded.</li>
            <li> Luckily I found</li>
            <li> there is a scent but its not overbearing and it quickly fades once the cream is applied.</li>
            <li> I started using the cream about a month after I gave birth and didn&#x27;t notice a significant change right away.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> Carried differently, more pointy and high.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a huge difference with just my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference within 4 days, and my wife stopped kidding me about using it after the first week</li>
            <li> DermaRESTORE is a product that you can apply directly on any marks you would like to minimize over the course of so many days, you should see a significant difference.</li>
            <li> Another reason why this product is good is this product doesn&#x27;t break the bank and one bottle goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product i have been using for two weeks now and has worked better then anything i have used so far and has faded all my stretch marks most you cant see now.</li>
            <li> They are much less noticeable and I feel a lot more confident!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to do much for the really old ones, but works great on the new ones!</li>
            <li> So far no side-effects just positive results, will be ordering more once this runs out!</li>
            <li> I got another bottle not because I really need it, because the first bottle work its magic.</li>
            <li> Slowly but surely showing effective!  </li>
            <li> it was way to strong the chemical smell and after awhile it just wants to make you vomit.</li>
            <li> I did receive my first bottle free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my actual experience and honest opinions of this cream.</li>
            <li> Try dermarestore first!</li>
            <li> On my second bottle it works great and faster with 1.5mm derma roller from new spa...</li>
            <li> I did the old cocoa butter lotion while pregnant because I was told that, that would reduce them, but to no avail they are there and there are many of them.</li>
            <li> I love the smell &amp; how it&#x27;s not messy &amp; dries up quick.</li>
            <li> :  I managed last summer to slam my leg into the top of a staple sticking out a picnic table bench at night and made a good 3mm or so dent that bled fairly well, not good times.  </li>
            <li> Bought for teenager who has bright red stretch marks from fast growth.  </li>
            <li> Its amazing I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of different products</li>
            <li> not everyone can have such amazing results</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks I began to notice great results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to see amazing results...</li>
            <li> WEll i have suffered with stretch marks for some time,However this product here was worth</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE ON FRESH SCARS .</li>
            <li> wanted to warn you about applying it on fresh scars.</li>
            <li> Had an old stretch mark on my boobs.now look more clearer .</li>
            <li> For what you pay, I would say its worth it.  </li>
            <li> It helped me hide many of the unappealing stretch marks and scars and works great.</li>
            <li> I find this useful</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I am using DermaRESTORE, they are completly gone!&lt;br /&gt;Definately worth a try</li>
            <li> IDK, either way it is a nice product I just did not see any actual improvement</li>
            <li> honestly I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in my stretch marks  </li>
            <li> and I must say that it was worth buying..</li>
            <li> Honestly this is the only product that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> My skin absorbed the lotion well.</li>
            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks from childbirth so far not to many things have worked.</li>
            <li> so I would remember to apply it, but it is totally worth the time and effort.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth trying to reduce appearance of your stretch marks from pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> but, not as red, which is nice.</li>
            <li> As far as a product can go derma store has gone I love ordering it and continually use it every day.</li>
            <li> Found Dermarestore when searching \\&quot;scar treatment for old scars\\&quot; on amazon and they were at the top with over 100 reviews.</li>
            <li> and so far I have to say that it&#x27;s &#x27;okay&#x27;.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER you can lighten it to where it won&#x27;t be as visible as when it&#x27;s fresh.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I would usually be wary of companies that &#x27;bribes&#x27; their customers, but given how great this product is in my opinion, I don&#x27;t mind and actually command them for their good marketing strategy!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get your hopes up though because it will NOT remove all your scars, but more than enough to make a significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve been pregnant with my first child I got stretch marks on my belly.</li>
            <li> SAW QUICK RESULT WITHIN FIRST 2 WEEKS BUT</li>
            <li> Dermarestore Stretch Mark and Scar Treatment really has significant and beneficial effects on the skin.  </li>
            <li> other then that good product 4/5 because of smell.</li>
            <li> Very much wishful thinking for any kind of these products to actually work,</li>
            <li> I just restarted the process of rolling and applying the product right after and for a week after so.</li>
            <li> And she was definitely right</li>
            <li> I battled with my weight right up until I had my daughter 10 years ago, so my stretch marks are abundant(its quite embaressing</li>
            <li> right on both hips</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks and for the longest time I searched and searched for a product that would be right for me and reduce the appearance of my marks.</li>
            <li> Beleive me, anything that takes SOME of the stretch marks away is a step in the right direction.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product right away.</li>
            <li> I started using this product right away.  </li>
            <li> and he was absoloutely right.</li>
            <li> and they sent a replacement right away.  </li>
            <li> Arrived right on time, no delays whatsoever.</li>
            <li> bought the DermaRestore because of the positive reviews I wish that I saw the review from  - June 19, 2014 Trash!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very helpful, clean and leaves no marks.</li>
            <li> As with other creams, the more consistent you apply it the better the results.  </li>
            <li> It smells pleasant, and I like the fact that it has natural essential oils and extracts in it.  </li>
            <li> I started using Dermarestore and after a few weeks I have seen a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better in general and the stretch marks seem to be fading.</li>
            <li> After using this magic concoction of pure goodness, my stretch marks from college have faded away into near nothingness.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are natural, I have never gained/lost significant weight and have never been pregnant.</li>
            <li> right now i have finished my first bottle</li>
            <li> It works very well with pregnant women</li>
            <li> The pump bottle is nice, but I cannot tell how much cream is really left because of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to to continue for a few more months to see if any more progress is made.</li>
            <li> its not something that&#x27;ll work super fast.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it, it&#x27;s almost completely removed all my stretch marks</li>
            <li> it works good, it wont desperate, but its good.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a month back and have seen good progress so far.</li>
            <li> Some will say that it works super fast.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are fading away, I&#x27;m pretty sure a few more weeks</li>
            <li> My stretch marks have not yet improved in texture, but the color is becoming more like the surrounding skin tone, so they are less visible.</li>
            <li> and it works very very well.</li>
            <li> It has a very light smell which is a giant plus as well.</li>
            <li> I received this very fast, i have started to use it but still no results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Consistency is key with anything you have to make sure you follow the directions and consistently use it in the right way</li>
            <li> It seems fine so far, my skin isn&#x27;t bothered and it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the product!!</li>
            <li> I am definitely noticing super fast results and I am very excited about this treatment,</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that I can see it&#x27;s making a difference.</li>
            <li> I searched thru many products and reviews here on Amazon and finally decided on DermaRESTORE.  </li>
            <li> and I saw results fast!</li>
            <li> Granted, I haven&#x27;t used it 2 times a day consistently.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t entirely too sure.</li>
            <li> I have many stretch marks on my belly, legs and upper arms.  </li>
            <li> I started using this cream on my arms first</li>
            <li> I am now over 20 years old and still short with the same stretch marks, but ever since using this product I can honestly say that I am not afraid to take off my clothes in front of my handsome fiancé.</li>
            <li> Plus my skin has never been so smooth and soft if for nothing else</li>
            <li> Love the way this product leaves my skin, would definitely recommend for anyone having skin problems.</li>
            <li> The first 3 products I bought didn&#x27;t work at all, I was devastated and thought and thought that I was gonna be stuck with my stretch lines forever.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to ladies who have stretch marks!!</li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t be any more obvious that you&#x27;re putting chemicals onto your body with the way this stuff smells.</li>
            <li> Im almost done with my first bottle</li>
            <li> I use this product religiously twice a day (morning/nighttime) and I&#x27;m truly satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I have seen women trying many different methods, from herbal to faith healing, to restore their skin shine and texture.</li>
            <li> you go through of not having been able to have the skin you had prior pregnancy.</li>
            <li> After my first child I had a lot of stretch marks on my belly.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase and I am on my 24th day already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost beach body ready!</li>
            <li> My gf been using this cream consistently.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t believe it would work, but I went ahead, bought it</li>
            <li> but In the third week I notice they were blending more</li>
            <li> After using jut one bottle I realized I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied, so I know to order 2 bottles next time .</li>
            <li> and if you didn&#x27;t know exactly where it was  </li>
            <li> Will continue using this first bottle and see what miracle will happen.</li>
            <li> Really improved my strechmarks and helped with my scars, also cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really think this was going to work, but since it was made in the USA, I thought I could trust it!</li>
            <li> With my first pregnancy I had gained 82 pounds.</li>
            <li> so im going to try a different product to get rid of it:)</li>
            <li> so the results i have really suprise me !</li>
            <li> At first, I was disapointed in the product as I saw no results.  </li>
            <li> and I actually think my stretch marks became more pronounced and darker in color.</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife after she had or first child because she wanted to try and get rid of the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> thank you so much!</li>
            <li> and it is starting to fade away, i hope after 2 or 3 months it will vanishes :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have light visible scars than the old more visible red ones I had.</li>
            <li> thanks Derma Restore!</li>
            <li> and i just finished my first bottle</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OK NOT REALLUY SEE MUCH DIFFERENT</li>
            <li> I started to use this cream about three weeks ago on fresh stretch-marks on my belly just after having a baby and the stretch-marks look much lighter now</li>
            <li> This scar treatment worked pretty well&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works !</li>
            <li> So, before i tried this product, i&#x27;ve been putting on different brands of stretch mark repair stuff on my belly for more than a year.</li>
            <li> For the first 2 weeks I used Dermarestore 3 times a day , then I tapered off to 2 times a day , to once a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to keep in mind that stretch marks are permenant skin damage and that any product you try is not going to completely erase them</li>
            <li> I have tried many different lotions, creams and serums, but none of them seemed to work.</li>
            <li> If your looking results in real time, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> It probably works better with a derma roller which is my next purchase when I get paid!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says and I can already tell a difference in my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical since I have tried so many different products</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone interested in scar removal.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;vegot my sexy back</li>
            <li> After having my first baby, stretch marks are what I dreaded.</li>
            <li> It might change for few more weeks if I really get outstanding results.</li>
            <li> I really would recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> After first couple days of using it, I noticed it working.</li>
            <li> the medications made me gain a ton of weight extremely fast!</li>
            <li> At first I had Stretch marks covering my stomach and sides.</li>
            <li> exactly where I want to be yet</li>
            <li> I use to work out a lot during my days in highschool and that left me with many stretch marks on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> what I like most of all they have a satisfaction guaranteed or your money back</li>
            <li> I am almost done with the first bottle and I am going to get another one.</li>
            <li> When I started using it, I had to smell it first.</li>
            <li> but I feel like people should be aware of this.</li>
            <li> All of these products are usually mediocre at best</li>
            <li> After the first use I already started seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much DermaRESTORE for everything!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and can really see an improvement!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a very efficient product!</li>
            <li> Hopefully i can see some very soon!</li>
            <li> This was the first product that I tried to remove them</li>
            <li> did a Google search for stretch mark removal and after sifting through many scam websites, I finally found myself on this Amazon listing.</li>
            <li> you recover your self-esteem and not feel that you have only creams to rely on for the hopes of a better appearance.</li>
            <li> I am so blessed to be able to purchase this for a markdown price in return for my objective and equitable review.</li>
            <li> works pretty well...</li>
            <li> I am exactly 6 months post baby and started using at 3 months.</li>
            <li> What was a deep reddish scar has lighted and looks much better.</li>
            <li> After using the product I&#x27;ve noticed a better improvement in the appearance of my stretch marks (Arms / love handles) I&#x27;m not sure if the derma roller was the reason</li>
            <li> I lost a lot of weight in a short amount of time after a lapband operation, and I ended up with a lot of embarassing stretch marks even though I felt so much better about my weight loss.  </li>
            <li> The pump does not release alot of product, so you have to pump a few times to get a good amount.</li>
            <li> I am very excited to see the final results.</li>
            <li> i am very heated up right now.</li>
            <li> DermaRESTORE had such an amazing action while coping with my pregnancy stretch marks!</li>
            <li> No bad smell, absorbs well, very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was finally able to remove a portion of this large white sticker, but the label came off with it.</li>
            <li> I bought more than one bottle and just finished the whole first bottle and am just now starting to see a difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other products but did not seem to have these kind of results.</li>
            <li> After that I have gifted this products to my other pregnant friends.</li>
            <li> My scar is gone completely, I&#x27;v been suffering with this huge scar on my forehead, and thanks to this product</li>
            <li> I love that is made from vitamins and minerals because the less chemicals used on your body the better and this product is exactly chemical free that will help you get your skin back to normal.</li>
            <li> Well finally I found this product and saw all the good reviews it had, and decided to give it a try one last time.</li>
            <li> Love it and so thankful for the fast results after only using for about two to three months!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really think it helps much, but it definitely is worth a try.</li>
            <li> As a male using this, it works on most of stretch marks around the hips and arms but not so much on the.. gluteus maximus (booty).</li>
            <li> This cream is just as good as the expensive ones and sometimes better than some.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews &amp; there was a lot for stretch marks &amp; decided to try based on positive reviews.</li>
            <li> But for now I have positive hope for this.</li>
            <li> I’ve had my stretch marks for over 8 years now and pretty much given up hope of repairing them.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few other stretch mark creams, but this one works best for me.  </li>
            <li> and she never fails to remind me how much of a difference she sees with her stretch marks now.</li>
            <li> There might be some minor insignificant improvement, but nothing more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure for a scar that hasn&#x27;t been there for a long time, it would work wonders since it made a difference on mine.</li>
            <li> I had pretty much given up hope...</li>
            <li> I have really deep stretch marks all over my abdominal area due to pregnancy and have been undergoing fraxel and carboxy treatments and use a bunch of creams in conjunction to those treatments and decided to give this one a try as well since it had great reviews.</li>
            <li> the results are evident even within 2-3 weeks, really helpful product.</li>
            <li> First thing about stretch mark I have heard is that they don&#x27;t really go away</li>
            <li> After having her first child, she had stretch marks on her stomach and it really upset her.</li>
            <li> After 15 years and hundreds of dollars later on many products, with little to none results whatsoever, January 20 I discovered DermaRESTORE on Amazon I sew great reviews and said why not so I purchased this product and received it 2 days later.  </li>
            <li> And I must also say that the picture shown on the product by the manufacturers is a real “mild” case looking at what the product has done in our more serious case..</li>
            <li> However, when I am looking down at my own body, I can still see them.  </li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend this to a pregnant woman only because i dont believe in putting anything on yourself or taking anything while pregnant.</li>
            <li> I am 5 months pregnant at this point and so far I have not  noticed any stretch mark.</li>
            <li> The strong chemical smell made me too nervous to use, especially around my baby.</li>
            <li> Well a few weeks beyond the 4 weeks (honestly i didnt use it consistently)</li>
            <li> have a large butt</li>
            <li> She had extremely large stretch marks all over the body and had lost hope trying any product until I found Dermarestore for her.</li>
            <li> and i thought it certainly couldnt hurt.</li>
            <li> After being in an accident, I had received large scars.</li>
            <li> But this is a miracle worker for women after giving birth or losing a large amount of weight.</li>
            <li> I have certainly seen an improvement.</li>
            <li> I feel like myself again when wearing certain clothes.</li>
            <li> While it may more than 1 bottle to really see the difference, progress is still to be expected after using 3/4 of the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to get a new one and apply it differently to see if it works better.</li>
            <li> She has previously used a different brand of lotion, from which she received great results in days.  </li>
            <li> For a nice and by using this merchandise every single day, for nearly 3 months.</li>
            <li> After the first three weeks, you could totally see a significant difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope to be able to report back in a few more weeks with increased positive results.</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up.</li>
            <li> but this cream really do it..</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> This has done absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve the look of his or her stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone seeking a dermatological solution for improving scar tissue as it worked in my experience!</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re so much lighter now</li>
            <li> Mind you, they are still there, but you have to look really closely to see them.</li>
            <li> This stretch mark cream really does work</li>
            <li> I had been using this product from sometime now, and it really works.</li>
            <li> We were bought surprise how fast it worked.</li>
            <li> The shipping was Farley fast and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> After my 4th child, I had HUNDREDS of stretch marks, and decided to give this dermarestore  a try because I was really self-conscious about them.</li>
            <li> it has really helped mine</li>
            <li> but my clients often do and one day a client said they ordered this product off of amazon and it was really working so</li>
            <li> As a mom with stretch marks, this product really helped and boosted my confidence.</li>
            <li> It was very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the DermaRestore, they no longer exists on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for 4 months straight.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> DermaRESTORE really does what its name says.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It has a very chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li> and I can really tell a difference</li>
            <li> Highly recommend DermaRestore to anyone who has stretch marks and is looking to improve the look of them!</li>
            <li> I will continue using it to see how much my marks will fade.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this wonder product.</li>
            <li> Totally risk free.</li>
            <li> Helped fade stretch marks very well.</li>
            <li> but dermarestore worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> and my stretch marks really have reduced in color.</li>
            <li> I could see the difference very soon.</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> She really doesn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> The cream really does lighten the marks.</li>
            <li> Before having my son I was very paranoid about acquiring stretch marks after giving birth to him.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got absolutely did wonders for me.</li>
            <li> We had tried a couple of the OTC creams and they just weren&#x27;t doing much of anything.</li>
            <li> After using a whole bottle, no results.</li>
            <li> I like this product and its really working.</li>
            <li> It was just like a magic, it worked so well on her skin than we expected, after using three bottles within 6months.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t begin to explain</li>
            <li> I am very self-conscious about my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I am a light skin asian woman who just had a baby.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as fast for me as for everyone from what I read on their reviews.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say this has worked for me.  </li>
            <li> The wound has healed but I don&#x27;t really like the scar.</li>
            <li> Not much done so far..might need more time.</li>
            <li> I used almost the whole bottle before my girlfriend commented on how they were fading.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice because I see it every day, so the change was gradual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend it for anyone with fresh scars, but for the people out there like me with decades old growth spurt scars, I would still recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would work</li>
            <li> Its just not working as fast as i thought it would.</li>
            <li> Its very embarrasing if you have a belly baring shirt</li>
            <li> Thanks DermaRoller for taking my stretch marks away.</li>
            <li> and I noticed absolutely zero difference.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of their stretch marks.</li>
            <li> but this one really does work and</li>
            <li> Thank you, I really appreciate this product.</li>
            <li> My strength marks have lighted up so much.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a product that worked fast and had no side effects.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look as intense as before.</li>
            <li> When I got this at a promotional rate to give opinion on the product, I am so ecstatic to test it out if it really works.</li>
            <li> edit this page if I really recommend it.</li>

            <li> This product was very helpful</li>
            <li> I really get fat, so</li>
            <li> This is absolutely some sort of hand cream.</li>
            <li> and currently they&#x27;re smooth and bearly visible from a distance.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>

            <li> But this cream really works.</li>
            <li> it really seems to be working</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of any difference with mama mio.</li>
            <li> It cost too much for uncertain results.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for healing told stretch marks.</li>

            <li> My stretch marks have lightened up and the skin is much softer.</li>
            <li> but I have used for 6 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using this and my stretch marks have cleared up so much.</li>
            <li> I just dont want them to show too much.</li>
            <li> This product really works</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to use it, thinking I&#x27;d be scarred for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE REVIEWS ARE FAKE BECAUSE THEY OFFER A FREE BOTTLE AFTER YOU WRITING A GOOD REVIEW -  </li>
            <li> I have tried 4 different types of Stretch marks  either oil or cream after i gave birth, so far this one works better.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of natural things like aloe, but overall I could not pronounce most of the items and had to look them up.</li>
            <li> Honestly this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Greatly soften the appearance of a five years old scar and slowly fading it away.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much just a typical lotion that costs a lot more.</li>
            <li> wow!!!</li>
            <li> They are pretty new</li>
            <li> So, I got this for a friend (who was extremely self conscious about her stretch marks after have kids) and this worked amazingly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product because it really works, my skin is much firmer then before I used this product and my stretch marks are much lighter then before .</li>
            <li> After 1 week, I noticed a significant difference and the scar was starting to fade.</li>
            <li> but as for me maybe I would have to continue to use it to see a big significant change I been using it for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I will also say we have been doing one set of stretch marks with DermaRESTORE and another set (other side of the body) with Mederma Stretch Mark Therapy, and the DermaRESTORE side does look better.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product recently, and up till now it is working miracles; my stretch marks have faded significantly and are almost unnoticeable now.</li>
            <li> I apply it twice a day like it says an I&#x27;m already excited for next swim suit season!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products but none seem to work.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products to help with stretch marks/ scar treatment.</li>
            <li> Have tried so many other products</li>
            <li> The marks have reduced in shades, but not disappeared, but I am purchasing it again, since I think other creams are costly and do not have satisfying reviews for the cost.</li>
            <li> The price is the cheapest on the market and shows more results then any other scare treatment product.</li>
            <li> I am posting this as my initial review for this product because I am excited.</li>
            <li> It worked better than some other treatments I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty strong but it glides on very smoothly and isn&#x27;t super thick and goopy like other creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li> After a week of use we began to see a massive improvement with the stretch-marks around her stomach becoming a lot fainter, with some having disappeared completely.</li>
            <li> The MEDERMA is no miracle cream either, but at least, you see some result and  most importantly, it leaves your skin incredibly SOFT.</li>
            <li> Not worth continuing to see if magically it started working in another two weeks.</li>
            <li> After my last child I was faced with the fact that I had a stomach full of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Two full bottles is just enough !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty young</li>
            <li> , I am pretty self conscious about them.</li>
            <li> and I have used many others before with not success...</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd pregnancy so my skin stretched more than the first.</li>
            <li> New respect for stretch mark creams!</li>
            <li> I love this product i have previously used Bio oil and even tried coconut oil .</li>
            <li> I use Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter which costs a lot less and has a better scent to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that if I were to continue using the product they would be even less visable.</li>
            <li> I would say this has worked better for me than previous products I have used</li>
            <li> Many of my scars and stretch marks have faded and are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I just opened my 3rd bottle yesterday, and am just happy that something work, no matter how slowly 😊</li>
            <li> I used cocoa butter the entire time I was pregnant with both of my daughters</li>
            <li> However, the company that sells this DermaRESTORE product is very generous and may offer you a complimentary second bottle!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed some of my older, lighter stretch marks fading.</li>
            <li> Overtime and steady use of DermaRESTORE</li>
            <li> I have found this treatment to not only diminish the appearance of my existing stretch marks, but to also act as a preventative measure for the future, which is just as important in the reduction of stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Having been embarrassed to take my shirt off for the last couple years, this is a tremendous relief and I will continue using this lotion until they&#x27;re gone</li>
            <li> it getting older.</li>
            <li> I had applied many different things to it in the beginning, including shae butter, and aloe and definitely noticed no improvement.</li>
            <li> and I am seeing steady improvements.</li>
            <li> Most likely you would need to purchase a second bottle to see your stretch marks begin to fade away.</li>
            <li> You could see the progress within a few months it had definitely made a good portion of the stretch marks fade away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back to my bikinis for sure by next summer!</li>
            <li> I had some stretch marks, mainly on my chest and thigh areas.</li>
            <li> I have been applying the DermaRESTORE mainly once every two days (after showering).</li>
            <li> I’m going to come back for my second bottle for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend you try this.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other products but never had these kind of results.</li>
            <li> it is far better than any other in the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a little over a month and am satisfied and am going to keep using this product</li>
            <li> do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> and that is when I decided to spend a little more money on a product.</li>
            <li> and that is when I decided to spend a little more money on a product.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a little of this cream on your finger tip.</li>
            <li> They did not miraculously disappear over night, but each week they get a little better.</li>
            <li> I have little and light stretch mark, but given this is my first baby</li>
            <li> i have very high hopes that after a few more weeks, my skin will look and feel like its old self.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a few weeks and can already tell a huge difference!</li>
            <li> My skin was left dry, clean, and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I was proud of having a baby, but was ashamed of the way my skin looked.</li>
            <li> but it does leave my skin really really soft which i really like</li>
            <li> Although I was skeptical of this product, I went ahead and purchased it based on the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> My five year old son has even noticed how much nicer my stomach looks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results I would say this product is for someone who is buying 3 bottles and that really wants to clear up stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Each day I do see the redness of my stretch marks change from pink to light skin tonal color.</li>
            <li> So far, I am really liking this product, and the results am getting.</li>
            <li> I was very self conscious about it.</li>
            <li> After 4 children, she was very self conscious about stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It really matters for me that it works even for my old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I only used it on fresh stretch marks</li>
            <li> and I waiting to see my results after using it for a few more months.</li>
            <li> I should have done more research on this product because it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and smells pretty good.... but sadly to say this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> We will know more in a few months and I&#x27;ll update  my review.  </li>
            <li> ; had written, all of them pretty much reviewed the same products--hair towels, weight loss supplements, printer cartriges, etc.</li>
            <li> Why I bought this product because it contains a proprietary complex of rare essential oils, vitamins, and uniquely effective extracts designed for optimal results.</li>
            <li> Just apply it regularly everyday and your scars will fade away after 3 weeks, like mine :)</li>
            <li> so i know that my stretch marks are still pretty deep and this cream did not help fill them out much.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few months, my scars have substantially minimized and I have been extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> While it does not seem to have affected the lotion&#x27;s effectiveness, it made me question for a couple of days whether the color change was normal.    </li>
            <li> I tried so many creams to lighten up my stretch marks, and so far this is the only cream that actually worked for me!!!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this product would work that I even bought a second bottle after I ran out of the first one.</li>
            <li> They stand behind their product, and the customer service is good as well.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good idea before they got even worse</li>
            <li> the odor was to strong and it lingered on my effect areas for a long time, so much that i was starting to give me a headache.</li>
            <li> After only four weeks, I can easily see a difference and my marks have finally started to fade!  </li>
            <li> I love this product it helps tremendously with my stretch marks, which have over the years gotten progressively worse.</li>
            <li> I am using my second bottle right now.</li>
            <li> I think that if I had used it the right way the entire time the marks would be even lighter.</li>
            <li> I bought it straight away after seeing all those positive reviews and the low price of $28!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this product around a month ago for my partner as she has recently had our first child and has been struggling with the stretchmarks that she has gained through pregnancy, within the first two weeks, we saw massive improvements with the stretchmarks around her stomach, and they had become so much fainter.</li>
            <li> I use it for a few weeks now and the stretch marks seem to disappear, not completely yet, but you can see huge a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I admit I was doubtful at first but with diligent use I have definitely noticed improvement and feel pretty confident that even more is to come!</li>
            <li> and i have new ones ( not anymore tho!)&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> I have not seen new stretch marks</li>
            <li> I learned to live with them, but then I decided one day</li>
            <li> My mother doesn&#x27;t get wrapped up into the new products coming out or anything like that</li>
            <li> Since I have used it I haven&#x27;t noticed any new marks.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it hardly smells and the skin absorbs it really fast, so it&#x27;s really comfortable!</li>
            <li> My mother surprised me with a bottle of DermaRESTORE, and after just a few weeks of using it, my skin looks much better, and smoother.</li>
            <li> and I personally used this product and it worked better than expected .</li>
            <li> I guess reading most recent reviews does not work, especially if everybody tries to give it a second chance and goes for a free bottle.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that when I used mederma I got a compliment from a girl that I smelled good, and with DermaRESTORE</li>
            <li> The reason i give it four stars is the bottle is small and if you use as instructed(twice a day), you can easily go through one bottle in a month if you have a large area to cover.</li>
            <li> The coloration became significantly lighter, going from a dark purple to a light pink.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and not a strong smell like I&#x27;ve had before in other brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been diligently using it and have seen no results, my skin is just very soft.</li>
            <li> The product is very nice, i ended up getting quite a few stretch marks on my thighs from pregnancy and after using this cream for a few weeks I can already tell they are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> bought the DermaRestore because of the positive reviews, but I&#x27;m starting to think that most of the reviews are fake because they were offer a &#x27;free bottle after writing a review&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I now wear sleeveless, albeit around the house, but even this is a huge improvement as I&#x27;ve spent my whole life in short sleeves.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> but Im sure i can find other lotions that can do this same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 yrs old &amp; have 3 kids all by C-Section &amp; I had practically given up on these stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I would assess that 65% of the scaring has completely lightened up to my skin&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream for exactly 3 weeks and 5 days, and it simply gave me hope</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use stretch mark creams in the past, including Mederma&#x27;s Stretch Mark Therapy and this product worked much better.</li>
            <li> Was really surprised how well this worked!  </li>
            <li> I had some pretty deep stretch marks from pregnancy, I started using this soon after delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as she was left with a stretch mark after having our first child.</li>
            <li> Well, it definitely helped in the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> While I normally like to go all natural, this has quite the list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ashamed of the marks and how vivid they are.  </li>
            <li> now my stretch mark started to vanished and the old scar start to disappear!</li>
            <li> IVE USED THUS FAR!</li>
            <li> My only comment/mini-complaint is that when I first started using the lotion, it was a off-white color.</li>
            <li> my first pregnancy I used body shop cocoa butter, but as surface area started getting larger, I got more lazy to apply.</li>
            <li> there are such rave reviews, but my friend due a week before me with her 1st has many stretch marks with this product.</li>
            <li> The first time I received the product in the mail, there were traces of cream that were outside the container</li>
            <li> For the old ones it needs time!</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products in the past, but this is the first product that has done anything worth mentioning!</li>
            <li> My scars aren&#x27;t completely gone, but I feel normal again.</li>
            <li> I tried several other products in past,  but never got these kind of significant results.</li>
            <li> stretch marks faded significantly (even improved old, red stretch marks on my inner thighs).  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see any change in my stretch marks- the old ones nor the new ones.</li>
            <li> With the changing of her body she gets new ones frequently.</li>
            <li> I had new ( 8-12 months old ) stretch marks on my things.</li>
            <li> I used this after I had my son and it, improved the look of my stretch marks, new and old.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty faint and rather nice.</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy and I am trying to be conscious about a lot thing related to the pregnancy; including stretch marks.</li>
            <li> There was what I thought some slight results, but I found that the cream itself leaves a skin colored residue that was short term (like foundation) and no long term scar reduction of any kind.</li>
            <li> After a month of use, my old and new stretch marks and scars are nearly gone.</li>
            <li> skin is different and you may get more or less results, but</li>
            <li> I purchased this product around 3 weeks ago for my wife as is currently 8 months pregnant with our child and has been concerned with the stretch-marks that she has gained recently.</li>
            <li> After my surgery I had a large scar on my back.</li>
            <li> I should also mention that when I bought the bottle, there was a little sticker saying to call for a free bottle.</li>
            <li> But I mainly ordered this to help with a huge dark scar on my back from a surgery I had about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> After a while, most of the stretch marks have at least faded to a white color, they are certainly still visible.</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin a nice smooth feel, doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell</li>
            <li> I was so self conscious about all my strechmarks, but no matter how much I worked out and dieted with the sole intention to get rid of it, it would never disappear.</li>
            <li> but DermaRESTORE is the only one that produces amazing results!&lt;br /&gt;For only just a few weeks</li>
            <li> (Medxpress did clear me when I went there</li>
            <li> We would recommend to anyone trying to clear up stretch marks</li>
            <li> but then just completely stop.</li>
            <li> I put on twice a day and would reccomend this product for anyone with old stretch marks..</li>
            <li> I had become self conscious about it and wanted to try something to minimize the scar.  </li>
            <li> , I started rubbing this product on my almost 3 week old scar</li>
            <li> And yes it has worked as far for me, and I hope this will continue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old, my mother never got stretch marks</li>
            <li> A natural product.</li>
            <li> It helps me reduce my old stretch mark.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Derma Restore has completely lightened all my stretch marks and they are no longer visible.</li>
            <li> I am so pleasantly surprised with how well it works.</li>
            <li> The marks aren&#x27;t completely gone, but the product did deliver in its promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In there defense my stretch marks are about two years old</li>
            <li> I would use it just for the soft skin.</li>
            <li> I was worried that since they were old stretch marks that I wasn&#x27;t going to see any results.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my chest and stomach for 4 days so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month now daily and have notice that my stretch marks are getting much lighter and some have even gone away.</li>
            <li> Im 20 years old and weigh 145</li>
            <li> But so far I like what I see</li>
            <li> they want to go away naturally.</li>
            <li> I had leftover stretch marks from losing alot of weight and this has helped considerably.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably because I haven&#x27;t used it correctly (as the bottle lasted only two weeks), but the product hasn&#x27;t worked very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> As far as buying another bottle I dont think I will buying any</li>
            <li> It is working so far</li>
            <li> Within the last month, I have really noticed a visible difference - the scaring lightened in pigmentation from a blackish/maroonish color.  </li>
            <li> The post delivery stretch marks leave a scar in the minds of beauty conscious women.</li>
            <li> I have been trying it too and it leaves my skin soft moisturizer hydrated.</li>
            <li> I know stretch marks won&#x27;t completely disappear, but it is making a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are completely gone in a month...</li>
            <li> I had surgery five years old</li>
            <li> I brought it for my wife after she had developed some stretch marks and some darkar patches of skin around her tummy.</li>
            <li> I tried several stretch mark creams, but this one so far absorbed into my skin the fastest and left my skin moist.</li>
            <li> and im a 16 year old</li>
            <li> this stuff made them go away just about completely within thew two months or earlier!&lt;br /&gt;be</li>
            <li> My mom got me dermarestore and even though it took about 7 months of use, its completely gone now.</li>
            <li> and I had 25 year old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I had scar near a tattoo that I was using the cream on.  </li>
            <li> I have bern using it on two surgical scars that are over 35 years old.  </li>
            <li> I imagine it&#x27;s different for different people with different skin completions but in any case it&#x27;s worth a shot for a reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li> but I think its to early to tell.</li>
            <li> my old ones</li>
            <li> Currently, I don&#x27;t see any differencs, but that&#x27;s reasonable since I just started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my nine year old stretch marks are halfway gone already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them since my early teens</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had these since I was 14 years old or so.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels soft as a baby.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift because I lost a lot of weight really fast and was left with stretch marks around my armpits and stomach.</li>
            <li> i am 16 years old</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are 7 yrs old.....</li>
            <li> and it really does have the potential to do what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I got really busy with summer stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get get rid of strechs, so far no changes, but for marks and scars</li>
            <li> This product has improved my old stretch marks a lot.  </li>
            <li> I am liking it thus far....</li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of problems with such products as my skin is very oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 children (3 yrs old and 5 months old) and used everything under the sun..</li>
            <li> the only thing that really hides them is getting my skin tanned, because</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can use this without breaking out.</li>
            <li> The only thing that really works for me is Mederma</li>
            <li> also used this on my 7 year old son who had appendicitis and has a  1 1/2 inch scar on his stomach.</li>
            <li> no help for the stretch mark as far as I can see....</li>
            <li> I am glad at least didn’t cause any rash or any skin abnormalities.</li>
            <li> My wife has a scar that made her self conscious</li>
            <li> /&gt;DermaRestore couldn&#x27;t be any easier to use and it is working wonderfully so far.  </li>
            <li> I am still using it on old scares.</li>
            <li> so they might be too old for this product to have any affect on them.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for about 30 days so far and already noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> This product actually showed results fast.</li>
            <li> and i would say that anyone who wants to get rid of stretch marks should definitely use this product.</li>
            <li> Nearly a month and no evidence of change</li>
            <li> but so far after months of using it I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t erase my stretch marks completely.</li>
            <li> I will still be using it on my stretch marks to see if they will disappear completely.</li>
            <li> My marks aren&#x27;t completely gone</li>
            <li> I have been so embarrassed by my stretch marks that they negatively impacted my life in too many ways to mention.  </li>
            <li> and so far it seems it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> I just started using this lotion initially bought it for stretch marks I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference on them</li>
            <li> My stretchmarks are 20 years old.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to feel self conscious about myself doing them.</li>
            <li> and so far the discoloration from the strech marks are completly gone .</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> However, I saw results within the first week and now after several weeks of using it they are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> but if something is good ill pay anything.</li>
            <li> Immediately after giving birth and returning home, I noticed that I had no new stretch marks and the ones from my first pregnancy were completely unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hypertrophic scar on my upper back, but I think is good for stretch-marks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DermaRESTORE for a little under four weeks now, and the results have been significant.</li>
            <li> now after a little over 6 months my strech marks have pretty much vanished</li>
            <li> Now they are turning much lighter, smoother, and less defined after only a few uses of applying this cream , and to be honest, I often forgot and didn&#x27;t apply it twice a day, every day.</li>
            <li> but now almost a year later and not even using the product daily the deep red marks I had are completely fading and only getting better.</li>
            <li> The cream does not have an unpleasant odor which helps enjoy the process that much better.</li>
            <li> Instead of looking red, they become white and has a less visible and more scarrish appearance.  </li>
            <li> I saw no difference at all using an entire bottle and following the directions exactly of applying it twice a day.</li>
            <li> my stretch marks after my 2nd baby were dark and now after 1 week they are so light and</li>
            <li> I use it twice daily as instructed, and apparently the color of the stretch marks is much lighter and skin gets smoother.</li>
            <li> I am not sure yet, but most likely I do not see any effect.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak for light scar tissue at this point, but effects are DEFINITELY noticeable for dark scar tissue.  </li>
            <li> Have tried many different scar creams in the past and</li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because a friend of mine used it in the past with amazing results, and after the first few weeks, I can say that it is the same!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and I am actually looking forward to wearing my two piece swimsuit again.</li>
            <li> Stretch marks have been a big problem for me since I was in high school.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who has pregnancy marks or just regular marks.</li>
            <li> To be clear, I am using them on the new stretch marks only.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped with stretchmarks and a little with scarring.. looking forward to my next bottle :)</li>
            <li> i read the negative comments and even then i still ordered because i was so desperate to find something that would just work and it had so many good reviews too that i bought into that.</li>
            <li> You normally will spend around $100 on a stretch mark cream that probably won&#x27;t work, but this one is only around $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> color of her skin is back to normal now and the stretch marks are also showing signs of disapperance.</li>
            <li> Yet after a few days, the lotion became a darker color, more like a yellowish white (which is not atypical for lotions).</li>
            <li> I have tried it for a little over a week now and already starting to see results, also makes make skin feel smooth with no odor</li>
            <li> I am definitely gifting this to my other pregnant friends during their baby showers.</li>
            <li> I have been going to the gym religiously for about 25 years and due to some quick growth I have sustained some stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I got new stretch marks in my inner thighs, that&#x27;s why I got this product.</li>
            <li> stretch marks covered my entire belly and were scattered on my hips and upper thighs as well, and because I am very fair-skinned</li>
            <li> feel like stretch marks are is dependent on diet, genetics, hydration, and how much weight you can gain gradually, I gained excessively, 60lb with the first two and will probably be close to that with this one too.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my scars pretty much vanish from my arms and legs from small injuries.</li>
            <li> The product does not leave my skin feeling soft or smooth, but it&#x27;s not greasy or thick either.</li>
            <li> The deep, purple deep stretch marks are becoming lighter, the little ones are fading before my eyes.</li>
            <li> It actually leaves me feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> She has tried treating them with other products but none had consistent results.</li>
            <li> So ive been using this product for about 6 months on my stretch marks around my breast and hips and after 2 months I SAW A MAJOR DIFFERENCE and</li>
            <li> Due to my post-pregnancy stretch marks on my belly and breast, I felt really self conscious</li>
            <li> product contains Aloe Vera Gel, Stearate, Green Bean, Algae Extract, Emu Oil and many other ingredients that contains healing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews complain about the smell, and although it definitely isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; smell, it&#x27;s not bad enough to dissuade me from continuing to use the product.</li>
            <li> We both saw less and less of the stretch marks and from that experience, I can say that I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other creams with no results in 3x the amount of time so that is definitely a positive.</li>
            <li> At this price, the striae will be generally gone within a thirty days.</li>
            <li> But I feel a general sense of a change.</li>
            <li> I can say with absolute and complete honesty that DermaRESTORE worked miracles in decreasing the appearance of dark spots on my legs.  </li>
            <li> my skin clear again i definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> After trying several expensive brands from skin care stores and vendors from the mall, I experienced minimal results.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets about purchasing.</li>
            <li> It’s barely a month now after the DermaRestore treatment was introduced to me by a friend.</li>
            <li> These spots are so soft at the moment, that you couldn’t possibly tell that once there were stretch marks there.</li>
            <li> It would probably work on newer stretch marks but not on my old, white ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has reduced my deep, 15 year old stretch marks</li>
            <li> Now it is barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;First of all, my stretch marks are very deep, visible and I am completely ashamed of them.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are fading and are no where near as red as before!</li>
            <li> This product has a chemical scent but the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, i have old white stretchmarks, so far no big results</li>
            <li> Just the first couple weeks ive noticed a change, my scars are not completely gone but it definitely made a big difference</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement in my stretch marks and this is the only product that have worked so far.</li>
            <li> I had 2 babies in the same calendar year, so my stomach looked like I had been attacked by a wild animal.</li>
            <li> i have old sretchmarks that are white</li>
            <li> she used these and they helped a lot you can barely notice them now.</li>
            <li> Reducing old stretchmarks from multiple pregnancies.</li>
            <li> When I wear my  bathing suit in the summer time, it&#x27;s so apparent and humiliating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, after 7 months of use, they are still there but barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although your stretch marks won&#x27;t disappear completely, you will actually see them getting lighter within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for over a month now and some of my stretch marks are completely faded.</li>
            <li> Now, after 7 months of use, they are still there but barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> DermaRESTORE has actually faded the stretchmarks that were not fading and made my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I can not believe that after having 9 kids, I barely have any stretch marks at all.</li>
            <li> If it worked at all, it was BARELY, and that was after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old male and have been applying this twice a day</li>
            <li> I bought my 1st bottle last month and used it for nearly 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Only thing it does it makes skin soft.</li>
            <li> Now a week later they are almost completely faded.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s apparent that I can&#x27;t fully get rid of them.</li>
            <li> and although my stretch marks are still apparent I saw lightening in the color of the marks, and a decrease in size of the marks.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had improvement on some of the smaller ones so far..</li>
            <li> My body is slowly starting to look back to normal.</li>
            <li> Bathing suits are not  a welcome thought in my mind when I see my labor of love marks.  </li>
            <li> I got a little scar across my right leg from an accident in wood working.</li>
            <li> They really need to change this into a tube.&lt;br /&gt;-The smell - it&#x27;s not an bad scent, but it&#x27;s pretty strong.  </li>
            <li> After my pregnancy i had a few stretchmarks that are disappearing right before my eyes.</li>
            <li> its just a waste of your money guess I&#x27;ll continue searching until I find the right product for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s without noticing, the previous ones for the first would widen or elongate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> DermaRESTORE is a pale yellow cream that absorbs quickly into skin after application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable in comparison to other creams, does not have an obtrusive smell and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> other reviewer says this really works.</li>
            <li> This cream has really helped with the biceps and chest area that have been damaged due to years of lifting and growing frame.</li>
            <li> Other ones ive tried show results really fast than stretch marks are visible again without use, or just dont work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other creams with much disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He is excited to see the marks around his belly disappear as he loses weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 26 years old guy and purchased this product in order to treat stretch marks on various parts of my body, such as the middle-back, waists etc.</li>
            <li> it hasnt gotten rid of my old ones that are white and very deep</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for only a month on old stretch mark and scars from surgery that happen with my last pregnancy August 2012.</li>
            <li> They have gradually vanished and I was so afraid that they were going to last for good.</li>
            <li> After struggling with my weight for years, I was finally able to get rid of the pounds but was left behind with the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Everything would work a little bit at first</li>
            <li> My bottle didnt come with any information so a little research might help ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got excited and recommended this treatment to my friend&#x27;s and family that are bothered by their mean stretch marks as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have major stretch marks on my upper arms and now that I have lost weight they have not dissapeared.</li>
            <li> That little container goes fast!</li>
            <li> Not only did this help reduce the appearance of any stretch marks drastically, but it also made my skin feel healthier in general.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not a long term treatment, I still decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it for a long time but so far it&#x27;s acceptable</li>
            <li> After our first child she tried out a few and they did not work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need to apply a small amount to your scars (I had to use quite a bit to even slightly cover mine because I had so many, so this lasted me about a month).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a year on newly stretchmarks and now they&#x27;re still there and harder to take out.</li>
            <li> I am 29yrs old, have tan &amp; dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very sceptical first few days, but later I realised my stretch marks became lighten and less visible.</li>
            <li> She normally uses the product after each bath and never combines it with any other product.  </li>
            <li> and they are very noticable because i am mix of white and black.</li>
            <li> When I bought this one I expected it to be the same old rubbish product that says it fixes stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Now they&#x27;re light ish pink to my skin time and hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, I have ordered 3 already and am going to keep on purchasing them, as I wouldn&#x27;t purchase any other brand or product!</li>
            <li> Hard to tell right now,</li>
            <li> , thats when i knew that indeed all the negative com mentors before me were right.</li>
            <li> The little bottle feels a little full</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are looking a lot less red and new</li>
            <li> pump bottle pumps out really small amounts at a time, if you&#x27;re covering a large area like I did, it required multiple pumps.  </li>
            <li> I was astounded due to the fact that I gained nearly 50 pounds and my angel was almost 9 pounds.</li>
            <li> I feel like my old stretch marks are not very visible now!</li>
            <li> We went to professional dermatologists and their treatment was extremely out of our budget</li>
            <li> There is no way for me to tell whether this worked or not because you are given such a small bottle that you can&#x27;t really use it enough to tell.</li>
            <li> As for this product, I feel it&#x27;s too over-priced, and you don&#x27;t get enough to use the product long enough over a larger area.</li>
            <li> I bought this, with not such high hopes of it working.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS had stretch marks since I can remember, especially on my hips and breasts, so I know that it&#x27;s really hard to find something that works exactly like it says it does and lives up to all the hype.</li>
            <li> just to soon to tell but for meeting my needs jst about half way I give it 3 strs..if I notice a difference in my stretch marks soon I will post a new review....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 4 weeks so far, and I&#x27;m starting to see slight fading on the recent scars that I got from scratches that didn&#x27;t bleed on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed small improvements on certain areas.</li>
            <li> They seem to be fading, but I am not sure if they really are or if I am just making it up in my head.</li>
            <li> I notice the appearance of my thigh stretch marks has faded, but I&#x27;m not sure if I see much of a difference yet with my stomach.</li>
            <li> But because of this scar and skin complex I am ready to let the snow melt and take on summer!</li>
            <li> None of the products that I used in the past, helped nearly as much as this one.</li>
            <li> Really havent seen any improvement, its just a ordinary lotion for me.</li>
            <li> I usually wait about 3 months for a real noticeable change, and this product has given me a hopeful outlook.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see results but I am optimistic!</li>
            <li> It seems thick, has a funny smell</li>
            <li> the stretch mark texture itself is pretty deep after using this product for about 4 weeks a month basically, I have noticed them getting a little lighter and less visable</li>
            <li> I suppose it was naive of me to assume that my scars would just &amp;#34;go away&amp;#34; immediately, but now I know it takes a little bit of time to work, as I&#x27;m sure would be the case with any other cream.</li>
            <li> All the scars are becoming dull for the past one week of using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But they are newly formed stretch marks and could have also just formed unevenly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally been using this product for one week now, maybe a couple days less, and am already surprised at the results.</li>
            <li> The old ones were already flesh colored so less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I went through a bottle and a half and got nothing but soft skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and my stretch marks have changed from purple to pink and are starting to fade!</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are not little &amp; are all over my stomach but have slightly faded.</li>
            <li> , I started to use it right away, after only one week of using this product I saw dramatic results, 11 days later, February 5th 2015 after using DermaRESTORE</li>
            <li> It isnt sticky and icky feeling like other creams I have tried, it absorbs into my skin really well!!</li>
            <li> They are not completely gone yet, but just about in almost no time flat.</li>
            <li> Not only have my stretch marks become A LOT less apparent</li>
            <li> I had an 11 pound baby and was covered in stretch marks due to being very very small before I became pregnant.</li>
            <li> This product combined with a daily regimen of dry skin brushing has drastically faded and reduced my stretch marks!</li>
            <li> You can actually feel a tingling sensation after applying this which makes me feel like it&#x27;s actually doing something, unlike other stretch mark products.</li>
            <li> I have two sets of white stretch marks, one I had for fifteen years and the other one just in the last five years.</li>
            <li> Excited to rock the beaches this summer in my little bikini, no more hiding my thighs!</li>
            <li> very strong unpleasant scent---</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> After having more than one child, I have plenty of stretch marks left behind on my belly and a few other places like my sides where it stretched on my basket ball belly with each child.</li>
            <li> I continued using this cream daily for a few months and it took my major stretch mark away.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any weird smell and the product is smooth like lotion.  </li>
            <li> Ps I&#x27;m African American dark skin</li>
            <li> but I am dark skin African American and was using it to get rid of the stretch marks I gotten from pregnancy</li>
            <li> She tends to not use past products I purchased on a regular basis, probably why they didn&#x27;t work, now that she is mature</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark brown African American, so this could be why it didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I will continue use of this product and look forward to seeing the long term results.</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks all over, so I have a LONG way to go</li>
            <li> I have minor scars and stretch marks, they did fade them out quite a bit.</li>
            <li> They are not as deep or as wide.</li>
            <li> so they are white and harder to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling since long time to get rid of these marks.</li>
            <li> , i already notice the strech marks has changed from red to pink.</li>
            <li> We can see that there has been a noticeable difference in her stretch marks and would expect them to be completely unnoticable in a few months time.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s working when you see your stretch marks turning from white to pink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for a long time and now that I have found it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to what it&#x27;s going to look like as my belly shrinks back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to what it&#x27;s going to look like as my belly shrinks back.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, I have noticed a marked improvement.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first but around the third week I saw very noticeable fading in my stretch</li>
            <li> LONG WAY TO GO ...</li>
            <li> Hopefully soon it will be red, pink and then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be a customer for a LONG time since they are on my arms, legs, abdomen, etc</li>
            <li> My wife already used one bottle for minor stretch mark blemishes and it worked for her</li>

            <li> I have a lot of stretch marks due to fast muscle growth in the past.</li>
            <li> I had a mole removed from my back that left a little scar.  </li>
            <li> but ive had these pesky stretch marks on my hips since as long as i can remember!</li>
            <li> I noticed that all the 5 star ones followed the same format and if you clicked on other reviews the &amp;#34;user&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I tried numerous other things to get rid of the scar,including Bio Oil and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other similar creams at nordstroms that go for approx.</li>
            <li> After using several other products for my stretch marks nothing seemed to work ..</li>
            <li> you really can&#x27;t go wrong ! :)</li>
            <li> I recently gained a substantial amount of weight due to a thyroid condition.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using dry brush technique as well as Microneedling every 7 days...</li>
            <li> My scar is a naval piercing that stretched out about 1.5 in long by 1/4 in wide after pregnancy.</li>
            <li> it left a long dark incision on my stomach.</li>
            <li> I only got a few, but they were  noticeably red.</li>
            <li> Ask me  in few more weeks or Ill</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical considering the low price but a success.</li>
            <li> scars that are really dark from deep/penetrating injuries of the past - not dug quite so much.</li>
            <li> I purposely always chose swim suits that covered a good part of my thighs, because I absolutely hated the stretch marks on my inner thighs.</li>
            <li> I have had a whole mess of stretch marks on my stomach, and within a few weeks of using this my skin is already looking lighter and easy on my eyes and everyone else&#x27;s, now I don&#x27;t have to be so afraid to take my shirt off at the beach.</li>
            <li> I used this morning and night for a single day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every single day, twice a day for over two months now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got really deep and dark stretchmark</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> and I ended up with these gross, dark, risen stretch marks.</li>
            <li> stitches.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punchline:  After about a week of using this once a day at night (and when I remember in the morning), I can tell already this scar has gone from dark brown looking to now a lighter and smaller redish brown mark.  </li>
            <li> I had several stretch marks on my belly a few on my side, I also applied it to a few old burn marks and childhood growth marks.</li>
            <li> They got worse over the years and using this overtime really helped my skin with old stretch marks AND scars less visible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only one week into my use with this product and the redness is going down.</li>
            <li> I foolishly ordered this based on the reviews, but didn&#x27;t take the time to actually sit down and closely read them.</li>
            <li> I’m already down with my second bottle of this product.</li>
            <li> A co-worker recommended this and even showed me a before and after of it on her arms, and I was amazed and hopeful, I was definitely not let down.</li>
            <li> Stretch marks on my entire stomach and down both legs..</li>
            <li> I researched everything I possibly could and this is the only product that has helped even a little bit!</li>
            <li> i highly do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> waist stretch marks are less obvious.  </li>
            <li> ill give this cream 4 stars only because I have not finish my first bottle</li>
            <li> and im starting to see a slight difference in my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I am away with some odd stretch marks I had on my back.</li>
            <li> I have had an unsightly scar from an iron burn on my left forearm for the past several years, which for some reason bothers me to no end.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to try to get rid of them and finally i found a product that makes them less visible.</li>
            <li> It works faster than Miderma and I only had it for a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I put the cream on religiously and after a month I can say they are significantly less noticeable.</li>
            <li> You have to be consistent and follow the directions properly instead of being whimsical with it.</li>
            <li> Have some scars from surgery and this seems to be making them less noticeable over the last month.</li>
            <li> I personally think the smell is a little dry / medicated.</li>
            <li> While this was a super awkward gift, I can&#x27;t thank my coworker enough for turning me onto this.</li>
            <li> after having my first child i had ugly stretch marks and wouldnt dare show my stomach again but after using this product for only a few weeks now my stretch  marks are really clearing</li>
            <li> I have used many other products including some very expensive products</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a little over a month</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different but not repulsive.  </li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first but after just 4 weeks I can see results!</li>
            <li> Earlier i as little susceptible about  its results..</li>
            <li> noticed that after using this cream my recent stretch marks were fading a little bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use as advised as always and apply a little daily.</li>
            <li> The smell isnt that bad either, i wish it was alittle better but</li>
            <li> Maybe I should never have spent my life covering up and hiding my stretch marks, but I did.  </li>
            <li> Granted i have only used it a few times now</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I definitely see results!</li>
            <li> I received this a few months back.</li>
            <li> After only a few days, my stretch marks went bye bye.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few weeks and the only difference in my stretch marks are that they are darker not lighter.</li>
            <li> I will come back in a few months to update with a before and after pics with my stretch marks and hopefully raise my 4 star review to a 5.</li>
            <li> and I have seen minimal to no results.</li>
            <li> When I did (after I had already spent my money of course)</li>
            <li> and now they are a softer pink.</li>
            <li> After our second child, she had some few stretch marks that were noticeable, I decided to look around for a product that would aid her.</li>
            <li> After only using it for a few days it has helped me alot with my stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> I applied twice daily for a few weeks and there was no change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> so hopefully when I&#x27;m done with it, the pink stretch marks I have will be gone too.</li>
            <li> I gave up after using it for 2 months and seeing not much improvement.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for a few months now when she bought it back in July.</li>
            <li> The stretch marks went away on my arms and legs but there are pink lines</li>
            <li> I still have some pink marks, but not purple.</li>
            <li> My brother had some stretch marks on my leg that have been a problem for a few years when he was younger</li>
            <li> After a few months of using this product the scar was substantially smaller!</li>
            <li> They were closed</li>
            <li> When I got DermaRestore they left within a few day</li>
            <li> In order to see any results on the skin I expected something to exfoliate or anything that can dissolve the damaged skin and stimulate re-growing the one.</li>
            <li> It has proven to fade a bit of some of my stretch marks, but not much.</li>
            <li> I have wide hips so even though I am a size 4 I still have stretch marks on my hips and</li>
            <li> She followed the directions to the letter and starting seeing results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It was such a waste of money .</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent $200 in creams to help rid me of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s making my stretch marks a lot lighter and slowly disappear</li>
            <li> After using the product for 4 weeks I can see a lightening in color, but it&#x27;s still as long and wide as it was previously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable but after just 4 days using dermatestore, I saw old stretch marks, that already were tuning black, start to fade.</li>
            <li> My marks came from gaining weight too quickly since I was too lazy and tired from all the school work I got from college.</li>
            <li> After my rapid weight gain and the dramatic weight loss from my childhood to early adulthood, I was left with stretch mark on the side of my abdominal area.</li>
            <li> Due to my pregnancy I put on a lot of weight and visible stretch marks are something you have to cope with after a pregnancy, not to mention the embarrassment and mental agony</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different lotions and potions, Mederma, lots of body butters, and Palmer&#x27;s creams, but with little to no success.</li>
            <li> when i first received the package, the package looked a little dusty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few weeks and all i can say is wow,</li>
            <li> Seriously I am 29 years old</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed is it takes a long time to see results (at least for me)</li>
            <li> Hasnt been long enough to see results but I can see my scars slowly fading</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The advertising was of a high quality, yet, the results were poor.</li>
            <li> I had really super bad stretch marks on my belly after my second child</li>
            <li> Healed just fine, but left a nasty dark mark on my shin - since I did not receive immediate medical attention, this resulted in a deep scab.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a slight lightening of my scars after only a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any other smell sensitivities</li>
            <li> Bought this due to an injury I have had a couple months ago.</li>
            <li> My brother recommended me this product for my stretch marks, due from giving birth twice.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about 2 months now and have only seen a small improvement, but my skin has always been stubborn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It should also be mentioned that I&#x27;ve used the product along with a &amp;#34;needles roller&amp;#34; (not sure how it&#x27;s called in English...)</li>
            <li> I just apply a small amount to my stomach area (stretch marks) every day and in a short while you can see the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other products and didn&#x27;t get anything out of it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy like other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> DermaRESTORE before using any other product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> so I looked at other options.</li>
            <li> I will continue using the cream as it&#x27;s the only treatment that has ever made any difference for me and, though the small bottle is $28, I can afford it.</li>
            <li> A lot of it also comes in this, so you will only need one every few months!</li>
            <li> After I had had my first child I was unable to find a produce that reduced the appearance of stretchmarks that was before dermrestore came along.</li>
            <li> So either all the other reviews are BS</li>
            <li> I have used home remedies to other brand stretch mark creams and nothing seem to even lighten the marks.</li>
            <li> A lot of the other creams, ointments and sprays just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I would def recommend this to other shoppers and I would buy it again for myself.</li>
            <li> I never really rate items, but I just had to make an exception!</li>
            <li> Bottle is small, but you don&#x27;t need a lot for coverage, after about 10 uses, I still have what feels like 3/4 of the bottle left.  </li>
            <li> not as miraculous as other reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products like Trilastin</li>
            <li> I give this product 5stars due to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Perhaps you have even tried other products out there on the market without results.</li>
            <li> We had tried other products but none of them seemed to work on her.  </li>
            <li> So either all the other reviews are BS</li>
            <li> I was not sure how it was going to work after trying numerous other products and treatments</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure any of these products deserve to be called such things.</li>
            <li> and I am disappointed because the high ratings were promising.</li>
            <li> I see slight improvement but not very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Obviously your stretch marks are not going to 100% disappear, but this definitely got rid or decreased the appearance of about 90% of mine.</li>
            <li> Two pregnancies, stretch marks getting worse each time, and four different products later, I found this and figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My entire tummy looked so messy after I gained a few pounds and it has been a pleasure with this product as all my marks are now gone.</li>
            <li> . . . . . however I was disappointed in not receiving a leaflet or information page with the product, and, in addition to that, a large white \\&quot;coding sticker\\&quot; was glued on to the back of the tube</li>
            <li> I have developed really bad stretch marks from m pregnancy and my whole belly has turned dark.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after having no success with any other stretch mark removers.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about these products that claim to get rid of scars and stretch marks, but after using this for less than a month, I&#x27;m seeing a difference in the scars on my legs.</li>
            <li> I like that it is not super sticky like some of the other creams or ointments I have tried.</li>
            <li> So if it works for mine that i have had for at least 8 years then it will definitely work for you !</li>
            <li> so its not fun hiding myself in the summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my dark stretch marks</li>
            <li> Mine weren&#x27;t dark but a 30.</li>
            <li> One bottle for a couple small marks will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now wear shorts and dresses with confidence instead of fretting about stares from people because of the dark marks on my legs.  </li>
            <li> and I have dark stretch marks around my waist and hips area</li>
            <li> Definitely makes the redness go away, slowly seeing it work.</li>
            <li> It feels good going on, there is no tingling like those wraps that I&#x27;ve tried and there also isn&#x27;t a terrible smell or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Its been slowly diminishing them enough</li>
            <li> After less than a months use, the ones above my belly button are so faint you can barely see them.</li>
            <li> This product cost less than those expensive stretch mark and scarring products but since I have been using it, I can see that it  really does work.  </li>
            <li> This will not let you down.</li>
            <li> Some stretch marks even shrunken down a notch.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It calms down my bulging stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update in a other 6 weeks!</li>
            <li> baby, my skin was very tight and smooth, which made me very vulnerable to rapid belly growth during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> When you get it, take a before picture &amp; write the date down for proof because in less than 4wks ( 3 for me)</li>
            <li> It worked on my belly, my stretch marks are less noticable</li>
            <li> I did see results, but they were slightly insignificant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DermaRESTORE on a daily basis for the last months, and yet, I&#x27;m unable to notice any improvement.</li>
            <li> but i see some slight skin peeling.</li>
            <li> I had such horrible stretch marks, went through having 2 more babies in 2 years.</li>
            <li> i have previously done laser treatments for my stretch marks, and i bought this cream for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month and a half day and night</li>
            <li> To my surprise in less than three months I am seeing results.  </li>
            <li> If i saw a slight difference after using for a month, i would have kept trying.  </li>
            <li> Since I have been using DermaRestore my Stretch marks are less visible and noticeable.</li>
            <li> the stretch-marks are less noticeable)</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 months , less that directed, and the marks have faded a lot.</li>
            <li> and I do see a slight difference in coloring and size.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about trying this out after so many wrong turns and allergies</li>
            <li> This I believe is working, but it&#x27;s not quick.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to seeing less and less - stretch marks.</li>
            <li> After my babies I had slight marks below my navel that I just wanted gone.</li>
            <li> , stretch marks began to fade and became less noticeable.</li>
            <li> After month and a half I do not see any improvement and do not see how would happen either.</li>
            <li> almost half of the stretch marks on my arms are gone.</li>
            <li> It has a slight nail polish remover smell to it</li>
            <li> I have them all around my belly button from my pregnancy and this product has made them lighter and less &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It makes my scars look less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks have become noticeably less visible.</li>
            <li> I have stretch mark from rapid growth I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4weeks there is slight change</li>
            <li> but I understand that you have to have patience to see the results from previous weight gain</li>
            <li> After receiving trying multiple products with absolutely no luck whatsoever for the terrible stretch marks I had after my first pregnancy, I began to use DermaRestore during my second pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I also give it a little massage and let it absorb before I lay down or put clothes on.</li>
            <li> I saw results within two weeks of using this and it&#x27;s far less expensive than other creams I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it would work on wide marks from pregnancy, but it is helping for our circumstance.  </li>
            <li> I went through a period a few months back where I gained a lot of weight really fast and as a result I received some ugly stretch marks.</li>
            <li> After a few, expensive so called solutions, I was left with my low self esteem and an even lower bank balance.</li>
            <li> Pregnancy and becoming a mother can be expecting but the stretch marks after pregnancy are annoying.</li>
            <li> it faded them a little bit but did not get rid of them</li>
            <li> It is not much better than other stretch mark creams that I have tried, but it has caused fading.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see drastic results lightens a little bit</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 weeks now and have noticed a difference but not a significant one.  </li>
            <li> , it took a little while</li>
            <li> The smell is a little &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; smelling, but you get use to it</li>
            <li> I have been using dermarestore for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I had to make myself a little schedule</li>
            <li> I decided to give this treatment a go, but I was a little worried I could not find a list of ingredients before I purchased.</li>
            <li> and I have seen my stretchmark&#x27;s get a little lighter</li>
            <li> It has been a little longer than a month and the redness has lessened.  </li>
            <li> So I was a little iffy trying anything to minimize them.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little over two weeks now</li>
            <li> This product does work, you just have to stick to using it and little by little it does work.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the scar I got from a little bike accident.</li>
            <li> I think they look a little fainter but my marks are since childhood</li>
            <li> You need to rub into the skin in circular motions and takes a little while to absorb.</li>
            <li> There is a little notice of the marks getting lighter.</li>
            <li> Little dab does the trick.</li>
            <li> In the past i tried a few creams and other things but had no results until this one.</li>
            <li> And the smell is not very appealing.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first as I have tried other stretch mark creams in the past...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m imagining the subtle changes or if it actually does reduce the coloration of the marks.</li>
            <li> I promise it won&#x27;t let you down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to throw out the other stretch mark cream as I have an use this!!</li>
            <li> From now on I am starting with 1star reviews to see what people actually are unhappy about when they they post.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to the beach a few times...and not with a tee shirt over my bathing suit.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks has faded my stretch marks</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use I have noticed a difference on the areas that I have been applying it too.  </li>
            <li> I also use it for my 2 laser tattoo removals and few acne scars on my face to help heal and reduce the scar appearance.</li>
            <li> I used this once a day for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This product completely faded the unfortunate stretch marks I obtained after giving birth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DermaRestore for a few weeks and already I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin tone</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few weeks ago and it has worked winders on my scars and stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> and i plan to buy a few for some of my friends.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using it I noticed that my stretch marks were fading.</li>
            <li> Of course I have a few stretch marks from having a baby, and well let&#x27;s face</li>

            <li> Just started this a few days.</li>
            <li> I have a few stretch marks on my tummy - both sides - below my navel after I gave birth.</li>
            <li> I keep using for another few weeks and the marks just kept getting lighter.</li>
            <li> what a waste.</li>
            <li> After just a few days, my stretch marks from pregnancy look like their fading.</li>
            <li> After a few applications of this product, my wife and I started to see results.</li>
            <li> Since we just had a baby it left some stretch marks behind.</li>
            <li> I saw a couple stretch marks on my body I used this everyday twice a day for a month</li>
            <li> Hopefully, in a few weeks time I won&#x27;t ever have to see my stretch marks again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I rub it on everyday, three or four times a day.</li>
            <li> After a few months of sticking with dermarestore I can say that I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day and after a few days i could see a lightening of the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen results from using this in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month, everyday after my shower.</li>
            <li> Then you are missing out.</li>
            <li> and I recently started to grow extremely tired of seeing my body like this.</li>
            <li> I went a few days overdue.&lt;br /&gt;Pregnancy</li>
            <li> So I broke out with a few stretch makes on my belly button.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I used this for a few months and did not notice any drastic changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks for my daughter to see results on her stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I showed the before and after pictures to a few friends and no one could distinguish the before and after pictures from one another.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Walmart a few months ago and it works just like the reviews state.</li>
            <li> He noticed a difference after a few weeks of using DermaRESTORE</li>
            <li> I noticed changes in my stretch marks after a few days, and after a month, I can say that this product cleared about sixty-five percent of my skin.</li>
            <li> Few things...</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> but I do see a few of my stretch marks disappearing and a couple of scars are blending</li>
            <li> I was initally very skeptical and about 2-3 weeks down the road, we really started seeing changes.</li>
            <li> The smell of this stretch mark cream compared to others is not strong or offensive which is a huge plus (and I hate cologne or fragrant deodorant).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for 4 months now and not even a slight difference!</li>
            <li> but I am really pale</li>
            <li> im pale</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such a dramatic change in my stretch marks .___.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stretch mark disappeared very quickly, never had an issue.</li>
            <li> This stinks to high heaven.</li>
            <li> Not many products do well for my skin, but this one is not letting me down!</li>
            <li> I had some pretty bad stretch marks from so rapid weight gain</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m seeing improvements yet and its been a few weeks already.</li>
            <li> Thin lotion, but goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it was really scarring badly after a few weeks</li>
            <li> I had some really bad stretch marks on my back prior to applying this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting to at least make my stretch marks less visible.</li>
            <li> so I would think it would at least fade is slight, nope, nada.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed due to such high reviews.</li>
            <li> From buying used up to now more than 20 days did not see any results I am very disappointed ！</li>
            <li> After 2 big boys and 80 lbs gained I have the worse of the worse stretch marks from my belly down to my legs, yes my legs have stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I really restored the look of my skin to how It was before I got these ugly stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Lost over 65 lbs over the past 20 months and after diligent use of Dermarestore.</li>
            <li> I like a lot of the essential oils this contains &amp; the fact that it is made in the U.S.A., however, I was unable to obtain any information on whether this was tested on animals.</li>
            <li> the past year 2013</li>
            <li> the bottle is too small for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost some weight the past 2 months and was hoping to ateast</li>
            <li> I have faith that if I continue using this treatment then by the Summer of 2015 I will be able to wear a 2 piece and not be embarrassed or ashamed of my once nasty looking</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the angry red they used to be!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> It is no more than just another cream</li>
            <li> If you are concerning purchasing well think not more buy it.</li>
            <li> I rub in a small circular motion</li>
            <li> well I&#x27;m just  not sure.</li>
            <li> My belly feels like it&#x27;s going to pop open and uncomfortable</li>
            <li> I usually use this in combo with Bio oil, cocoa butter, or mama mio.</li>
            <li> There is not many words to describe how I feel after using this product for 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve also been using it for two small cut I had and</li>
            <li> I used this for the past 2 months</li>
            <li> It comes in a small bottle with a pump.</li>
            <li> I usually pump 3x and apply that amount to one area.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 4 weeks</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the only effect it did was make my skin softer.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I truly like it just</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very impatient person</li>
            <li> it kept getting worse and worse until i could only wear knee length dresses to hide them</li>
            <li> used DermaRestore  after I had my second kid; it does not smell bad and has relieved me  of the marks in less than 2 months.</li>
            <li> You can hardly see my stretch marks anymore.  </li>
            <li> , I can hardly believe it.</li>
            <li> I can hardly tell now that I had stretch marks.</li>
            <li> You can hardly see my stretch marks in some places.</li>
            <li> Really hard to get rid of, probably because I sit all day in class/work.</li>
            <li> so it is hard to tell if it will work on stretch marks or not</li>
            <li> She complains about her stretch marks at least once a week.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have any dramatic results yet, I do notice that the texture of my stretch marks looks smoother &amp; slightly lighter.</li>
            <li> but i was too late because i bought it before i read the reviews.</li>
            <li> She complained about it to me</li>
            <li> I use at least once a day,</li>
            <li> and i  know that adolescent stretch marks are common but</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to write a negative review</li>
            <li> I hated seeing them and,over the years, have tried many expensive so called solutions, with no results.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my chest &amp; on an icky scar on my hand.</li>
            <li> So I will try it for a least two months and then write another review.</li>
            <li> Slowly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m real and this stuff is crap.</li>
            <li> I then started to slowly stop using it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m slowly seeing results.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s slowly fading.</li>
            <li> Its working, slowly but its working...</li>
            <li> the STREch marks and the discoloration will slowly diminish.</li>
            <li> but you must remember that treating stretch marks is a slow process</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months and the progress has been slow</li>
            <li> Did not do anything, super disappointed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Doesnt mean iv given up hope on this product</li>
            <li> Recommend this to everyone especially other mothers!</li>
            <li> I started noticing them get lighter in just a few weeks!!</li>
            <li> This is fake just like every other product</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Also it is not as expensive as other products in the market place.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I can tell there is a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> they were a very angry red.</li>
            <li> I have been trying various stretch marks treatment cream which were very expensive and got zero</li>
            <li> Not one of the merchandise i always applied in the past, assisted virtually approximately this.</li>
            <li> I have tried upon several products to get rid of awful zebra like marks on my waist line, and I must say, this is it what every woman actually needs after her delivery...</li>
            <li> It is anticipated that anyone with “serious” stretch marks would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> And since I know how hard it is to be disappointed by yet another stretch mark product that doesn&#x27;t deliver, you should be reassured by the 100% money back satisfaction guarantee.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are very dark and difficult to go away.</li>
            <li> this year i got them really bad on my inner thigh</li>
            <li> Then I came across this product on Amazon in a last ditched attempt to find something non-invasive or surgical because I have keloid skin and scar really bad with any type of surgery.</li>
            <li> I never thought that such a low-priced cream would clear my scars when&lt;br /&gt;the costly cosmetic products failed miserably.</li>
            <li> I was really shocked, within a few weeks the once angry red stretch marks seemed to fade.</li>
            <li> As much as I hate to admit it, let&#x27;s face it - nearly every woman encounters stretch marks at some point in her life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely continue using this miracle cream as long as it takes to make these horrible marks</li>
            <li> but that was a major fail and just left my skin oily and smelled horrible.</li>
            <li> From palmer&#x27;s to bio-oil, everything just seemed to work but never really helped me to get rid of those disgusting purple red</li>
            <li> I gotten a pretty nasty scar that wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to see other people waste money if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> please listen to all the negative comments!</li>
            <li> After having my first child I had used a cream which smelled horrible and took 4 months to relieve me of the marks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My marks are slowly disappearing now!</li>
            <li> However, after my delivery I begin to notice the dreadful things appearing as my stomach began to shrink back down.</li>
            <li> It was frustrating to continuously apply the product for 2-3 weeks without seeing results, but I stuck with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about three months on a post-surgical scar behind my knee.  </li>
            <li> And my stretch marks just continued getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any difference in my marks.</li>
            <li> and they were a violent red.</li>
            <li> so i guess that could be why they kept getting worse.</li>
            <li> This product doesn’t make it worse in that case.</li>
            <li> BUT it has decreased SOME of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Helpful- decreased how visible marks look</li>
            <li> I couldnt wear half the things in my closet without my stretch marks showing!!!!</li>
            <li> It does not have a bad odor like some of the other skin creams out there.</li>
            <li> But after about 2 months, my stretch marks were seriously lighter!</li>
            <li> and ive seen a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> Friends who have seen this dramatic improvement on her are already buying the product.</li>
            <li> My husband had a bad scar under his chin from surgery, it was raised and firm.</li>
            <li> My wife has recently had a baby girl, but my wife had very bad stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It sucks!!</li>
            <li> No more those ugly marks for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> so skeptical about stuff like this</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work one bit for my scars.</li>
            <li> but I could be wrong.</li>
            <li> It also has a weird smell</li>
            <li> The smell is weird</li>
            <li> Not impressed at this point.</li>
            <li> Saw no difference unfortunately.</li>
            <li> sorry to say as I thought this was the miracle cream it says it is</li>
            <li> so they were a horrible red color</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to go though some expensive procedure</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that have tried everything and failed everytime in trying to remove your stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> A friend had told me about DermaRestore and after being skeptical..</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are unfortunately on my butt.  </li>
            <li> I gained 70 lbs during my pregnancy and am left with the terrible marks as proof.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews decided to give this a try and.......did not see any difference for me, has a weird smell to it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work and has a weird scent.</li>
            <li> After having my baby, I got lots of stretch marks on my belly, worse night mare ever!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to buy this</li>
            <li> should have gone for an acid treatment (vaguely remember my friend doing it years ago).</li>
            <li> it works and you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> incision scar if fading to a faint brownish tone</li>
            <li> Stretch marks after pregnancy are awful, I&#x27;ve been using this cream daily, after shower</li>
            <li> I got this product for my wife, becuase she was really insecure about her stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> wary, go ahead with DermaRESTORE.</li>
            <li> And the sudden weight loss now worst because of pregnancy.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about trying this one, but after reading some rave reviews I decided to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> After giving birth to 3 girls my body was in need of some serious help!!</li>
            <li> Insane home remedies like some strange cucumber paste, all the way up to medicated body wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very sad, almost obsessed with searching a solution, how to remove them.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement but this lotion stinks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not longer afraid of taking off my shirt in front of people.</li>
            <li> I  became desperate.</li>
            <li> Stretchmarks can be so depressing</li>
            <li> Unfortunately does nothing :(.</li>

            <li> When my wife had 2 children she had horrible stretch marks and trust me they were bad but that is nature.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks were really bad after having my son!</li>
            <li> bad idea on my part!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing to lose, except your ugly stretch marks!</li>
            <li> and I have yet to be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> But the small ones did fade!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I still had horrible stretch marks until I used DermaRESTORE.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible and it takes forever to rub in.</li>

            <li> if i could compare it to anything i would say it smelled like nasty hairspray, literally.</li>
            <li> However it depends on how bad your stretches are!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> its been over 2 months and i dont see a change.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and my stretch marks have changed from purple to pink and are starting to fade!</li>
            <li> Good stuff you should try it</li>
            <li> I just used it five times and it already made a big difference.  I know because I only used it on one side of the affected area so I could compare.</li>
            <li> I recently had 2 kids and I got stretch marks all over my stomach and sides. I tried everything. I tried bio oil and mederma for scars and exfoliating them. Everything would work a little bit at first but then just completely stop. I was ready to give up. I saw this product on here and figured I would give one last try. I am so glad that I did. You can hardly see my stretch marks anymore.  I could not be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> Derma Restore review: I tried the Derma Restore scar and stretch mark therapy cream. The first thing I noticed was the very pleasant smell.It has an almost flowery or perfume like smell.It quickly absorbs into my skin and goes on smooth and even. My skin was left dry, clean, and fresh feeling. No oily or greasy residue. I noticed a slight lightening of my scars after only a few days of use. That is very impressive! I am very pleased so far. I will continue use of this product and look forward to seeing the long term results.</li>
            <li> Works! This my third bottle! I see the different! I will buy again. please make a larger bottle!</li>
            <li> This really works! Im so skeptical about stuff like this but my stretch marks are clearing and its only been one month I put on twice a day and would reccomend this product for anyone with old stretch marks.. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the dermarestore cream for a month. I have noticed my stretch marks lightly fading. I still need to keep using it but I definitely notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I used this cream religiously morning and night. It doesn&#x27;t make them disappear, but it significantly reduces the appearance. Happily satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> You will not be upset! Give this one a go!</li>
            <li> great stretch mark reducer!</li>
            <li> Great product! Slowly but surely I noticed my stretch marks are going away.</li>
            <li> Very well i know many people think this doesnt work,WEll i have suffered with stretch marks for some time,However this product here was worth it!Made my skin clear again i definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Its the second one i buy&lt;br /&gt;Dosnt work</li>
            <li> I used this product, and within a couple weeks I started to notice the stretch marks were fading away! This works</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any changes after 3 months.. It&#x27;s just a calamine lotion based preparation</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 4 weeks now and I still have my stretch marks. They seem to be fading, but I am not sure if they really are or if I am just making it up in my head. Either way I am continuing to use the product because it does make them feel smoother.</li>
            <li> DermaRESTORE answers all the stretch marks especially to people who have experienced rapid skin stretch. It works very well with pregnant women</li>
            <li> I actually like this cream I haven&#x27;t tried many stretch mark creams, but this one works fine for me and you must be patient with this product also. I notice the appearance of my thigh stretch marks has faded, but I&#x27;m not sure if I see much of a difference yet with my stomach. I will continue using the cream since I feel like overtime I&#x27;m gone have the results I want.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Lost 25 lbs quicker than I was wanting to and bought this product to help with the stretch marks on my arms and stomach.  Worked better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month now and I got to say, it&#x27;s working. My stretch marks are fading away, I&#x27;m pretty sure a few more weeks and my marks will disappear. I would totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about these products that claim to get rid of scars and stretch marks, but after using this for less than a month, I&#x27;m seeing a difference in the scars on my legs. I will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> It smells really really bad and I can&#x27;t use it because the smell gives me headaches because it is so strong! I don&#x27;t have any other smell sensitivities so this was a surprise to me.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle now.  This stuff is amazing! I now wear sleeveless, albeit around the house, but even this is a huge improvement as I&#x27;ve spent my whole life in short sleeves.  I&#x27;ve been to the beach a few times...and not with a tee shirt over my bathing suit.  Life is changing and it&#x27;s a wonderful thing.  Maybe I should never have spent my life covering up and hiding my stretch marks, but I did.  The beginning of freedom, the feeling of sunshine and/&lt;br /&gt;or the night air on my shoulders is something very new to me and it is simply amazing.  I have stretch marks all over, so I have a LONG way to go but this is the only product that has produced results...amazing results... for me. I cannot recommend this highly enough.</li>
            <li> After gaining 6 sizes in a short period of time, I have a fair amount of stretch marks. This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that I can see it&#x27;s making a difference. I just opened my 3rd bottle yesterday, and am just happy that something work, no matter how slowly 😊</li>
            <li> Saw absolute no results, if anything I think it created more stretch marks</li>
            <li> The best cream that i use really works i see the results in a days, I thought that nothing works for stretch mark but this cream really do it..</li>
            <li> After a few weeks has faded my stretch marks</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon but thought I&#x27;d share my thoughts. I had a mole removed from my back that left a little scar.  I had become self conscious about it and wanted to try something to minimize the scar.  After 2 months I can already see results and already feel much better about my scar.  I&#x27;d highly recommend you try this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two weeks and it works very very well. It actually reduced my scars and I didn&#x27;t even know that the scars were that noticeable. Best thing is my fiancé noticed and said something to him. I&#x27;m going to throw out the other stretch mark cream as I have an use this!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE ON FRESH SCARS . I was operated on nov 11th leaving a 2inch scar, I started rubbing this product on my almost 3 week old scar...bad idea . My wound, after 2 uses , was starting to open. My surgeon wasnt very happy. Had to go back to receal it.&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt mean iv given up hope on this product , i still rub it on my stretch marks. Granted i have only used it a few times now so i cant comment on that just yet.&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to warn you about applying it on fresh scars. Maybe i missed out on warning signs . Make sure to read instructions and warning before applying . My bottle didnt come with any information so a little research might help ;)</li>
            <li> I searched thru many products and reviews here on Amazon and finally decided on DermaRESTORE.  I have 3 kids and several stretch marks! But I mainly ordered this to help with a huge dark scar on my back from a surgery I had about 5 years ago.  After a few weeks of use I have noticed a difference on the areas that I have been applying it too.  I will be placing my second order by next week!</li>
            <li> It was okay it faded them a little bit but did not get rid of them</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month now and my stretch marks have faded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 4 weeks so far, and I&#x27;m starting to see slight fading on the recent scars that I got from scratches that didn&#x27;t bleed on my forehead. It was frustrating to continuously apply the product for 2-3 weeks without seeing results, but I stuck with it and I finally am seeing them now. I suppose it was naive of me to assume that my scars would just &amp;#34;go away&amp;#34; immediately, but now I know it takes a little bit of time to work, as I&#x27;m sure would be the case with any other cream. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews complain about the smell, and although it definitely isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; smell, it&#x27;s not bad enough to dissuade me from continuing to use the product. They stand behind their product, and the customer service is good as well. I have no regrets about purchasing.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any changes since I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li> Still trying it out, See improvement but I am really pale so I think it&#x27;s gonna take longer</li>
            <li> LOVE. IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently lost a lot of weight, and although I am ecstatic about my weight loss, the stretchmarks that came as a consequence are not so flattering for the up coming beach season. After trying several expensive brands from skin care stores and vendors from the mall, I experienced minimal results. The advertising was of a high quality, yet, the results were poor. My friend recommended DermaRESTORE to me and I decided to try it out, and it WORKED. SOMETHING. FINALLY. WORKED.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately does nothing :(. I probably should have known better but... I always hold out hope!</li>
            <li> I used cocoa butter the entire time I was pregnant with both of my daughters and I still had horrible stretch marks until I used DermaRESTORE. This is the only product that has reduced the look of my stretch marks.  I use this three times a day.  I can really see a difference in my skin.  I have also been using this on my daughters scars and they have been fading away.  There isn&#x27;t any weird smell and the product is smooth like lotion.  I will be purchasing more of this so that I will not run out!  Recommend this to everyone especially other mothers!</li>
            <li> This has done absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> After my pregnancy, my thighs and my stomach looked like a road map. All covered in stretch marks. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I was proud of having a baby, but was ashamed of the way my skin looked. My mother surprised me with a bottle of DermaRESTORE, and after just a few weeks of using it, my skin looks much better, and smoother. i have very high hopes that after a few more weeks, my skin will look and feel like its old self.</li>
            <li> Had an old stretch mark on my boobs.now look more clearer .</li>
            <li> really awesome product. It only took me 2 weeks of usage to finally see the results. I tried a different product before and they didn&#x27;t work but this one is really great. I will be recommending dermarestore to my friends. No more those ugly marks for me.</li>
            <li> Been using for almost 2 months. Def has helped lighten my stretch marks. Not a miracle in a bottle, but for the price, I&#x27;m happy with results so far.</li>
            <li> Definitely under rated, best stretch mark cream I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Recommending to others, without a doubt.</li>
            <li> I’ve had my stretch marks for over 8 years now and pretty much given up hope of repairing them.  I gained my marks do to quick growth during weight lifting and mass gain.  The lotion helped smooth my marks and help my skin tone. I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.  The smell is pretty faint and rather nice. My skin feels a lot softer than before I started with the product.  I have tried a few other stretch mark creams, but this one works best for me.  I noticed the appearance of my shoulder, back and waist stretch marks are less obvious.  I have been using this product for over a month now, and I will continue using the cream since I believe over time I will have the results I desire.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve the look of his or her stretch marks. A forewarning you’ll need to have some patience to see results. I believe you’ll need to purchase a second bottle to see your stretch marks begin to fade away.  However, the company that sells this DermaRESTORE product is very generous and may offer you a complimentary second bottle!</li>
            <li> I am definitely gifting this to my other pregnant friends during their baby showers. My marks faded away beautifully after giving birth to my twins. Buy this and spread the word!</li>
            <li> This is one hell of a good investment. All my scars and stretch marks are gone after a month or so. And the best part is my fiance noticed the results. This will not let you down.</li>
            <li> I rushed and bought this product as soon as I came to know that this effectively work on old scars. And yes it has worked as far for me, and I hope this will continue.</li>
            <li> First when I saw that its GMP certified I was quite happy about the product. And then I ordered it for my wife and she seems to be very happy with the results</li>
            <li> from losing weight to having your stretch marks show all the time. this product helped me restore my stretch marks and improve the look of them. I love that is made from vitamins and minerals because the less chemicals used on your body the better and this product is exactly chemical free that will help you get your skin back to normal. loved the product worked so well with my skin and I saw results fast!</li>
            <li> I see slight improvement but not very noticeable. Granted, I haven&#x27;t used it 2 times a day consistently. I will continue to use to product and update my review within another month. Smells great by the way!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product out and I gave it to my wife. She complains about her stretch marks at least once a week. She&#x27;s been using it for a while now and she never fails to remind me how much of a difference she sees with her stretch marks now. She&#x27;s happy which means I&#x27;m happier</li>
            <li> This product delivered the expectation that I had for it! Healed some scaring and improved my skin&#x27;s health overall. I would highly recommend this product to anyone seeking a dermatological solution for improving scar tissue as it worked in my experience!</li>
            <li> I told my daughter that there&#x27;s no cream on earth that can fix stretch marks, but she mixed this with cocoa butter and they&#x27;re so much lighter now, I can hardly believe it. They faded from a noticeable red color to the color of her skin. Mind you, they are still there, but you have to look really closely to see them. I&#x27;m amazed.</li>
            <li> ATTENTION LADIES!! Okay let&#x27;s start off with my situation... I&#x27;m 20 years old, my mother never got stretch marks so when I went to her for help she was no help... Dang it Dad... So I was on Depo birth control and gained 30 pounds in 3 months. Stretch marks galore. I tried many lotions but none seemed to work. I bought this one in last chance hopes! It worked! I used it very abundantly twice a day for about 3 weeks and then switched to just after I showered and rubbed it in all the way and the results have made me feel much more confident. I cried over these stretch marks.. But because of this scar and skin complex I am ready to let the snow melt and take on summer! I only used it on fresh stretch marks But my results have made me so happy. I hope the same for whoever else makes the purchase!</li>
            <li> Starting to work good, waiting on my free bottle</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all!</li>
            <li> I can finally see my stretch marks fading away! I never thought I would be able to reclaim my body after the kids but I am starting to see a difference and I am loving it! I would definitely recommend to anyone with scars or stretch marks!</li>
            <li> My scar is a naval piercing that stretched out about 1.5 in long by 1/4 in wide after pregnancy. After using the product for 4 weeks I can see a lightening in color, but it&#x27;s still as long and wide as it was previously. I&#x27;m going to try another bottle and report back!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so embarrassed of the stretch marks on my arms &amp; I&#x27;ve been dying to find a product that will actually fade them but honestly I&#x27;m getting more stretch marks than I started out with &amp; they&#x27;re becoming deeper &amp; more red even using this product! I have been eating healthy &amp; exercising but this product has not been able to improve my stretch marks &amp; I&#x27;m giving up hope.</li>
            <li> Recommend this product guys</li>
            <li> DermaRESTORE is a pale yellow cream that absorbs quickly into skin after application. I recommend using it after a thorough shower to increase penetration of the lotion into the dermis. You can actually feel a tingling sensation after applying this which makes me feel like it&#x27;s actually doing something, unlike other stretch mark products. It is strongly scented and will cling to you &amp; your clothing for a day, but the smell is not objectionable IMO.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if the product is working... I have been using it for 2 months and I just cant tell. The package did come with a free bottle if you call a number on the label and ask for it.. I haven&#x27;t called yet though, mostly because I doubt that the product is working.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. It didn&#x27;t help me one bit.</li>
            <li> It help with a recent scar that I have on my leg but it does nothing for stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It is not much better than other stretch mark creams that I have tried, but it has caused fading.  Instead of looking red, they become white and has a less visible and more scarrish appearance.  The pump bottle is nice, but I cannot tell how much cream is really left because of it.  As with other creams, the more consistent you apply it the better the results.  For what you pay, I would say its worth it.  It is up there with Barmon&#x27;s Stretch Mark cream and better than Palmer&#x27;s.  The smell of this stretch mark cream compared to others is not strong or offensive which is a huge plus (and I hate cologne or fragrant deodorant). The dual use for scars makes it more of a buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: I did like the cream enough to reorder once I ran out.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! Overall, it has helped with my issues surrounding my skin complexion as well as my stretch marks. I highly recommend this product because it really works, my skin is much firmer then before I used this product and my stretch marks are much lighter then before .</li>
            <li> I have heard scars from childhood and stretch marks after birth. It’s barely a month now after the DermaRestore treatment was introduced to me by a friend. Am so excited that the scars and stretch marks are fading out. Great satisfaction from my money and the remarkable results of the stretch marks and scars treatment.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I definitely see results!</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my wife. She has some scars on the belly and would look bad.&lt;br /&gt;She tried it for a 15 days and started seeing remarkable difference. This is a very good product indeed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of upset I didn&#x27;t discover it sooner!! This stuff is amazing! After my pregnancy i had a few stretchmarks that are disappearing right before my eyes. My husband even notices a difference. I will definitely be back in my crop tops soon!</li>
            <li> I like this product and already ordered my second bottle. My stretch marks were from my 1st pregnancy where I gained almost 40 lbs. I started using this and appears that it helped reduced my stomach/belly stretch marks. I also use it for my 2 laser tattoo removals and few acne scars on my face to help heal and reduce the scar appearance. I will continue to use this and keep posted if I see any more changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with in junction with a derma roller and I&#x27;ve noticed some of my older, lighter stretch marks fading. I&#x27;m hoping my darker ones will fade with continued use.</li>
            <li> I have tried 4 different stretch mark lotions before but this is THE only one that worked for me. I had really super bad stretch marks on my belly after my second child and I didnt even want to look at my belly any more. By the end of using this bottle, almost all my stretch marks are gone! I can hardly tell now that I had stretch marks. I am using my second bottle right now. I am very happy to find this product and I recommend everyone who concerns about your stretch marks to use this one.</li>
            <li> Just got it, awaiting results!</li>
            <li> I received this a few months back. I held off to review until I was sure of the results. I am reordering. It does work. I have minor scars and stretch marks, they did fade them out quite a bit. Overtime and steady use of DermaRESTORE I am confident most will disappear. No bad smell, absorbs well, very soft on the skin. A natural product. Terrific!</li>
            <li> In truth, I do understand that everyone&#x27;s scars are different, and that different products will work based on skin type and severity of the scars. Unfortunately, this did not work one bit for my scars. Others may have better luck and I do hope it will help someone else.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, i would totally recommend this to anyone trying to get the perfect skin. It helped me hide many of the unappealing stretch marks and scars and works great.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a little over a month and I see significant results! I have used it on some stretch marks I have on my legs and they are now about 3 to 5 shades lighter in just a month! I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> Terrible. This stuff doesn&#x27;t not work. I used it for OVER a month and it did nothing. The smell is horrible and it takes forever to rub in. When I would shower in the mornings I could feel it running off my skin. Go try Excel!  I&#x27;m real and this stuff is crap. Try this stuff http://www.amazon.com/Premium-Stretch-Mark-Cream-118ml/dp/B00E07VB6G/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390428124&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;excel+stretch+mark+cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally been using this product for one week now, maybe a couple days less, and am already surprised at the results. I am 7 months pregnant and wanted to get a head start at my stretch mark/scars recovery process. My stretch marks have reduced tremendously. I gave the review a 4 star and not a 5 only because it&#x27;s only been a week and I waiting to see my results after using it for a few more months.</li>
            <li> I used this once a day for a few weeks. I don&#x27;t think there was any change but I could be wrong. At one point I thought there was but I wasn&#x27;t entirely too sure. I then started to slowly stop using it. Not for any reason, I would just forget to do it. I am going to get back into it. Maybe try it twice a day this time for a couple of months. I just have stretch marks on my stomach and upper, inner thighs. Gained some weight so lovely stretch marks decided to pop up. I will update this once I have given it another try for a while! I would recommend this to others though. It seems that so many other people have had great luck with it!</li>
            <li> Certainly not the best, but you can say that it’s better than many other products. Works fine DermaRESTORE is a cheap alternative and I have got the results in my case.</li>
            <li> This stretch mark cream really does work and I haven&#x27;t ever had a cream that worked like this one.  I have many stretch marks on my belly, legs and upper arms.  I started using this cream on my arms first and when I saw how the stretch marks were fading I started using else where.  I love how the stretch marks just look lighter at first and then seem to fad more over time.  I am very happy using this cream and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product from sometime now, and it really works. My skin is smoother and the appearence of the marks is deminishing.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for a while. The result is so far so good. The cream is easy to absorb and leave your skin hydrated. It helps me reduce my old stretch mark. I will use it again.</li>
            <li> Does nothing.  All the good posts are because people get a free bottle for posting a good review.  Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over a year and made a HUGE difference.  Lost over 65 lbs over the past 20 months and after diligent use of Dermarestore. stretch marks faded significantly (even improved old, red stretch marks on my inner thighs).  Smell isn&#x27;t great but it works so I don&#x27;t care.  I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle of this stuff and I&#x27;ll keep buying.</li>
            <li> Horrible do not use this made it worse</li>
            <li> My man bought this for me, after I had my son, after 2weeks of using it I started drastic changes. We were bought surprise how fast it worked. I got another bottle not because I really need it, because the first bottle work its magic. I just want the second bottle for finishing touches. Thanks for making this product I love it!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now for the stretch marks in my stomach and I am very happy with the results. The stretch marks have lightened and are not as noticeable as before.</li>
            <li> Great product! I used it on my after baby stretch marks and they are going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angie V.</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s starting to work. Hard to tell right now, but I am going to keep using this product for a few months to see if it&#x27;s going to really make a difference. I am hopeful.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see drastic results lightens a little bit I think don&#x27;t know for sure that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving a three star and not two</li>
            <li> Great product, if you use it as directed you&#x27;ll see great results</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost a month now and I haven&#x27;t seen any changes. Packaging was lousy, the product was just stuff in the envelope without the box or leaflet explaining more about the product.</li>
            <li> It took my stench marks from &amp;#34;Hey.&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;LOOK AT ME!&amp;#34; Since using this product, my marks became more an more noticeable and did not fade away, even after using the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this product I have noticed a big improvement in my stretch marks. They are not as deep or as wide. I am hoping that with continued use they will go away. I have used many other products including some very expensive products and I have not had the results I am seeing with DermaRESTORE. I should also mention that my stretch marks are from 25 years ago, I wish I had found this years ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 weeks now and have noticed a difference but not a significant one.  I am determined to keep at it to see if the progress continues.  The scent is pretty strong but it glides on very smoothly and isn&#x27;t super thick and goopy like other creams I have tried.  I hope to be able to report back in a few more weeks with increased positive results.</li>
            <li> Love this! Bought this due to an injury I have had a couple months ago. I was playing football and was tripped and got rammed into a poll. I gotten a pretty nasty scar that wouldn&#x27;t go away.The shipping was Farley fast and arrived on time. I started applying the treatment to the scar every time I went to sleep. After 1 week, I noticed a significant difference and the scar was starting to fade. The second week the scar was healed and it was gone. I would recommend this to anyone dealing with a brutal scar!</li>
            <li> No results, used for many weeks applying twice a day. Nothing. I should have done more research on this product because it was a waste of money. It also has a weird smell</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after having my first child and have been very pleased with its results!</li>
            <li> Derma Restore!!! All I can say is... THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. I was a fat child when I was younger weighing over 190 pounds and I was only 5&#x27;2 with stretch marks on my tummy, and sides. I am now over 20 years old and still short with the same stretch marks, but ever since using this product I can honestly say that I am not afraid to take off my clothes in front of my handsome fiancé. Derma Restore has completely lightened all my stretch marks and they are no longer visible. Some stretch marks even shrunken down a notch.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: There aren&#x27;t any. I am very sensitive and I can honestly say that I didn&#x27;t have any side affects from this product&lt;br /&gt;This product contains Aloe Vera Gel, Stearate, Green Bean, Algae Extract, Emu Oil and many other ingredients that contains healing powers.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who are having a difficulty achieving perfect skin!!</li>
            <li> DermaRESTORE had such an amazing action while coping with my pregnancy stretch marks! They have gradually vanished and I was so afraid that they were going to last for good. I just love the feel of my skin on the applied areas! These spots are so soft at the moment, that you couldn’t possibly tell that once there were stretch marks there. I am absolutely satisfied with the outcome – it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> After my first child, I had a few stretch marks and tried in vain to treat them with a few other topical products  but who can possibly afford to apply something that expensive to such a large area and so often?!). After my 4th child, I had HUNDREDS of stretch marks, and decided to give this dermarestore  a try because I was really self-conscious about them. I am so pleasantly surprised with how well it works. The marks aren&#x27;t completely gone, but the product did deliver in its promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stretch marks covered my entire belly and were scattered on my hips and upper thighs as well, and because I am very fair-skinned they were a very angry red. Now they are turning much lighter, smoother, and less defined after only a few uses of applying this cream , and to be honest, I often forgot and didn&#x27;t apply it twice a day, every day. Just for reference, one bottle is actually still descent with a good amount of cream still in it and I applied a generous amount to my entire belly (navel to pubic bone and out and around hips). I would say I averaged about 10 applications per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if they will continue to improve with longer use, but I&#x27;m going to get another bottle and find out. I definitely recommend giving this a try courtesy of PRI !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the entire bottle 1-2 times a day and rubbing it in and have seen no results. In there defense my stretch marks are about two years old so they are white and harder to get rid of. It would probably work on newer stretch marks but not on my old, white ones.</li>
            <li> It worked on my belly, my stretch marks are less noticable (I used it religiously twice a day). The smell is weird but I got used to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this for stretch marks...I use it on my face.  Among the listed ingredients are peptides and great oils.  I must say that this is a keeper.</li>
            <li> The strong chemical smell made me too nervous to use, especially around my baby. I couldn&#x27;t wash the smell off my hands effectively.</li>
            <li> I admit I was doubtful at first but with diligent use I have definitely noticed improvement and feel pretty confident that even more is to come!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for four weeks. My skin is soft , the scent is pleasant but I didn&#x27;t see any change in my stretch marks- the old ones nor the new ones.</li>
            <li> Works! Great product and delivered results! -rrc</li>
            <li> I have two scars on my nose , I applied the product for about a week and it gave me bumps all around.. I thought it was acne so I stopped using it. It has been over two weeks and the bumps are still there, they are definitely not acne by the way the look and feel..</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of getting rid of my post pregnancy stretch marks. Now I am the only one that can tell that there was anything there. Now I am starting to use it for the stretch marks on my inner thighs that I have had since I hit puberty and it is starting to work. Plus my skin has never been so smooth and soft if for nothing else I would use it just for the soft skin.</li>
            <li> I find this useful it has really helped mine (: from having my daughter I very much so consider buying it :)</li>
            <li> I saw the amazing reviews and had to try this product and it does work. I have two sets of white stretch marks, one I had for fifteen years and the other one just in the last five years. I was worried that since they were old stretch marks that I wasn&#x27;t going to see any results. However, I saw results within the first week and now after several weeks of using it they are barely noticeable. I&#x27;ve been recommending DermaRESTORE to all my friends.</li>
            <li> The first week I used this I saw amazing change .... This cream is literally my crack.... Lol will be buying more to help with another scar I have ......</li>
            <li> I have used this on my chest and stomach for 4 days so far. While I don&#x27;t have any dramatic results yet, I do notice that the texture of my stretch marks looks smoother &amp; slightly lighter. Hopefully with continued use I will see more results. I like a lot of the essential oils this contains &amp; the fact that it is made in the U.S.A., however, I was unable to obtain any information on whether this was tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I bought this to deal with stretch marks on my thighs. After only a few days, my stretch marks went bye bye.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product leaves my skin, would definitely recommend for anyone having skin problems. Very good and you will see results.</li>
            <li> Not only did this help reduce the appearance of any stretch marks drastically, but it also made my skin feel healthier in general. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I really love how well this product worked on my stretchmarks!  I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Awesome product in less then two weeks I started to see results would recommend to anyone trying to reduce the appearance of stretch marks</li>
            <li> My brother recommended me this product for my stretch marks, due from giving birth twice. I bought two bottles and applied it twice a day in my stomach for 8 weeks. I also used a Derma roller during the 8 weeks. This product is a true miracle!!! I have used many stretch mark creams before but I have never used a cream that has actually worked. This cream smells amazing and feels really awsome on your skin. I would recommend this product for anyone who has stretch marks or scars because you can truly see the results in a matter of weeks. I love DermaRestore and will continue being a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DermaRestore for about six weeks now and my stretch marks appear to be getting lighter. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will definitely be purchasing another.</li>
            <li> I got Dermarestore because I had 4 kids and ended up having a lot of stretch marks. I have been using this for a month now daily and have notice that my stretch marks are getting much lighter and some have even gone away. I have tried many creams before stating to help stretch  marks go away and none of them have ever worked like the dermarestore works. I love how nice this works and I have recommended it to many of my friends who have had child and suffer from stretch  marks also. Make sure like anything to see the best results to use as directed.</li>
            <li> I love this product i have previously used Bio oil and even tried coconut oil . None of which gave me results.  So i decided to give it one last shot with this dermarestore. Im 20 years old and weigh 145 but ive had these pesky stretch marks on my hips since as long as i can remember! But with this product i definitely can tell a difference.  And ive only been using it for about 2 weeks . The smell is a little different but not repulsive.  I would definitely recommend this product.  Its already lightened the strech marks and even made them thinner. And again its only been 2 weeks . Plus i do not use a derma roller with it.  So if it works for mine that i have had for at least 8 years then it will definitely work for you !</li>
            <li> Im still waiting for the results. Ive been using for two months now</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 4 weeks and there is a significant reduction in the redness of my stretchmarks.  I will be using more of this and continue to use it until I get the results I am looking for.  But so far I like what I see</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few weeks and the only difference in my stretch marks are that they are darker not lighter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have stretch marks but my clients often do and one day a client said they ordered this product off of amazon and it was really working so what I did was took a look at the ingredients and was blown away that more people don&#x27;t try this.&lt;br /&gt;I could use it for my acne scars and stuff so thats why I came here to order some.&lt;br /&gt;Great for women with post pregnancy stretch marks or people with scars they want to go away naturally.</li>
            <li> As much as I hate to admit it, let&#x27;s face it - nearly every woman encounters stretch marks at some point in her life. I have found this treatment to not only diminish the appearance of my existing stretch marks, but to also act as a preventative measure for the future, which is just as important in the reduction of stretch marks! Loved this beauty find.</li>
            <li> Went to mexico about 4 summere ago and got attacted by masqitos had bites up and down my legs that left red scars. Im so glad this is working thanks.</li>
            <li> I tried this to remove stretch marks all over my stomach. I saw very significant improvement in clearing the screches. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just started using it last month. I had my baby 6 months ago, but I&#x27;ve seen no results yet. Got to be patient, I guess.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has been using it for just over two weeks, and hasn&#x27;t noticed any improvement.  She has previously used a different brand of lotion, from which she received great results in days.  Not impressed at this point.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such a dramatic change in my stretch marks .___.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I believe in miracles but I sure believe in DermaRESTORE.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I recently lost a lot of weight leaving me with stretch marks on my legs. I used this product and it has taken away the appearance of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This product helped me to reduce my stretches significantly. I recommend it a lot.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and I have noticed a difference in the look of my stretch marks. They appear to be getting lighter, I recommend using this product twice a day.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with DermaRestore. This product completely faded the unfortunate stretch marks I obtained after giving birth. You have got to buy it!</li>
            <li> Dermarestore contains a scientific blend of only the finest nutrients and vitamins!</li>
            <li> As a mom with stretch marks, this product really helped and boosted my confidence.</li>
            <li> THEY WILL SEND YOU A BOTTLE WITH A STICKER TO CALL IN ORDER TO POST A REVIEW TO GET A FREE BOTTLE&lt;br /&gt;THAT IS WHY IT HAS HIGH REVIEWS I GOT MORE STRECH MARKS WITH THIS&lt;br /&gt;DONT BUY</li>
            <li> I used this morning and night for a single day. And I woke up the next morning and could see noticeable improvement. I am mind blown! Not many products do well for my skin, but this one is not letting me down! I recommend it for all moms with stretch marks 😊</li>
            <li> I recently got a tattoo and a blemish had appeared on it, leaving a scar once the tattoo had healed up. It was very noticeable. I purchased this product and now I cant even see the scar. Tattoo looks great. I am a happy customer. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Derma Restore is a great product to use on stretch marks to elimate the visible skin problem that can occur during and after a pregnancy.  The product is also good at elimating unslightly scars.  Such as the scars acquired after surgery.</li>
            <li> Thank you DermaRESTORE!! I was so self conscious about all my strechmarks, but no matter how much I worked out and dieted with the sole intention to get rid of it, it would never disappear. So about a year ago I started looking into different cremes I could put on my marks to make it go away. The first 3 products I bought didn&#x27;t work at all, I was devastated and thought and thought that I was gonna be stuck with my stretch lines forever. Well finally I found this product and saw all the good reviews it had, and decided to give it a try one last time. And thank god I did, this stuff works amazing!</li>
            <li> I recommended this someone I know and boom, scar is gone (well not boom, it took a little while but it worked). But wait there&#x27;s more... ok there isn&#x27;t more, it did what it was suppose to do and she&#x27;s happy with result.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly for any stretch mark. I had leftover stretch marks from losing alot of weight and this has helped considerably.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about two weeks . I don&#x27;t know if is to soon to see any result jet. I will continue using it hoping i can get good results at the end.</li>
            <li> . . . . . however I was disappointed in not receiving a leaflet or information page with the product, and, in addition to that, a large white \\&quot;coding sticker\\&quot; was glued on to the back of the tube so I couldn&#x27;t even read directions on the tube itself.  I was finally able to remove a portion of this large white sticker, but the label came off with it. I have no idea how to use this product and am denied the ability to see what it is actually contained in the DermaRestore that I am applying to the scar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks and my stretch marks have faded significantly.  I&#x27;ve tried several other products but never had these kind of results.  I would strongly recommend Derma Restore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably because I haven&#x27;t used it correctly (as the bottle lasted only two weeks), but the product hasn&#x27;t worked very well on my skin. I&#x27;ll try to get a new one and apply it differently to see if it works better. Anyway, it hardly smells and the skin absorbs it really fast, so it&#x27;s really comfortable!</li>
            <li> I had some ugly injury marks. Thanks to the DermaRestore, they no longer exists on my face. I&#x27;ve been struggling since long time to get rid of these marks. Hope and patience always pays. :)</li>
            <li> Saw no difference unfortunately. For the price, I am not going to keep buying it to see if it eventually works. I saw no difference at all using an entire bottle and following the directions exactly of applying it twice a day. Disappointed...wish I could find something that works.</li>
            <li> I think it smells good. I have used it for about 2 months now and have only seen a small improvement, but my skin has always been stubborn. I WILL UPDATE once I have more information.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product to test and review but my opinions are 100% my own. I wouldn&#x27;t lie about my stretch mark creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave birth to my son in April of this year and had horrendous stretch marks. I didn&#x27;t gain a lot of weight, but stretch marks are in my genes, so I couldn&#x27;t help that. I started using the cream about a month after I gave birth and didn&#x27;t notice a significant change right away. But after about 2 months, my stretch marks were seriously lighter! Mine were those purpleish looking ones too, very deep. Now they are just the color of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need to apply a small amount to your scars (I had to use quite a bit to even slightly cover mine because I had so many, so this lasted me about a month). The smell is a little &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; smelling, but you get use to it and it&#x27;s not like it lingers or anything. I also think that this product is very cheap for what it is! You normally will spend around $100 on a stretch mark cream that probably won&#x27;t work, but this one is only around $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am so impressed with this product! I highly recommend it to ladies who have stretch marks!! If you are unsure if you should get this product or not, get it! I promise it won&#x27;t let you down!</li>
            <li> I did see results, but they were slightly insignificant. Maybe if two bottles were used better results would come.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t see a difference, a waste of money I would just stick to coca butter lotion.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are fading more and the texture are smoothing out. I will continue to use this product and hope to see a better improvement.</li>
            <li> Time is an important factor here.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for 4 months straight.  It&#x27;s has reduced my deep, 15 year old stretch marks I&#x27;d say by 80%.  I&#x27;m going to to continue for a few more months to see if any more progress is made. I&#x27;ll will be sure to update.  But overall a great product if you use diligently.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Been using for a month and my white marks are getting lighter . Going to keep using to see increased benefits. 1 bottle was just enough for a month .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 26 years old guy and purchased this product in order to treat stretch marks on various parts of my body, such as the middle-back, waists etc. I&#x27;ve been using DermaRESTORE on a daily basis for the last months, and yet, I&#x27;m unable to notice any improvement. There might be some minor insignificant improvement, but nothing more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should also be mentioned that I&#x27;ve used the product along with a &amp;#34;needles roller&amp;#34; (not sure how it&#x27;s called in English...) prior to each use of the DermaRESTORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the lotion/cream has a nice texture and it absorbed relatively quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I apologise for any mistakes in my English]</li>
            <li> Issue number one: I used this for six weeks and saw no reduction in either my scar or the stretch marks on my thighs. Issue number two: This stinks to high heaven. It couldn&#x27;t be any more obvious that you&#x27;re putting chemicals onto your body with the way this stuff smells. I could only use it before I went to bed so I didn&#x27;t reek going into the office. Not worth continuing to see if magically it started working in another two weeks.</li>
            <li> Needed something for a bright red scar. Read the reviews &amp; there was a lot for stretch marks &amp; decided to try based on positive reviews. I have noticed improvement in the color of the scar. Will keep using!</li>
            <li> New respect for stretch mark creams! There is hope! I&#x27;ve been using this product for weeks now and ive seen a dramatic difference. I use it with a dermaroller and its wonderful!</li>
            <li> I just apply a small amount to my stomach area (stretch marks) every day and in a short while you can see the difference. It has drastically lightened my stretch marks! I really like this product and will be ordering more soon! I RECEIVED THIS item in Exchange FOR MY UNBIASED HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> My wife has a week using it and there are no clear outcome yet but the skin already feels smooth not like before.</li>
            <li> Im almost done with my first bottle and i havent seens any results yet but it does leave my skin really really soft which i really like but Im sure i can find other lotions that can do this same. As far as buying another bottle I dont think I will buying any it didnt give me the result that i wanted.</li>
            <li> It is working so far but I&#x27;m also working out more do my skin is tightening up as well and the smell isn&#x27;t bad ether</li>
            <li> I got this product on time and I&#x27;m happy with the bottle and packaging!  I&#x27;ve been using DermaRestore for a few weeks and already I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin tone and I hope for more.  I contacted the seller to ask some questions and I&#x27;m pleased with the level of customer service to handle my concerns, I def recommend this product and seller.  I plan to update my review as my results continue.</li>
            <li> Ok Guys this cream is truly a MIRACLE!!! I did a before &amp; after picture because I actually didn&#x27;t think it would work &amp; I needed proof. In just 3 wks of using it, my stretch marks faded more than 50%!!! I had awful raised stretch marks &amp; they totally smooth out 100%!!! I&#x27;m 50 yrs old &amp; have 3 kids all by C-Section &amp; I had practically given up on these stretch marks! Please, buy this cream because it WORKS!!! Someone told me about Bio Oil. I used it over a month, &amp; I didn&#x27;t see any difference. This DermaRESTORE cm works Fast !!!! So, if you are impatient like me &amp; want to see fast results, this is your solution. When you get it, take a before picture &amp; write the date down for proof because in less than 4wks ( 3 for me) You won&#x27;t believe your eyes. I&#x27;ve told everyone about this cream because it WORKS!! Don&#x27;t wait another second, order your bottle today. Oh, I forgot, it fades your scars too. I had a tummy tuck &amp; my surgery scars faded over 60%. When I went to my follow up appt. my Doctor jaw dropped because she couldn&#x27;t believe her eyes!!! I told her about the cream &amp; she was just amazed.</li>
            <li> From buying used up to now more than 20 days did not see any results I am very disappointed ！</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about three months on a post-surgical scar behind my knee.  Within the last month, I have really noticed a visible difference - the scaring lightened in pigmentation from a blackish/maroonish color.  I would assess that 65% of the scaring has completely lightened up to my skin&#x27;s normal pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Mederma and did not get any results.  Although I was skeptical of this product, I went ahead and purchased it based on the great reviews.  I use this product religiously twice a day (morning/nighttime) and I&#x27;m truly satisfied.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This cream is Amazing!!! I use it alongside my dermaroller and am beginning to see Very good results in lightening an acne scar I have on my cheek. Seeing the before and after pics on some of these reviews is making me even more excited and motivated to stay with it! It absorbs quickly and well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. It actually leaves me feeling very soft. I will come back in a few months to update with a before and after pics with my stretch marks and hopefully raise my 4 star review to a 5. I haven&#x27;t noticed any results with them yet but It&#x27;s only been a couple weeks. I did receive my first bottle free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my actual experience and honest opinions of this cream.</li>
            <li> The post delivery stretch marks leave a scar in the minds of beauty conscious women. I have seen women trying many different methods, from herbal to faith healing, to restore their skin shine and texture. DermarESTORE is a sure success way in skin repair technology. I have heard about this cream being used by a host of satisfied women in my community. The good texture and pleasing scent of the cream is an added attraction.</li>
            <li> Due to my pregnancy I put on a lot of weight and visible stretch marks are something you have to cope with after a pregnancy, not to mention the embarrassment and mental agony you go through of not having been able to have the skin you had prior pregnancy. DermaRESTORE did a wonderful job for me and got me looking great again. I can get into my two piece swimwear comfortably now.</li>
            <li> I never thought that such a low-priced cream would clear my scars when&lt;br /&gt;the costly cosmetic products failed miserably. I am totally stunned&lt;br /&gt;with this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work... nothing else to say!</li>
            <li> A really nice product. It has a weird smell, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> This product works great on old and new scar. After my first child I had a lot of stretch marks on my belly. I started to apply bio-oil which didn&#x27;t work and stretch marks were still there.&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried this DermaRESTORE I have been using this product for a few days and i have noticed a difference in the look of my stretch marks they appear to be getting lighter. Now it is barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I am so happy to say this product really works. After my last child I was faced with the fact that I had a stomach full of stretch marks. I started using Dermarestore and after a few weeks I have seen a remarkable improvement. My skin feels so much softer and smoother. My five year old son has even noticed how much nicer my stomach looks. I highly recommend this product and I am actually looking forward to wearing my two piece swimsuit again.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes the redness go away, slowly seeing it work. Best stretch mark cream I&#x27;ve used, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! This is my first purchase and I am on my 24th day already. Due to my post-pregnancy stretch marks on my belly and breast, I felt really self conscious ( they weren&#x27;t awfully huge or purple). Along with the help of my Derma Roller, I saw some great results in a week. Although, I did stop doing the Derma Roller for almost a week ( do to life events, not the derma roller). I just restarted the process of rolling and applying the product right after and for a week after so. I love the results!! I&#x27;m almost beach body ready! I will order again.</li>
            <li> My gf been using this cream consistently. It&#x27;s amazing what it does to stretch marks. With the changing of her body she gets new ones frequently. She has tried treating them with other products but none had consistent results. I have seen the redness is diminished &amp; the size too. It has also firmed up her skin. It such a great cream. I have been trying it too and it leaves my skin soft moisturizer hydrated. I am impressed at the quality &amp; effectiveness of this cream. It contains a great list of ingredients essential for skin hydration &amp; repair.</li>
            <li> My results have been okay so far, I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll improve but overall the best cream ice tried</li>
            <li> I have scars on my face from acne that have reduced in pigment after applying cream once a day for over a month. Recommend using of sunblock if your job requires you to be outdoors.</li>
            <li> DermaRESTORE really does what its name says. I really restored the look of my skin to how It was before I got these ugly stretch marks. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this dermarestore my stretch mark is lighter then before. I been using this for the past 5wk or more, I&#x27;m happy that I order this just to try it out, work great for me.</li>
            <li> The product worked wonders for me. At first I didn&#x27;t believe it would work, but I went ahead, bought it and I&#x27;ll never regret it. Very smooth on the skin. I was actually worried that it might irritate my skin. I have to admit, it does take some time to see some progress.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a week and it&#x27;s amazing! Stretch marks have gotten lighter. I will definitely will recommend it!</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy!!! The only reason they have a 4.3 out of 5 is because they send people a free bottle for a 5 star rating!!! And this stuff doesn&#x27;t even work!!! It sucks!!</li>
            <li> smells good, leaves skin really smooth. I bought more than one bottle and just finished the whole first bottle and am just now starting to see a difference so i will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week and can already see a difference! I had an 11 pound baby and was covered in stretch marks due to being very very small before I became pregnant. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after struggling with a weight problem when I was younger. Stretch marks kept me from doing many things like going to the beach and doing anything during the summer. That was until I bought this. In almost no time I saw a huge difference in my stretch marks. They are not completely gone yet, but just about in almost no time flat. I recommend 100%!</li>
            <li> My daughter started to use it as soon as she got it.</li>
            <li> It has a very chemical smell to it. My nursing baby didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few weeks ago and it has worked winders on my scars and stretchmarks. I have already bought another one for my self and i plan to buy a few for some of my friends. I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who has and scars or stretchmarks that they want gone for summer bikini season.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of scars on my arm and especially during summer they started to annoy me.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am using DermaRESTORE, they are completly gone!&lt;br /&gt;Definately worth a try</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and smells pretty good.... but sadly to say this product did not work for me. So far I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for a little over a month now and I have not seen any improvement:(...... however my stretch marks were very light before I started using this product and I think its meant for the people who had the &amp;#34;dark stretch marks&amp;#34;  bc it might make them lighter by reducing the darkness of their stretch marks... IDK, either way it is a nice product I just did not see any actual improvement</li>
            <li> I ended up buying this through a different site then amazon but It is definitely working, I use 2-3 times daily and only been working well over a week now my strech marks and scars are looking A LOT better. The strech marks arent looking so red now and it seems to be fading the color! I would recommend this to any girl or guy trying to get rid of strech marks or scars!</li>
            <li> This stuff Is great it&#x27;s really starting to fade my stretch marks I didn&#x27;t see any results for two weeks but In the third week I notice they were blending more I&#x27;m hopeful continued use will prove to be more effective. Ps I&#x27;m African American dark skin and it&#x27;s working&lt;br /&gt;I use it with bio oil and Shea butter as well</li>
            <li> I am giving this product a 3 star because i didnt see any results yet, have been using it for 4 weeks and will order a 2nd bottle to see if there are any changes</li>
            <li> I bought it for my scratch marks during the last trimester .it working wonderfuly</li>
            <li> I have lots of stretch marks on my stomach after having a baby. I have tried lots of products to minimize the appearance of my stretch marks. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and I do see that the stretch marks at the top of my stomach are beginning to fade. I know stretch marks won&#x27;t completely disappear, but it is making a difference in my skin. I can&#x27;t wait to see results with continued use!</li>
            <li> Hi, I&#x27;m Amy Age-20&lt;br /&gt;First of all, my stretch marks are very deep, visible and I am completely ashamed of them.&lt;br /&gt;Over the past year 2013 I have been trying various stretch marks treatment cream which were very expensive and got zero result.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I&#x27;ve done my research and found this latest skin repair cream and let&#x27;s face it, the price is very reasonable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream for exactly 3 weeks and 5 days, and it simply gave me hope again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say this cream work wonders because my deep stretch marks are starting to fade!&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I never thought it would be possible after the countless repair creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom was the second person to notice I was obtaining miraculous results with this product. I&#x27;m a very impatient person but Patience is key in using this repair cream! The smell is pleasant but a bit intense at first, however I like it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue using this miracle cream as long as it takes to make these horrible marks unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got excited and recommended this treatment to my friend&#x27;s and family that are bothered by their mean stretch marks as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Good LUck!</li>
            <li> ill give this cream 4 stars only because I have not finish my first bottle but over all its seems to be doing its job my stretch marks are getting lighter I will be ordering more until its completely gone great product</li>
            <li> I just had a baby 12 weeks ago and I started using this product 2 weeks after having the baby. My stretch marks are fading and are no where near as red as before! I&#x27;m so happy a friend recommended this product! My husband just bought me another bottle!! I would recommend DermaRestore to anyone!</li>
            <li> I loved this product! I had moderate results after 4 weeks. After using jut one bottle I realized I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied, so I know to order 2 bottles next time . Other than that, I&#x27;m really impressed !  UPDATE: I ordered a second bottle and I&#x27;m blown away with the results , I&#x27;m not that comfortable posting the pics, but if you have mild stretch marks. Two full bottles is just enough ! 6-20-15</li>
            <li> hello I bought this products because of the high reviews. honestly I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in my stretch marks  maybe it depends on your body type different products work for different people and things but as for me maybe I would have to continue to use it to see a big significant change I been using it for 3 weeks so I say to each its own it may work for others but I am dark skin African American and was using it to get rid of the stretch marks I gotten from pregnancy maybe the 100% honest thing that will work is probably laser removal I will continue to use the product till the bottle is gone why not otherwise its just a waste of your money guess I&#x27;ll continue searching until I find the right product for me.</li>
            <li> I must say, I LOVE this product....It&#x27;s the best..My stretch marks that was on my arm are actually going away.I have only been using this product for a week and I must say that it was worth buying.. Thanks :-)</li>
            <li> Have not seen any results yet. Applying every day twice. It does leave my skin a nice smooth feel, doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell</li>
            <li> Derma Restore actually works... I have some surgery on my forehead  and  after just two weeks  scare has blended in and if you didn&#x27;t know exactly where it was  you wouldn&#x27;t know...  I continue to use a dab a day.</li>
            <li> Great Stretch Mark and Scar Treatment. I have tried it for a little over a week now and already starting to see results, also makes make skin feel smooth with no odor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using THIS for about 3 weeks now and I can really tell a difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other products and didn&#x27;t get anything out of it. I&#x27;m only one week into my use with this product and the redness is going down. The scars are smoothing out. A long way to go before they dissappear but a great start.</li>
            <li> My pregnant wife loves this stuff. For sure, can see a difference from before and after. Will buy for her again.</li>
            <li> I have been using dermarestore for a little over a month and I have yet to be disappointed!  After a few days of using it I noticed that my stretch marks were fading. Honestly this is the only product that has worked for me. I have tried cocoa butter, tummy butter and nothing has worked like thw way dermarestore does!  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I would like to give this product more stars but I feel maybe you should see results before buying another bottle I didn&#x27;t see any results I would say this product is for someone who is buying 3 bottles and that really wants to clear up stretch marks.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle it works great and faster with 1.5mm derma roller from new spa... My stretch marks are completely gone in a month... I give it 4 star cause the bottle is too small for the price</li>
            <li> i.ve been using it for about five weeks now, and i can see a visible difference on the appearance on my skin. i think with 2 more bottle, i will be ok. i will definately recommend it to anyone. i love the smell too</li>
            <li> After using Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter for the last several months to no noticeable results, I opted to give DermaRestore a shot.  After only four weeks, I can easily see a difference and my marks have finally started to fade!  Having been embarrassed to take my shirt off for the last couple years, this is a tremendous relief and I will continue using this lotion until they&#x27;re gone completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CANNOT RECOMMEND HIGHLY ENOUGH!!!!!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of this product. I have stretch marks on my stomach from 2 pregnancies. I started noticing them get lighter in just a few weeks!! Luv it!!</li>
            <li> After receiving trying multiple products with absolutely no luck whatsoever for the terrible stretch marks I had after my first pregnancy, I began to use DermaRestore during my second pregnancy. Immediately after giving birth and returning home, I noticed that I had no new stretch marks and the ones from my first pregnancy were completely unnoticeable. Highly recommend DermaRestore to anyone who has stretch marks and is looking to improve the look of them! Love it and so thankful for the fast results after only using for about two to three months!</li>
            <li> This product has a chemical scent but the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, i have old white stretchmarks, so far no big results but i see some slight skin peeling. Will continue using this first bottle and see what miracle will happen.</li>
            <li> I had surgery five years old it left a long dark incision on my stomach.I purchase Dermarestore and I have use it for 4 weeks I see the mark lighten up. Can&#x27;t wait to see the in results ordering another bottle&lt;br /&gt;Mel</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it has helped me tremendously and is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever used and I will definitely continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many stretch mark products and this has been the best so far! I have been using it for about a month now and my stretch marks have disappeared almost all the way. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
            <li> i have been using derma restore marks for about five weeks now and my  marks apper to be getting light  OMG i fell in love with the dermarestore am soooo happy to get another bottle i love it................!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have only used it for a week and I already have great results. Of course I have a few stretch marks from having a baby, and well let&#x27;s face it getting older. I also have scars from Gall bladder surgery and a C-section. Within a week of applying this product I have already seen results. My stretch marks and my scars are both fading. This product is a miracle in a bottle. Everyone should try this just if nothing else to boost your self confidence at Bikini season. It&#x27;s moisturizing and smooth and you can almost feel it working right away. Definitely an amazing find. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after a more extended length of time.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 6 weeks now. Still uncertain if there has been any improvement in the colored stretch marks. We will continue using as the product does smell nice and has presented no issues with skin sensitivity.  I will also say we have been doing one set of stretch marks with DermaRESTORE and another set (other side of the body) with Mederma Stretch Mark Therapy, and the DermaRESTORE side does look better.  But they are newly formed stretch marks and could have also just formed unevenly.  We will know more in a few months and I&#x27;ll update  my review.  In full disclosure I am writing this review to receive a free additional bottle of the product.</li>
            <li> Just the first couple weeks ive noticed a change, my scars are not completely gone but it definitely made a big difference</li>
            <li> I have been using now twice a day for 6 weeks and it has not worked at all sorry to say as I thought this was the miracle cream it says it is</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now and im starting to see a slight difference in my stretch marks. I will continue using it to see how much my marks will fade.</li>
            <li> I finished the bottle and didn&#x27;t see any results. It might works on recent stretch mark or could prevent the stretch marks. It didn&#x27;t work on me specifically.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister. She says that it works and she has much more confidence now.</li>
            <li> I have tried upon several products to get rid of awful zebra like marks on my waist line, and I must say, this is it what every woman actually needs after her delivery... Within just 2 months of constant use, DermaRESTORE has made my waist line beautiful again... Marks have subsided and skin appears clean and bright</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement but this lotion stinks. I can only put It  on At night before bed because i don&#x27;t Want to get out of the shower in the morning and smell like this all day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks and I have seen minimal to no results. I&#x27;ve lost some weight the past 2 months and was hoping to ateast make the stretch marks fade away. Maybe you need to use more than 1 bottle in order to see results . I will not be buying again</li>
            <li> I was in a car accident and left with scars that needed attention.  DermaRESTORE is the answer!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days and I have noticed a difference in the look of my stretch marks they appear to be getting lighter I use it twice a day</li>
            <li> I am away with some odd stretch marks I had on my back. Thanks to this wonder product. The good part is it is very effective and is made of rare essential oils, vitamins that rare extracts for giving best results. Don&#x27;t mind recommending to people. I liked it. Totally risk free. Value for money.</li>
            <li> Huge difference! Cleared up my scar tissue in no time. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Really improved my strechmarks and helped with my scars, also cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> Love the product - it works as it claims. I used to be much larger than I am now so I had loads of stretch marks...not anymore - WOOT!</li>
            <li> Just started this a few days. It has a very strong scent... which I guess is a good thing because it smells like it gets the job done and it has! My stretch marks are looking a lot less red and new</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement in my stretch marks and this is the only product that have worked so far. So I am looking forward to trying the product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a huge difference with just my first bottle. You can hardly see my stretch marks in some places.</li>
            <li> DermaRESTORE is not a &amp;#34;miracle cream&amp;#34;... but it definitely WORKS if you use it correctly! My stretch marks were really bad after having my son! REALLY bad. I am on my second bottle and they are visibly shades lighter, already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion smells great and isn&#x27;t greasy, like a lot of products. Most importantly, (to me) it&#x27;s affordable! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different lotions and potions, Mederma, lots of body butters, and Palmer&#x27;s creams, but with little to no success. DermaRESTORE has exceeded my expectations. I will definitely continue using this product! Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use stretch mark creams in the past, including Mederma&#x27;s Stretch Mark Therapy and this product worked much better. My skin is prone to stretch marks from working out and lifting weights and using DermRestore after month significantly diminished mine. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product. My stretch marks got way better</li>
            <li> Folks, this product will have you believing in magic.  I used this as soon as I got it and within a week, I could see the changes.  I highly recommend this item to all.</li>
            <li> I have had an unsightly scar from an iron burn on my left forearm for the past several years, which for some reason bothers me to no end. I had applied many different things to it in the beginning, including shae butter, and aloe and definitely noticed no improvement. My wife purchased DermaRESTORE and I ended up being the one to use it. I have been applying twice a day for ten days and already can see that the scar is lightening up. I don&#x27;t know if this blemish will ever be invisible, but I am already happy with the improvement that I&#x27;ve managed to make so far.</li>
            <li> never found a cream that worked, and had tried everything I recommend to every woman who experiences this bad is very good.</li>
            <li> I started using this on April 10, 2014. I waited over 2 months to do this review because I wanted to give this product a chance to work. But lo and behold, NOTHING is happening. I have a few stretch marks on my tummy - both sides - below my navel after I gave birth. I have been using this twice daily ever since I received it in the mail and I have not seen a difference in my stretch marks. NONE WHATSOEVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is runny. However, didn&#x27;t have a problem with the smell as some people did on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the DermaRestore because of the positive reviews, but I&#x27;m starting to think that most of the reviews are fake because they were offer a &#x27;free bottle after writing a review&#x27;. I was offer this as well, but I didn&#x27;t take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not re-purchase! I get way better results from &#x27;MEDERMA stretch mark therapy&#x27; that I bought from Walmart. The MEDERMA is no miracle cream either, but at least, you see some result and  most importantly, it leaves your skin incredibly SOFT.</li>
            <li> Of all the products I&#x27;ve tried this one gave me the best results. My skin absorbed the lotion well. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy like other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. If you want to minimize stretch marks try DermaRESTORE before using any other product.</li>
            <li> I foolishly ordered this based on the reviews, but didn&#x27;t take the time to actually sit down and closely read them. When I did (after I had already spent my money of course) I noticed that all the 5 star ones followed the same format and if you clicked on other reviews the &amp;#34;user&amp;#34; had written, all of them pretty much reviewed the same products--hair towels, weight loss supplements, printer cartriges, etc. etc. I believe that this is a scam aimed to take advantage of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been diligently using it and have seen no results, my skin is just very soft. I&#x27;ll update this comment if I do start to notice differences.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months and I am seeing steady improvements. I&#x27;ve tried other creams with no results in 3x the amount of time so that is definitely a positive. It&#x27;s affordable in comparison to other creams, does not have an obtrusive smell and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> Been using this for some time and have noticed good improvements in my skin. Helped fade stretch marks very well. Definitely recommend it to everyone to try. Solid product highly effective!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using this product, it seems to be working already though. I used it on my stretch marks from pregnancy and the color seems to be lightening :) I&#x27;m happy with it so far. I received a discount on the item for a review. :)</li>
            <li> I brought it for my wife after she had developed some stretch marks and some darkar patches of skin around her tummy. I was initally very skeptical and about 2-3 weeks down the road, we really started seeing changes. The lotion gets abosrbed into the skin and not at all oily. So that&#x27;s a definite postive.&lt;br /&gt;Her color of her skin is back to normal now and the stretch marks are also showing signs of disapperance. I would definitely like to recommend this product to anyone to has had issues with stretch marks post pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Good excellent product, I got this product and read instruction before i apply to my tummy stretch mark and my C. S scar, . This product is is  Stretch mark and scar therapy. In few days after i started,  I impressed for good result, this is my best therapy . Why I bought this product because it contains a proprietary complex of rare essential oils, vitamins, and uniquely effective extracts designed for optimal results. I riteally recommended this product, I am happy and satisfied. I got this in promotional discount , for product reviews and it is true. The best Scar and stretch mark therapy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really think this was going to work, but since it was made in the USA, I thought I could trust it! I purchased this product because a friend of mine used it in the past with amazing results, and after the first few weeks, I can say that it is the same! Thanks so much for the product!! I will be recommending it to all my friends!</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t have stretch marks? I have tried everything to try to get rid of them and finally i found a product that makes them less visible. I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all I even feel like it made them spread I bought used it for 2 months and 3 weeks and now they are just all over no improvement at all ! This is fake just like every other product bio oil is much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Faded the stretch marks on my hips and thighs significantly and nothing else has ever worked for me. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Ok, I will be the first to admit. With my first pregnancy I had gained 82 pounds. I doubled my weight! I had such horrible stretch marks, went through having 2 more babies in 2 years. And my stretch marks just continued getting worse and worse. I came across this stretch mark and scar treatment and I have noticed a HUGE difference. It is such a great product. Easy to apply. No bad smells. My stretch marks and scars are diminishing. I have faith that if I continue using this treatment then by the Summer of 2015 I will be able to wear a 2 piece and not be embarrassed or ashamed of my once nasty looking stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the treatment to anyone that has shameful looking stretch marks or scars. I know that you shouldn&#x27;t be ashamed of them but lets be honest here everyone/most people hope and wish there was a remedy. Well, look no further here it is.</li>
            <li> I tried several stretch mark creams, but this one so far absorbed into my skin the fastest and left my skin moist. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I had 2 babies in the same calendar year, so my stomach looked like I had been attacked by a wild animal. It was horrible. I have been using these for a few weeks and can already tell a huge difference! It doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but it does work quickly. It feels good going on, there is no tingling like those wraps that I&#x27;ve tried and there also isn&#x27;t a terrible smell or greasy feeling. I love it so far.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first off all.. make sure if youre buying one BUY ANOTHER. its not something that&#x27;ll work super fast. well it feels fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a large butt and im think so of coarse stretch marks came -_- and im a 16 year old so its not fun hiding myself in the summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im looking forward to wearing a bathing suit feeling confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but anyways. i have old sretchmarks that are white and they are very noticable because i am mix of white and black. and i have new ones ( not anymore tho!)&lt;br /&gt;i had purpleish pinksih ones under my butt (couldnt wear short shorts)&lt;br /&gt;but this stuff made them go away just about completely within thew two months or earlier!&lt;br /&gt;be patient people!&lt;br /&gt;this stuff isnt fake! i saw some peoples review saying it didnt work? but i was too late because i bought it before i read the reviews. bad idea on my part! but im very happy about the results!&lt;br /&gt;unfortunatly it hasnt gotten rid of my old ones that are white and very deep so im going to try a different product to get rid of it:) im happy and you wont regret this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;thanks :)</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks from childbirth so far not to many things have worked. I&#x27;ve been using the product for a little over a month and am satisfied and am going to keep using this product and hopefully I won&#x27;t be able to see my marks much longer .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of products that claimed they would do what derma restore said it would, and they were a big flop.  Was really surprised how well this worked!  I have a scar on the front of my leg and with warm weather, I really wanted to wear shorts without embarrassment, or trying to cover it with a band aid.  I had to make myself a little schedule so I would remember to apply it, but it is totally worth the time and effort.  I like that you rub it in until it disappears, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting any on your clothes.  I&#x27;m super sensitive to smell, and was glad to find it wasn&#x27;t too strong smelling!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best stretch mark product! I saw immediate results after a couple of weeks, this product shrinks and lightens the stretch marks rapidly. Great for looking your best for summer after pregnancy! Well worth money!</li>
            <li> I fell of my bike as a kid and had to get  stitches on my leg. I tried numerous other things to get rid of the scar,including Bio Oil and nothing worked. My mom got me dermarestore and even though it took about 7 months of use, its completely gone now. So i dont know if it would work for stretchmarks but for scars yeah.</li>
            <li> I really love this product... Three weeks now and my stretch Mark is already fading ... It works try it</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!!! I&#x27;ve tried many others and none of seem to work but dermarestore worked very well for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I can already see results. I will keep using it and I advice all those who need to get rid of stretch marks to use it!!</li>
            <li> The DermaRestore is very effective, works quickly, and you gradually notice changes. It works faster than Miderma and I only had it for a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about four months now, obviously not twice a day but as often as I remember to and my stretch marks really have reduced in color. They aren&#x27;t the angry red they used to be! Very pleased .</li>
            <li> I use this product for more than a month. It works!!! Stretch Mark are disappearing.</li>
            <li> I too have read these great reviews and so I went ahead and bought myself a bottle. I paid $44 so I&#x27;m not too happy to see it for this price but if something is good ill pay anything. I have stretch marks on my waist from the child bearing days and I have tried a lot of remedies to get rid of them but nothing helped. DermaRESTORE was applied to the problems areas twice per day as directed. It took about 2 weeks but I started to see some lighter areas in works and I was thrilled. I keep using for another few weeks and the marks just kept getting lighter. Theres a very noticeable difference in the area now and my hubby even tells me how much better it looks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know, was a gift for daughter who is away at school, has bad stretch marks from developing quickly with large breasts. Hoping this will help her. Have not asked her if she used or likes, will update once I know. She tends to not use past products I purchased on a regular basis, probably why they didn&#x27;t work, now that she is mature hoping she follows through and works for her. All the reviews were really good, that&#x27;s why I decided to get for her.</li>
            <li> I purchased DermaRestore for my stretch marks after having lost a lot of weight at the gym. So far I&#x27;m loving it, it&#x27;s almost completely removed all my stretch marks and I feel much more secure about myself. I&#x27;m not longer afraid of taking off my shirt in front of people. It&#x27;s very helpful, clean and leaves no marks. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and the treatment is going great. Recommend this to ALL people.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of stretch marks and after using this product, they were all gone. I really love this product because now i don&#x27;t have to hide my body because of my stretch marks. But now I&#x27;m happy that they are gone after I&#x27;ve used this product. Amazing and i recommend it to people who are looking to get rid of their stretch marks!</li>
            <li> This actually works ! I was doubting it but i bought it and tried it and im shocked . I actually dont use it all the time so the results i have really suprise me !</li>
            <li> Slowly but surely showing effective!  Good product Just waiting and seeing!</li>
            <li> After seeing this product here i bought it for my pregnant wife so she could use it after giving birth. And so she started using this after she gave birth and the marks faded away, she really loved this treatment.</li>
            <li> I have been battling my stretch marks for quite some time now and I research something that can work. I came across this and I LOVE IT!!! I am free from the scars! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> As a mother myself, I feel like this is an awesome product for all mommies!</li>
            <li> Only used for a month and noticed a difference.  I have olive skin and I had 25 year old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Want to purchase this cream to see what all the Hype is about!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin but moisturize it.</li>
            <li> This product has to go on under lotion or it wont absorb. Still didnt work well for me and i dont even have huge stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product during and after pregnancy, it had always give me a cooling &amp; smooth sensations to my problem area. Each day I do see the redness of my stretch marks change from pink to light skin tonal color. I want to continue using this product &amp; see more results. I wish the bottle is bigger and cream distribute in larger amount. I ran out of this product quickly so it would be nice to get more. It&#x27;s worth trying to reduce appearance of your stretch marks from pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I have used many products for fading scars and dermarestore is absolutely the best one yet!! Don&#x27;t keep Wasting money on high dollar products that leave you with no results. Try dermarestore first!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t Work Don&#x27;t Buy !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;They give you a free bottle for writing a good review !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a while now and it&#x27;s working.I could see the difference very soon. I  have lot of stretch marks from pregnancy. This has made them a shade lighter and it looks so much better. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used it like 1 month befor my second pregnancy and it works great good product</li>
            <li> awful product doesnt work..i want my money back. what a waste. i am putting this as 5 stars cause those are the only reviews i read so maybe everyone will see this. most 5 star reviews in here for dermarestore are actually fake. i am using a dermaroller also and still doesnt work. do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> This actually seems to fade stretch marks.  I bought this for a friend and her stretch marks are fading, she has since ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife.  She has what she calls a spaghetti factory on her stomach.  Her stretch marks are definitely lighter after a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nine weeks now and I am very satisfied with the results. I plan to continue using this product and would definitely recommend it. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I still need to use it longer to get continued results.</li>
            <li> I had some pretty deep stretch marks from pregnancy, I started using this soon after delivery. Within a month they are almost non visible. It didn&#x27;t seem to do much for the really old ones, but works great on the new ones!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;ALL THE REVIEWS ARE FAKE BECAUSE THEY OFFER A FREE BOTTLE AFTER YOU WRITING A GOOD REVIEW -  most of the ladies thought if they  use more time with this product something will happen and its free so why not&lt;br /&gt;after they wrote  review they can&#x27;t go back....so if you DO NOT throw your money to the garbage DO NOT BY THIS JUNK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the DermaRestore because of the positive reviews I wish that I saw the review from  - June 19, 2014 Trash! Just another rip off!&lt;br /&gt;I bought the DermaRestore the same month.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as she was left with a stretch mark after having our first child. She complained about it to me and I figured it would make her happy if I got some for her. The stretch mark disappeared very quickly, never had an issue.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks is fading. I&#x27;m happy I bought this and just like other reviewer says this really works. I&#x27;ve got really deep and dark stretchmark so I think it will take longer to fade but my other stretchmarks are fading so for that i am really happy. I would buy again and again and again.</li>
            <li> so far this product is been working good. I have not seen new stretch marks and I&#x27;m 27 weeks pregnant. It also helps to relieve the itching. I will continue to use it after pregnancy for better results.</li>
            <li> My stretchmarks began to fade and look better within three weeks, i feel more confident in my skin now :)</li>
            <li> i have previously done laser treatments for my stretch marks, and i bought this cream for maintenance. its good</li>
            <li> I love this product it helps tremendously with my stretch marks, which have over the years gotten progressively worse. But with this product my stretch marks are now going away making me feel younger and healthier. I love this product and so do my friends of whom I have recommended this to. I will continue to recommend this and use this regularly. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage that doesn&#x27;t work.  Stop paying people to write reviews.</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks from some weight gain on my thighs and butt.(sad but true) So i started using this at Christmas and i thought that i would wait a while before a review. I think in the six months it has definitely reduced the appearance of them. They are pretty new so they were a horrible red color and now they are a softer pink. Which is nice because it&#x27;s summer. The reason i give it four stars is the bottle is small and if you use as instructed(twice a day), you can easily go through one bottle in a month if you have a large area to cover.</li>
            <li> At first, I was disapointed in the product as I saw no results.  But as I continued to use it, I definitely saw a reduction in redness.  I expect the results to continue and can&#x27;t wait to see them!  Another plus- I had scar near a tattoo that I was using the cream on.  I was worried the cream might fade the tattoo but it hasn&#x27;t at all!  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is a dud.  I used it as directed and I actually think my stretch marks became more pronounced and darker in color.</li>
            <li> I have tried 4 different types of Stretch marks  either oil or cream after i gave birth, so far this one works better. I use at least once a day, right now i have finished my first bottle, i already notice the strech marks has changed from red to pink. Now i ordered my second bottle, i hope they get better and better.</li>
            <li> I bought this product confidently based on others reviews and I have not experienced any difference in my marks. I used it twice a day as its recommended and there has not been any change in the color of my scars/stretch marks. I use Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter which costs a lot less and has a better scent to it.</li>
            <li> I love this product &amp; will be ordering again.I just finished my first bottle &amp; already see wonderful results. Thank you DermaRESTORE for making me feel confident again!</li>
            <li> My product just arrived and so far I&#x27;m really happy with it. After just a few days, my stretch marks from pregnancy look like their fading. It absorbs quickly and smells pleasant. I am hoping to see more significant results soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month and a half day and night and I see no difference whatsoever in my strechmarks, I did not see any change in my skin, it might have worked for others but it did not do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I have used DermaRESTORE for a year now and I absolutely love the product, I noticed that its a gradual process meaning for me after 3 months I really saw the difference and my stretch marks started to disappear, I personally feel this is one of the best products on the market for scars from pregnancy and stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> Reduced my thigh stretch marks ALOT! Just wish the bottle was bigger lol. I got it on sept 12 it lasted till oct 10</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife after she had or first child because she wanted to try and get rid of the stretch marks. she used these and they helped a lot you can barely notice them now. she was so happy that it worked she tells everyone about it now lol.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about anyone else I&#x27;m probably the only one who uses this on my facial acne scars and this cream is killin it! Woohoo! I plan to use this on some stretch mark I have too but I figured if its good for scars then maybe it&#x27;s work on my face. I was right!!! From being skeptical to confident i would def. buy again.</li>
            <li> Obviously your stretch marks are not going to 100% disappear, but this definitely got rid or decreased the appearance of about 90% of mine. Two pregnancies, stretch marks getting worse each time, and four different products later, I found this and figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;. Well, it definitely helped in the first 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months now and it finally ran out. I didn&#x27;t do it twice a day either. I think around the 3rd month is when I stopped seeing results, almost like my body was telling me that that was the best I was going to get. It worked better and faster than cocoa butter, mederma, perfectly posh fabulous momma stick, and another product I got from Motherhood.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every day, for almost 2 months. It has definitely worked for me. At this rate, the stretch marks will be mostly gone within a month. Just give it time. None of the products that I used in the past, helped nearly as much as this one. I wholeheartedly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does. Everything is getting lighter and some have vanished. I recommend anybody this cream it&#x27;s great. This is the wanting for to vanish the scars and more.</li>
            <li> Received the product on time.... I will recommend Derma Restore.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month, twice a day and i have seen a difference in my  stretch mark, they become lighter and haven&#x27;t gained any more. I will continue using it for best result!</li>
            <li> Love this product.it&#x27;s really works so happy..:)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I have bern using it on two surgical scars that are over 35 years old.  To my surprise in less than three months I am seeing results.  The scars are fading away.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I can&#x27;t believe the results in such a short period of time.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really think it helps much, but it definitely is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Reducing old stretchmarks from multiple pregnancies. After less than a months use, the ones above my belly button are so faint you can barely see them.</li>
            <li> Great cream. Not a miracle cream but it does what is says. I been having streach marks over 14 years. I been using the cream about 2 weeks know and it has been doing what it says it does. Will keep on using it. I recommend it</li>
            <li> this product shouldn&#x27;t even be called a product! it was amazing and worked well! Use as directed and you will see great results. I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few weeks and all i can say is wow, will make sure to purchase many more when i need them. thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Smells objectionable to me.</li>
            <li> After having more than one child, I have plenty of stretch marks left behind on my belly and a few other places like my sides where it stretched on my basket ball belly with each child. After a while, most of the stretch marks have at least faded to a white color, they are certainly still visible. I decided to give this treatment a go, but I was a little worried I could not find a list of ingredients before I purchased. While I normally like to go all natural, this has quite the list of ingredients. There are a lot of natural things like aloe, but overall I could not pronounce most of the items and had to look them up. Since it&#x27;s not a long term treatment, I still decided to give it a go. It seems fine so far, my skin isn&#x27;t bothered and it seems to be helping. My skin looks better in general and the stretch marks seem to be fading. My daughter had stitches a while back and I will be trying this on her scar as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. EVERYTHING IN THIS REVIEW IS 100% MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY</li>
            <li> I used this product Stretch marks are faded but still visable better then before.</li>
            <li> There was what I thought some slight results, but I found that the cream itself leaves a skin colored residue that was short term (like foundation) and no long term scar reduction of any kind.</li>
            <li> This cream has really helped with the biceps and chest area that have been damaged due to years of lifting and growing frame. While it may more than 1 bottle to really see the difference, progress is still to be expected after using 3/4 of the first bottle. I imagine it&#x27;s different for different people with different skin completions but in any case it&#x27;s worth a shot for a reasonably priced product. I&#x27;ve seen other similar creams at nordstroms that go for approx. $70.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best creams my wife has used after her pregnancy! After our second child, she had some few stretch marks that were noticeable, I decided to look around for a product that would aid her. I came across this product and decided to give it a shot. What do you know? After a few applications of this product, my wife and I started to see results. We both saw less and less of the stretch marks and from that experience, I can say that I&#x27;m a satisfied customer. I would most certainly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a treatment for stress marks or scars.&lt;br /&gt;Quality product, I may purchase this product again if I decide to have another child.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream for 3 weeks and it is starting to fade away, i hope after 2 or 3 months it will vanishes :)</li>
            <li> Does NOT work!!!! Complete waste of money! This product deserves zero stars but of course it won&#x27;t let you give any lower than one.</li>
            <li> Bought for teenager who has bright red stretch marks from fast growth.  She really doesn&#x27;t like the smell (make it smell pleasant for five stars!), but it really does seem to be fading the bright red.  Not sure how it would work on wide marks from pregnancy, but it is helping for our circumstance.  She will continue to use this product and hope for even more improvement!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but I got it for my wife anyway. Since we just had a baby it left some stretch marks behind. After a few weeks I can tell there is a dramatic difference. The cream really does lighten the marks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that this product ACTUALLY WORKS! My scar is gone completely, I&#x27;v been suffering with this huge scar on my forehead, and thanks to this product ITS FINALLY GONE. I&#x27;v tried numerous amounts of products - But this one actually worked! Give it a try guys!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had terrible stretch marks after losing 50lbs in two months. Didn&#x27;t want to go though some expensive procedure so I looked at other options. Came across this product at the recommendation of a friend. Now my stretch marks are virtually gone and are improving day by day. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product works like magic. After only using it for a few days it has helped me alot with my stretchmarks. This was the first product that I tried and I&#x27;m glad I chose right. I recommend this to anyone that have tried everything and failed everytime in trying to remove your stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> I saw a couple stretch marks on my body I used this everyday twice a day for a month and they are still there kinda salty bout it</li>
            <li> I have used it for 4 weeks and I have seen my stretchmark&#x27;s get a little lighter but I think its to early to tell.</li>
            <li> Love the product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a while. I noticed a difference within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Before having my son I was very paranoid about acquiring stretch marks after giving birth to him. They run in my family and my mother got them after me.. I researched everything I possibly could and this is the only product that has helped even a little bit! I was weary but gave it benefit of the doubt and am so happy I did.</li>
            <li> I have had a whole mess of stretch marks on my stomach, and within a few weeks of using this my skin is already looking lighter and easy on my eyes and everyone else&#x27;s, now I don&#x27;t have to be so afraid to take my shirt off at the beach.</li>
            <li> For a nice and by using this merchandise every single day, for nearly 3 months. It&#x27;s got absolutely did wonders for me. At this price, the striae will be generally gone within a thirty days. Simply just offer this occasion. Not one of the merchandise i always applied in the past, assisted virtually approximately this. I wholeheartedly suggest this.</li>
            <li> I have had a scar on my finger for YEARS. I always use Vitamin E and after a while I feel that it just stopped getting better. I got DermaRESTORE  cream and I quickly saw a difference for the better. I&#x27;m sure for a scar that hasn&#x27;t been there for a long time, it would work wonders since it made a difference on mine.</li>
            <li> Honestly this was a waste of money. I applied twice daily for a few weeks and there was no change whatsoever. The product also smells strongly of cocoa butter. My stretch marks are natural, I have never gained/lost significant weight and have never been pregnant. The product was supposed to help with this but it did nothing. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> After a month use it has reduced my stretch mark appearance. I use this with a derma roller. I will give a more detail review in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 1 week and it has worked amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and you may get more or less results, but my stretch marks after my 2nd baby were dark and now after 1 week they are so light and my old ones u can&#x27;t tell I have them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using this and recommend you try it.&lt;br /&gt;It may work for you : )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty young and it&#x27;s embarrassing to say, but I have stretch marks on the side of my  thighs.  They are hideous to look at. I&#x27;m ashamed of the marks and how vivid they are.  When I wear my  bathing suit in the summer time, it&#x27;s so apparent and humiliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the bottle today. I smothered a bit on my thigh and then used the Derma roller to roll on the stretch marks.  Hopefully, in a few weeks time I won&#x27;t ever have to see my stretch marks again. Currently, I don&#x27;t see any differencs, but that&#x27;s reasonable since I just started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review in a week.</li>
            <li> My wife had some terrible stretch marks after our child was born, and she was embarrassed to wear any sort of bathing suit or any cooler apparel! We had tried a couple of the OTC creams and they just weren&#x27;t doing much of anything. A friend had told me about DermaRestore and after being skeptical..we tried it and wow..they were 70% in about 10 days. Best product we have tried!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. After using a whole bottle, no results. My stretch marks aren&#x27;t even that deep. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;ve seen better results with Palmers stretch mark lotion.</li>
            <li> I like this product and its really working.</li>
            <li> Surprising I wouldn’t allow my wife who is a beneficiary of this wonderful product to submit a review. I am so happy for the new look on her skin.  She had extremely large stretch marks all over the body and had lost hope trying any product until I found Dermarestore for her. It was just like a magic, it worked so well on her skin than we expected, after using three bottles within 6months.  She normally uses the product after each bath and never combines it with any other product.  Friends who have seen this dramatic improvement on her are already buying the product. It is anticipated that anyone with “serious” stretch marks would give it a try.  And I must also say that the picture shown on the product by the manufacturers is a real “mild” case looking at what the product has done in our more serious case..</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product. I have only been using it for a week and I already see outstanding changes. I hit a huge growth spurt when I was 11 and I ended up with these gross, dark, risen stretch marks. I&#x27;m 20 now and my nine year old stretch marks are halfway gone already. I really can&#x27;t begin to explain just how happy I am too have tried this  product,and would recommend to anyone!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very self-conscious about my stretch marks. I&#x27;ve had them since my early teens and I get them after any weight change. I have them on my buttocks and thighs. Last year I gained a lot of weight that I am trying to gradually lose it. I got new stretch marks in my inner thighs, that&#x27;s why I got this product. To be clear, I am using them on the new stretch marks only. I put the cream on religiously and after a month I can say they are significantly less noticeable. They are still there but, not as red, which is nice. I will continue using the cream as it&#x27;s the only treatment that has ever made any difference for me and, though the small bottle is $28, I can afford it.</li>
            <li> I am a light skin asian woman who just had a baby. I have little and light stretch mark, but given this is my first baby, I am pretty self conscious about them. DermaRESTORE does work. I rub it on everyday, three or four times a day. It has been four weeks and I&#x27;m slowly seeing results. It doesn&#x27;t work as fast for me as for everyone from what I read on their reviews. The little bottle feels a little full so hopefully when I&#x27;m done with it, the pink stretch marks I have will be gone too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say this has worked for me.  I gave up after using it for 2 months and seeing not much improvement.</li>
            <li> Great product works excellent!!</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly and I was so blown away by the reviews that I used this not once or twice, but three times a day on my stretch mark on my hips.  I&#x27;ve had these nasty stretch marks forever and they are a painful reminder of puberty.  Seriously I am 29 years old and I&#x27;ve had these since I was 14 years old or so.  The red marks had started to fade.  It has been a little longer than a month and the redness has lessened.  I am very excited to see the final results.</li>
            <li> This did not do the trick for me, nothing has changed after using 2 times a day for 1 month. I don&#x27;t have the patience to keep using to find out in the end it doesn&#x27;t work.  If i saw a slight difference after using for a month, i would have kept trying.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> Best Stretch mark and scar treatment repair product available on the market. I highly recommend this product, I have ordered 3 already and am going to keep on purchasing them, as I wouldn&#x27;t purchase any other brand or product! A lot of it also comes in this, so you will only need one every few months!</li>
            <li> I used this during and after my pregnancy. I had stretch marks appear during the pregnancy and that is when I decided to spend a little more money on a product. After 3 weeks of use, twice a day, I noticed a huge difference in my existing stretch mark. Now, after 7 months of use, they are still there but barely noticeable. I also exfoliate the area in the shower prior or applying the lotion for added improvement. I am purchasing another bottle! Hope this helps someone in the fight against these horrendous things :)</li>
            <li> I got a little scar across my right leg from an accident in wood working. The wound has healed but I don&#x27;t really like the scar. So my wife got me this one day. To my amazement, it works! Just apply it regularly everyday and your scars will fade away after 3 weeks, like mine :) I totally recommend this</li>
            <li> DermaRESTORE - Stretch Mark and Scar Treatment - The Latest in Skin Repair technology - 4oz Cream、、Bottle is running out have no effect！</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every stretch mark cream on the market but nothing made a dent until DermaRestore. After having 4 children, I got these unsightly, deep, purple stretch marks on my belly and upper arms. For me, that meant bye-bye sleeveless tops. But thank God for DermaRestore, my worries are gone. Only 3 weeks into using it, I can see a big change already. The deep, purple deep stretch marks are becoming lighter, the little ones are fading before my eyes. It is a miracle. So far, I am really liking this product, and the results am getting. I am definitely buying it again</li>
            <li> very good just in one week you can see the results,the stretch begin to erase a 2 weeks...so i recommend .</li>
            <li> Not much done so far..might need more time.</li>
            <li> I Would recommend this product to everyone. Just need to have some patience to see results. Most likely you would need to purchase a second bottle to see your stretch marks begin to fade away. Love the smell and how the skin feels after placing it on my skin. Skin feels soft as a baby.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks now, i have noticed my stretch marks considerably Smaller, softer, and the color has faded. I have used many different stretch mark products and this has been by far the best working and the quickest working product i have ever used. I would definitely recommend buying.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift because I lost a lot of weight really fast and was left with stretch marks around my armpits and stomach. I used almost the whole bottle before my girlfriend commented on how they were fading. I didn&#x27;t really notice because I see it every day, so the change was gradual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking even a good product that works like this still takes time to do its thing, and it also helps to have someone who is impartial to notice the results over that period of time. All in all I&#x27;m going to buy another bottle just to see how it does with even more time.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are unfortunately on my butt.  I had a growth spurt in my teens, the scars began on my thighs cause my legs grew longer and somehow they all traveled up to my butt and they stayed there ever since.  I learned to live with them, but then I decided one day I would do something about them, so I bought the Palmer&#x27;s stretch mark cream for pregnant people - didn&#x27;t work.  This was recommended here so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where it kinda worked: my stretch marks were red.  This cream faded those stretch marks when I&#x27;m looking at myself in the mirror.  However, when I am looking down at my own body, I can still see them.  Weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where it didn&#x27;t work:  so the cream faded them, why am I saying it didn&#x27;t work?  Well now the scars are LIGHTER than my regular skin tone, so they&#x27;re still visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Results are immediate, I noticed a change within 3 days of using as directed (morning &amp; night).&lt;br /&gt;-Your skin feels a lot smoother and softer where you applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The pump bottle pumps out really small amounts at a time, if you&#x27;re covering a large area like I did, it required multiple pumps.  They really need to change this into a tube.&lt;br /&gt;-The smell - it&#x27;s not an bad scent, but it&#x27;s pretty strong.  I started applying the cream wearing disposable gloves, cause this thing sticks to your skin.  I noticed when I was applying it barehanded, even after washing my hands, I could still smell the scent of the cream on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for anyone with fresh scars, but for the people out there like me with decades old growth spurt scars, I would still recommend it.  I&#x27;d rather have light visible scars than the old more visible red ones I had.</li>
            <li> I have stubborn stretch marks on my back, thighs and butt. I have stretch marks because of puberty when growing. My stretch marks are very dark and difficult to go away. I started using this product in April. I noticed that my stretch marks were getting lighter by the third week! I have been using this product since then and now my stretch marks are almost gone. Another reason why this product is good is this product doesn&#x27;t break the bank and one bottle goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> I started using this product recently, and up till now it is working miracles; my stretch marks have faded significantly and are almost unnoticeable now. After using this product I was astonished by how quickly it worked and helped my stretch marks go away and made my self esteem boost as well. I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this product for about three months. After the first three weeks, you could totally see a significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;Although your stretch marks won&#x27;t disappear completely, you will actually see them getting lighter within a couple of days. (Please, don&#x27;t expect miracles).&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recomend DermaRESTORE</li>
            <li> I had a scar on the underside of my wrist from surgery. It was noticeable because it looked like I tried to take my life. I was very self conscious about it. DermaRESTORE significantly lightened the scar and it&#x27;s not as obvious.</li>
            <li> I am an avid dermaroller user and this cream goes great with derma rolling. I like to use this cream after I put on some vitamin C serum so that I can get my full results. My marks came from gaining weight too quickly since I was too lazy and tired from all the school work I got from college. This is great for someone with sensitive skin or skin allergies because they make sure to not include any allergens. I have a mix of new and old scars and this cream works great on both! This cream has been certified by FDA and GMP so you know that this is a quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dermarestore for 4 weeks now And tried so many brands before but this one is the best so far , I could see a big difference of the appearance of my stretch marks ..and I will continue to use it .&lt;br /&gt;I Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used several stretch marks product before and nothing worked. Since I have been using DermaRestore my Stretch marks are less visible and noticeable. I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> Have been using for a couple weeks and am beginning to see fading.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for a few months now when she bought it back in July. We can see that there has been a noticeable difference in her stretch marks and would expect them to be completely unnoticable in a few months time. After a few months of sticking with dermarestore I can say that I recommend this.</li>
            <li> i have so much stretch mark and few scars on my body and since i used this product it seems like a miracle now my stretch mark started to vanished and the old scar start to disappear! thanks Derma Restore! Im buying more :)</li>
            <li> i am 16 years old and i  know that adolescent stretch marks are common but this year i got them really bad on my inner thigh it kept getting worse and worse until i could only wear knee length dresses to hide them and they were a violent red. I did gain a bit of weight this year so i guess that could be why they kept getting worse. I  became desperate. I couldnt wear half the things in my closet without my stretch marks showing!!!! So i found this and i though why the hell not. I have to say it has helped a lot i&#x27;ve only been using it for a month and i just finished my first bottle my stretch marks are not as bright and are starting to fade. I put this on twice a day.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OK NOT REALLUY SEE MUCH DIFFERENT</li>
            <li> This product is great I had the pleasure of bumping into it at a friends house and she recommended it to me. And she was definitely right I feel like I could see the change in just a couple of weeks. Try it you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Did not work. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product since May and i have seen great improvement , i am 7 months pregnant and my stretchmarks have faded and are not noticeable. I would recommend this product to anyone and will definetly continue using it.</li>
            <li> I was most pleased with this product. After I had had my first child I was unable to find a produce that reduced the appearance of stretchmarks that was before dermrestore came along. I began seeing results immediately, each day the marks were lighting and it was truly life changing.</li>
            <li> I started to use this cream about three weeks ago on fresh stretch-marks on my belly just after having a baby and the stretch-marks look much lighter now( my uterus is still shrinking , so may be because my belly is getting smaller the stretch-marks are less noticeable) but I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use it! Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hypertrophic scar on my upper back, but I think is good for stretch-marks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product around 3 weeks ago for my wife as is currently 8 months pregnant with our child and has been concerned with the stretch-marks that she has gained recently. After a week of use we began to see a massive improvement with the stretch-marks around her stomach becoming a lot fainter, with some having disappeared completely. My wife is very happy with the results and it has given her a boost of confidence about her appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product, would recommend it to any couples who are having issues.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditions delivered as expected. 100% Recommended.</li>
            <li> This scar treatment worked pretty well&lt;br /&gt;There is definitely a difference on my scar</li>
            <li> Really good product heard a lot about it...plus some of my friends also tested it out and they results</li>
            <li> Awesome cream! It really works !</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are 7 yrs old.....I had pretty much given up hope...I gained 70 lbs during my pregnancy and am left with the terrible marks as proof. The lotion definitely smoothed my marks and firmed my skin  a bit. I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li> As a male using this, it works on most of stretch marks around the hips and arms but not so much on the.. gluteus maximus (booty). The stretch marks went away on my arms and legs but there are pink lines so it&#x27;s not that bad. My hips still has some marks. My booty still has stretch marks. Really hard to get rid of, probably because I sit all day in class/work.</li>
            <li> So, before i tried this product, i&#x27;ve been putting on different brands of stretch mark repair stuff on my belly for more than a year. From palmer&#x27;s to bio-oil, everything just seemed to work but never really helped me to get rid of those disgusting purple red lines.&lt;br /&gt;Before baby, my skin was very tight and smooth, which made me very vulnerable to rapid belly growth during my pregnancy. Stretch mark started while i was 7 month pregnant, and i started using Clarins and that was not helpful at all.&lt;br /&gt;I was quite giving up on those &amp;#34;worms&amp;#34; on the belly before i tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;It has only been a week since i started using DermaRESTORE, and the result has been obvious enough to surprise me. I use it twice daily as instructed, and apparently the color of the stretch marks is much lighter and skin gets smoother. Fine lines has started disappearing already.&lt;br /&gt;I love it! Thank you DermaRESTORE!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m seeing improvements yet and its been a few weeks already. Hopefully I will see improvements by the time I used all the product.</li>
            <li> Used according to directions, saw no results.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this stuff. I like that it is not super sticky like some of the other creams or ointments I have tried. I also like the convience of the spray bottle.The labeling and the cleanliness of the bottle gave me the impression that this is a quality product and it really does have the potential to do what it says it does. I have only been using it a couple of weeks so I can not tell you if it works as of yet but I will update as I continue to use it. I have high hope for this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a sample of this product during a promotion for testing and review.</li>
            <li> I see no difference/effect.</li>
            <li> Great skin cream, fantastic for scarring. Takes some time but gives a good amount and with repeated use, you will see the results!</li>
            <li> Seems to be working, scars lighter already</li>
            <li> The best stretch mark cream I have used! I started using this cream on April 14 2014. I had new ( 8-12 months old ) stretch marks on my things. They were deep and purple. I had been using fade cream on them but it didn&#x27;t help. For the first 2 weeks I used Dermarestore 3 times a day , then I tapered off to 2 times a day , to once a day. Eventually it got to the point of only using it about 4 times a week. I got really busy with summer stuff. When I do use it , I put it on as soon as I get out of the shower. I thought that maybe my pores being opened would help more ?? I have been using it for 3 months , less that directed, and the marks have faded a lot. I took pics when I started but my phones sd card got messed up and I lost them . My bf says they have lightened too. I still have some pink marks, but not purple. I think that if I had used it the right way the entire time the marks would be even lighter. I have very light skin and scar easily. I would recommend it . Just use it as often as it says to.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome to help clear the skin, get rid of marks and scars... I have been trying to get get rid of strechs, so far no changes, but for marks and scars it&#x27;s perfect :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product. I was really hoping it would work but my stretch marks didn&#x27;t fade at all, even after a month of use. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> Great product very inexpensive compared to others. After the birth of my second child I started using DermaRestore. I had several stretch marks on my belly a few on my side, I also applied it to a few old burn marks and childhood growth marks. In about a week I saw a significant difference. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I apply religiously as directed. My stretch marks have faded and my burn marks are almost gone. I&#x27;m loving this product so much I purchased one for my sister and friend. They both are also seeing great results</li>
            <li> My brother had some stretch marks on my leg that have been a problem for a few years when he was younger and I got him this. You could see the progress within a few months it had definitely made a good portion of the stretch marks fade away. This cream is amazing and even surprised me, I doubted it at first but seeing it with my own eyes has made believe how great this cream is.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple days now and I can already see my stretch marks fading away</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews decided to give this a try and.......did not see any difference for me, has a weird smell to it.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first but after just 4 weeks I can see results! Good product!! Happy about the purchase for a cheap price</li>
            <li> I had my last child almost 6 years ago and i had completly lost hope on getting rid of the stretch marks but i have been trying this product for about a month now and i have seen a whole lot of improvement in the visibility of my stretch marks :)</li>
            <li> This product has improved my old stretch marks a lot.  I have used many different products and this product has provided better results for me.</li>
            <li> Im seeing amazing results added with dermarolling and exfoliation. Its just not working as fast as i thought it would. But still working quickly</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Have only been using it for 2 weeks and can already see improvement. I play soccer so i got stretch marks on my calves and thighs, hips and butt as soon as I hit puberty around 12, I am now 17 and though my stretch marks have faded over time I was looking for something that would quicken the process! I apply it twice a day like it says an I&#x27;m already excited for next swim suit season!! It&#x27;s important to keep in mind that stretch marks are permenant skin damage and that any product you try is not going to completely erase them but this product seems like it will definitely come close!</li>
            <li> DermaRestore is a stretch mark and scar treatment lotion. I had twins and my stomach was like a road map. I have tried many different lotions, creams and serums, but none of them seemed to work. I figured after a while it was just hopeless and nothing was going to work. Its very embarrasing if you have a belly baring shirt or if you want to wear a bikini. I heard about the DermaRestore and i thought it certainly couldnt hurt. I was pleasantly suprised. I used it twice a day and after a few days i could see a lightening of the stretch marks. Every day the marks seem more faded  and it looks great. Thanks DermaRoller for taking my stretch marks away. I have much more confidence now.</li>
            <li> Its very good product. All the scars are becoming dull for the past one week of using.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other products but never had these kind of results. I would strongly recommend Derma Restore.</li>
            <li> After 5 pregnancies, I sort become accustomed to all of my &amp;#34;battle scars&amp;#34; a.k.a. stretch marks. I did the old cocoa butter lotion while pregnant because I was told that, that would reduce them, but to no avail they are there and there are many of them. So I was a little iffy trying anything to minimize them. DermaRESTORE is a product that you can apply directly on any marks you would like to minimize over the course of so many days, you should see a significant difference. So I did as the directions suggest and I do see a slight difference in coloring and size. Its not mind blowing, but it is definitely acceptable and I didn&#x27;t have any adverse reactions. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my stretch mark</li>
            <li> I am liking it thus far....using it in conjunction with dermal roller and exercise we shall see the end result in the future...Happy with the Product for now.</li>
            <li> After my rapid weight gain and the dramatic weight loss from my childhood to early adulthood, I was left with stretch mark on the side of my abdominal area. Living in California the weather is mostly sunny and warm and is never a bad time for the beach or a pool party, well it&#x27;s been a while since I could enjoy those events shirtless in a longtime. After 15 years and hundreds of dollars later on many products, with little to none results whatsoever, January 20 I discovered DermaRESTORE on Amazon I sew great reviews and said why not so I purchased this product and received it 2 days later.  I swear this was going to be my last result...! I was going to seek leaser treatment, but on January 23, 2015. I received my bottle of DermaRESTORE, I started to use it right away, after only one week of using this product I saw dramatic results, 11 days later, February 5th 2015 after using DermaRESTORE you won&#x27;t believe your eyes, I posted the results. DemaRESTORE is AMAZING and affordable.</li>
            <li> This item works really good would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews for this I decided to try it. I used it faithfully twice a day for weeks on my stretch marks and some scars of varying sizes and age and I noticed absolutely zero difference. So either all the other reviews are BS or I am the anomaly that this product did not work on.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet. I&#x27;m hoping with one more bottle I&#x27;ll see a difference. Either way I&#x27;ll be writing another review in 4 weeks. I&#x27;d hate to see other people waste money if it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m only trying another bottle because I want to use it the way it says. I&#x27;ve missed days or i would forget to use it in the morning or at night.  Maybe that&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t seen any results???</li>
            <li> wow!!! i am very heated up right now. if there is a comment i wanna leave is definitely this one!!!! people! please listen to all the negative comments! because it is true!!!!! i read the negative comments and even then i still ordered because i was so desperate to find something that would just work and it had so many good reviews too that i bought into that. when i first received the package, the package looked a little dusty and i opened it and the first thing i noticed as i went to apply was the odor!! it literally smelled like a bunch of chemicals. if i could compare it to anything i would say it smelled like nasty hairspray, literally. and on the bottle was a 1-800 number to call if i would like to receive another bottle for free and when i saw that, thats when i knew that indeed all the negative com mentors before me were right. i didnt even bother calling because i already knew what it would be about. anyways i only applied this product on twice. i couldnt go more than that. the odor was to strong and it lingered on my effect areas for a long time, so much that i was starting to give me a headache. i didnt even bother with it anymore. it was way to strong the chemical smell and after awhile it just wants to make you vomit. i highly do not recommend this product. i am a male with stretch marks and i too hate them but let me tell you that you are just wasting your money on this.</li>
            <li> I have really deep stretch marks all over my abdominal area due to pregnancy and have been undergoing fraxel and carboxy treatments and use a bunch of creams in conjunction to those treatments and decided to give this one a try as well since it had great reviews. To be honest i did not see much of a difference in texture but color wise they do blend in more with my skin tone. I still get a bunch of wrinkles if i bend over so i know that my stretch marks are still pretty deep and this cream did not help fill them out much. It is no more than just another cream but then again maybe it does take longer to see results.</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS had stretch marks since I can remember, especially on my hips and breasts, so I know that it&#x27;s really hard to find something that works exactly like it says it does and lives up to all the hype. DermaRESTORE does it all - without leaving marks or stains on your clothing. You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s working when you see your stretch marks turning from white to pink. And since I know how hard it is to be disappointed by yet another stretch mark product that doesn&#x27;t deliver, you should be reassured by the 100% money back satisfaction guarantee. There&#x27;s nothing to lose, except your ugly stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Great, fantastic recommended for friends. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few weeks but haven&#x27;t notice much of a change.</li>
            <li> no change at all. Waited 3 weeks to see a difference. And have up after that</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK FOR ME. MY STRETCH MARKS STILL BE NOTICE A LOT</li>
            <li> This a great cream, I love it.. I been use it for about 3 months now and I have used many others before with not success...I notice big improvement in how my skin looks now.... I honestly recomend this product a lot!!!!</li>
            <li> HANDS DOWN THE BEST PRODUCT IVE USED THUS FAR! If you are concerning purchasing well think not more buy it. Where did my stretch marks go? Derma restore took them away</li>
            <li> Im very impressed with the results I am seeing after a few weeks of using dermarestore stretchmark cream. Every night before bed. I rub in a small circular motion a dime size amount on each target area(including my upper thighs, buttocks, and belly and upper arms). I have realized that it absorbs better after a shower. It isnt sticky and icky feeling like other creams I have tried, it absorbs into my skin really well!! I battled with my weight right up until I had my daughter 10 years ago, so my stretch marks are abundant(its quite embaressing therefore I avoid clothing that shows problematic areas), so its beyond exciting to see them fading!! It has a very light smell which is a giant plus as well. If your looking results in real time, this is the product for you! Other ones ive tried show results really fast than stretch marks are visible again without use, or just dont work. This is definatly hope in a bottle!!! I will be wearing tube tops and booty shorts in no time!!!(lol totally joking...no midlife crisis here)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I recieved this stretch mark cream at discount for a HONEST review</li>
            <li> DermaRESTORE is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My stretch marks have faded significantly since I started using this product 4 weeks ago. I&#x27;ve tried other creams with much disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;I gained 50 pounds during pregnancy and ended up with lots of stretch marks but DermaRESTORE has already reduced the appearance of them, plus it moisturizes my skin at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend DermaRESTORE to everyone!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> I started using this product about a month ago it has dramatically changed the appearance of the stretch marks however I have had my stretch marks for years after having two children they aren&#x27;t high up my stomach there right on both hips where my waist line is anyway the stretch mark texture itself is pretty deep after using this product for about 4 weeks a month basically, I have noticed them getting a little lighter and less visable I&#x27;m sure that if I were to continue using the product they would be even less visable. It probably works better with a derma roller which is my next purchase when I get paid!</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks and for the longest time I searched and searched for a product that would be right for me and reduce the appearance of my marks. I stumbled upon DermaRESTORE and I have to say, I could not be happier. It does exactly what it says and I can already tell a difference in my stretch marks. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of their stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about trying this out after so many wrong turns and allergies but this one has truly worked for me. My skin rashes are gone along with my scabs, scars and thigh stretch marks.</li>
            <li> You have to be consistent and follow the directions properly instead of being whimsical with it. And the plus side is that i had no allergies with this. Skin rashes would crop up once in a while with other brands, but this was wonderful.</li>
            <li> After giving it a try, my wife is now truly happy with the amazing visible results after just a few months or so. After our first child she tried out a few and they did not work. Now she is finally sticking to this.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about 4 weeks and I have seen a different in my stretch mark ,after I used this dermarestore my dark stretch marks became&amp;#34;light&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;to see the results use it 2 times a day and don&#x27;t miss a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss alhashmi</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products but none seem to work. Until I found derma restore it instantly took the color out of my stretch marks and made me look 10 years younger. As far as a product can go derma store has gone I love ordering it and continually use it every day. There is nothing else that matches up or even comes close to derma restores results that I have personally seen.</li>
            <li> While there is a smoother appearance to the scar I purchased this product for, it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will remove it.</li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of problems with such products as my skin is very oily. This product doesn’t make it worse in that case. It doesn’t stain my clothes and there is no bad fishy smell either.</li>
            <li> No matter what others say, for me the results always matter. So this product here not only got rid of my scars but also removed the stretch marks</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for 3 weeks and we have seen great improvement on her stretch marks, I will definately buy some more.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any improvement after using it  for over a month.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work and has a weird scent. Go with urban therapy&#x27;s stretch mark prevention cream. Now that works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months and I must say it does work. I was a bit sceptical since I have tried so many different products but this one really does work and the price isn&#x27;t bad either. Has nice scent too.</li>
            <li> Hasnt been long enough to see results but I can see my scars slowly fading</li>
            <li> After being in an accident, I had received large scars. After countless research, I discovered lots of good reviews on this product so I decided to try this. After using this for a few months, my scars have substantially minimized and I have been extremely satisfied with the product. Overall, I would recommend all of you guys to try this product if you have scars or stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products to help with stretch marks/ scar treatment. I MUST say this product was the best i&#x27;ve ever used hands down! I have been using it for a little over two weeks now and I already notice a significant difference in my scars! They are fading away quick! I highly recommend this excellent product! 5/5</li>
            <li> This  product is truly amazing. I went through my entire pregnancy without one noticeable stretch mark. I was astounded due to the fact that I gained nearly 50 pounds and my angel was almost 9 pounds. However, after my delivery I begin to notice the dreadful things appearing as my stomach began to shrink back down. I was mortified. I tried everything imaginable and nothing seemed to even lightly fade their appearance. Then I came across this product on Amazon in a last ditched attempt to find something non-invasive or surgical because I have keloid skin and scar really bad with any type of surgery. Well, I&#x27;m here to tell you that this stuff really works!!! Not only have my stretch marks become A LOT less apparent but my actual skin texture is improving as well. This product combined with a daily regimen of dry skin brushing has drastically faded and reduced my stretch marks! I never take the time to write reviews but I just had to let everyone know how awesome DermaRestore is. I&#x27;ll be back to my bikinis for sure by next summer!</li>
            <li> This I believe is working, but it&#x27;s not quick. I use it with a shaper and it looks as if it is working.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all...I&#x27;m disappointed, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!!! I have try so many and this one is the best...love the product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> A must have product for stretchmark. It helped reduce the discoloration. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks; still waiting for results. . When I get any results I will be sure to share the  update.</li>
            <li> Beleive me, anything that takes SOME of the stretch marks away is a step in the right direction.  Thank you, I really appreciate this product. Looking forward to seeing less and less - stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Many people I know and I personally used this product and it worked better than expected .</li>
            <li> After my surgery I had a large scar on my back. After a few months of using this product the scar was substantially smaller! I recommend this to anyone interested in scar removal.</li>
            <li> At last after five years of after birth weight and stretch marks, I can finally wear my bikini and go public in two weeks. quite effective products I&#x27;m glad i&#x27;vegot my sexy back Whohooo!!!</li>
            <li> After having my baby, I got lots of stretch marks on my belly, worse night mare ever! Derma restore was recommended to me by a friend and am glad I tried it because all those stretch marks are now fading away gradually.  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT!!!! This is the only stretch mark cream that I have ever seen results with. Within 2 weeks from starting I saw noticeable results. I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for over a month now and some of my stretch marks are completely faded. Very happy with this cream and look forward to the future results.</li>
            <li> After using this magic concoction of pure goodness, my stretch marks from college have faded away into near nothingness. I got this as a gift from my coworker, who recommended this product to me. While this was a super awkward gift, I can&#x27;t thank my coworker enough for turning me onto this. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for something to help with my stretchmarks from being overweight. I have major stretch marks on my upper arms and now that I have lost weight they have not dissapeared. I started using this product and it helped dramatically! They almost dissapeared within a week anyone suffereing for the same thing should try this instantly!</li>
            <li> After having my first baby, stretch marks are what I dreaded. I only got a few, but they were  noticeably red. My husband purchased this for me. I must admit I was skeptical at first, but after using it for about a month (twice a day), it really worked! My strength marks have lighted up so much. I will definitely keep using it &amp; I definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Stretch marks have been a big problem for me since I was in high school. I wanted to find a product that worked fast and had no side effects. This product helped reduce the visible signs of my stretch marks dramatically.</li>
            <li> I saw all the reviews for this product, did alittle research and decided to try it out.. Well I received the product and there was a &amp;#34;free bottle&amp;#34; sticker on the package so i called the number on the sticker. They were closed so i sent an email. the woman wrote me back the next day and told me to try out the product, contact her after 4 weeks and let her know how the product was. Well a few weeks beyond the 4 weeks (honestly i didnt use it consistently) and i still never wrote her back BUT it has decreased SOME of my stretch marks. I&#x27;ve had 2 children (3 yrs old and 5 months old) and used everything under the sun.. the only thing that really hides them is getting my skin tanned, because im pale it shows bad. This product does work, you just have to stick to using it and little by little it does work. The smell isnt that bad either, i wish it was alittle better but its okay. I have sensitive skin and can use this without breaking out. I wouldnt recommend this to a pregnant woman only because i dont believe in putting anything on yourself or taking anything while pregnant. but thats just my opinion. I do wish it was alittle cheaper but hey something is better than nothing for working on all my stretchmarks! Good luck! everyones bodies are different so hopefully it works for you too!</li>
            <li> After months of use, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the appearance of my scars or stretch marks. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading reviews, I have been applying the product twice a day for 3 weeks and my stretch marks on belly have faded. I&#x27;ve tried some other products but did not seem to have these kind of results. Would buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> I so the effects after 2 weeks I should order it again</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple months ago after reading all the reviews. I had a child and was left with stretch marks all over my stomach so i used this 3 times a day and nothing happened. I saw no improvement not even some kind of fading. I would not recommend it to anyone and i also wont be buying anymore of it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product right away. I used this during and after my pregnancy. I had stretch marks appear during the pregnancy and that is when I decided to spend a little more money on a product. After 3 weeks of use, twice a day, I noticed a huge difference in my existing stretch mark. Now, after 7 months of use, they are still there but barely noticeable. I also exfoliate the area in the shower prior or applying the lotion for added improvement. My stretch Marks are smooth to the touch. They don&#x27;t look as intense as before. I feel as if it is honestly repairing damage to the skin. I will continue to use this, because I can see the difference.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I seen results in a matter of 10 days!  It is nice to see something that truly works.  I will continue to buy many bottles.</li>
            <li> Good product, still in the initial stages of visible change though.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all. Dont waste your money. I had strech mark during my pregnancy. I did not see a miracle for 6-7 months after my pregnancy. Its a ripe off</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for four weeks now and my skin feels amazing! I see improvements every day and I am loving that my stetch marks are disappearing.</li>
            <li> I have recently gave birth 4 months ago to a beautiful baby girl. This is my 2nd pregnancy so my skin stretched more than the first. I gained about 25 lbs and is still hoping to lose more soon. Aside from changing hormones, one thing I dislike post partum are stretch marks. I had really bad stretch marks and I think I do keep scars for that reason. I have tried using bio-oil, rose hip, pregnancy shea butter and I have not seen a lot of differences. The only thing that really works for me is Mederma but it breaks my bank. When I got this at a promotional rate to give opinion on the product, I am so ecstatic to test it out if it really works. I have tried it for two weeks now, I have seen some lines removed but not drastic change yet so I am giving a four star to it. It might change for few more weeks if I really get outstanding results. I am hoping to see more changes. Ask me  in few more weeks or Ill edit this page if I really recommend it. For now, I will leave it to I like it because it absorbs well and smells okay.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I used this for about three weeks now and I am getting really good results &#x3D;), I Highly recommend trying it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mother and she seems to think this is a great product. She has been looking at some similar items and this seems to be one of the products that are easier for her to use. I think she loves it so much she might start selling it. My mother doesn&#x27;t get wrapped up into the new products coming out or anything like that so when she gets excited about something it is time to take a notice.</li>
            <li> I used this after I had my son and it, improved the look of my stretch marks, new and old.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the scar I got from a little bike accident. After applying for 4 days, I saw how it lightens up. My scar is big and I just took my chance with this product, it turns out it is effective and cheap for its price.</li>
            <li> This works great! My sister purchased it &amp; loved it. So I decided to try it And I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> After my babies I had slight marks below my navel that I just wanted gone. I knew I would have to go the laser route in the end. Well, I tried this treatment that was like a cure in the bottle (as they all claim to be). OMG! Let me just say this stuff WORKS! I would love to add a photo but I don&#x27;t want to appear vain. I am rocking a belly shirt as I type this. Love love love love!!!!!</li>
            <li> After I had my son I had stretchmarks all over my stomach and on my thigh. I have tried everything to get rid of them. Some products have even made me break out with huge splotchy rashes. DermaRESTORE has actually faded the stretchmarks that were not fading and made my skin feel so soft. I really would recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> Derma restore is the key for your skin to gain back that elasticity and get rid of those embarrassing stretch marks.  And with this product, you will never have to worry about stretch marks again.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a month, twice a day and i have seen a difference in my stretch mark, they become lighter and haven&#x27;t gained any more. I will continue using it for best result!</li>
            <li> I started using this cream years ago. After first couple days of using it, I noticed it working. I continued using this cream daily for a few months and it took my major stretch mark away. this product is great that gave me the results where my stretch marks looks more flesh toned and a even and the depth seems to have improved as well, I&#x27;m gonna keep purchasing this. SO i THINK it is AWESOME! Great product and I highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> I have 9 kids! Yes...I gave birth to 9 babies! I had some stretch marks, mainly on my chest and thigh areas. I bought this, with not such high hopes of it working.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few weeks, I have noticed a BIG difference! The stretch marks are disappearing! I can not believe that after having 9 kids, I barely have any stretch marks at all. This smells goods, works good and absorbs rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on my 7 year old son who had appendicitis and has a  1 1/2 inch scar on his stomach. It is helping his scar to fade rather well. I am very impressed with this product. I would highly recommend this to anyone with stretch marks or scars.</li>
            <li> Great product! I was a bit skeptical to buy this but I thought I would give it a shot and I&#x27;ve seen results from using this in just a few days. Would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> After using several other products for my stretch marks nothing seemed to work .. I realized my stretch marks became lighter in color after using this specific product. I hope I get to see more results with time (: I love the smell &amp; how it&#x27;s not messy &amp; dries up quick. Definitely looking foward to my next bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a skinnier kind of gal, when I was diagnosed with diabetes the medications made me gain a ton of weight extremely fast! While not being the type to buy into things like this, I had some extra money and wanted to give it a shot. I was really shocked, within a few weeks the once angry red stretch marks seemed to fade. I&#x27;m really impressed with this product and would recommend it to anyone :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought my sister many products to treat her stretch marks but DermaRESTORE is the only one that produces amazing results!&lt;br /&gt;For only just a few weeks, stretch marks began to fade and became less noticeable. My sister was so thankful and grateful that I found this product. I&#x27;m very much happy for her! I highly recommend DermaRESTORE if you want a product that works!</li>
            <li> At first I had Stretch marks covering my stomach and sides. When I got DermaRestore they left within a few day and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I recommended it to my friend and she also lost her stretch marks. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs their stretchmarks removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DermaRESTORE for a little under four weeks now, and the results have been significant. The coloration became significantly lighter, going from a dark purple to a light pink. Plus, the total area of the scarring seems to be lessening. There are various options for dealing with stretch marks, and while I haven&#x27;t tested any others, I don&#x27;t plan on doing so - DermaRESTORE is doing a satisfactory enough job.    My only comment/mini-complaint is that when I first started using the lotion, it was a off-white color. Yet after a few days, the lotion became a darker color, more like a yellowish white (which is not atypical for lotions). While it does not seem to have affected the lotion&#x27;s effectiveness, it made me question for a couple of days whether the color change was normal.    This is a safe buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star because I ordered  on Thursday and it came on Friday. It smells good.I&#x27;ll see if it get the work done.</li>
            <li> This product is bs.. I regret wasting money on this.</li>
            <li> The product is very nice, i ended up getting quite a few stretch marks on my thighs from pregnancy and after using this cream for a few weeks I can already tell they are getting lighter. I would definitely recommend this cream to friends.</li>
            <li> It has been a month. Did work on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright... It doesn&#x27;t do much, really. All it does is make them softer and a tiny bit lighter. .</li>
            <li> Didnt see any effect on my wife</li>
            <li> Have some scars from surgery and this seems to be making them less noticeable over the last month.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. It has been the only product the showed any results. Ii believe everyone should try this product</li>
            <li> My husband bought it for me, but I would have ordered myself with the great reviews and all. Did not work for me at all. Used religiously every day for quite some time.  I guess reading most recent reviews does not work, especially if everybody tries to give it a second chance and goes for a free bottle. From now on I am starting with 1star reviews to see what people actually are unhappy about when they they post. In the hind sight (mine is always 20/20) should have gone for an acid treatment (vaguely remember my friend doing it years ago).</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT!  I bought this to use on my belly and thighs for stretch marks.  I use this in combination with a 1.5 mm derma roller and I LOVE the combined results.  I am definitely noticing super fast results and I am very excited about this treatment,</li>
            <li> After 2 big boys and 80 lbs gained I have the worse of the worse stretch marks from my belly down to my legs, yes my legs have stretch marks. I have used home remedies to other brand stretch mark creams and nothing seem to even lighten the marks. I tried the dermaRestore and omg! the marks are getting lighter! I can wear skirts and shorts without embarrassment!!! I am using it on my husband as well. He also gained the marks during my pregnancy with his sympathy pregnancy symptoms lol. He is excited to see the marks around his belly disappear as he loses weight.</li>
            <li> This product was very helpful my stretch marks are starting to get lighter in they are fading my marks away!!</li>
            <li> After using more than three months.... no help for the stretch mark as far as I can see....</li>
            <li> Its amazing I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of different products, this worked best!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a week and i can already see a difference!!</li>
            <li> It really works and good, fast result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and I see some noticeable different. I really Works!!!</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant I use a lot of oil for my skin. I really get fat, so after I had stresse How I can remove my stretch marks. That is product really perfect. It&#x27;s working to me. I would like recommend to people. I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful. My wife would not have gotten through her pregnancy without it. She got incredibly self conscious around the 4 month stage. As the stretch marks began to show, we tried just about everything to get rid of them. Insane home remedies like some strange cucumber paste, all the way up to medicated body wash. Finally a neighbor recommended DermaRESTORE, and it worked wonders! The stretch marks, disappeared in 2-3 days! This product is amazing! I will definitely recommend it to anyone expecting.</li>
            <li> Very much wishful thinking for any kind of these products to actually work, and this is no different. If it worked at all, it was BARELY, and that was after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> Bye bye stretch marks! Hello beautiful skin!</li>
            <li> I was searching for a good stretch mark product and I&#x27;m liking the results. I&#x27;m in my second pregnancy and still have some marks from my prior one. I also have 4 scars on my stomach from hernia surgeries. That said this product gives me everything I need for scar and stretch mark treatment. My husband even said he noticed a difference in the stretchmark coloration on my thighs. Definitely going to continue using this product throughout my pregnancy!</li>
            <li> The best stretch mark cream I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of these ugly things for four years now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product around a month ago for my partner as she has recently had our first child and has been struggling with the stretchmarks that she has gained through pregnancy, within the first two weeks, we saw massive improvements with the stretchmarks around her stomach, and they had become so much fainter. Me being a large guy myself, I also have stretchmarks on my shoulders, as my shoulders outgrew my skin, which makes this product even better as this means that both of us can reduce the amount of stretchmarks on our bodies and finally be happy with what we look like again! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> So ive been using this product for about 6 months on my stretch marks around my breast and hips and after 2 months I SAW A MAJOR DIFFERENCE and now after a little over 6 months my strech marks have pretty much vanished im gonna continue to use this product and recommend to all my friends!</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month, everyday after my shower. There are immediate results - seems just like a pigmented cream,  but I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant lightening. There&#x27;s also a peculiar scent to the product that isn&#x27;t overwhelming, but can linger.</li>
            <li> Been using for a couple of weeks, and I can definitely see a reduction in the redness of my post-pregnancy stretch marks. 4 stars instead of 5 just because of value. That little container goes fast!</li>
            <li> I am not sure yet, but most likely I do not see any effect. After month and a half I do not see any improvement and do not see how would happen either. For me it feels like hand cream. In order to see any results on the skin I expected something to exfoliate or anything that can dissolve the damaged skin and stimulate re-growing the one. This is absolutely some sort of hand cream. I am glad at least didn’t cause any rash or any skin abnormalities.</li>
            <li> After three months I&#x27;ve started to notice a difference.  I&#x27;ve had a burn scar on my arm for years, but this product still was able to make a difference.</li>
            <li> The best!!!! This totally cleared my red stretch marks in one one month!!! I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first then decided to be adventurous and buy and couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes after a few weeks of applying this product the marks from my pregnancy was gone! Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Its smooth, effective product go and get it</li>
            <li> it is a gift for my friends and she loves it</li>
            <li> I did as it said for a week and I noticed the stretch marks were turning more into the color of my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now and have about 1 1/2-2 ounces left and currently they&#x27;re smooth and bearly visible from a distance. I&#x27;ll be getting this again soon. I also got a sample libido supplement as a gift haha. Great shipping time too!</li>
            <li> Great product!  This is my second time using it, and I am happy with my results. I use the Derma Roller first then put on the DermaRestore for the best results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now. I noticed that my skin feels good after I put it on. I use this product twice a day on all of my stretch marks. Are my stretch marks fading...well I&#x27;m just  not sure. I&#x27;m also using dry brush technique as well as Microneedling every 7 days... So I&#x27;ve just begun this journey. I&#x27;m hopeful! I&#x27;ll update in a other 6 weeks!</li>
            <li> it works good, it wont desperate, but its good. I will buy it again because it is good :) :)</li>
            <li> I honestly have to say I like what I see. My overall skin texture is lighter and softer lines. I will continue to use this product. Hopefully  remember to use twice a day.</li>
            <li> All I can say is \\&quot;Score\\&quot; lol.. My wife has a scar that made her self conscious so I searched amazon for a product that could possibly help her out. Found Dermarestore when searching \\&quot;scar treatment for old scars\\&quot; on amazon and they were at the top with over 100 reviews. Gave it whirl and gave it to my wife to try out. She already is seeing a difference and loved the thoughtfulness of the gift along with the [[ASIN:B00ING1Q4M Phytoceramides Gluten Free - Skin Care Products For Women, 30 Day Supply, Anti Aging Beauty Product, Advanced with Vitamin A, C, D and E, Clinical Strength Ceramide-PCD Formula, Made From Rice, 30 Vegetarian Capsules, Works Great with Vitamin C Serum as...]] I got her as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Win win all the way around. Thanks dermasrestore</li>
            <li> This product is a working progress. I will continue to use it. I am seeing some results. I love it</li>
            <li> Works ok, but never received a free bottle like the label said on this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product right away.  I have noticed that my stretch Marks are smooth to the touch.  They do look as intense as before.  I feel as if it is honestly repairing damage to the skin.  I will continue to use this, because I can see the difference.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and it came really fast!!! I ordered on Saturday and I got it on that following Monday!!! I used the product the same day and tomorrow will be a week!!! I have three kids and I believe I got 3 sets of stretch marks on my stomach and thigh lol!!! I&#x27;m not giving up though I know things like this does take time and I have gave everything else a shot so why keep using this product!!! I will update again:) BE BLESSED!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier I&#x27;m not exactly where I want to be yet but I have DEFINITELY seen a lot of improvement. Will keep ordering for sure.  :-)</li>
            <li> I have developed really bad stretch marks from m pregnancy and my whole belly has turned dark. I started using this product a month back and have seen good progress so far. My stretch marks around my naval area seem to have lightened a bit. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> So far,so good.my marks are diminishing and my skin is supple,firm and soft.a product that actually keeps its promise.this is definitly a keeper.its silky and smooth with a pleasant smell.thank you.danielle couturier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DermaRestore for about a month now and it seems to be working! I&#x27;m a 22 year old male and have been applying this twice a day and it&#x27;s slowly fading. I&#x27;m going to continue using this product until I stop seeing results!</li>
            <li> Since I have used it I haven&#x27;t noticed any new marks. I am 8 months prego so I am happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> the results are evident even within 2-3 weeks, really helpful product.</li>
            <li> This does nothing to reduce any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Its working, slowly but its working...</li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m impressed.  What lady doesn&#x27;t want to look her best no matter what she is wearing?  There comes a time when we can wait for a miracle or we can do something about it.  Stretchmarks can be so depressing but they are a fact of life and we either deal with them or hide them.  It&#x27;s not just about looking good but feeling good about ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DermaRestore couldn&#x27;t be any easier to use and it is working wonderfully so far.  The more I use it, the more they fade.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more from it.</li>
            <li> I use to work out a lot during my days in highschool and that left me with many stretch marks on my arms and legs. In the past i tried a few creams and other things but had no results until this one. A friend of mine recently told me how good this product was and he was absoloutely right. I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and almost half of the stretch marks on my arms are gone. This product does wonders!</li>
            <li> Still got em, but they aren&#x27;t as noticeable I suppose. Meh.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for some, but it did not work for me. Still using out the bottle as directed, if that changes I will change my review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost two months. My scars are smoother, lighter and fading away. I think if I continue to use this product my scars on my  belly will be gone.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see a difference at all</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my belly. I had 3 children and now have  bad stretch marks. Its been slowly diminishing them enough I dont feel so embarrassed putting on my bathing suit.</li>
            <li> Hello everyone. I really must say this stuff works. And it didn&#x27;t take three or four years to write a review. I work a lot. But this cream really works. I am still using it on old scares. If you are having any doubts about buy this cream. Then you are missing out. I would one recommendation. Make sure you use a little of this cream on your finger tip. A little goes a long way. And I recommend that you use it three times a day. I did. Happy using</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s making my stretch marks a lot lighter and slowly disappear it really seems to be working</li>
            <li> My body was filled with stretch marks and I recently started to grow extremely tired of seeing my body like this. I decided to look around for solutions... Lo and behold, I found DermaRESTORE. This is extremely effective and does the job quickly. My body is slowly starting to look back to normal.</li>
            <li> I have used DermaRESTORE for 4 weeks now and I already see a big improvement in my skin. I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for a long time and now that I have found it I&#x27;m a happy camper if your looking for an amazing stretch mark therapy cream look no further it works and you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m imagining the subtle changes or if it actually does reduce the coloration of the marks. I think they look a little fainter but my marks are since childhood so they might be too old for this product to have any affect on them.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it for a long time but so far it&#x27;s acceptable</li>
            <li> But I feel a general sense of a change. I bought my 1st bottle last month and used it for nearly 3 weeks and it&#x27;s definitely made a difference on a scar I have on my stomach. I was a bit skeptical considering the low price but a success. Just patience is required to see how much more it can be done. I plan to buy another bottle or 2 when this current amount runs out and will def recommend to anyone who doubts it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It works!!! Have tried so many other products but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Works great! Significant difference from the time I started!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  I would definately recommend.</li>
            <li> used this derma cream right after my derma roller and am seeing great results a month later the color of my stretch marks have faded dramatically. would recommend this product to get rid of stretch marks for sure.</li>
            <li> I am about 34 weeks pregnant now. Been using to product in my last trimester and so far very pleased. This is my 3rd pregnancy and I wish they had this product with my prior pregnancies!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like stretch marks are is dependent on diet, genetics, hydration, and how much weight you can gain gradually, I gained excessively, 60lb with the first two and will probably be close to that with this one too.&lt;br /&gt;With my first pregnancy I used body shop cocoa butter, but as surface area started getting larger, I got more lazy to apply. I felt vey moisturized with the cocoa butter, but ended up with some stretch marks on my thighs and hips.  I went a few days overdue.&lt;br /&gt;Pregnancy number 2, I used same cocoa butter. Carried differently, more pointy and high. So I broke out with a few stretch makes on my belly button. It&#x27;s without noticing, the previous ones for the first would widen or elongate.&lt;br /&gt;Pregnancy number 3 now. I do not want any more stretch marks than I had. The old ones were already flesh colored so less noticeable. So I&#x27;m carrying low and pointy. My belly feels like it&#x27;s going to pop open and uncomfortable if I don&#x27;t apply anything, I&#x27;ve been using body shop cocoa butter and bio oil. It saves me from Discomfort. I bought mama mio bc  there are such rave reviews, but my friend due a week before me with her 1st has many stretch marks with this product. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of any difference with mama mio. I even invested in stivectin in my second trimester, but can&#x27;t tell if it worked, so I returned it to Costco. It cost too much for uncertain results. Lastly I got derma restore. I feel like my old stretch marks are not very visible now! I already got a second bottle bc I like this product. It does have rubbing alcohol smell when you first apply, but disappears to a light pleasant scent within seconds. Thin lotion, but goes a long way. I usually use this in combo with Bio oil, cocoa butter, or mama mio. This product works very well for healing told stretch marks. I&#x27;m curious to what it&#x27;s going to look like as my belly shrinks back. I do recommend this product for healing and prevention.etch marks. I&#x27;m curious to what it&#x27;s going to look like as my belly shrinks back. I do recommend this product for healing and prevention.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet... Pretty much just a typical lotion that costs a lot more. Waste of money</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for about 30 days so far and already noticeable results.  A lot of the other creams, ointments and sprays just don&#x27;t work. But this is a miracle worker for women after giving birth or losing a large amount of weight. So far no side-effects just positive results, will be ordering more once this runs out!</li>
            <li> There is not many words to describe how I feel after using this product for 2 weeks now. For a super-CHEAP price having access to this is awesome. It saved me a lot of bucks by not needing to go into surgery. BYE-BYE Scars.</li>
            <li> A friend gave this product to me to try on a scar I have.  After a few weeks of use, I have noticed a marked improvement. It smells pleasant, and I like the fact that it has natural essential oils and extracts in it.  It does not stain, is not greasy, and is easy to apply.  I definitely recommend using it!</li>
            <li> I have certainly seen an improvement. Not a big one, but my stretch marks are starting to fade and go away.</li>
            <li> I tried palmers and cocoa butter and they did nothing for me.. I searched and read every review for wvery product and this one caught my eye. I was very skeptical at first but around the third week I saw very noticeable fading in my stretch marks my fiance evan said he saw a difference to. I took a picture before and now and it is definitely working they have faded. You have to use it twice a day. I go to the bathroom sink rub it in and immediately wash my hands the smell isnt bath and body works but it gets the job done. And my skin is very smooth now. Im definitely telling everyone I know with stretch marks and this is an great gift for a babyshower. I will definitely buy more!!!!!!!!! Be patient and give it a try</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week but my scars have started to fade. I can really see a difference and am looking forward to getting rid of them.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I tried so many creams to lighten up my stretch marks, and so far this is the only cream that actually worked for me!!!</li>
            <li> DermaRestore is a good product. However it depends on how bad your stretches are!!! Mine weren&#x27;t dark but a 30. Day trial still wasn&#x27;t enough to vanish them! But the small ones did fade!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It has proven to fade a bit of some of my stretch marks, but not much. A bottle lasts for about 3-4 months for the lower back.</li>
            <li> I rly like this product. I have tried another stretch mark remover (baby mio) but that was a major fail and just left my skin oily and smelled horrible. This product actually showed results fast. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and my stretch marks have started to fade/gotten lighter in color. I rly like that this is a lotion not an oil. It comes out white and you just rub into the marks. It has a slight nail polish remover smell to it but it fades away quickly and it doesn&#x27;t stay on your clothes. I would def recommend this to other shoppers and I would buy it again for myself.</li>
            <li> One of my friend recommended me to use this for my stretch marks..Earlier i as little susceptible about  its results..But after using only for a week(applied twice daily) i could see the difference...the marks became lighter..have been using it for almost 12 days and i would say that anyone who wants to get rid of stretch marks should definitely use this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, and left my skin feeling oily. I already have oily skin, and after use it would cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve been pregnant with my first child I got stretch marks on my belly. I&#x27;ve been very sad, almost obsessed with searching a solution, how to remove them. I got many advices but I couldn&#x27;t decide who should I listen and what to do. My friend gave me advice to try with some cream and after I did a research, I decided to try DermaRESTORE. I&#x27;ve been very sceptical first few days, but later I realised my stretch marks became lighten and less visible. This made me more optimistic and now I&#x27;m still using it. My stretch marks are almost gone and this summer I&#x27;ll wear my bikinis again!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from a long time friend I have tried soooo many things to reduce the scars and I&#x27;m loving this ! DermaRESTORE - The #1 Clinically Proven Stretch Mark and Scar Treatment - 4oz Cream&lt;br /&gt;Consistency is key with anything you have to make sure you follow the directions and consistently use it in the right way not everyone can have such amazing results everyone&#x27;s skin is different so everyone cannot have the same result. I love the packaging I love the pump bottle it also has a nice sent there are also zero allergens which make this great for just about anyone but what I like most of all they have a satisfaction guaranteed or your money back you really can&#x27;t go wrong ! :)</li>
            <li> I am 29yrs old, have tan &amp; dry skin. The purpose of this was to help lighten a scar on my leg that has been there for a while. I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing seems to work. I used this for a few months and did not notice any drastic changes. BUT, this did help lighten stretch marks on my arm. And the smell is not very appealing. But, that&#x27;s not why you would purchase this item. For the scar I switched over to vitamin E oil and that worked out better for that.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this product would work that I even bought a second bottle after I ran out of the first one. I&#x27;ve tried this product for 4 months now and not even a slight difference! I have wide hips so even though I am a size 4 I still have stretch marks on my hips and this product didn&#x27;t help at all; I followed the directions twice a day and everything! Hope others have better experience than I did with this product.</li>
            <li> I finished 2 bottles and I saw no changes! I was so disappointed.I will definitely try another product or visit the dermo instead!</li>
            <li> Great product, wife is happy with it. She&#x27;s 3 months pregnant and she wanted to apply during her pregnancy and after.</li>
            <li> Nearly a month and no evidence of change</li>
            <li> I am liking the results. Scars were left on my face and since I started using this product, I have been noticing them fade away gradually. Thumb up!</li>
            <li> Did not do anything, super disappointed! I wish i could give 0 stars!</li>
            <li> This actually made my stretch marks a lot lighter then it was before, but so far after months of using it I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t erase my stretch marks completely. It works amazing on scars! I will still be using it on my stretch marks to see if they will disappear completely.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT.... SAW QUICK RESULT WITHIN FIRST 2 WEEKS BUT LONG WAY TO GO ...</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I will easily use this again and recommend it.  My marks aren&#x27;t completely gone but I am still hopeful with continued use.</li>
            <li> I never really rate items, but I just had to make an exception! I am almost done with the first bottle and I am going to get another one. The marks are so faint now! It&#x27;s unreal!</li>
            <li> I already got stretch mark after my pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that after using this cream my recent stretch marks were fading a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helped me to keep my  skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I noticed results quick with this product. I could see an improvement in color &amp; depth of stretch mark. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> very strong unpleasant scent---I do not like using it just because of the smell so it is hard to tell if it will work on stretch marks or not</li>
            <li> My fellow gentlemen...  we all know chicks dig scars, but scars that are really dark from deep/penetrating injuries of the past - not dug quite so much. (Though the women may never mention it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backstory:  I managed last summer to slam my leg into the top of a staple sticking out a picnic table bench at night and made a good 3mm or so dent that bled fairly well, not good times.  Healed just fine, but left a nasty dark mark on my shin - since I did not receive immediate medical attention, this resulted in a deep scab.  (Medxpress did clear me when I went there a couple days later, probably shouldn&#x27;t had stitches.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punchline:  After about a week of using this once a day at night (and when I remember in the morning), I can tell already this scar has gone from dark brown looking to now a lighter and smaller redish brown mark.  Hopefully soon it will be red, pink and then almost normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for light scar tissue at this point, but effects are DEFINITELY noticeable for dark scar tissue.  Highly recommend, I don&#x27;t like spending more than $20 for something that seems like fancy lotion, but it&#x27;s not, this is a true repairing product.  Yes, it smells at first for a couple minutes, but it&#x27;s small price to pay to not gross out your lady.  Bottle is small, but you don&#x27;t need a lot for coverage, after about 10 uses, I still have what feels like 3/4 of the bottle left.  One bottle for a couple small marks will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had a big problem with stretch marks after I gave birth to my daughters. I have them on my lower back, legs, and belly. Bathing suits are not  a welcome thought in my mind when I see my labor of love marks.  So when the chance came to review this product I was really excited. The first time I received the product in the mail, there were traces of cream that were outside the container so I had to contact amazon and they sent a replacement right away.  When I started using it, I had to smell it first. It has a light fragrance that I like. It comes in a squirt bottle so it is nice because you just squirt how much you want. It recommends to apply it twice a day but I have d.one it only in the morning. I know it will take a while to see the difference but Im sure that this will if not eradicate all the lines it will lighten them</li>
            <li> Good product. Takes time but my stretch marks seem to be fading! Nice size bottle too.</li>
            <li> I can see somewhat of a difference in the strech marks. They&#x27;re not noticable as they once were!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have used it for about a month and I have seen a significant change on my hips and thighs stretchmarks. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and it seems to be helping with the fading of my stretch marks.  I have them all around my belly button from my pregnancy and this product has made them lighter and less &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34;.  I will continue to use it and hope that it continues to reduce their appearance!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!! I originally bought it at the store and it worked so well I had to wright  a review! It takes a while so don&#x27;t expect it to just magically disappear.&lt;br /&gt;But yea it does work! I still have some strech marks so I will buy more!!! But yes&lt;br /&gt;it does work!!!! :) :) :) :) :)</li>
            <li> I used this as directed. I didn&#x27;t want to write a negative review but I feel like people should be aware of this. I&#x27;m 22 with no children I weigh 125 but recently started herring stretch marks on my thighs. Only thing it does it makes skin soft. I exfoliate daily and use the product twice daily. I went through a bottle and a half and got nothing but soft skin. I thought it would work because it smells like chemicals but maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m African American and my skin needs something different. I&#x27;m very disappointed due to such high reviews. I feel like the free one bottle thing is just a scam. I&#x27;m not going bother getting rid of them anymore.</li>
            <li> I just lov it so a amazing cream a really help me</li>
            <li> Makes your skin itchy, then you start shedding. Worked amazingly well on a new scar.</li>
            <li> Most of my life(since a weight loss at age 12) I have been so embarrassed by my stretch marks that they negatively impacted my life in too many ways to mention.  I hated seeing them and,over the years, have tried many expensive so called solutions, with no results.  I have just finished two bottles(over the course of two months) of this &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; and now I find myself looking daily at these stretch marks as I watch them disappear!  I&#x27;ll probably be a customer for a LONG time since they are on my arms, legs, abdomen, etc...but I&#x27;m one happy customer.  This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work. Save your money and don&#x27;t buy it. I was surprised by how many good reviews it got. Those people must be paid to say it works.</li>
            <li> I just started using this DermaRESTORE cream.  I even put it on my face! It does not irritate or burn or leave my skin red. I put it on my chest &amp; on an icky scar on my hand. I know it&#x27;s too soon to see results &amp; maybe it&#x27;s wishful thinking but these areas seem to be softer! It is moisturizing. I did receive this cream at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. Thank You!</li>
            <li> All of these products are usually mediocre at best but DermaRESTORE is absolutely wonderful! After the first use I already started seeing a difference. Now a week later they are almost completely faded. Amazing! Thank you so much DermaRESTORE for everything! Will be back again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting to at least make my stretch marks less visible. It&#x27;s apparent that I can&#x27;t fully get rid of them. This product didn&#x27;t do anything. i used it for months. No change in my before and after photos. May work for others, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. I&#x27;m a dark brown African American, so this could be why it didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using the DermaRESTORE - Stretch Mark and Scar Treatment - The Latest in Skin Repair, for 6 weeks and so far it seems it&#x27;s working for me. I would recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I just started using this lotion initially bought it for stretch marks I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference on them just yet more time is needed but I&#x27;ve also been using it for two small cut I had and its been helping it a great deal in healing faster and also fading the wound...for stretch marks its just to soon to tell but for meeting my needs jst about half way I give it 3 strs..if I notice a difference in my stretch marks soon I will post a new review....tick... tock...</li>
            <li> Seeing mild effects. Using it for the last 5 months, but only once a day (opposed to what is recommended). The marks have reduced in shades, but not disappeared, but I am purchasing it again, since I think other creams are costly and do not have satisfying reviews for the cost.</li>
            <li> When I apply the lotion twice a day (am and pm), my stretch marks look a lot better.  If I skip a day or two, they seem to be more pronounced.  Overall, the lotion has made my skin more supple, and my stretch marks are more faded.</li>
            <li> I got this cream to see if it work with the stretch marks after about three weeks I saw the difference in significantly diminished stretch marks on my stomach. I also used it on my son&#x27;s scar he fell off his bike and scraped his knees and it was really scarring badly after a few weeks you can see the different his knees are not that scarred as before</li>
            <li> First thing about stretch mark I have heard is that they don&#x27;t really go away but they fade. I have used lot of stretch mark products (Palmer Cocoa Butter, Earth Mama etc) but they did not do anything to me. Guess I had the toughest ones. I got this product as (my second) baby shower gift. I did not use it during pregnancy but used it after and I did notice the marks to fade after weeks. I am hoping that they will eventually become very light to be noticeable. After that I have gifted this products to my other pregnant friends.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Been noticing stretch marks lighter and skin smoother...Worth the try!!!</li>
            <li> I have just started using this lotion and I love it! The smell is pleasant and not a strong smell like I&#x27;ve had before in other brands. It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see results but I am optimistic!</li>
            <li> Really havent seen any improvement, its just a ordinary lotion for me. I think i&#x27;ll try a dermaroller next</li>
            <li> I have been using for couple of weeks but I don&#x27;t know yet. Smell is not bad.</li>
            <li> This product is true, it works wonders on stretch marks and burn marks. It took a few weeks for my daughter to see results on her stretch marks. We would recommend to anyone trying to clear up stretch marks</li>
            <li> not as miraculous as other reviews</li>
            <li> It has a nice odor! I have been using this for about a month now.. would like to continue using cause it works better than cocoa butter you get at the stores. My stretch marks are not little &amp; are all over my stomach but have slightly faded. I&#x27;m sure it will take more time for them to fade but this would of been great to have bought &amp; used during my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I have been using DERMA RESTORE for a month now. The strech marks on my thighs have lightened significantly! And I am starting to see a difference on my stomach! DERMA RESTORE is easy to apply and has a light nice smell to it. So after a shower i apply it and feels like lotion.  I am excited to see what the rest of this trail does for me!</li>
            <li> It helped me remove my stretch marks. Also it is not as expensive as other products in the market place.</li>
            <li> Been using for a month now, not a drastic change but definite improvement. incision scar if fading to a faint brownish tone</li>
            <li> i been using this product for almost two months and nothing changes! don&#x27;t buy this you&#x27; re just wasting your money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month. I&#x27;ve noticed small improvements on certain areas. I will continue to use this product, and hopefully I will achieve the results I want.</li>
            <li> Use cream only two weeks, but I like it, is well absorbed and has a pleasant smell. good quality-price ratio</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product. I used it for 3 months and I found some good changes. It has a good smell as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and can really see an improvement! I&#x27;ve tried other products like Trilastin but nothing has worked as well as this. I will definitely continue to order.</li>
            <li> After having my first child I had used a cream which smelled horrible and took 4 months to relieve me of the marks.&lt;br /&gt;I used DermaRestore  after I had my second kid; it does not smell bad and has relieved me  of the marks in less than 2 months.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It got rid of my stretch marks! So happy!</li>
            <li> Product is great. Redness is already going away after using it twice a day for a week. Never giving up!</li>
            <li> It has a very strong chemical smell and I don&#x27;t see any difference. I also used in combination with a demo roller.</li>
            <li> My wife has recently had a baby girl, but my wife had very bad stretch marks. She would hate going to the swimming pool or the beach because she didn&#x27;t want people to see her stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;So as her husband I started looking at ways of treating her stretch marks, I have tried lots of different products and remides. When I bought this one I expected it to be the same old rubbish product that says it fixes stretch marks! But it did!&lt;br /&gt;My wife was thrilled that she had got ridden of her stretch marks, and so was I. We could now go to the beach and the swimming pool which out her being scared and shy.&lt;br /&gt;I would definatly recommend this product to anyone suffering from stretch marks</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle.  It does not work overnight.  My stretchmarks are 20 years old.  They are about 65% gone!!!  And I have only been using once a day with a roller derm</li>
            <li> I think you need to use more than 1 bottle to see difference but for the new stretch marks is good! For the old ones it needs time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed my stretch marks have lightened. I would say this has worked better for me than previous products I have used and I have tried everything.I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Can&#x27;t wait to recommend it to all my friends!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in the 4+ weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> cheap price, delivery is also good.&lt;br /&gt;but since received this product, I used to put on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t works</li>
            <li> Shannie Shi:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very efficient product!</li>
            <li> I received this very fast, i have started to use it but still no results. Hopefully i can see some very soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now. I took a picture of my stomach before beginning this product so I could see if it was working. Nothing. I showed the before and after pictures to a few friends and no one could distinguish the before and after pictures from one another.</li>
            <li> You can see a difference if you keep up with it.</li>
            <li> My wife found this for our daughter. After 4 children, she was very self conscious about stretch marks. She had also lost all of the weight she had put on over that time too. She followed the directions to the letter and starting seeing results in a few weeks. They did not miraculously disappear over night, but each week they get a little better. Be persistent and patient and the results will come.</li>
            <li> Writing this review to help out anybody who has acne scars or stretch marks like i do, because this product works very well. A couple weeks back i noticed that i was beginning to get acne scars, so i got this product. Arrived right on time, no delays whatsoever. After applying it twice a day since i got it, i&#x27;ve noticed that my scars don&#x27;t look so prominent anymore. I would definitely recommend this to anybody who needs skin treatment.</li>
            <li> Very good skin cream. It does take time but it works like a charm, gets rid of scars and any blemishes. Works great and you get amazing results at the end. Use as advised as always and apply a little daily.</li>
            <li> I went through a period a few months back where I gained a lot of weight really fast and as a result I received some ugly stretch marks. This was the first product that I tried to remove them and I chose right! This got rid of all the stretch marks that I got! I am very satisfied with DermaRestore and recommend to all with stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I tried this product after having no success with any other stretch mark removers. I&#x27;ve lost a good amount of weight and beefed up but I had fairly visible stretch marks on my shoulders and thighs. So after trying this, and giving it some time, I noticed a difference. After using it for a while my stretch marks had faded significantly. Great product overall. I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to get rid of those pesky stretch marks.</li>
            <li> When my wife had 2 children she had horrible stretch marks and trust me they were bad but that is nature. Either way she did not the marks so I went and bought her this. I must say that this does help hide the stretch marks! My wife is very happy about the results and I am happy that she is happy!</li>
            <li> Usually, I&#x27;m very skeptical about reviews, but I decided to give this product a chance anyways! It&#x27;s unbelievable but after just 4 days using dermatestore, I saw old stretch marks, that already were tuning black, start to fade. And, I don&#x27;t even use it all the recommended times a day! I love this product and hope to keep seeing great results after a few weeks more.</li>
            <li> I honestly have to say this worked wonders for my wife. After having her first child, she had stretch marks on her stomach and it really upset her. We went to professional dermatologists and their treatment was extremely out of our budget and we couldn&#x27;t sacrifice that amount of cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a Google search for stretch mark removal and after sifting through many scam websites, I finally found myself on this Amazon listing. I bought it straight away after seeing all those positive reviews and the low price of $28!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks, the stretch marks had improved drastically and my wife&#x27;s self esteem was restored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone trying to remove stretch marks after pregnancy</li>
            <li> This product is awesome I bought it for my daughter about 4 weeks ago and she already seen her skin improve dramatically, her skin is now 80% more clearer. It is like magic in a bottle. I recommend DermaRestore 100% .</li>
            <li> Great product! I purchased this at Walmart a few months ago and it works just like the reviews state. As long as you follow the instructions right for the cream, it works great! I&#x27;ve had my scars pretty much vanish from my arms and legs from small injuries. Not 100% on big scars, but for my medium-small ones, it works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for four weeks and although my stretch marks are still apparent I saw lightening in the color of the marks, and a decrease in size of the marks. I will continue to use this product because I truly believe it works in improving the overall quality of skin.</li>
            <li> Good so far! I really like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and you really do start to see a difference. It&#x27;s not drastic but you can definitely tell the stretchmarks have faded. I usually wait about 3 months for a real noticeable change, and this product has given me a hopeful outlook.</li>
            <li> So, I got this for a friend (who was extremely self conscious about her stretch marks after have kids) and this worked amazingly. She no is able to go out and where a bikini as if she never had kids.</li>
            <li> Greatly soften the appearance of a five years old scar and slowly fading it away.  Have tried many different scar creams in the past and DermaRESTORE is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> This product is the best product I have ever used. Amazing.The price is the cheapest on the market and shows more results then any other scare treatment product. I used this while pregnant with my son, I haven&#x27;t seen anything like this ever! I have seen 0 stretch marks, I can personally say this is the best product, I recommended this to several friends I knew who were pregnant and were astounded with the results! No one does it better then DermaRESTORE!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some weeks now, my skin is much smoother and I can see that the stretch marks have diminished some. This product cost less than those expensive stretch mark and scarring products but since I have been using it, I can see that it  really does work.  I really like that it absorbs well into the skin without a greasy feel. I will continue to use this product to see what my end result will be</li>
            <li> Dermarestore Stretch Mark and Scar Treatment really has significant and beneficial effects on the skin.  After trying countless products by trial and error, I have found this product to be the best because it really does work.  Its ingredients are impressive and effective in getting rid of those unsightly skin blemishes, and the price tag attached to it is very reasonable. All in all, I recommend this product to those who want to ensure that they are using a product with clinically-tested components.</li>
            <li> I saw results within two weeks of using this and it&#x27;s far less expensive than other creams I&#x27;ve purchased. This cream is just as good as the expensive ones and sometimes better than some. I plan to continue using it, I combined it with the use of a dermaroller I purchased that seems to help also. the trick is finding time/remembering to use it twice a day!</li>
            <li> I’m already down with my second bottle of this product. The best thing is you can hardly tell that you even had stretch marks in the very first place. Just wonderful!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product i have been using for two weeks now and has worked better then anything i have used so far and has faded all my stretch marks most you cant see now. great product</li>
            <li> I started using this cream when I started getting stretch marks when I was 8 months pregnant, I am now one week postpartum and barley show signs of any stretch marks, I look forward to continuing using this product and seeing more results!!!</li>
            <li> Pregnancy and becoming a mother can be expecting but the stretch marks after pregnancy are annoying. So if you are fed up of the stretch marks just order this and you can get rid of them.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  But for me this gave me a red itchy rash. And I never gets any kind of reaction to products so I don&#x27;t know what was in the dermaRESTORE that made me react that way.  And I&#x27;m not seeing any results.</li>
            <li> after having my first child i had ugly stretch marks and wouldnt dare show my stomach again but after using this product for only a few weeks now my stretch  marks are really clearing and i love it. derma restore did wonders for me. i&#x27;ve already recommended it to a friend and i&#x27;m able to show her my stomach as proof</li>
            <li> There is no way for me to tell whether this worked or not because you are given such a small bottle that you can&#x27;t really use it enough to tell. If you have many stretchmarks over a wider area, you should make a $30 investment in a good dermaroller, like Shessentials dermaroller, and forget spending this much money on a tiny amount of cream. Dermarolling produced an absolute miracle that took my breath away. You can check out my reviews on the two brands of dermarollers I used.    As for this product, I feel it&#x27;s too over-priced, and you don&#x27;t get enough to use the product long enough over a larger area. I can&#x27;t say in my six applications that this worked or not.    If you do decide to try it, still consider the dermaroller, which can help augment whatever else you do. Just look at reviews on Amazon and see how many people are raving about this.    I hope this help you recover your self-esteem and not feel that you have only creams to rely on for the hopes of a better appearance. :o)</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are definitely fading which is a miracle because I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING and nothing seemed to work.  DermaRESTORE has finally been my miracle cream.  The only thing I noticed is it takes a long time to see results (at least for me) so don&#x27;t give up!  I have yet to see if they will continue to fade but here is hoping!</li>
            <li> I give this product 5stars due to my satisfaction. I bought this product for my daughter who is a bit over weight, and with just 1week of usage the stretchmarks are fading. She feels more secure and comfortable. I definitely recommend this awesome and effective product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DermaRESTORE for about six weeks now and I can already tell a difference in my stretch marks! They are much less noticeable and I feel a lot more confident! Definitely give this a shot!</li>
            <li> Had a bad Oder and did I noticed no change after 4 weeks of use. It was such a waste of money .</li>
            <li> I am using it for 4 weeks and my stretch marks have faded significantly. I tried several other products in past,  but never got these kind of significant results. I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Seen so much improvement..and will recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a year now and it definitely works! I had some pretty bad stretch marks from so rapid weight gain and I lost it all and now I was to embarrassed to take my shirt off at pools or the beach, I was pretty upset about it because those two things are my favorite things to do and I didn&#x27;t want to feel self conscious about myself doing them. So before last summer I gave this product a shot in hopes It would go away. They didn&#x27;t go away by the summer but now almost a year later and not even using the product daily the deep red marks I had are completely fading and only getting better. I know that they will always some what be there but this was good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me....</li>
            <li> Helpful- decreased how visible marks look</li>
            <li> A friend of mine was impressed about this treatment and recommended it to me. I have been using this therapy for a month now on some stretch marks I have on my hips, I am very happy with its results, the marks are less visible and my skin looks smoother. I love it!</li>
            <li> Getting rid of stretch marks is something most mothers have thought about. Perhaps you have even tried other products out there on the market without results. If either of these describes you, then this product is perfect for you. Because it gets results that you can see with your own eyes. There is no question that the ingredients in DermaRESTORE are assembled with your healthy skin in mind. Give it a try and see for yourself!</li>
            <li> Good and as described by the seller.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto 👌 100%</li>
            <li> Significant reduction in appearance of stretch marks after 2 months of use. Excited to see what will happen after 4 more months.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly. I have been used it for 3 months and I see a great improvement on my stretch marks. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I had some really bad stretch marks on my back prior to applying this. Amazingly, after a month, all of my stretch marks have magically disappeared and I&#x27;m feeling very confident on going to the beach and pool now. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has pregnancy marks or just regular marks.</li>
            <li> Stretch marks after pregnancy are awful, I&#x27;ve been using this cream daily, after shower and I&#x27;ve seen they are not the pronounced than before, hope not to see them soon!..</li>
            <li> This product really works. Great for scars and stretch marks. I had a scar on my arm and this totally got rid of it. Easy to use!! I love this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This has reduced the appearance of my stretch marks after using for only two weeks. It also moisturizes my skin, leaving me nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I can say with absolute and complete honesty that DermaRESTORE worked miracles in decreasing the appearance of dark spots on my legs.  I now wear shorts and dresses with confidence instead of fretting about stares from people because of the dark marks on my legs.  I am now an official member of the Sexy Legs Club ya&#x27;ll lol !</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results of this product. It makes my scars look less noticeable. It is a MUST HAVE for those who want to get rid of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This actually healed my unsightly scars that always have made me self-conscious. Thank you!</li>
            <li> honestly i didnt use but i bought for my gf and she really loved this one!! so.. this is awesome</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream. I was very skeptical at first as I have tried other stretch mark creams in the past...but after one month of continuos use, I am seeing results!  My stretch marks have become noticeably less visible. They are not gone completely, but come on, this isn&#x27;t magic! I would recommend this to anyone and I will definitely be buying another bottle!</li>
            <li> Very effective product! I was very pleasantly surprised! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I got this product for my wife, becuase she was really insecure about her stretch marks.  We had tried other products but none of them seemed to work on her.  Luckily I found DermaRESTORE.  This stuff really works.  Her stretch marks were all but gone within a week or two of treatment.</li>
            <li> Bobby, my wife used it faithfully twice a day for weeks on my stretch marks and some scars of varying sizes and age and I noticed absolutely zero difference. So either all the other reviews are BS or I am the anomaly that this product did not work on.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wary, go ahead with DermaRESTORE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the derma restore for 4 weeks now &amp; I&#x27;ve seen improvement with my strech marks. I also been using derma roller which I&#x27;m sure helps also... So far so good!!!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh! I don’t know where to begin. This product has been the answer to my prayers. After struggling with my weight for years, I was finally able to get rid of the pounds but was left behind with the stretch marks. This product not only reduced the marks but they have practically disappeared. I feel like myself again when wearing certain clothes. This is definitely a confidence booster.</li>
            <li> No results after 5 weeks and the smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> I have been going to the gym religiously for about 25 years and due to some quick growth I have sustained some stretch marks. I used this for the past 2 months and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I recommend it:)</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy and I am trying to be conscious about a lot thing related to the pregnancy; including stretch marks. I did some research as on what to use to prevent stretch marks and I came across this product. I read many good reviews on the product; therefore, I decided to give it a try. I have been applying the DermaRESTORE mainly once every two days (after showering). I am 5 months pregnant at this point and so far I have not  noticed any stretch mark. I am very happy with the product and plan to place a new order as I am running out of my first battle.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! My husband had a bad scar under his chin from surgery, it was raised and firm. He noticed a difference after a few weeks of using DermaRESTORE so I decided to try it for my saggy jawline. I too have noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Definitely see results if used as stated.</li>
            <li> I lost a lot of weight recently and had a lot of unsightly stretch marks on my stomach. I&#x27;ve been using this product a month and see great improvement!  This product works well.</li>
            <li> I purposely always chose swim suits that covered a good part of my thighs, because I absolutely hated the stretch marks on my inner thighs. After a few, expensive so called solutions, I was left with my low self esteem and an even lower bank balance. A co-worker recommended this and even showed me a before and after of it on her arms, and I was amazed and hopeful, I was definitely not let down. Excited to rock the beaches this summer in my little bikini, no more hiding my thighs!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medium toned african American woman. I recently gained some weight and some strech marks formed on the back of my thighs. I started using it July 11, it&#x27;s august 11th nightly now and so far the discoloration from the strech marks are completly gone . They used to be this deep purple color. Now they&#x27;re light ish pink to my skin time and hardly noticeable. The risen skin is still there but I&#x27;m still waiting for more results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using the cream on too of diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> After losing a lot of weight I&#x27;ve started having white stretch marks around my body. It was kinda disgusting. After one month using the cream the stretch marks are not gone, but they are almost not noticable.</li>
            <li> I purchased and started using this product at the end of April 2014. Ive lost about 50 lbs since last year and had some stretch marks on my chest and stomach. After 4 months of using the product as directed; im happy with the results that I have had thus far. My stretch marks have lightened up and the skin is much softer. I would recommend this product to others looking for a way to treat their stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now, and although I don&#x27;t use it twice a day as I&#x27;m supposed to, I can already see improvement! My stretch marks have not yet improved in texture, but the color is becoming more like the surrounding skin tone, so they are less visible. I have tried a lot of products in the past, but this is the first product that has done anything worth mentioning! I should also mention that when I bought the bottle, there was a little sticker saying to call for a free bottle. After contacting them, I was told to leave a review in order to receive the free bottle. I would usually be wary of companies that &#x27;bribes&#x27; their customers, but given how great this product is in my opinion, I don&#x27;t mind and actually command them for their good marketing strategy! lol. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every single day, twice a day for over two months now. I have not seen a difference and I am disappointed because the high ratings were promising. My stretch marks aren&#x27;t even that bad so I would think it would at least fade is slight, nope, nada.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! I had really bad stretch marks on my thighs bottom &amp; stomach after birth they are a lot lighter &amp; my skin is so firm &amp; smooth!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now and so far I have to say that it&#x27;s &#x27;okay&#x27;. It comes in a small bottle with a pump. The pump does not release alot of product, so you have to pump a few times to get a good amount. I usually pump 3x and apply that amount to one area. You need to rub into the skin in circular motions and takes a little while to absorb. The product does not leave my skin feeling soft or smooth, but it&#x27;s not greasy or thick either. After one week of use, I have not seen any results yet but will update review and rating if I do see results.</li>
            <li> I am posting this as my initial review for this product because I am excited. Stretch marks have been my best friend since I am in grade school as a fat kid. And the sudden weight loss now worst because of pregnancy. I have been told that you cannot 100% remove stretch marks so I&#x27;m sorry but that&#x27;s true. HOWEVER you can lighten it to where it won&#x27;t be as visible as when it&#x27;s fresh. This DermaRestore gave me hope. It calms down my bulging stretch marks. It&#x27;s still there but I can see improvement. I apply it every morning and before I go to bed. I also give it a little massage and let it absorb before I lay down or put clothes on. I like the bottle that it comes with. It really matters for me that it works even for my old stretch marks. I will definitely write an update after a month of using this. But for now I have positive hope for this. I am so blessed to be able to purchase this for a markdown price in return for my objective and equitable review.</li>
            <li> I have stretch mark from rapid growth I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4weeks there is slight change but still I have to use it for more 4weeks to make the change it says it will do ,will write another review after more 4 weeks .</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about trying this one, but after reading some rave reviews I decided to give it a chance. Many of my scars and stretch marks have faded and are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> works pretty well...there is a scent but its not overbearing and it quickly fades once the cream is applied.</li>
            <li> I seems to be fading a couple areas on my stomach from my child.</li>
            <li> It worked better than some other treatments I&#x27;ve tried. I noticed changes in my stretch marks after a few days, and after a month, I can say that this product cleared about sixty-five percent of my skin.</li>
            <li> Do I think it works?  Few things...I use it once a day and not twice a day. I am exactly 6 months post baby and started using at 3 months. I see a difference in texture. It&#x27;s not wrinkly skin anymore , it is smoothing out.  I still see the discoloration so I am confident that with more exfoliation and application for this producy and almond oil and cocoa butter the STREch marks and the discoloration will slowly diminish. Doesn&#x27;t hurt to try but it&#x27;s not a miracle cream by any means.</li>
            <li> Totally loved it! my face feels and looks so much better. The cream does not have an unpleasant odor which helps enjoy the process that much better.</li>
            <li> This cream is really great it is far better than any other in the market. It does not have a bad odor like some of the other skin creams out there.</li>
            <li> i had a scar below my chin from many years and it was quite visible, i used this cream for 2-3 months and the scar is getting diminished day by day. I am really very happy with the result of this product and i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After loosing some weight recently I was trying to find something to make my skin look and feel tighter and BINGO I found it.  This has worked great.  Within a few weeks I began to notice great results.  I will soon be reordering it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This cream does work but you must remember that treating stretch marks is a slow process</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing. It does what it says. I&#x27;ve been using this for around 3 months and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference from before. Don&#x27;t get your hopes up though because it will NOT remove all your scars, but more than enough to make a significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and I suggest that others can do the same.</li>
            <li> I recently gained a substantial amount of weight due to a thyroid condition.  Unfortunately I got stretch marks on my stomach and hips :(  This product not only helped fade the stretch marks but made my skin softer than it&#x27;s ever been!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Do not purchase !!</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is amazing! After giving birth to 3 girls my body was in need of some serious help!! Stretch marks on my entire stomach and down both legs.. So happy I finally found a product that has dramatically reduce the appearance of my stretch marks. I was not sure how it was going to work after trying numerous other products and treatments I thought there was no hope until I found DermaRESTORE. Highly Recommend this for any amount of stretch marks or scars.</li>
            <li> I have had stretch marks for years and tried everything to get rid of them. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month and I&#x27;ve had improvement on some of the smaller ones so far.. Hoping the bigger ones will be fading soon!!</li>
            <li> This is great and is working on &amp;#34;cabbage patch&amp;#34; my scar from my heart surgery. My wife already used one bottle for minor stretch mark blemishes and it worked for her so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. What was a deep reddish scar has lighted and looks much better. I recommend this to all my friends and family</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a year on newly stretchmarks and now they&#x27;re still there and harder to take out. Waste of my money. Don&#x27;t buy, it&#x27;s a scam!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 4 weeks and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement on my stretch mark. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy another bottle. This product is one of the product in the market</li>
            <li> This is just a rip off. I ordered the product,  then also seen it was listed as one of the top 10 BEST stretch mark products online. I&#x27;m not entirely sure any of these products deserve to be called such things. For one thing the product appears bigger in the picture. Secondly so many of these five star ratings are so these people could receive a FREE bottle. People will say anything, and shame on them. I haven&#x27;t seen anything this product claims to do. I paid the money to receive  over priced coco butter in a tiny bottle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent $200 in creams to help rid me of my stretch marks. But have yet to find anything that actually does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please save your money &amp; get the surgery.&lt;br /&gt;RIP OFF just like the rest.</li>
            <li> It seems thick, has a funny smell but I have used for 6 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference yet so the jury is still out on this</li>
            <li> I have a lot of stretch marks due to fast muscle growth in the past. I searched for a good solution for months and i found this product works best against stretch marks. I use it for a few weeks now and the stretch marks seem to disappear, not completely yet, but you can see huge a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for only a month on old stretch mark and scars from surgery that happen with my last pregnancy August 2012. There is a little notice of the marks getting lighter. So I will try it for a least two months and then write another review.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to help reduce some stretch marks around the buttocks area. I thought it was a good idea before they got even worse but after constant and regular use there was no signs of improvement. Unfortunately the only effect it did was make my skin softer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 5 months. The first month that I used it, it was already effective. You do have to be consistent with it for it to be really effective. Even when you&#x27;re not, it still works but you will have a slower progress. I&#x27;m still using this and my stretch marks have cleared up so much. They got worse over the years and using this overtime really helped my skin with old stretch marks AND scars less visible! I buy this every month and it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped with stretchmarks and a little with scarring.. looking forward to my next bottle :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to purchase this I read and heard it works miracles! I just dont want them to show too much. I&#x27;ve had stretch marks every since I was in Jr. High School.</li>
            <li> Been using for a couple months and I don&#x27;t see too many results yet at this point. Hopefully I will see more soon.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I truly like it just but I do see a few of my stretch marks disappearing and a couple of scars are blending but I understand that you have to have patience to see the results from previous weight gain</li>
            <li> Been using it for 2 months with no results whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. After a month of use, my old and new stretch marks and scars are nearly gone. Results are different for everyone. I have sensitive skin and it the ingredients didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Little dab does the trick. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I purchased DermaRESTORE after trying two bottles of mederma, and not noticing any significant improvement. After looking for an alternative I stumbled upon DermaRESTORE and read the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two bottles of DermaRESTORE as well and decided to try a derma roller. After using the product I&#x27;ve noticed a better improvement in the appearance of my stretch marks (Arms / love handles) I&#x27;m not sure if the derma roller was the reason but I&#x27;m on to my second bottle now and going to derma tool for the second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that when I used mederma I got a compliment from a girl that I smelled good, and with DermaRESTORE I personally think the smell is a little dry / medicated. other then that good product 4/5 because of smell.</li>
            <li> Wish the price was lower, and it kinda smelled funky.</li>
            <li> This product really works believe me I&#x27;m 13 and I have dark stretch marks around my waist and hips area and now there fading away I&#x27;m planning on buying a second bottle soon!</li>
            <li> I feel so good about my skin, now that I can wear my two pieces again. Some will say that it works super fast. So if it does take some time do not give up hope.</li>
            <li> i still haven&#x27;t seen any results yet and ive been trying it for a month but i do also miss some days so we will see</li>
            <li> My entire tummy looked so messy after I gained a few pounds and it has been a pleasure with this product as all my marks are now gone. I’m going to come back for my second bottle for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to see amazing results... I have to order another bottle... My marks are starting to fade away .. It takes time.. Just have to be patient and dedicated to this... !! I just wish it worked faster!!</li>
            <li> This item is so great it&#x27;s really working for my skin im on to my second bottle</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for a month now, 2-3 times a day and i haven&#x27;t been able to see any results yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months and the progress has been slow but I can definitely see a difference. I noticed that when I use the product twice a day as indicated my skin would itch, so I started using the cream only at nighttime and this stopped the itching.  Overall it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Does not work. It&#x27;s not FDA approval.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to get rid of my stretch marks for the longest and this is the product! My marks are slowly disappearing now!</li>
            <li> It is a good product. Helps with stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;The product and company are great. Would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I have recently lost weight and this product has assisted me greatly in getting rid of the stretch marks.  I am looking forward to being bikini ready in a few months.</li>
            <li> My wife used DermaRestore after her last pregnancy and was so impressed with the results that I ended up using it myself!  I lost a lot of weight in a short amount of time after a lapband operation, and I ended up with a lot of embarassing stretch marks even though I felt so much better about my weight loss.  I used DermaRestore for the same regimen that my wife did and, what can I say?  It totally did the trick?  I noticed a huge difference within 4 days, and my wife stopped kidding me about using it after the first week, she was as amazed as I was.  This is a product that works, for men, women, anyone!</li>
            <li> After my motorcycle accident, I was severely scarred up. I was embarrassed around friends, family, and especially my fiance. She saw how upset I was, so she purchased this product for me. I really didn&#x27;t want to use it, thinking I&#x27;d be scarred for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that I took her advice and used the product. My scars aren&#x27;t completely gone, but I feel normal again. I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> This is the healthiest my skin has ever been!</li>
            <li> brilliant product worked wonders on my scarred skin&lt;br /&gt;tried many products before but they never seemed to work&lt;br /&gt;great for stretch marks caused through preganancy and growth</li>
