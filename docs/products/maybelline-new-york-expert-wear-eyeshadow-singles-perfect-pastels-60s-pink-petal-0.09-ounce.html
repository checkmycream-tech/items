            <li>so I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li>very good benefit/price ratio excellent deal good product.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the quality.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no shimmer, which is great for me.</li>
            <li>This is a good color for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>This has the perfect amount of blush tone to be flattering and enough coverage to be the perfect &amp;#34;blending&amp;#34; shade when I finish my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Design and quality are great, so far very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this eye shadow!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It is much more &amp;#34;peach&amp;#34; than what the picture would indicate and it takes a fair bit to cover an eye lid</li>
            <li>This color is excellent for those of us with fair skin and blue eyes.</li>
            <li>Hope they keep making light pinks!</li>
            <li>I found it here :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotta buy multiples before they stop making it :)</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness, it is a must have color for light skin.</li>
            <li>Again, lighter than expected but very nice.</li>
            <li>Nice and light, perfect for a base color on your lids, or in a pinch you could even use it as a blush.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;WOW!!!&amp;#34; kind of color, but it&#x27;s definitely one that you should have in your make up kit.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Nice light pink color that looks natural and can be applied alone.  </li>
            <li>but I like it pretty well.</li>
            <li>Get exactly what you expect</li>
            <li>Nothing WOW about the color but nice for daily wear.</li>
            <li>I love the color as a base coat on my very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several Maybelline eye shadows and the case always breaks easily and early.</li>
            <li>The color is even more pale than it appears.  </li>
            <li>This Maybelline New York Expert Wear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 years old and need a matte shadow.</li>
            <li>pastel pink is a really pretty color.</li>
            <li>I actually use it as a blusher for a natural color that gives my complexion a &#x27;lift&#x27; without screaming.</li>
            <li>I have pale skin, and most of the lighter colors out there either make me look dead</li>
            <li>Beautiful base color for eye shadow</li>

            <li> When Maybelline stopped making this color, I almost panicked!  I have pale skin, and most of the lighter colors out there either make me look dead or like I fell in dirt.  This has the perfect amount of blush tone to be flattering and enough coverage to be the perfect &amp;#34;blending&amp;#34; shade when I finish my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> This Maybelline New York Expert Wear pastel pink is a really pretty color. Nice and light, perfect for a base color on your lids, or in a pinch you could even use it as a blush.

            <li> to powdery for me by itself. I put cream base shimmer under this then it sorta pops. very pale color</li>
            <li> Product was not as described or as pictured, very disappointing, I have no use for it.</li>
            <li> This color is excellent for those of us with fair skin and blue eyes. I use it as the base color and I always get compliments on my makeup. When my local store stopped carrying it, I rushed online and found it here. Thank goodness, it is a must have color for light skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this eye shadow! Stores actually discontinued it so I&#x27;m very happy I found it here :)</li>
            <li> I love the color as a base coat on my very fair skin. It&#x27;s very subtle, which is what I want in a base layer. There&#x27;s no shimmer, which is great for me. It lasts for a long time, it&#x27;s not too hard, not too soft. The problem is the case. I&#x27;ve had several Maybelline eye shadows and the case always breaks easily and early.</li>
            <li> Beautiful base color for eye shadow</li>
            <li> very good benefit/price ratio excellent deal good product. Design and quality are great, so far very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> idk y this product is discontinued!! I love it! its a perfect base color I can wear everyday! I&#x27;ve gotta buy multiples before they stop making it :)</li>
