            <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as viva la juicy, but the scent is VERY similar!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they sell it in the VS near me in this size, but i&#x27;m sure if they did it would have cost more than it did on here.</li>
            <li>I wanted a sample of it just to really know the scent to it .i</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the bottle was undamaged.</li>

            <li>my new fave!</li>
            <li>I wish the spray was a little more stronger and lasted longer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 1 of my favorite perfumes, but you can go right into Victorias secret and buy the same exact size for $15</li>
            <li>I bought it because it&#x27;s said to smell like viva la juicy and that is completely correct!</li>

            <li> This is my favorite perfume! I had the full size bottle from the VS store and when I ran out I happily bought this small travel size here. The bottle functioned perfectly and it lasted a pretty long time (about 2 months). If you can&#x27;t get to a VS store, don&#x27;t want to order off their website and pay shipping, or just want a lower price, buy this here!</li>

            <li> Shipping was fast and the bottle was undamaged.</li>
            <li> This is a very similar to viva la juicy but I honestly think it smells better, I get lots of compliments when I wear it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! This is the perfect scent for bringing out your inner Sexy Little Tease ;) 100% recommended to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, lasts a long time, each time I wear it I get complimented on how good I smell. I&#x27;ve always been p partial to Victoria&#x27;s Secret vanilla but now I&#x27;m partial to this scent-my new fave! Smells sexy, sweet and inviting.</li>
            <li> When I first got the perfume, it smelled watered down, I was just about to send it back...but then I used it one more time (I also applied lotion to my skin) and wow did it smell good! Amazing Body Mist! I do reccomend this. Its a bit pricey for the size bottle it comes in though. (Atleast I think so)</li>
            <li> I love it and I got it fast. I very happy.</li>
            <li> fast service, nice scent</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my daughter so she would have a small bottle to carry in her purse.  She loved it; however, I was disappointed that the cap was so loose and that it was wrapped in bubble wrap which allowed the bottle to leak slightly.  Would have preferred that it was in a box and that the cap was tighter.  Made it seem like a used product.  As I said she was happy, so that is what mattered to me.</li>
            <li> I took a risk and went by the reviewers recommendations and purchased the Tease spray. I own a few Victoria Secret colognes and love them all. I was very satisfied as was my boyfriend who said it was a fantastic smell.</li>
            <li> Love this body spray . One of my favorites. Light pretty scent . Not over powering</li>
            <li> I did not come with enboltorio but also as shown in the photo !!!</li>
            <li> I recently started to purchase Victorias Secret items and this is one of my top 5 favorites. The scent lingers for a good part of the day. It is light and very feminine. I purchased the smaller bottle to keep in my purse for on the go. But I do also own a full size bottle and a rollerball. I would definitely recommend this scent to anyone. I did not purchase from amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought this scent not knowing how it smells. It reminds me of my trip to vegas which makes me love this spray even more!! I wish the spray was a little more stronger and lasted longer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 1 of my favorite perfumes, but you can go right into Victorias secret and buy the same exact size for $15</li>
            <li> Definitely an amazing smell. I bought it because it&#x27;s said to smell like viva la juicy and that is completely correct! It&#x27;s not as strong as viva la juicy, but the scent is VERY similar!</li>
            <li> I like it, I just wish it could have been in a box.</li>
            <li> The scent is very sexy and fresh nice size bottle does seem to last longer i will be buying another one soon</li>
