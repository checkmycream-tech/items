            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li> I first purchased this product in 2011 at 225lbs.  I used it at least 5 days per week, massaging it in vigorously and sleeping in the arm wraps.  I found that It works with daily use and if you throw in a few toning exercises 2 times a week, you get really good results.  I have gotten down to 162lbs and my arms better match my body.  They are slimmer and more toned.  This product works to reduce saggy triceps.  You will have to use it for at least 2 weeks to see noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I had lipo and an arm lift in June. I came across the arm wrap while trying to find something to wear for compression. I gave it a try and cannot say enough about how it helped me. I gave my Dr. the product information to help others. Although I did not use it in the conventional way, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Works well on mobilizing excess arm fat; tightening of the skin is less dramatic.  It may be hard on the skin if you have any skin senstivity.  My daughter&#x27;s skin remains very red after using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used this daily and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long, maybe a month, but my triceps are starting to look better. I will continue to use this until product is gone and then will decide if its worth ordering more.</li>
            <li> To preface this-I am highly skeptical about beauty aids that promise results with no work and bad genes. I have a \\&quot;swimmers physique\\&quot; and am very self-conscious about my upper body size. I hardly ever buy this kind of stuff, but the idea of compression makes sense to me. I tried ace bandages, which irritate my skin and stick. I even tried to make my own sleeves, but they didn&#x27;t stay up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+So I have been using this for a week and to my surprise I am noticing visible results. My skin seems firmer and my arms seem more \\&quot;compact\\&quot;. They stay on pretty well and give medium compression for someone with large arms. If you wear them under a tee shirt it just looks like you have a pink shirt underneath. I have sensitive skin and have had no rash or itching or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I am not sure if the lotion makes any difference, but it is heavily perfumed and I can&#x27;t use it when I am sleeping or exercising. I may try it with a non-scented lotion. I got the impression on another website there were a few sets of \\&quot;sleeves\\&quot; but there are only 2-one for each arm. As far as quality, one elastic thread had broken and there is a small hole after washing them once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be effective, though not without flaws. Hopefully this will help you decide whether or not to purchase one of the \\&quot;Velform\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money. I followed the directions and never saw a change in the size of my arms.</li>
            <li> Not to happy about it sleeve not big enough</li>
            <li> Im not sure this product really does what it says, but it does smell nice and leave skin soft. I don&#x27;t have big arms and I saw no difference. I can by lotion to smell nice.</li>
            <li> I have this product for a month now,and it really does work. My arms have gone down alot with rare exercise, when i used this product. I even used it on my back and by back slim down. How crazy is that?????  I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this religiously, maybe three times a week, didn&#x27;t see any result but skin has gotten smoother. It&#x27;s a little bit pricy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I actually saw a slight improvement right away.  I do see a slight improvement in the crepe-like, sagging of my upper arms.  I just recently lost 40 lbs, and am 56 years old and needed something to make my arms look better.  The liquid has a really nice smell to it.  I will continue to use this!</li>
            <li> If used the way the package directs, this really works.  This is the second time I have purchased this product.</li>
            <li> ok but did not firm up my arms</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and really don&#x27;t see much difference in appearance.  I&#x27;ll continue using it until it is completely gone but not mauch positive result.</li>
            <li> So far so good...I am thin and have fairly thin arms but they are not tight and even with weight training I am unhappy with the lose skin on the underside.  I have been wearing these for about a week and I already see a huge improvement!  I wear the arm wraps all day even though it is only suggested for 30 minutes.  I wear them under my normal clothing and they are not too tight or uncomfortable to keep on and in fact it has been chilly so they are perfectly fine under normal clothing.  When I remove them, my arms appear firmer and the skin looks very smooth.  I allow the lotion to completely dry before applying the arm wraps.  Make sure the skin feels dry to the touch and not tacky before putting them on.  I will continue to use these and hope to repurchase just the gel.</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t work at all.My arms still looked the same plus the wrap didn&#x27;t fix. This product was the waste of money</li>
            <li> I have faithfully used this product and have seen NO results !</li>
            <li> Still testing, but I believe it has taken about 1 1/2 inches off of my wings.</li>
            <li> LoL! Yes I bought it, and no it didn&#x27;t do a thing. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and have seen no change. I think those who see a change are probably already working on this trouble area apart from the wraps. Hate is too strong a rating, so I&#x27;ll just say I don&#x27;t like it, and hey more power to you if it works for you!</li>
            <li> This does tighten things up! I have lost 100 pounds and have fluctuated ever since. I have always had trouble with the skin on my upper arms-- this really helped! I am twenty three years old so I do have more elasticity in my skin. I can wear my jackets more comfortably now!</li>
            <li> I purchased the arm wraps and were a bit skeptical ... but it actually works -- I used the arm wraps and notived a difference almost right away - I use the arm wraps twice a day for an hour instead of just for 30 mins .. It works so far ! I am excited about -- I think will try the stomach wrap next  - its worth  &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> it made me itch on the areas I applied .&lt;br /&gt;maybe, ok to other people but did not agree with me.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to a play it several times just to see if it was a coincidence, but each time it made my arm itch.&lt;br /&gt;I wasted my money, not sure about the return policy.</li>
            <li> I have giant sausage arms, these little wraps didn&#x27;t fit around my arms without cutting into my circulation.  You&#x27;d be just as good using anti cellulite cream with some baby oil and Saran wrap with a heating pad.</li>
            <li> If I would use it , it would probably work.  It was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of body wraps but this didn&#x27;t impress me. The wraps feel nice on and the product smells great but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve been using it off an on for three years. It&#x27;s great for maintenance and that last minute prep before an event.</li>
            <li> event though you dont see dramatic results for weeks.  your skin feel much softer  and smoother.  i am now using them more ofeten</li>
            <li> Tried this longer than it was recommended, it did not work at all.  It did have a plesant smell, but that&#x27;s all it did.</li>
            <li> If  you want to waiste your money buy this item. doesnt work.  The wraps are to lose dont tie up &amp; the wrapping lotion doesnt work</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff it does what it says it was going to do.i will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  Couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. Not for me.</li>
            <li> I did it for the whole month and haven&#x27;t seen any results.....&lt;br /&gt;Still using it thou but don&#x27;t expect to see anything just want to use it all up.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This did not firm my arms! I don&#x27;t even have much loose skin and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I give this product a 1 because of the beautiful scent it has. Other than that I haven&#x27;t seen any changes. I can honestly say my skin at least feels a bit softer but this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t know if this will work for me. Really I was expecting so much more especially for the price they sell. However they work better than the night wrap.</li>
            <li> I like the product. Don&#x27;t normally rate a product but this product does work. I see slimmer arms. If I&#x27;d use it every night like its required I think it would work better. But overall it does work.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m using it. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I think this product is a scam!  I should of known it was too good to be true!  It does not work at all.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 1 week and can already see tighter skin on my upper arms. I have been using the gel and wearing the arm wraps all night long while sleeping. It smells really nice too.</li>
