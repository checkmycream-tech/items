            <li>I really liked this bag however...</li>
            <li>Nice item..</li>
            <li>It was great for holding everything for 25 days abroad and it fit perfectly in my 24 inch suitcase, opened fully, laying flat just in case TSA needed to have a look.</li>
            <li>I feel this would be better for jewelry rather than cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Each compartment is separated with a zipper that runs along the top which prevents any leakage.  </li>
            <li>So glad to have a pocket for my toothbrush and paste and clippers.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Was hoping I would be able to fit shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Fabulous bag for all your toiletries.  </li>
            <li>This is a cheap unit - you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t fit some eyeliners and lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Took it on a trip and it made getting ready for events so easy.</li>
            <li>I liked it enough to purchase another one for one of my kids.</li>
            <li>it has just the right amount of pockets and zippers and holds all my necessityies.</li>
            <li>I turned out kind of small but worked out OK....</li>
            <li>It helped me to organize my makeup and is always ready to travel with me!</li>
            <li>This is large but foldable.  </li>
            <li>Very flimsy zipper so went from 3 stars to 1 star.</li>
            <li>the first time I used it the little loop on the top which you put the hook through, broke.  </li>
            <li>It will be going into the trash before I waste any more space on it for the return trip home.  </li>
            <li>I ordered three different travel bags and kept this one because of it&#x27;s large size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tenderly handling this thing ever since and so far, the two remaining zippers are holding, but it&#x27;s  a miracle.  </li>
            <li>The side opposite of the compartments is a cheap satin material which is difficult to keep clean looking.</li>

            <li> I really liked this bag however...the first time I used it the little loop on the top which you put the hook through, broke.  All of the compartments are great, all of the zippers work great.  I liked it enough to purchase another one for one of my kids.</li>
            <li> I turned out kind of small but worked out OK....for some reason they keep deleting this comment but I think others should know that I did have issues with the zippers and I didn&#x27;t overfill the pouches some of them would not stay zipped. IE: Once zipped they would re-open.  I feel this would be better for jewelry rather than cosmetics.</li>
            <li> My item was about 21&amp;#34;x 10&#x27; .  i was very disappointed because  l liked the layout. I just needed the space that was advertised.</li>
            <li> Nice item.. Thank you</li>
            <li> very nice for jewelry or makeup while traveling or at home</li>
            <li> i did not like the position of the pouches, am a frecuent traveler and i can not find any purpose to the pouches maybe this was designed for women??</li>
            <li> Fabulous bag for all your toiletries.  Each compartment is separated with a zipper that runs along the top which prevents any leakage.  Sturdy construction that folds flat in your suitcase</li>
            <li> This is large but foldable.  We recently used it on. Month-long trip to Asia. We loaded up all the OTC meds we might need--we had them and did not need to find a pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I ordered three different travel bags and kept this one because of it&#x27;s large size.  It was great for holding everything for 25 days abroad and it fit perfectly in my 24 inch suitcase, opened fully, laying flat just in case TSA needed to have a look. Ideal! Or so I thought.  One of the zippers broke two days after I got to Italy.  A second broke a week later.  I&#x27;ve been tenderly handling this thing ever since and so far, the two remaining zippers are holding, but it&#x27;s  a miracle.  This is a cheap unit - you get what you pay for.  It will be going into the trash before I waste any more space on it for the return trip home.  Skip this one.</li>
            <li> Did not meet expectations at all.  Pockets too small, craftsmanship poor.</li>
            <li> The side opposite of the compartments is a cheap satin material which is difficult to keep clean looking. The bottom has frayed strings and isn&#x27;t seen correctly. The compartments do not expand so it was difficult to even fill with travel-sized items (one zipper has already broke). I could see where this might suffice for jewelry (but not large jewelry). Doesn&#x27;t cut it as a cosmetic/travel organizer. It&#x27;s something you&#x27;d expect to find at a Dollar Store. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t fit some eyeliners and lipsticks. Was hoping I would be able to fit shampoo and conditioner. Nope. Fills up with only one item in each pocket. Zipper broke on bag. Very flimsy zipper so went from 3 stars to 1 star.</li>
            <li> Bought this YEME cosmetic hanging travel bag/organizer. Took it on a trip and it made getting ready for events so easy. Holds a lot and I always knew where every little item was. So glad to have a pocket for my toothbrush and paste and clippers. The zippers worked great and it folded up for travel. May get one for my partner and maybe some for gifts.</li>
            <li> Great bag! It helped me to organize my makeup and is always ready to travel with me!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my cruise and vacation.  Love it...it has just the right amount of pockets and zippers and holds all my necessityies.</li>
            <li> Great for packing and organizing g jewelry for a trip</li>
            <li> great piece of travel gear</li>
            <li> Saves counter room since you can hang it up.  The hanger pushes inside for travel.</li>
