            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed and feeling confident that continuing to use the rest of the bottle should take care of my stretch mark problem.  </li>
            <li>The lotion has a pleasant smell/very nuetral.</li>
            <li>The marks have been fading and the scent is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Great product, it works great and has helped me feel better about myself.</li>
            <li>I have used the cream on my butt and hips, which have been there for years, and I haven&#x27;t had results as good as on my arms.</li>
            <li>&lt;i bought this because I saw good reviews about it.</li>
            <li>The price is affordable and the quantity is fair for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I will also be using a derma roller which I heard was really good for stretch marks, I will keep updating on here</li>
            <li>I see man good reviews on ths product, maybe its me</li>
            <li>Good Stuff.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t heard of it until I searched on Amazon for a good stretch mark</li>
            <li>I read a lot of good reviews and thought I could give it a shot.</li>
            <li>, I loved putting it on</li>
            <li>A WORD TO THE WISE...</li>
            <li>It smells good and feels good...</li>
            <li>A good moisturizer</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it had a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li>so it provides some good moisture to the skin.</li>
            <li>It has really good ingredients in it too.  </li>
            <li>This would be a good moisturizer to PREVENT but does nothing to reduce or erase.</li>
            <li>and i loved it.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, so far great results!</li>
            <li>works really great:)</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t tell you how satisfied and happy</li>
            <li>Was very pleased with the product and the price.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this product once mine runs out!</li>
            <li>, then at night I went to apply more, and they were faded already!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad they started selling this on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I am going to keep using this product for sure!</li>
            <li>I just need to be patient for much better results!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it worked well on everyone else though!</li>
            <li>It has become my favorite!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d try it anyways since it&#x27;s so cheap, and I am so happy I did.</li>
            <li>Now, my stretch marks aren&#x27;t invisible (yet), but for two weeks time, the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>but I had to say something about this amazing cream I just bought.  </li>
            <li>The smell is light and attractive, and it makes my skin feel like silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also it works well as a nice moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I saw no difference at all.</li>
            <li>and they are fading quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>ive tried hundreds of products of every kind.</li>
            <li>a nice mellow sent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to use it for a couple more months to give it a fair analysis.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still effective afterwards.</li>
            <li>I dont understand how this has so many good reviews</li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell a difference from the moment I started using this cream and</li>
            <li>It feels amazing and has a very light, neutral, warm smell.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering this once more, unless more is needed, and getting rid...or close to rid, of my stretch marks!</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t \\&quot;right there\\&quot; anymore!!!</li>
            <li>but I guess most people would say it smells like some kind of plant.</li>
            <li>and We&#x27;re are very happy so far.</li>
            <li>but this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>, my stomach looks awesome, even in natural light!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product when you first try it.</li>
            <li>Great Product, Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because the ingredients are promising, the consistency is great- like a whipped butter, and the smell is very light.</li>
            <li>Also, I love that there is no smell to this product.</li>
            <li>with that it fades away most of the stretch mark.</li>
            <li>but of course i&#x27;m gon purchase some more...</li>
            <li>then i went on to getting stri-vectin SD and that works soo much better</li>
            <li>I was for sure</li>
            <li>learn more at [...]</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to try the cream route for stretch mark improvement, you have to make the most of the product by using it often and generously.</li>
            <li>and I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with the product</li>
            <li>The product came fast and feels great just started using it</li>
            <li>I have one prominent stretch mark and this did nothing along the lines of making it go away.</li>
            <li>The cream is working on the old&lt;br /&gt;stretch marks also, but it just takes more time and patience because</li>
            <li>My stretch marks smoothed out a lot more after using this.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27; expecting too much more after using Mederma</li>
            <li>i will be buying more ...</li>
            <li>Order 2 more again, wish it keep working for me.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t, I think one more jar will do the trick.  </li>
            <li>They are lighter and blend in better.</li>
            <li>I expect with continual use, it can make a greater significance.</li>
            <li>although im sure they will never fully disappear i am so so happy with this product i reccomend for anyone who is looking for a REAL miracle product.</li>
            <li>so my skin would be more pliant and permeable.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more when I get the money.    </li>
            <li>At that time I probably would have had a better time getting rid of them.</li>
            <li>and it is just fabulous!</li>
            <li>I tried to contact the manufacturer to make sure I was applying correctly, but no response.</li>
            <li>Although I can say it is better than before.</li>
            <li>I bought another one and will concentrate more in that area.</li>
            <li>I just bought my second one and it still works great!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t say how many times per day to apply or anything.  </li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s not animal tested too</li>
            <li>will be purchasing again :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely  love this cream.</li>
            <li>I started using it after my 4th month of pregnancy all over my belly and my love handles, up until I gave birth.  </li>
            <li>I doubt that it has anything more than vitamin E.</li>
            <li>I doubt that so many reviewers have had a chance to see \\&quot;wonderful\\&quot; results.  </li>
            <li>You are better off by buying a jar of vitamin E cream.</li>
            <li>But if you can prevent them, I believe you can do so by making your skin more elastic by means of applying Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>(I think this helps to absorb it better</li>
            <li>It helped reduce, and in most cases eliminate, my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I had had my son 2months before and still use it till this day and they look so much better</li>
            <li>Im at the end of my first jar with amazing results!</li>
            <li>Tried many many creams with no results.</li>
            <li>I love it and will be ordering it again</li>
            <li>This is magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>Product does what it promise and I will be buying couple more.</li>
            <li>and I used it for more than a month.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did because it does make a difference.  </li>
            <li>This cream is rich, has a nice smell and after using it as directed for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>This is the first product I used because of the good reviews</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you Skintrition for leaving my skin beautiful, supple, and soft.</li>
            <li>It hydrates your skin and leaves it soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I searched for one for a long time and decided to order this one based on excellent reviews.</li>
            <li>The scent is okay, its not too creamy its fine like lotion.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that they are a lot lighter now, not completely gone but much better than before!</li>
            <li>They are slowly becoming lighter as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I used the product primarily on my arms where my stretch marks are most noticeable.  </li>
            <li>but once I compared the pictures I could see that the color of the stretch marks was becoming lighter.</li>
            <li>Now the skin overtop feels healthy and smooth, too.  </li>
            <li>Excellent conditions delivered as expected.</li>
            <li>Before recieving it I was so delighted at how fast it got to me and that I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping.</li>
            <li>this product smells good and it seemed to lighten my stretchmarks on my thighs all though it didnt do much for the sides of my waist where i also had stretch marks</li>
            <li>If women are pregnant or women in general are looking for a good cream that makes your skin feel good, go ahead and get this.</li>
            <li>I can say that it does moisturize well and it absorbs easily into your skin.  </li>
            <li>There is no doubt that this product prevents stretch marks and it has made my stretch marks a tad bit lighter, but it separates easily.  </li>
            <li>Seemed like an easy fix and who doesnt like easy...</li>
            <li>the Mederma one I used smelled strongly of hospital soap, ew.)</li>
            <li>However, it is a very good cream and moisturizes your skin all day long.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it is nothing more than a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I had to mix it and now its fine.  </li>
            <li>and it should be fine.</li>
            <li>Received quickly!</li>
            <li>It is advertised for the Prevention of stretch marks, yet it uses an ingredient that many avoid while pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews for this product and many others as well, and this one seemed to positively affect many people.</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference now that I have been using this product.</li>
            <li>thinking I wouldn&#x27;t see a huge change, but I saw no difference at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal, especially now that Amazon is offering free shipping.</li>
            <li>I ordered this after I saw all the great reviews, I personally saw results in ONE DAY!!!</li>
            <li>( I&#x27;m  slim &amp; fit</li>
            <li>Obviously I&#x27;m not expecting my stretch marks to be \\&quot;erased\\&quot;, but any improvement is welcome.</li>
            <li>I used this product (fragrance free version) for a month</li>
            <li>I have brown skin and EXTREMELY light colored, good-sized stretch marks on my shoulders</li>
            <li>marks\\&quot; apply it as directed and did nothing else but to smooth my skin.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve definitely seen improvement which is great.  </li>
            <li>I began considering carboxytherapy, but figured I&#x27;d wait until I found a good deal on it and lost about ten more pounds.     </li>
            <li>Thanks to the company for making such a great product!   </li>
            <li>I love this cream so much I&#x27;m buying more for my friends and family.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think two more weeks would have changed them, nor two more months.</li>
            <li>Its been about 5 months now and I highly recommend this cream to anyone whose fear of revealing their stretch marks is keeping them from enjoying life!</li>
            <li>But again, I&#x27;ve had these particular stretch marks for something around 17-18 YEARS, and this is truthfully the most improvement I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>Great product so far, I&#x27;m using it during my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>Are you plagued by unsightly stretch marks that embarrass you and keep you from wearing some of the cute new styles of clothing that you love?</li>
            <li>but I saw improvement in only two weeks of use and that was a complete win because you know something is good when it starts working right away.</li>
            <li>and they were significantly diminished (the scars looked thinner and shorter).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how this product finishes on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has been 2 months (that&#x27;s how long it lasted) and I can see great improvement:</li>
            <li>My wife didn&#x27;t saw any results with this cream but each body is unique.</li>
            <li>Be aware this product is more for preventing then getting rid of stretch marks</li>
            <li>Definitely worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li>, thus I cannot say whether it is effective on new marks.</li>
            <li>use twice a day on clean skin for two months, you will see results.</li>
            <li>I did them one better and used it three times a day on certain areas.</li>
            <li>You can feel the \\&quot;special quality\\</li>
            <li>This cream works pretty good so far.  </li>
            <li>I really think this was a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>I hope it works for everyone as well as it has for me because this has been a true blessing.</li>
            <li>The cream, however, gave a soft feel to my skin and smelled nice.</li>
            <li>: I WAS GIVEN A FULL REFUNDED...</li>
            <li>So this product is good for newer stretch marks (so the red ones)...</li>
            <li>I was excited to have found this cream with such great reviews but it didn&#x27;t do much of anything for my skin .</li>
            <li>I ordered this item based on the load of great comments it got from other amazon users.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to try and its cheaper than some other products and has great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m recommending this to all my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li>Mild smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to feel much more confident.</li>
            <li>Either way there is a mild improvement.  </li>
            <li>As two weeks went by a started noticing that one set of stretch marks in particular seemed lighter and more surfaced.</li>
            <li>I just wish I had found this product sooner and had this while I was pregnant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super creamy, yet it absorbs immediately into your skin..</li>
            <li>Being pregnant to twins, I wanted to apply stretch mark cream to my stomach.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this product if you are pregnant because Retinol Palmitate has been shown to cause tumors and cancers in animals.</li>
            <li>but i am stretch mark-prone, and at 8 months pregnant still don&#x27;t have any on my belly</li>
            <li>Used the first bottle and did not notice a huge difference with existing stretch marks.</li>
            <li>and I can see some more concrete results.</li>
            <li>It stays on for a good long while.</li>
            <li>I was not afraid that it&#x27;s going to be sticky at first, but it gets absorbed easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Definitely my new favorite product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use this for two more to know it&#x27;s not going to work and furthermore, I&#x27;ve pretty much run out of the cream already.</li>
            <li>I will totally use this product again if I ever decide to have more children!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different creams and lotions over the years, and I could feel that a majority of them just sat on top of my skin, probably lending a hand in clogging a large number of my pores.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream only because of its shea oil and it worked for me amazingly.</li>
            <li>It really helped moisturize and smooth out my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really seen any results but it makes your skin smooth...</li>
            <li>I choose the fragrance free version and it really does not have any smell.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I have an olive complexion, and medium skin tone.</li>
            <li>But as I said, these are fresh stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Regardless, it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want it getting absorbed by fabric.    </li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s worth every penny I&#x27;ve paid for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never written a review about anything in my life, but this product is worth every word I&#x27;m writing.</li>
            <li>With daily use i noticed a difference honestly within a week.</li>
            <li>However, I do not think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>:) I found that I was just as well off letting stretch marks fade naturally over time.</li>
            <li>These were old stretch marks too, ones that I had for many years since pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Clearly, that is a better alternative.</li>
            <li>Still need more for a complete result.</li>
            <li>Decided to go the natural route to help with stretch marks and purchased shea butter instead, much more affordable and there is plenty to purchase here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and so far, nothing else I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why everyone else seems to have had such great success, but I have to believe all the positive reviews aren&#x27;t really accurate or honest.</li>
            <li>Two of the times I used it on a daily basis, I applied right after a warm bath</li>
            <li>I heard from other reviews this product is good, bought it</li>
            <li>It is not a miracle cream though, and does not make the stretch mark disappear, but it DOES makes it highly unnoticeable (which for me is good enough).     </li>
            <li>if&lt;br /&gt;you apply the cream right.</li>
            <li>After receiving it, I put it on right away, and did so for about a week.</li>
            <li>I have four beautiful children, and I had several deep stretchmarks on my stomach, legs, and breast.</li>
            <li>I know different products work best for different skin types, so if you&#x27;re wondering, I have very fair skin, and I have a combination of old and new stretch marks, and unfortunately I get stretch marks very easily...</li>
            <li>I have tried several different creams for years, and by far, this is the best.  </li>
            <li>I did reorder my second jar, so I will let you know if things keep improving, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great product and at a low price.   </li>
            <li>It did not make them go completely away, but she wants me to buy her more of this when she runs out.</li>
            <li>I do want to make sure that say stretch marks can never be completely removed so, don&#x27;t expect too much from this product.</li>
            <li>I really am trying to help other people make a good choice.</li>
            <li>By the time I finished my first jar, the new ones had faded pretty significantly.  </li>
            <li>Its a pretty neutral smell.</li>
            <li>I recently gave birth to a healthy baby boy.</li>
            <li>I was using the Palmer&#x27;s before the Urban Skintrition, so I don&#x27;t know for sure if the Palmer&#x27;s is beneficial.</li>
            <li>an&#x27;t really say how it does on stretch marks!</li>
            <li>Haha!     </li>
            <li>While i still have a few in the area i experimented on, the change has been so welcomed and loved that i would recommend this product to ANYone who would be willing to try it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use it twice a day, consistency is the key with this product.</li>
            <li>after the full two weeks my stretch marks on my stomach were so light and much smaller</li>
            <li>but this has made confidence level much higher.</li>
            <li>This is the first review i have written on ANYTHING.</li>
            <li>If you have many stretch marks, like I do, this cream will not last you a month.   </li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I decided to do something about it when it started to get hot in Texas and it prevented me from wanting to wear knee length dresses or shorts.</li>
            <li>I put this first</li>
            <li>i never thought there would be a product that actually works and does makes stretchmarks disappear because after trying several products this is the only thing that had given me wonderful results in just weeks..</li>
            <li>This cream is an absolute miracle!</li>
            <li>Didnt really work on me!</li>
            <li>Within the first month, after using it generously twice a day, I ran out.</li>
            <li>This product is absolute garbage!</li>
            <li>product makes my skin extremely soft and helps to smooth the texture of the marks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle, and I just ordered another.</li>
            <li>I want to see the results after I finish the second to say for sure.</li>
            <li>but you have to look pretty closely to see them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure results vary a bit from one person to the next</li>
            <li>but this product really worked for me!</li>
            <li>Bought my first jar applied twice a day sometimes 3.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure Urban Skintrition helped!</li>
            <li>So if your like me and have several problem areas, you may need more than one tub.</li>
            <li>I will re-invest in this cream again once I&#x27;m done with the first one.</li>
            <li>Hopefully these work on my legs because I would really love to wear shorts especially for P.E.</li>
            <li>For everyone that is searching for a stretch mark solution and saving a couple of bucks, you definitely get the bang for this product :)</li>
            <li>My friend actually mentioned this one to me saying it made her skin feel super smooth.  </li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks, I was very pleased that the color of the scars had faded a bit and were definitely less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I first was looking to buy other brands that were popular</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a little over two weeks, and already there is an exceptional difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had stretch marks all my life and now that I&#x27;ve started using this cream they are becoming more and more faint.</li>
            <li>I imagine this would be super-effective in preventing stretch marks or fading fresh marks, mine are from many years ago and harder to rid of, but it IS working</li>
            <li>The marks on my inner thighs started to lighten slightly after a week, which is impressive in and of itself since they are so old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my second jar and results are still good especially on my arms.</li>
            <li>I also put it on my face at night because my skin is very sensitive and it dries out quickly after washing my face.</li>
            <li>The stretch marks are much lighter and less noticeable and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I have not felt so sexy in a long time</li>
            <li>I had visible stretch marks on my belly from the pregnancy and now its so light I can barely see them.  </li>
            <li>Because the shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>On top of that, my skin seriously feels so smooth (the husband loves this btw!).  </li>
            <li>im nt sure how urban skinitration works on older stretch marks</li>
            <li>If, however, you just had a baby and the stretch marks are new and fresh, apply this cream and it should do the trick!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know that my body will naturally heal itself, but I will still use it because of how quickly its helping to get rid of them.  </li>
            <li>After having my 2 beautiful children my poor body has been left looking not so beautiful with several deep stretch marks.</li>
            <li>When I became a lady, my chest grew large very quickly and I had red stretch marks.</li>
            <li>My product was somehow lost in the mail and they mailed me a new one right away.</li>
            <li>The cream is very light and not really greasy.  </li>
            <li>After two pregnancy&#x27;s I have light minor stretch marks on my stomach and the back of my legs, they are white and you can feel them (depth wise)</li>
            <li>I seriously did not have high hopes that this product would work, despite all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>You can hardly see them and they look much more smooth.</li>
            <li>The seller provided an excellent experience as far as shipping and packaging went, but the product failed me.</li>
            <li>My order was shiped prety fast that I could not beleive.</li>
            <li>The product itself doesn&#x27;t really have a smell (which I&#x27;m thankful for,</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, but in the beginning I would have compared it to the way my skin smells after a night of drinking too much.</li>
            <li>I became really self conscience and wouldn&#x27;t wear shorts even when it was 100 degrees out.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>so I felt this was sold for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone struggling with embarrassing stretch marks!</li>
            <li>My skins takes everything very well</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>The product is very hydrating</li>
            <li>This cream works really</li>
            <li>/&gt;the skin feeling very smoothed.</li>
            <li>Since the cream is light you only need</li>
            <li>I really, really, hoped this cream would work, but realistically figured it was just a scam like all the others.</li>
            <li>I have about 15 on one side that are SO noticeable, and I really had to look to see them.</li>
            <li>Well I used the whole bottle and there isnt really a difference.</li>
            <li>Shipping was also fast.</li>
            <li>I really like the results I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>and there is a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I just want to say thanks to everyone that gave a review on this product</li>
            <li>it really helped me make my  purchase...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and will purchase again and again!</li>
            <li>This cream really works for me.</li>
            <li>I can tell the differences very eazy.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks look so much lighter and smoother.  </li>
            <li>it would have really made a difference.   </li>
            <li>My wife said it is very sticky.</li>
            <li>But I really didn&#x27;t see a difference on my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>i highly recommened this product!</li>
            <li>but nothing has really worked.</li>
            <li>The cream does not really give directions on how many times to apply it.</li>
            <li>I would avoid this product or ask a real doctor if it&#x27;s legitimate.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know too much about stretch mark creams but decided to give this one a shot.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I can really see a GIGANTIC difference to the problem areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the cream for a while now, and my stretch marks are still there of course, but they are much lighter than they were.  </li>
            <li>My stretch marks have lightened some, but I really use it for the tightening aspect and for the softness it gives my skin.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work.  </li>
            <li>thanks to this</li>
            <li>I started reading the reviews more carefully.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much info on the company...</li>
            <li>So the stretch marks don&#x27;t stand out as much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of stretch mark creams that didn&#x27;t work, but this one really did...</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re really noticeable.</li>
            <li>I used this whole container but did not notice a difference.</li>
            <li>and I do not plan on buying another batch to find out if it really works.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks on my thighs really seemed to diminish.</li>
            <li>but it really took a lot for me to decide if I should because of the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it lightened them up much either.</li>
            <li>I would say if you really want to get rid of your stretch marks, give it a try...</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see real results after using all the product</li>
            <li>The marks were still very visible.</li>
            <li>Since Palmer&#x27;s is also cheaper, I really recommend trying that one instead of this.</li>
            <li>so I wanted something to get rid of them even though I don&#x27;t have them as much is still did nothing for me</li>
            <li>and I have already seen very noticeable differences in my skin.  </li>
            <li>This lotion works really well</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this would work for me.</li>
            <li>so far it works a lot better on the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>Still, it was a nice moisturizer and it didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many people were paid to write these reviews, but it is just more false advertising.</li>
            <li>I have tried Strivectin on numerous occasions, and most recently I followed the directions exactly as written.</li>
            <li>Compared to other products that I use: Medela and Palmer, this cream is thicker and provide more moisture.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other products and nothing seemed to work for me.</li>
            <li>and i think i am seeing more of difference due to the time passing instead.</li>
            <li>i will keep at though because there were so many other successes.</li>
            <li>I was excited since the reviews seemed all about the same the cream helped with stretch marks I has hopes this would be my miracle cream.</li>
            <li>This is better than some of the other products out there on the market.</li>
            <li>Mainly because of the cost in relation to how much cream is in the jar.</li>
            <li>I had decent results with Mederma, but Bio-oil didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product is that it&#x27;s really thick and super creamy but not oily</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to diminish their stretch marks.</li>
            <li>There is definitely something special about this cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had stretch marks for a while, the pale white kind (not very deep) from being active in sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 1 jar of this because I read all of the GREAT reviews.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>It does have a different smell to it, not necessarily bad though.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad smell just a regular cream smell.  </li>
            <li>The new ones are no longer red at all and the old ones are becoming level with the surrounding skin.     </li>
            <li>The reason I decided to review it is because I actually do notice a difference which obviously surprises me since I&#x27;ve tried SO many things.</li>
            <li>I have been using it religiously on my stretch marks i got from being pregnant.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of not taking care of my skin while I was pregnant and almost 5 years later, I still have stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I have used so many different kinds of creams (including the $135 stuff from strivectin), and this is the only one that I see a difference with.  </li>
            <li>but I was mainly concerned about the ones on my arm.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for older stretch marks, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.</li>
            <li>Only mild change.</li>
            <li>They were bright red, quite long and deep.</li>
            <li>Minus wishing i hadn&#x27;t tried my experiment (only because of the results being lovely and not treating the others), i wish i had done this 9 years ago when the problem first started bothering me and worsening.</li>
            <li>Almost finished a full jar with no change at all in my current stretch marks and didn&#x27;t prevent new ones.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to fade their stretch marks.</li>
            <li>and now they&#x27;re a light silvery (clearish color), deep, and thick and most of all very embarrassing</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product because of all the 5 and 4 stars.</li>
            <li>This product is highly rated on amazon</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews, I had high hopes for this product but the bottom line is that it just does not work..at all.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>A++, i highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>I bought this product due to the great reviews and I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li>I decided to do a more linguistic detective work and read reviews of other creams where truly the cream is 4 or 5 star.</li>
            <li>I am trying to fade a bunch of old stretch marks after losing a large amount of weight.  </li>
            <li>but they where a little bit more puffier in that area im going to buy this product again to see if i can lighten both areas again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seems to be working as my stretch marks are a little better</li>
            <li>I will continue to use If I can get it at a place where it is a little more affordable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working on it seeing a little improvement need more time.</li>
            <li>Considering the picture uploads on one particular blog, i decided it was worth a try being affordable and having potential to work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had stretch marks on my thighs since early adolescence, from both weight gain/loss and a growth spurt, and nothing I used over the years has done so much as made the slightest dent in them.</li>
            <li>These great reviews are fake, friends.</li>
            <li>I think it didn&#x27;t work on those though because they are very severe and well over 15 years old.</li>
            <li>it even helped with an old laparscopic surgery scar that was raised in my belly button, it really smoothed it out and lightened its color too....</li>
            <li>I just massaged the cream into my inner thigh area in a circular motion until the cream was absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li>at least it didnt work for me as well as i would have liked maybe for someone with lighter marks.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m using it I can tell that it makes my skin more firm.</li>
            <li>then this is a product for you to try it actually works and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Also, it is thick and creamy, and once you work it all in your skin feels nice and smooth/healthy.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is nice and thick, it&#x27;s a whipped lotion and there is no scent, not even the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really is effective, but the results are slow and gradual.  </li>
            <li>This product really fade old and new stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I got them right after puberty in my inner thighs and hips.</li>
            <li>I am on my second jar right now.  </li>
            <li>Feel free to ask me any other questions you might have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that in 10 more weeks ill barely notice them.</li>
            <li>I just bought TONS of new shorts for the summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new crack for my skin</li>
            <li>Please note that I did not use the cream for new stretch marks</li>
            <li>Time to try something new...</li>
            <li>The product is new to the market.</li>
            <li>While it has not stopped new stretch marks from appearing, it has help fade the existing ones.</li>
            <li>I used to be overweight and during my process of losing weight, I had some new stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with both products together though and am finally seeing results after trying so many other expensive products.</li>
            <li>There are several different types of cream for stretch marks available, as well as stretch mark removal by using laser surgery.    </li>
            <li>If you are realistic about stretch mark creams, you will be pleasantly surprised by it.</li>
            <li>They are about 10 years old, as I got them when I was running in track/cross country in high school.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin, and haven&#x27;t had any problems with this breaking me out/</li>
            <li>I have very large, deep marks on the sites of my bottom from growing, and they&#x27;re lighter than my natural skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I am not sure if it is safe to use during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that has not only helped,  but dramatically made a difference.  </li>
            <li>This cream has lightned my new and old silvery stretch marks about 50% in a month.</li>
            <li>My new stretch marks are still there along with the old.</li>
            <li>a con is that is does not dry fast and sticks to clothes ick)</li>
            <li>After 3 babies, I have more than my share of stretch marks, particularly very deep, dark ones on my stomach; being fair-skinned makes them quite noticeable.</li>
            <li>I tried this product on new and old (we&#x27;re talking 12 year old) stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a drastic difference, especially not after just two weeks, but I certainly figured that I would have at least seen a slight change given the GREAT reviews they gave their product and the fact</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference and didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the marks and if it was doing anything, because I usually was putting it on right before bed.</li>
            <li>By the time I finished my second, the older ones had faded too!  </li>
            <li>The texture is more thick so you need a bigger blob of lotion to cover a large area.  </li>
            <li>The ones in my breast are so clear</li>
            <li>While it left my skin soft and very moisturized, it did not remove any stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>Says it makes her skin feel amazingly soft...</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference until almost 3 week&#x27;s use, but the difference is obvious.</li>
            <li>So I decided to give this product a try and WOW</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and replenished.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>No heavy perfume smell, which I like.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantley surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 23 years old</li>
            <li>So far, this product has made no difference in the look or feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li>(I have deep ones from pregnancy), but not as fast as I thought they would after reading some reviews.</li>
            <li>with a couple of old stretch marks.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Nothing i had ever tried worked and after using a prescription removal/diminishing cream for nearly 7 months with no results (at all), i gave up.</li>
            <li>About two months ago and nearly a year of having given up</li>
            <li>but even if not- i can settle for having them be nearly gone.</li>
            <li>, it keeps my skin so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am so pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>Hi everyone reading this review, I&#x27;ve had stretch marks every since I was really young</li>
            <li>I was young and embarrassed</li>
            <li>You will start to notice after a week that your skin is really soft.</li>
            <li>I will order this again and see if continued use diminishes them completely.</li>
            <li>but my skin feels anew after using it... soft, replenished and silky.</li>
            <li>Only things I recommend is to not put too much on.</li>
            <li>It is also unscented which is what I wanted for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It also makes your skin really soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying out Mederma since it&#x27;s about the same price &amp; is very well-known.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve had  luck with this stuff.</li>
            <li>really lathered this stuff on and was religious with it</li>
            <li>now i haven&#x27;t noticed any of my old stretchmarks go away</li>
            <li>and my son is almost a year old.</li>
            <li>side effects-- just soft silky skin.</li>
            <li>It works SO well and leaves my skin so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have ordered two bottles so far</li>
            <li>but I ABSOLUTELY noticed a difference after using Urban Skintrition.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for my wife for two weeks so far</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t expect your stretch marks to completely dissapear overnight</li>
            <li>Just started using this stretch mark cream 4 days ago and so far im feeling optimistic.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft all day.  </li>
            <li>and it has completely turned them to a lighter color.</li>
            <li>This cream really reduces the visual of  my stretchmarks.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m buying her a few for her birthday because i&#x27;m so confident itwill be her answer 13 years after starting treatments.</li>
            <li>One of my close friend recommend this cream for me, as i was unable to find any which can bring a good result.</li>
            <li>Mederma was the only other product that seemed to do anything, but it took several months, lots of $$$, and eventually (maybe because I have very light, sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>They were mostly new stretch marks with very few light old ones..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being desperate to do something -anything!- about this after I lost a good deal of weight this spring and saw marks more pronounced than ever plus loose skin, I tried this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what happens after another few weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rich and luxurious on my skin, leaving it firm and supple.  </li>
            <li>But for this product, it feels like everybody used the same keywords to write the reviews No other reviews available on any other website.</li>
            <li>I finished medical school last year, and after getting asked on my dermatology block by so many patients for a solution to stretch marks, I decided to investigate the subject on myself.  </li>
            <li>Not only was there no change, but the jar is really small, so if you have more than just a couple of lines</li>
            <li>I have older white stretch marks that I have had for years</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for only 2 weeks and at first i was thinking this stuff don&#x27;t work,  and after a couple of days i have noticed a big difference!</li>
            <li>I had stretch marks on my breasts and booty and have tried many different products in the past.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item due to the other reviews, and I&#x27;m glad it did.</li>
            <li>Before I knew this, I figured I&#x27;d chanced upon a great product that would at the very least lighten my marks to a slight degree.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend this especially to brown skin girls.</li>
            <li>I only gave the cream four stars because I didn&#x27;t start to notice a difference until I started using it with the derma roller device (highly recommended).</li>
            <li>I have gone through about a jar and a half so far, consistent daily through the first one and slacking on the second, but i started slacking because i wasn&#x27;t seeing much difference after about a month, but i bought a second jar to wait it out.</li>
            <li>I feel a lot better running around town, bending and stretching (especially in the winter) after having applied a little Urban Skintrition.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 15 wks pregnant, so not much stretching has begun.</li>
            <li>I just fininshed my first jar and I do believe I am seeing slight improvement, which is more than I can say for the other products on the market that are even more expensive.  </li>
            <li>there not completely gone but have lighten so much im in shock.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy, doesn&#x27;t smell weird, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>still have a half of jar left, maybe it will produce better results over the long run...</li>
            <li>Also, the cream is very thick and you have to really work it in and it is not that smooth.</li>
            <li>It seems to have lessened existing scars, but it definitely has prevented new stretch marks on my chest and shoulders that have appeared from strength training.</li>
            <li>I lost a lot of weight and did wonders for my self confidence but left stretch marks all over my body that had me fearing taking off my shirt to show off my new weirs when visiting the beach or the pool.  </li>
            <li>I am 32 weeks with fraternal twins and with not a single stretchmarks so far.</li>
            <li>I have been looking forever for a product that actually works and finally I found one AND at a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>After only one week of using this product, I&#x27;ve found my recently appearing stomach stretch marks to be fading fast.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve only been using this for a month but my stretch marks have really improved and they&#x27;re definitely lighter.</li>
            <li>If I ever decide to get pregnant, I&#x27;ll probably get a few jars of this for prevention.    </li>
            <li>this product, was very surprised it actually worked, and now I recommended it to everyone!</li>
            <li>We live in Arizona and my wife has dry skin pretty much year round.</li>
            <li>Still not perfect, but this is more progress than anything else has given me!</li>
            <li>If you try it for about a week you can see a major difference.</li>
            <li>The marks faded a little bit, but I think that&#x27;s more because of the extra care and that any regular moisturizer would do the same.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to all one that suffers from stretch marks of any kind or might be pregnant and would like to prevent stretch marks...big and dark to small and light</li>
            <li>So it takes awhile, but any product that says it will give immediate results is full of crap, so this is more realistic.</li>
            <li>I generally use it twice a day unless I forget.</li>
            <li>My results so far are enough motivation to keep using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice daily on the stretch marks on my stomach for three weeks so far</li>
            <li>now I can barely see it.</li>
            <li>I only used this cream on my stretch marks for about 2 weeks before stopping completely, so I can&#x27;t say how it is with stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I developed very deep stretch marks on my hips and bum and around my navel at the end of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Maybe its because all my stretch marks are old (deep, silver ones),</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 20-year old female.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely seen a difference.</li>
            <li>Im a 21 yr old male and did Not work on me.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for old stretch marks that I&#x27;ve had since middle school.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 3 bottles of it already to prevent further stretch marks and keep the old ones from resurfacing.  </li>
            <li>However, I tried to use it on old white stretch marks</li>
            <li>/&gt;The amount you get seems small at first, but a small amount covers a large area, since it spreads easily, almost like wet soap spuds.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s rich and creamy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the product runs out very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2.5 months, but not as consistently as I should, and I think my marks have become a bit less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I should have really followed the warnings from other customers.</li>
            <li>Using as directed, even in several areas , this little jar lasts Making definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>My old ones tended to be deep and white.</li>
            <li>It is not worth the price as my stretchmarks look exactly the same as they did before I started using it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for 2 months now, and no it is not a miracle cream that has magically erased my stretch marks, but it definitely has decreased the appearance of them.</li>
            <li>As an extra precaution, I tend to leave the skin bare for about 15 minutes after putting on the cream.</li>
            <li>This cream helped me complete a long journey which started the day I decided</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for two weeks and within the first few days I noticed a difference...</li>
            <li>Improvements showed the first few days i used it</li>
            <li>Natural feels but not very nice when u leave much on your skins....</li>
            <li>I almost gave up on it, but then in this last week I started to notice MAJOR improvements even in deep stretch marks that I have had since puberty.</li>
            <li>I am a 30 year old male who has 10 year old stretch marks from extreme weight loss.  </li>
            <li>i have just received my first jar of this and it looks like a whipped cream, the smell is not strong but doesn&#x27;t stink just kinda there</li>
            <li>The stretch marks seem much deeper now, and less visible.  </li>
            <li>A little lotion covers a large area.  </li>
            <li>A big difference happened quickly and it slowly kept working over the course of the 2 months.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a very noticeable difference in as little as 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I only write reviews when the product is either too good or too bad and this one is exellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> A good moisturizer</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it had a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li> so it provides some good moisture to the skin.</li>
            <li> It has really good ingredients in it too.  </li>
            <li> This would be a good moisturizer to PREVENT but does nothing to reduce or erase.</li>
            <li> and i loved it.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, so far great results!</li>

            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad they started selling this on Amazon!  </li>

            <li> It has become my favorite!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try it anyways since it&#x27;s so cheap, and I am so happy I did.</li>
            <li> Now, my stretch marks aren&#x27;t invisible (yet), but for two weeks time, the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> but I had to say something about this amazing cream I just bought.  </li>
            <li> The smell is light and attractive, and it makes my skin feel like silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also it works well as a nice moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I saw no difference at all.</li>
            <li> and they are fading quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> ive tried hundreds of products of every kind.</li>
            <li> a nice mellow sent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need to use it for a couple more months to give it a fair analysis.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still effective afterwards.</li>
            <li> I dont understand how this has so many good reviews</li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell a difference from the moment I started using this cream and</li>
            <li> It feels amazing and has a very light, neutral, warm smell.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering this once more, unless more is needed, and getting rid...or close to rid, of my stretch marks!</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t \\&quot;right there\\&quot; anymore!!!</li>
            <li> but I guess most people would say it smells like some kind of plant.</li>
            <li> and We&#x27;re are very happy so far.</li>
            <li> but this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> , my stomach looks awesome, even in natural light!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product when you first try it.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because the ingredients are promising, the consistency is great- like a whipped butter, and the smell is very light.</li>
            <li> Also, I love that there is no smell to this product.</li>
            <li> with that it fades away most of the stretch mark.</li>
            <li> but of course i&#x27;m gon purchase some more...</li>
            <li> then i went on to getting stri-vectin SD and that works soo much better</li>
            <li> I was for sure</li>
            <li> learn more at [...]</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to try the cream route for stretch mark improvement, you have to make the most of the product by using it often and generously.</li>
            <li> and I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with the product</li>
            <li> The product came fast and feels great just started using it</li>
            <li> I have one prominent stretch mark and this did nothing along the lines of making it go away.</li>
            <li> The cream is working on the old&lt;br /&gt;stretch marks also, but it just takes more time and patience because</li>
            <li> My stretch marks smoothed out a lot more after using this.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27; expecting too much more after using Mederma</li>
            <li> i will be buying more ...</li>
            <li> Order 2 more again, wish it keep working for me.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t, I think one more jar will do the trick.  </li>
            <li> They are lighter and blend in better.</li>
            <li> I expect with continual use, it can make a greater significance.</li>
            <li> although im sure they will never fully disappear i am so so happy with this product i reccomend for anyone who is looking for a REAL miracle product.</li>
            <li> so my skin would be more pliant and permeable.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more when I get the money.    </li>
            <li> At that time I probably would have had a better time getting rid of them.</li>
            <li> and it is just fabulous!</li>
            <li> I tried to contact the manufacturer to make sure I was applying correctly, but no response.</li>
            <li> Although I can say it is better than before.</li>
            <li> I bought another one and will concentrate more in that area.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second one and it still works great!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t say how many times per day to apply or anything.  </li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s not animal tested too</li>
            <li> will be purchasing again :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely  love this cream.</li>
            <li> I started using it after my 4th month of pregnancy all over my belly and my love handles, up until I gave birth.  </li>
            <li> I doubt that it has anything more than vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I doubt that so many reviewers have had a chance to see \\&quot;wonderful\\&quot; results.  </li>
            <li> You are better off by buying a jar of vitamin E cream.</li>
            <li> But if you can prevent them, I believe you can do so by making your skin more elastic by means of applying Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> (I think this helps to absorb it better</li>
            <li> It helped reduce, and in most cases eliminate, my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> I had had my son 2months before and still use it till this day and they look so much better</li>
            <li> Im at the end of my first jar with amazing results!</li>
            <li> Tried many many creams with no results.</li>
            <li> I love it and will be ordering it again</li>
            <li> This is magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Product does what it promise and I will be buying couple more.</li>
            <li> and I used it for more than a month.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did because it does make a difference.  </li>
            <li> This cream is rich, has a nice smell and after using it as directed for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This is the first product I used because of the good reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you Skintrition for leaving my skin beautiful, supple, and soft.</li>
            <li> It hydrates your skin and leaves it soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I searched for one for a long time and decided to order this one based on excellent reviews.</li>
            <li> The scent is okay, its not too creamy its fine like lotion.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that they are a lot lighter now, not completely gone but much better than before!</li>
            <li> They are slowly becoming lighter as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I used the product primarily on my arms where my stretch marks are most noticeable.  </li>
            <li> but once I compared the pictures I could see that the color of the stretch marks was becoming lighter.</li>
            <li> Now the skin overtop feels healthy and smooth, too.  </li>
            <li> Excellent conditions delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> Before recieving it I was so delighted at how fast it got to me and that I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping.</li>
            <li> this product smells good and it seemed to lighten my stretchmarks on my thighs all though it didnt do much for the sides of my waist where i also had stretch marks</li>
            <li> If women are pregnant or women in general are looking for a good cream that makes your skin feel good, go ahead and get this.</li>
            <li> I can say that it does moisturize well and it absorbs easily into your skin.  </li>
            <li> There is no doubt that this product prevents stretch marks and it has made my stretch marks a tad bit lighter, but it separates easily.  </li>
            <li> Seemed like an easy fix and who doesnt like easy...</li>
            <li> the Mederma one I used smelled strongly of hospital soap, ew.)</li>
            <li> However, it is a very good cream and moisturizes your skin all day long.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure it is nothing more than a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I had to mix it and now its fine.  </li>
            <li> and it should be fine.</li>
            <li> Received quickly!</li>
            <li> It is advertised for the Prevention of stretch marks, yet it uses an ingredient that many avoid while pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews for this product and many others as well, and this one seemed to positively affect many people.</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference now that I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> thinking I wouldn&#x27;t see a huge change, but I saw no difference at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal, especially now that Amazon is offering free shipping.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after I saw all the great reviews, I personally saw results in ONE DAY!!!</li>
            <li> ( I&#x27;m  slim &amp; fit</li>
            <li> Obviously I&#x27;m not expecting my stretch marks to be \\&quot;erased\\&quot;, but any improvement is welcome.</li>
            <li> I used this product (fragrance free version) for a month</li>
            <li> I have brown skin and EXTREMELY light colored, good-sized stretch marks on my shoulders</li>
            <li> marks\\&quot; apply it as directed and did nothing else but to smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve definitely seen improvement which is great.  </li>
            <li> I began considering carboxytherapy, but figured I&#x27;d wait until I found a good deal on it and lost about ten more pounds.     </li>
            <li> Thanks to the company for making such a great product!   </li>
            <li> I love this cream so much I&#x27;m buying more for my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think two more weeks would have changed them, nor two more months.</li>
            <li> Its been about 5 months now and I highly recommend this cream to anyone whose fear of revealing their stretch marks is keeping them from enjoying life!</li>
            <li> But again, I&#x27;ve had these particular stretch marks for something around 17-18 YEARS, and this is truthfully the most improvement I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> Great product so far, I&#x27;m using it during my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> Are you plagued by unsightly stretch marks that embarrass you and keep you from wearing some of the cute new styles of clothing that you love?</li>
            <li> but I saw improvement in only two weeks of use and that was a complete win because you know something is good when it starts working right away.</li>
            <li> and they were significantly diminished (the scars looked thinner and shorter).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see how this product finishes on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has been 2 months (that&#x27;s how long it lasted) and I can see great improvement:</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t saw any results with this cream but each body is unique.</li>
            <li> Be aware this product is more for preventing then getting rid of stretch marks</li>
            <li> Definitely worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li> , thus I cannot say whether it is effective on new marks.</li>
            <li> use twice a day on clean skin for two months, you will see results.</li>
            <li> I did them one better and used it three times a day on certain areas.</li>
            <li> You can feel the \\&quot;special quality\\</li>
            <li> This cream works pretty good so far.  </li>
            <li> I really think this was a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I hope it works for everyone as well as it has for me because this has been a true blessing.</li>
            <li> The cream, however, gave a soft feel to my skin and smelled nice.</li>
            <li> : I WAS GIVEN A FULL REFUNDED...</li>
            <li> So this product is good for newer stretch marks (so the red ones)...</li>
            <li> I was excited to have found this cream with such great reviews but it didn&#x27;t do much of anything for my skin .</li>
            <li> I ordered this item based on the load of great comments it got from other amazon users.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to try and its cheaper than some other products and has great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recommending this to all my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li> Mild smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to feel much more confident.</li>
            <li> Either way there is a mild improvement.  </li>
            <li> As two weeks went by a started noticing that one set of stretch marks in particular seemed lighter and more surfaced.</li>
            <li> I just wish I had found this product sooner and had this while I was pregnant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super creamy, yet it absorbs immediately into your skin..</li>
            <li> Being pregnant to twins, I wanted to apply stretch mark cream to my stomach.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product if you are pregnant because Retinol Palmitate has been shown to cause tumors and cancers in animals.</li>
            <li> but i am stretch mark-prone, and at 8 months pregnant still don&#x27;t have any on my belly</li>
            <li> Used the first bottle and did not notice a huge difference with existing stretch marks.</li>
            <li> and I can see some more concrete results.</li>
            <li> It stays on for a good long while.</li>
            <li> I was not afraid that it&#x27;s going to be sticky at first, but it gets absorbed easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li> Definitely my new favorite product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use this for two more to know it&#x27;s not going to work and furthermore, I&#x27;ve pretty much run out of the cream already.</li>
            <li> I will totally use this product again if I ever decide to have more children!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different creams and lotions over the years, and I could feel that a majority of them just sat on top of my skin, probably lending a hand in clogging a large number of my pores.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream only because of its shea oil and it worked for me amazingly.</li>
            <li> It really helped moisturize and smooth out my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen any results but it makes your skin smooth...</li>
            <li> I choose the fragrance free version and it really does not have any smell.  </li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I have an olive complexion, and medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> But as I said, these are fresh stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Regardless, it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want it getting absorbed by fabric.    </li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s worth every penny I&#x27;ve paid for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review about anything in my life, but this product is worth every word I&#x27;m writing.</li>
            <li> With daily use i noticed a difference honestly within a week.</li>
            <li> However, I do not think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> :) I found that I was just as well off letting stretch marks fade naturally over time.</li>
            <li> These were old stretch marks too, ones that I had for many years since pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Clearly, that is a better alternative.</li>
            <li> Still need more for a complete result.</li>
            <li> Decided to go the natural route to help with stretch marks and purchased shea butter instead, much more affordable and there is plenty to purchase here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and so far, nothing else I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone else seems to have had such great success, but I have to believe all the positive reviews aren&#x27;t really accurate or honest.</li>
            <li> Two of the times I used it on a daily basis, I applied right after a warm bath</li>
            <li> I heard from other reviews this product is good, bought it</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle cream though, and does not make the stretch mark disappear, but it DOES makes it highly unnoticeable (which for me is good enough).     </li>
            <li> if&lt;br /&gt;you apply the cream right.</li>
            <li> After receiving it, I put it on right away, and did so for about a week.</li>
            <li> I have four beautiful children, and I had several deep stretchmarks on my stomach, legs, and breast.</li>
            <li> I know different products work best for different skin types, so if you&#x27;re wondering, I have very fair skin, and I have a combination of old and new stretch marks, and unfortunately I get stretch marks very easily...</li>
            <li> I have tried several different creams for years, and by far, this is the best.  </li>
            <li> I did reorder my second jar, so I will let you know if things keep improving, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great product and at a low price.   </li>
            <li> It did not make them go completely away, but she wants me to buy her more of this when she runs out.</li>
            <li> I do want to make sure that say stretch marks can never be completely removed so, don&#x27;t expect too much from this product.</li>
            <li> I really am trying to help other people make a good choice.</li>
            <li> By the time I finished my first jar, the new ones had faded pretty significantly.  </li>
            <li> Its a pretty neutral smell.</li>
            <li> I recently gave birth to a healthy baby boy.</li>
            <li> I was using the Palmer&#x27;s before the Urban Skintrition, so I don&#x27;t know for sure if the Palmer&#x27;s is beneficial.</li>
            <li> an&#x27;t really say how it does on stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Haha!     </li>
            <li> While i still have a few in the area i experimented on, the change has been so welcomed and loved that i would recommend this product to ANYone who would be willing to try it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use it twice a day, consistency is the key with this product.</li>
            <li> after the full two weeks my stretch marks on my stomach were so light and much smaller</li>
            <li> but this has made confidence level much higher.</li>
            <li> This is the first review i have written on ANYTHING.</li>
            <li> If you have many stretch marks, like I do, this cream will not last you a month.   </li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I decided to do something about it when it started to get hot in Texas and it prevented me from wanting to wear knee length dresses or shorts.</li>
            <li> I put this first</li>
            <li> i never thought there would be a product that actually works and does makes stretchmarks disappear because after trying several products this is the only thing that had given me wonderful results in just weeks..</li>
            <li> This cream is an absolute miracle!</li>
            <li> Didnt really work on me!</li>
            <li> Within the first month, after using it generously twice a day, I ran out.</li>
            <li> This product is absolute garbage!</li>
            <li> product makes my skin extremely soft and helps to smooth the texture of the marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle, and I just ordered another.</li>
            <li> I want to see the results after I finish the second to say for sure.</li>
            <li> but you have to look pretty closely to see them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure results vary a bit from one person to the next</li>
            <li> but this product really worked for me!</li>
            <li> Bought my first jar applied twice a day sometimes 3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure Urban Skintrition helped!</li>
            <li> So if your like me and have several problem areas, you may need more than one tub.</li>
            <li> I will re-invest in this cream again once I&#x27;m done with the first one.</li>
            <li> Hopefully these work on my legs because I would really love to wear shorts especially for P.E.</li>
            <li> For everyone that is searching for a stretch mark solution and saving a couple of bucks, you definitely get the bang for this product :)</li>
            <li> My friend actually mentioned this one to me saying it made her skin feel super smooth.  </li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks, I was very pleased that the color of the scars had faded a bit and were definitely less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I first was looking to buy other brands that were popular</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over two weeks, and already there is an exceptional difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had stretch marks all my life and now that I&#x27;ve started using this cream they are becoming more and more faint.</li>
            <li> I imagine this would be super-effective in preventing stretch marks or fading fresh marks, mine are from many years ago and harder to rid of, but it IS working</li>
            <li> The marks on my inner thighs started to lighten slightly after a week, which is impressive in and of itself since they are so old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my second jar and results are still good especially on my arms.</li>
            <li> I also put it on my face at night because my skin is very sensitive and it dries out quickly after washing my face.</li>
            <li> The stretch marks are much lighter and less noticeable and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have not felt so sexy in a long time</li>
            <li> I had visible stretch marks on my belly from the pregnancy and now its so light I can barely see them.  </li>
            <li> Because the shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> On top of that, my skin seriously feels so smooth (the husband loves this btw!).  </li>
            <li> im nt sure how urban skinitration works on older stretch marks</li>
            <li> If, however, you just had a baby and the stretch marks are new and fresh, apply this cream and it should do the trick!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know that my body will naturally heal itself, but I will still use it because of how quickly its helping to get rid of them.  </li>
            <li> After having my 2 beautiful children my poor body has been left looking not so beautiful with several deep stretch marks.</li>
            <li> When I became a lady, my chest grew large very quickly and I had red stretch marks.</li>
            <li> My product was somehow lost in the mail and they mailed me a new one right away.</li>
            <li> The cream is very light and not really greasy.  </li>
            <li> After two pregnancy&#x27;s I have light minor stretch marks on my stomach and the back of my legs, they are white and you can feel them (depth wise)</li>
            <li> I seriously did not have high hopes that this product would work, despite all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> You can hardly see them and they look much more smooth.</li>
            <li> The seller provided an excellent experience as far as shipping and packaging went, but the product failed me.</li>
            <li> My order was shiped prety fast that I could not beleive.</li>
            <li> The product itself doesn&#x27;t really have a smell (which I&#x27;m thankful for,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, but in the beginning I would have compared it to the way my skin smells after a night of drinking too much.</li>
            <li> I became really self conscience and wouldn&#x27;t wear shorts even when it was 100 degrees out.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> so I felt this was sold for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone struggling with embarrassing stretch marks!</li>
            <li> My skins takes everything very well</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> The product is very hydrating</li>
            <li> This cream works really</li>
            <li> /&gt;the skin feeling very smoothed.</li>
            <li> Since the cream is light you only need</li>
            <li> I really, really, hoped this cream would work, but realistically figured it was just a scam like all the others.</li>
            <li> I have about 15 on one side that are SO noticeable, and I really had to look to see them.</li>
            <li> Well I used the whole bottle and there isnt really a difference.</li>
            <li> Shipping was also fast.</li>
            <li> I really like the results I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> and there is a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I just want to say thanks to everyone that gave a review on this product</li>
            <li> it really helped me make my  purchase...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and will purchase again and again!</li>
            <li> This cream really works for me.</li>
            <li> I can tell the differences very eazy.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks look so much lighter and smoother.  </li>
            <li> it would have really made a difference.   </li>
            <li> My wife said it is very sticky.</li>
            <li> But I really didn&#x27;t see a difference on my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> i highly recommened this product!</li>
            <li> but nothing has really worked.</li>
            <li> The cream does not really give directions on how many times to apply it.</li>
            <li> I would avoid this product or ask a real doctor if it&#x27;s legitimate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know too much about stretch mark creams but decided to give this one a shot.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and I can really see a GIGANTIC difference to the problem areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the cream for a while now, and my stretch marks are still there of course, but they are much lighter than they were.  </li>
            <li> My stretch marks have lightened some, but I really use it for the tightening aspect and for the softness it gives my skin.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work.  </li>
            <li> thanks to this</li>
            <li> I started reading the reviews more carefully.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much info on the company...</li>
            <li> So the stretch marks don&#x27;t stand out as much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of stretch mark creams that didn&#x27;t work, but this one really did...</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re really noticeable.</li>
            <li> I used this whole container but did not notice a difference.</li>
            <li> and I do not plan on buying another batch to find out if it really works.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks on my thighs really seemed to diminish.</li>
            <li> but it really took a lot for me to decide if I should because of the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it lightened them up much either.</li>
            <li> I would say if you really want to get rid of your stretch marks, give it a try...</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see real results after using all the product</li>
            <li> The marks were still very visible.</li>
            <li> Since Palmer&#x27;s is also cheaper, I really recommend trying that one instead of this.</li>
            <li> so I wanted something to get rid of them even though I don&#x27;t have them as much is still did nothing for me</li>
            <li> and I have already seen very noticeable differences in my skin.  </li>
            <li> This lotion works really well</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this would work for me.</li>
            <li> so far it works a lot better on the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> Still, it was a nice moisturizer and it didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many people were paid to write these reviews, but it is just more false advertising.</li>
            <li> I have tried Strivectin on numerous occasions, and most recently I followed the directions exactly as written.</li>
            <li> Compared to other products that I use: Medela and Palmer, this cream is thicker and provide more moisture.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other products and nothing seemed to work for me.</li>
            <li> and i think i am seeing more of difference due to the time passing instead.</li>
            <li> i will keep at though because there were so many other successes.</li>
            <li> I was excited since the reviews seemed all about the same the cream helped with stretch marks I has hopes this would be my miracle cream.</li>
            <li> This is better than some of the other products out there on the market.</li>
            <li> Mainly because of the cost in relation to how much cream is in the jar.</li>
            <li> I had decent results with Mederma, but Bio-oil didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is that it&#x27;s really thick and super creamy but not oily</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to diminish their stretch marks.</li>
            <li> There is definitely something special about this cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had stretch marks for a while, the pale white kind (not very deep) from being active in sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 1 jar of this because I read all of the GREAT reviews.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> It does have a different smell to it, not necessarily bad though.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad smell just a regular cream smell.  </li>
            <li> The new ones are no longer red at all and the old ones are becoming level with the surrounding skin.     </li>
            <li> The reason I decided to review it is because I actually do notice a difference which obviously surprises me since I&#x27;ve tried SO many things.</li>
            <li> I have been using it religiously on my stretch marks i got from being pregnant.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of not taking care of my skin while I was pregnant and almost 5 years later, I still have stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have used so many different kinds of creams (including the $135 stuff from strivectin), and this is the only one that I see a difference with.  </li>
            <li> but I was mainly concerned about the ones on my arm.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for older stretch marks, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.</li>
            <li> Only mild change.</li>
            <li> They were bright red, quite long and deep.</li>
            <li> Minus wishing i hadn&#x27;t tried my experiment (only because of the results being lovely and not treating the others), i wish i had done this 9 years ago when the problem first started bothering me and worsening.</li>
            <li> Almost finished a full jar with no change at all in my current stretch marks and didn&#x27;t prevent new ones.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to fade their stretch marks.</li>
            <li> and now they&#x27;re a light silvery (clearish color), deep, and thick and most of all very embarrassing</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product because of all the 5 and 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This product is highly rated on amazon</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I had high hopes for this product but the bottom line is that it just does not work..at all.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A++, i highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the great reviews and I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I decided to do a more linguistic detective work and read reviews of other creams where truly the cream is 4 or 5 star.</li>
            <li> I am trying to fade a bunch of old stretch marks after losing a large amount of weight.  </li>
            <li> but they where a little bit more puffier in that area im going to buy this product again to see if i can lighten both areas again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems to be working as my stretch marks are a little better</li>
            <li> I will continue to use If I can get it at a place where it is a little more affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on it seeing a little improvement need more time.</li>
            <li> Considering the picture uploads on one particular blog, i decided it was worth a try being affordable and having potential to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had stretch marks on my thighs since early adolescence, from both weight gain/loss and a growth spurt, and nothing I used over the years has done so much as made the slightest dent in them.</li>
            <li> These great reviews are fake, friends.</li>
            <li> I think it didn&#x27;t work on those though because they are very severe and well over 15 years old.</li>
            <li> it even helped with an old laparscopic surgery scar that was raised in my belly button, it really smoothed it out and lightened its color too....</li>
            <li> I just massaged the cream into my inner thigh area in a circular motion until the cream was absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li> at least it didnt work for me as well as i would have liked maybe for someone with lighter marks.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m using it I can tell that it makes my skin more firm.</li>
            <li> then this is a product for you to try it actually works and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Also, it is thick and creamy, and once you work it all in your skin feels nice and smooth/healthy.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is nice and thick, it&#x27;s a whipped lotion and there is no scent, not even the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really is effective, but the results are slow and gradual.  </li>
            <li> This product really fade old and new stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I got them right after puberty in my inner thighs and hips.</li>
            <li> I am on my second jar right now.  </li>
            <li> Feel free to ask me any other questions you might have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that in 10 more weeks ill barely notice them.</li>
            <li> I just bought TONS of new shorts for the summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new crack for my skin</li>
            <li> Please note that I did not use the cream for new stretch marks</li>
            <li> Time to try something new...</li>
            <li> The product is new to the market.</li>
            <li> While it has not stopped new stretch marks from appearing, it has help fade the existing ones.</li>
            <li> I used to be overweight and during my process of losing weight, I had some new stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with both products together though and am finally seeing results after trying so many other expensive products.</li>
            <li> There are several different types of cream for stretch marks available, as well as stretch mark removal by using laser surgery.    </li>
            <li> If you are realistic about stretch mark creams, you will be pleasantly surprised by it.</li>
            <li> They are about 10 years old, as I got them when I was running in track/cross country in high school.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have very sensitive skin, and haven&#x27;t had any problems with this breaking me out/</li>
            <li> I have very large, deep marks on the sites of my bottom from growing, and they&#x27;re lighter than my natural skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I am not sure if it is safe to use during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that has not only helped,  but dramatically made a difference.  </li>
            <li> This cream has lightned my new and old silvery stretch marks about 50% in a month.</li>
            <li> My new stretch marks are still there along with the old.</li>
            <li> a con is that is does not dry fast and sticks to clothes ick)</li>
            <li> After 3 babies, I have more than my share of stretch marks, particularly very deep, dark ones on my stomach; being fair-skinned makes them quite noticeable.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on new and old (we&#x27;re talking 12 year old) stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a drastic difference, especially not after just two weeks, but I certainly figured that I would have at least seen a slight change given the GREAT reviews they gave their product and the fact</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference and didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the marks and if it was doing anything, because I usually was putting it on right before bed.</li>
            <li> By the time I finished my second, the older ones had faded too!  </li>
            <li> The texture is more thick so you need a bigger blob of lotion to cover a large area.  </li>
            <li> The ones in my breast are so clear</li>
            <li> While it left my skin soft and very moisturized, it did not remove any stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> Says it makes her skin feel amazingly soft...</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference until almost 3 week&#x27;s use, but the difference is obvious.</li>
            <li> So I decided to give this product a try and WOW</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and replenished.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> No heavy perfume smell, which I like.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantley surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 years old</li>
            <li> So far, this product has made no difference in the look or feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> (I have deep ones from pregnancy), but not as fast as I thought they would after reading some reviews.</li>
            <li> with a couple of old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Nothing i had ever tried worked and after using a prescription removal/diminishing cream for nearly 7 months with no results (at all), i gave up.</li>
            <li> About two months ago and nearly a year of having given up</li>
            <li> but even if not- i can settle for having them be nearly gone.</li>
            <li> , it keeps my skin so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am so pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> Hi everyone reading this review, I&#x27;ve had stretch marks every since I was really young</li>
            <li> I was young and embarrassed</li>
            <li> You will start to notice after a week that your skin is really soft.</li>
            <li> I will order this again and see if continued use diminishes them completely.</li>
            <li> but my skin feels anew after using it... soft, replenished and silky.</li>
            <li> Only things I recommend is to not put too much on.</li>
            <li> It is also unscented which is what I wanted for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It also makes your skin really soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying out Mederma since it&#x27;s about the same price &amp; is very well-known.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve had  luck with this stuff.</li>
            <li> really lathered this stuff on and was religious with it</li>
            <li> now i haven&#x27;t noticed any of my old stretchmarks go away</li>
            <li> and my son is almost a year old.</li>
            <li> side effects-- just soft silky skin.</li>
            <li> It works SO well and leaves my skin so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have ordered two bottles so far</li>
            <li> but I ABSOLUTELY noticed a difference after using Urban Skintrition.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for my wife for two weeks so far</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect your stretch marks to completely dissapear overnight</li>
            <li> Just started using this stretch mark cream 4 days ago and so far im feeling optimistic.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft all day.  </li>
            <li> and it has completely turned them to a lighter color.</li>
            <li> This cream really reduces the visual of  my stretchmarks.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m buying her a few for her birthday because i&#x27;m so confident itwill be her answer 13 years after starting treatments.</li>
            <li> One of my close friend recommend this cream for me, as i was unable to find any which can bring a good result.</li>
            <li> Mederma was the only other product that seemed to do anything, but it took several months, lots of $$$, and eventually (maybe because I have very light, sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> They were mostly new stretch marks with very few light old ones..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being desperate to do something -anything!- about this after I lost a good deal of weight this spring and saw marks more pronounced than ever plus loose skin, I tried this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see what happens after another few weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so rich and luxurious on my skin, leaving it firm and supple.  </li>
            <li> But for this product, it feels like everybody used the same keywords to write the reviews No other reviews available on any other website.</li>
            <li> I finished medical school last year, and after getting asked on my dermatology block by so many patients for a solution to stretch marks, I decided to investigate the subject on myself.  </li>
            <li> Not only was there no change, but the jar is really small, so if you have more than just a couple of lines</li>
            <li> I have older white stretch marks that I have had for years</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only 2 weeks and at first i was thinking this stuff don&#x27;t work,  and after a couple of days i have noticed a big difference!</li>
            <li> I had stretch marks on my breasts and booty and have tried many different products in the past.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item due to the other reviews, and I&#x27;m glad it did.</li>
            <li> Before I knew this, I figured I&#x27;d chanced upon a great product that would at the very least lighten my marks to a slight degree.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend this especially to brown skin girls.</li>
            <li> I only gave the cream four stars because I didn&#x27;t start to notice a difference until I started using it with the derma roller device (highly recommended).</li>
            <li> I have gone through about a jar and a half so far, consistent daily through the first one and slacking on the second, but i started slacking because i wasn&#x27;t seeing much difference after about a month, but i bought a second jar to wait it out.</li>
            <li> I feel a lot better running around town, bending and stretching (especially in the winter) after having applied a little Urban Skintrition.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 15 wks pregnant, so not much stretching has begun.</li>
            <li> I just fininshed my first jar and I do believe I am seeing slight improvement, which is more than I can say for the other products on the market that are even more expensive.  </li>
            <li> there not completely gone but have lighten so much im in shock.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy, doesn&#x27;t smell weird, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> still have a half of jar left, maybe it will produce better results over the long run...</li>
            <li> Also, the cream is very thick and you have to really work it in and it is not that smooth.</li>
            <li> It seems to have lessened existing scars, but it definitely has prevented new stretch marks on my chest and shoulders that have appeared from strength training.</li>
            <li> I lost a lot of weight and did wonders for my self confidence but left stretch marks all over my body that had me fearing taking off my shirt to show off my new weirs when visiting the beach or the pool.  </li>
            <li> I am 32 weeks with fraternal twins and with not a single stretchmarks so far.</li>
            <li> I have been looking forever for a product that actually works and finally I found one AND at a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li> After only one week of using this product, I&#x27;ve found my recently appearing stomach stretch marks to be fading fast.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only been using this for a month but my stretch marks have really improved and they&#x27;re definitely lighter.</li>
            <li> If I ever decide to get pregnant, I&#x27;ll probably get a few jars of this for prevention.    </li>
            <li> this product, was very surprised it actually worked, and now I recommended it to everyone!</li>
            <li> We live in Arizona and my wife has dry skin pretty much year round.</li>
            <li> Still not perfect, but this is more progress than anything else has given me!</li>
            <li> If you try it for about a week you can see a major difference.</li>
            <li> The marks faded a little bit, but I think that&#x27;s more because of the extra care and that any regular moisturizer would do the same.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to all one that suffers from stretch marks of any kind or might be pregnant and would like to prevent stretch marks...big and dark to small and light</li>
            <li> So it takes awhile, but any product that says it will give immediate results is full of crap, so this is more realistic.</li>
            <li> I generally use it twice a day unless I forget.</li>
            <li> My results so far are enough motivation to keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice daily on the stretch marks on my stomach for three weeks so far</li>
            <li> now I can barely see it.</li>
            <li> I only used this cream on my stretch marks for about 2 weeks before stopping completely, so I can&#x27;t say how it is with stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I developed very deep stretch marks on my hips and bum and around my navel at the end of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Maybe its because all my stretch marks are old (deep, silver ones),</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20-year old female.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely seen a difference.</li>
            <li> Im a 21 yr old male and did Not work on me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for old stretch marks that I&#x27;ve had since middle school.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 bottles of it already to prevent further stretch marks and keep the old ones from resurfacing.  </li>
            <li> However, I tried to use it on old white stretch marks</li>
            <li> /&gt;The amount you get seems small at first, but a small amount covers a large area, since it spreads easily, almost like wet soap spuds.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rich and creamy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the product runs out very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2.5 months, but not as consistently as I should, and I think my marks have become a bit less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I should have really followed the warnings from other customers.</li>
            <li> Using as directed, even in several areas , this little jar lasts Making definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> My old ones tended to be deep and white.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the price as my stretchmarks look exactly the same as they did before I started using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 2 months now, and no it is not a miracle cream that has magically erased my stretch marks, but it definitely has decreased the appearance of them.</li>
            <li> As an extra precaution, I tend to leave the skin bare for about 15 minutes after putting on the cream.</li>
            <li> This cream helped me complete a long journey which started the day I decided</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks and within the first few days I noticed a difference...</li>
            <li> Improvements showed the first few days i used it</li>
            <li> Natural feels but not very nice when u leave much on your skins....</li>
            <li> I almost gave up on it, but then in this last week I started to notice MAJOR improvements even in deep stretch marks that I have had since puberty.</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old male who has 10 year old stretch marks from extreme weight loss.  </li>
            <li> i have just received my first jar of this and it looks like a whipped cream, the smell is not strong but doesn&#x27;t stink just kinda there</li>
            <li> The stretch marks seem much deeper now, and less visible.  </li>
            <li> A little lotion covers a large area.  </li>
            <li> A big difference happened quickly and it slowly kept working over the course of the 2 months.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a very noticeable difference in as little as 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I only write reviews when the product is either too good or too bad and this one is exellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little pricer for just a moisture loition, but I figured compared to the other stretch mark creme prices it was worth trying.</li>
            <li> , it has a consistency of whipped butter, it&#x27;s not oily, but since it&#x27;s thick it does stay on the skin for a while and may not soak in completely right away if you put a lot on.</li>
            <li> I suggest you get a little at a time because it is really rich and creamy and this makes it harder than other creams to integrate into the skin.</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy, but not ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I never wore strapless dresses before because of them and now thanks to this product I&#x27;m going to be wearing tops/dresses with long sleeves all year round.</li>
            <li> In the past, I tried bio oil, pure cocoa butter, and vitamin e oil.</li>
            <li> Manufactures of stretch mark creams have their work cut out for them, as they are very hard (if not, impossible) to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Haha, not sure if that makes sense,</li>
            <li> Used as directed, this is the first route I went with in hopes of at least fading mine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear long sleeves 365 days a year, and thought the stretch marks on my arms looked obvious.</li>
            <li> started putting alot of the cream on my arms and stomach where I developed stretch marks and after only a few times of using this product I can tell it is starting to work.</li>
            <li> It took a long time for me to notice a difference, but, this product actually worked.  </li>
            <li> but I HATE the way my stomach looks in natural light because you can really see them then.</li>
            <li> The redness of my scars has faded and the silver from old scars is nearly gone, my deep marks are slowly filling in.</li>
            <li> Before the new product, I noticed that the Palmers had little effect on the stretch marks</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely not as bright red, more of a dull red.</li>
            <li> ive been using the product religiously and have seen little to no results so far.</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks in other places on my body (hips and booty), and I don&#x27;t really care about them because they can be hidden.</li>
            <li> had some very long and deep stretch marks from body expansion</li>
            <li> I gained about thirty pounds, lost most of it back and that mixed with bad genetics has left me with stretch marks on my arms, shoulders, breasts, hips and upper thighs.</li>
            <li> also dry brushed before showering and then applied after shower</li>
            <li> The lighter stretch marks on my thighs are now barely noticeable, while the really deep, dark marks on my stomach have faded quite a bit as well.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ve decided to loose up to about 20 pounds recently and to help with my motivation I thought I could get rid of my stretch marks to build confidence.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely erase the stretch marks but they are now very slight and faded especially compared to what they were in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would not buy this again and found it so disappointing that I&#x27;d never buy any other kind of product from Skintrition.</li>
            <li> Also, I had a lot of loose skin and this stuff has really helped firm it up!</li>
            <li> It has been a little over a month now and it hasn&#x27;t completely gotten rid of my stretch marks</li>
            <li> I also have ones on my upper thighs from the growth spurt that looked like massive tears in the skin, and they are just now, as I approach the 3 week mark, starting to fade, just a little.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much money, so I couldn&#x27;t afford to buy a product that didn&#x27;t at least get my hopes up.    </li>
            <li> I would recommend that you buy at least 2 jars to get real results</li>
            <li> I doubt they&#x27;ll ever completely disappear without laser treatment, but I would be completely satisfied if they were at least faint.</li>
            <li> Since using the cream&lt;br /&gt;alot of my stretch marks have been removed, the long deep&lt;br /&gt;stretch</li>
            <li> i dontknow how it lasted that long.</li>
            <li> oh and took way to long to ship</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young and my skin is plenty firm.</li>
            <li> It smells alot like a cream I tried a long time ago</li>
            <li> Im 20 years old and this didnt really help, I have white stretch marks and after a whole jar they are still there.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing, thick, and soothing.</li>
            <li> I have the deep puple ones from pregnacy and they seem to be a little less dark but not so much that i would recomend this product...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week now, but I have used other products like bio oil, excel stretch mark cream, and dermectin.</li>
            <li> they are just fairly deep on my stomach and upper thighs, i seen no difference at all and was a little disapointed.</li>
            <li> I am still using the product because I have stretch marks in other areas that are smaller that I would like to get rid of as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read tons of different reviews about other products but nothing seemed to describe my problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2-3 weeks (not diligently but a recommended amount (every other night and the next morning)</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> It just has a different texture compared to other creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long, so</li>
            <li> My skin gets really dry during winter</li>
            <li> I used it every day and would allow time for it to dry before I put on my cloths.</li>
            <li> only problem is that it is not cheap and you don&#x27;t only need to use one..</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are not new, so maybe it would work on newer stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> but recently due to contracting poison oak all over my body and the subsequent itching and scratching made me develop dark red marks on my belly and hips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, soothing, and first thing it did was drastically improve the skin that had been \\&quot;burned\\&quot; by the Mederma.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten a single blemish since using this product.</li>
            <li> and I have yet to get a single stretchmark.</li>
            <li> The cream does not work, applied it liberally and vigurously on a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been very skeptical with stretch mark creams because it never works for me and my skin is super sensitive</li>
            <li> marks have shortened, the dark stretch marks have lightened&lt;br /&gt;and are starting to fade away.</li>
            <li> Upon usuing a jar I definitely saw a difference in the lightening of the marks even though I am dark skinned.</li>
            <li> The stretch marks were a deep dark purple.  </li>
            <li> I can see it tightens up the skin that were loose after pregnancy and</li>
            <li> now they&#x27;re coming down my entire arm!</li>
            <li> Only problem I found is a little does not go a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin starting to feel smoother and less wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a one and a half weeks and, no, my stretch marks aren&#x27;t gone, but they are improved enough for me to leave a review.</li>
            <li> I am a puerto rican and black female with four kids.</li>
            <li> but it definitely has made them a lot lighter and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am Black female</li>
            <li> I want my money back, I&#x27;m so pissed for spending $25 on such a small jar</li>
            <li> At first i thought it was wishful seeing and got a little silly and only applied it to the deepest and darkest group on my entire stomach.</li>
            <li> first I was skeptical when I read the label and saw such a little jar containig a regular butter looking cream...</li>
            <li> I used the pregnancy version throughout my 10 months and never got a single stretch mark..and had a 9lb 9oz baby!</li>
            <li> I gained an extra 20 pounds a little quicker than my body could handle and these unsightly stretch marks appeared all over my legs, thighs and butt.</li>
            <li> The only thing this product did was make my stretchmarks a little smoother.</li>
            <li> It is so smooth and my skin just absorbs it like crazy.</li>
            <li> During my pregnancy I tried everything from oils to creams; unfortunately, I still developed deep red stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I started using it with no expectations only because i didn&#x27;t wanna waste my money</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely NO improvement.</li>
            <li> The cream is a tad expensive but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> and i recieved absolutely NO results from this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wast money on this unknown product.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no results from this stretch mark cream.</li>
            <li> I had some on my waist and my thighs which I got at the beginning of college and this product got rid of the ones on my waist but not really the ones on my thighs...</li>
            <li> I only saw a few noticeable differences.</li>
            <li> so I purchased this cream to help with the expected stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I only use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pale caucasian who had noticeable stretch marks on her lower back and hips.  </li>
            <li> Plain Vaseline seemed to work well as a prevention, but it left a trail of grease on everything I touched, stained my pajamas when I applied it before bed, and of course did nothing for the existing stretch marks.</li>
            <li> , in about 3 weeks they were smaller and not bright red like they were before.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, a little bit goes a long way, and if you put it on, do it after you shower, as it doesn&#x27;t need to come off after you&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for stretch marks I got due to a pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> When I read all the other reviews on this stretch mark cream</li>
            <li> I was extremely selective when deciding on a stretch mark product.</li>
            <li> I came extremely close to coughing up the money for Trilastin, but I became suspicious of their marketing.</li>
            <li> the ratings on other creams, and</li>
            <li> The bottle is empty, and no improvement at all!  </li>
            <li> this product did not work, i used it for over a month and with such a small tub</li>
            <li> My biggest insecurity has always been my stretch marks and for years prevented me from wearing bathing suits and other clothing items even around my closest friends.</li>
            <li> I did try other products (Maderma) and had no results like this product.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s due to this cream seeing as I haven&#x27;t used it in months.</li>
            <li> This scores a lot of points, because I&#x27;ve noticed that other creams (that have come in contact with my hands) end up on everything...</li>
            <li> My stretch marks weren&#x27;t extreme</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first</li>
            <li> thank you I have use other products</li>
            <li> You may however still use these creams for years to come and maybe they will reduce the appearance, I just didn&#x27;t have that long to invest in time wasted with creams.</li>
            <li> No funky chemicals like all the other stretch mark creams.</li>
            <li> I have tried other stretch mark creams and celtrixa.</li>
            <li> it might have made the old ones a LITTLE lighter but its hard to tell.  </li>
            <li> I know that we&#x27;re all afraid of scam reviews, but I am a real person who is not employed by or affiliated with Urban Skintrition in any way whatsoever.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve gotten a lot smoother and way less pink.</li>
            <li> only used it for a couple weeks so not sure about its effect on making stretch marks less noticable.</li>
            <li> Based on the other reviews, I was REALLY hoping that this cream would work, but unfortunately I saw no change in the appearence of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, almost smell-free and absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li> I hardly have any left!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there hasn&#x27;t been much improvement</li>
            <li> Im definitely always the negative one</li>
            <li> I gave birth last month and have been using this cream on my belly for the past few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> i dont have dark stretch marks at all</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone of tanned to dark skin tones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing but hasn&#x27;t done a thing for my stretch marks unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had a dark stretch mark on both of my arms</li>
            <li> and I have thick stretch marks all over body especially on my upper body.</li>
            <li> I think all of the good reviews are fake!!!!</li>
            <li> Within two week her stretch marks are starting to go away slowly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so self conscious with my guy friend behind</li>
            <li> I guess if I use this in conjunction with other methods like slight tanning ,marks should start to fade or appear less...</li>
            <li> I just got mine in the mail, i thought the packaging looked a little different, very plain printout on a sticker basically.  </li>
            <li> The stretch marks covered from the midpoint between my chest and my belly button down to my thighs.</li>
            <li> and I hope it works as well for me as it has for other reviewers!  </li>
            <li> and Ive tried a few other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half way finished with this cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mederma and Bio-oil previously and this product falls in between those two products price-wise.  </li>
            <li> and I have not noticed any change or even a slight fading at all.</li>
            <li> I am not pregnant, nor have i ever been.</li>
            <li> (i put it on about a half hour before i go to bed-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd that there are no directions on how you should use the cream.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a SLIGHT difference.</li>
            <li> my red/purple stretch marks turned pale and eventually white, they thinned out in size, and became hardly visible in some areas.</li>
            <li> I like how it comes in a round container instead of a squeeze bottle like some other stretch mark cream because you can get every little bit out.</li>
            <li> After searching long and hard I decided to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I noticed terrible strecth marks ON THE MIDDLE of my arms witch made me very self conscious.</li>
            <li> I have gone through half the jar in a little over a week.</li>
            <li> , it is thick cream, like someone else mentioned, so also massage it in well, and let it dry, before dressing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s helped a little bit.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to soak in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even using a little around my eyes because of the nourishing ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I did this faithfully for a little over two weeks.</li>
            <li> there are like little rivers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a little over two weeks</li>
            <li> It worked to fad my strtch marks a little.</li>
            <li> There are some areas that will take a little longer, but all scars are fading.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say other than this product has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect them to ever vanish completely, but they have caused me so much grief and prevented me from wearing shorts or bathing suits and made me so self-conscious for so long, that any reduction is nothing short of a miracle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a while back because it was cheap, and i had terrible purple stretch marks all over my arm.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 6 weeks and during that time my stretch marks actually got worse</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using the cream I already noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> The sad part is that i was ran completely out</li>
            <li> but i got a few bottles</li>
            <li> I know how personal and frustrating stretch marks can be.    </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> first I was very skeptical about the cream because I&lt;br /&gt;never heard of it before.</li>
            <li> I decided what the heck, what did I have to lose (besides a few bucks)??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product that i could afford...and even a few that i couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Within a few days i received Skin Nutrition and applied as directed.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I used it EVERYDAY twice a day (once in the morning, and once at night after I took a shower).</li>
            <li> and I took another picture a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Listen... dont buy it.... waste of $$ and time....</li>
            <li> I began to see results of this product in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, and I do mean NOTHING, its just another hyped up GIMMICK with Merchants trying to sell the product and ENHANCE SALES, And I think the REVIEWS are FAKE.  </li>
            <li> For now, my strtch marks DO seem to be a bit less noticeable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for less than a month and the difference is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> Since the product was so expensive, I decided to use shea butter on my other red stretch marks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a strong senct but</li>
            <li> Used it as directed hoping it would finally fade my old stretch marks but no luck :(  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of skintrition because of the lack of information about the company, and lack of reviews in general.</li>
            <li> I have had stretch marks for the past few years and decided I needed to do something about it.</li>
            <li> I only gave it two stars because it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it is useable as just a regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Scargo Scar Massage Lotion at least made them fainter and less pronounced.</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s less expensive and less invasive than a tummy tuck or other procedure, it might not work.</li>
            <li> and at least start to help fade them a little.  </li>
            <li> With all of the scams out there I can understand why people are skeptical, but I&#x27;m definitely not a company bot writing this.</li>
            <li> The stretch marks on my legs appear to be lighter and the length seems to be shortening or tightening, I&#x27;m not sure which.  </li>
            <li> I have used celltrixa in the past and they worked to help fade marks on my butt.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;to apply a small amount.</li>
            <li> I started using this after excessive weight gain from bodybuilding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying a small amount of product about 3-4 times per day.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t ever leave reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it seemed to work for others, but I didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works</li>
            <li> it gets really hard and flaky.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews for anything</li>
            <li> If you have hard stretch marks</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for at least a month.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been at least 4-weeks</li>
            <li> I rubbed generous amounts into my marks for at least five minutes three times a day.</li>
            <li> You would be crazy enough not to get it.</li>
            <li> I used this cream for at least a month.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;like butter\\&quot;, but not...because it&#x27;s not in the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I used almost a the whole tub of this crap on one mark (over the course of time.. not all at once) and it did nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 3 weeks, and I can slowly see my stretch marks fading</li>
            <li> thick cream...</li>
            <li> It is now my everyday body lotion!!</li>
            <li> It only made them worse!!</li>
            <li> I have horrible dark red stretch marks due to weight gain.</li>
            <li> This product is seriously a bust.</li>
            <li> and the smell is not good in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical of beauty products in general, but ever since I got stretch marks from my pregnancy, I became obsessed with getting rid of them and tried every stretch cream product on the market, even considering laser surgery as an option.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find a really&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> I decided to test the product on the newest stretch marks I had, which were also the worst ones I&#x27;ve ever had and was really looking forward to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I thought this cream was going to thin them out some</li>
            <li> It was especially frustrating to lose 40 pounds only to discover that the weight had damaged the skin all over my body.</li>
            <li> and I could swear it made my stretch marks worse with every day usage</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the ability of this product, but thought I would at least try it for the stretch marks on my stomach.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for approximately 3 weeks</li>
            <li> It is horribly greasy and very sticky.</li>
            <li> but this product has made a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> I just want to dark stretchmarks to fade. :(</li>
            <li> What a waste of money :(</li>
            <li> I am one of those who has a sensetive type skin and when there is something wrong with that nothing works.</li>
            <li> They are still there (sadly) but they are not as noticable.</li>
            <li> I am using some of these products together with the Skintrition cream in hopes they&#x27;ll work together to make bigger improvements and not give me some awful reaction.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just unfair.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;d have to say this is proving me wrong.</li>
            <li> its to greasy and smells weird.</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t expensive but for the results, the price seems infinite.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical  about this one, but decided to try it after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> so i think no matter what you put and even its expensive if your skin is prone to stretchmarks, its useless</li>
            <li> so I gave it a try since it&#x27;s not too expensive.  </li>
            <li> also tried using this on stretch marks I got as a kid as a side effect to hydrocortisone cream, and sadly it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit skeptical to continue buying because I&#x27;ve read reviews about how this is a scam.</li>
            <li> Sadly I can say it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s expensive and didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, I have not.  </li>
            <li> Even if this product were to fail at lessening the appearance of my marks, I would continue to buy it as a body butter.</li>
            <li> Sad to say, I&#x27;ve tried every cream there is for stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they are scars that will never go away.</li>
            <li> I was wrong used it for 1 month</li>
            <li> As a well-educated girl, I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of creams that claim to reduce the appearance of stretch marks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, my stretch marks are still there</li>
            <li> I have really bad stretch marks from rapid weight gain behind my knees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Avon stretch mark lotions, Mederma for stretch marks (which I hated and was over-priced), scar removal products, bio-oil, and plain cocoa butter lotions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took about 2-3 weeks to see any difference, but it became very dramatic change with time</li>
            <li> so if I happen to choose the wrong one, I WILL get a bad rash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my twenties and have a crazy amount of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> There is no shame in getting stretch marks, but there is no reason to keep these ugly marks from causing you to be uncomfortable or to feel unattractive.  </li>
            <li> The product stinks and is greasy</li>
            <li> I bought this cream thinking it would do nothing, but getting laser treatments are so expensive and time consuming!</li>
            <li> It feels very weird on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 8 weeks now and have bad marks on my legs and under my arms, this product has showed noticeable improvement in both areas.</li>
            <li> it peeled my skin so badly, it looked and felt like I had</li>
            <li> They are not too bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really bad stretch marks for years</li>
            <li> I used to use mederma, which had a bad smell to it, for two years.</li>
            <li> and worst it makes you feel all greasy and my stretch marks have gotten worse since using this product the product I used before helped keep those stretch marks at bay</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed, as I went into it</li>
            <li> If not, you&#x27;ll be disappointed by everything.     </li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t :(</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am disappointed it does not help relieve an itchy belly</li>
            <li> Im a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews on products that are meant to reverse the appearance of stretch marks before making this purchase, and I was still really disappointed after choosing this one.</li>
            <li> i am truly disappointed, just another scam.</li>
            <li> Hopefully does this does the trick!I should&#x27;ve gotten the scented though:(</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed, it just didn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> So I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do crap!</li>
            <li> Putting clothes on after using is awful and it doesn&#x27;t seem to fully absorb into the skin.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m half way finished with this cream and it&#x27;s helped a little bit. exfoliating skin prior application helps and keep skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have those horrendous stretch marks on my stomach that are brig red/pink ish. I tell you this so you know why I bought this cream. It is so smooth and my skin just absorbs it like crazy. I have only been using it for about 2 weeks and I can already tell a bit of differnence.the skin of the stretch marks is smoother, and the color has faded a shade. Still not perfect, but this is more progress than anything else has given me!</li>
            <li> I am one of those who has a sensetive type skin and when there is something wrong with that nothing works. I had a lot of deep streach marks and I used some oils which did not worked for me. I bought this cream only because of its shea oil and it worked for me amazingly. My strech marks around my breast are faded after one month and on my leg they are not as deep as before. I use it once in the morning and once at night. In addition I recommand this seller. My order was shiped prety fast that I could not beleive.</li>
            <li> Says it makes her skin feel amazingly soft...only used it for a couple weeks so not sure about its effect on making stretch marks less noticable.</li>
            <li> I decided to test the product on the newest stretch marks I had, which were also the worst ones I&#x27;ve ever had and was really looking forward to get rid of. They were bright red, quite long and deep. I&#x27;ve tried Avon stretch mark lotions, Mederma for stretch marks (which I hated and was over-priced), scar removal products, bio-oil, and plain cocoa butter lotions. None of those products worked, but this one seems to be doing well. I&#x27;ve used about 1/3 of the product (for almost 3 weeks now), trying to remember to use it twice a day but sometimes only once. I&#x27;ve had no kids, just have stretch marks from various weight loss and gain that&#x27;s ruined my skin. The product itself doesn&#x27;t really have a smell (which I&#x27;m thankful for, the Mederma one I used smelled strongly of hospital soap, ew.), it has a consistency of whipped butter, it&#x27;s not oily, but since it&#x27;s thick it does stay on the skin for a while and may not soak in completely right away if you put a lot on. It also does not stain clothes. The reason I decided to review it is because I actually do notice a difference which obviously surprises me since I&#x27;ve tried SO many things. They&#x27;re definitely not as bright red, more of a dull red. They&#x27;re a lot softer and not as deep. Once I&#x27;ve finished with this container, I plan on getting another one. I really think this was a worthwhile purchase. If you do decide to buy this, just remember to use it twice a day and stay patient. I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference until almost 3 week&#x27;s use, but the difference is obvious.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over two weeks, and already there is an exceptional difference. The stretch marks are lighter and smoother. The lotion has a pleasant smell/very nuetral. Also, it is thick and creamy, and once you work it all in your skin feels nice and smooth/healthy. Great product. I will definatly recommend to all my gilfriends.</li>
            <li> I have been battling stretch marks since having my daughter in 2009 and nothing works. I found this product on amazon and read all the great reviews. I am happy to say that they are a lot lighter now, not completely gone but much better than before! I will be ordering more of this product once mine runs out!</li>
            <li> Hi everyone,  I never leave reviews for products I buy, but felt compelled to leave a review of this product in hopes of helping others. I&#x27;m in my twenties and have a crazy amount of stretch marks. I gained about thirty pounds, lost most of it back and that mixed with bad genetics has left me with stretch marks on my arms, shoulders, breasts, hips and upper thighs. I have tried Strivectin on numerous occasions, and most recently I followed the directions exactly as written. In the past, I tried bio oil, pure cocoa butter, and vitamin e oil. This was all to no avail. It only left me with greasy skin! I began considering carboxytherapy, but figured I&#x27;d wait until I found a good deal on it and lost about ten more pounds.     I was skeptical of skintrition because of the lack of information about the company, and lack of reviews in general. I figured I&#x27;d try it anyways since it&#x27;s so cheap, and I am so happy I did. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, but in the beginning I would have compared it to the way my skin smells after a night of drinking too much. Haha, not sure if that makes sense, but I guess most people would say it smells like some kind of plant. Its a pretty neutral smell. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, and I definitely see a noticeable difference. I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed to wear armless, because they have faded enough to practically blend in with my skin. I haven&#x27;t worn armless shirts since middle school!! Now, my stretch marks aren&#x27;t invisible (yet), but for two weeks time, the results are amazing. With all of the scams out there I can understand why people are skeptical, but I&#x27;m definitely not a company bot writing this. For what it&#x27;s worth, I have an olive complexion, and medium skin tone. Feel free to ask me any other questions you might have.</li>
            <li> I gained an extra 20 pounds a little quicker than my body could handle and these unsightly stretch marks appeared all over my legs, thighs and butt. I became really self conscience and wouldn&#x27;t wear shorts even when it was 100 degrees out. Sooo I went on and checked for products. I tried the bio oil because I heard it worked for stretch marks. I used it for about 6 weeks and during that time my stretch marks actually got worse bc I was still gaining weight. So I decided to give this product a try and WOW, in about 3 weeks they were smaller and not bright red like they were before. This isn&#x27;t a cure, you have to use it regularly or it won&#x27;t work. But WHO CARES it worked for me!! I just bought TONS of new shorts for the summer. THANK YOU!!!!</li>
            <li> I should have really followed the warnings from other customers. This product did absolutely nothing also if you leave it open it gets really hard and flaky. What a waste of money :(</li>
            <li> I recently noticed stretch marks on my upper arms. I have stretch marks in other places on my body (hips and booty), and I don&#x27;t really care about them because they can be hidden. I can&#x27;t wear long sleeves 365 days a year, and thought the stretch marks on my arms looked obvious. Within a few days of using the cream I already noticed a difference. They are still there (sadly) but they are not as noticable. But as I said, these are fresh stretch marks. I have used the cream on my butt and hips, which have been there for years, and I haven&#x27;t had results as good as on my arms. Also, I love that there is no smell to this product.</li>
            <li> I recently gave birth to a healthy baby boy. During my pregnancy I tried everything from oils to creams; unfortunately, I still developed deep red stretch marks. My friend recommended I try this cream and it has improved the color of my stretch marks (not so red anymore). They are slowly becoming lighter as I continue to use it. I did not realize that stretch marks would be such a hassle during my pregnancy but hopefully as I begin to lose my prego weight, the stretch marks will continue to disappear. I know that my body will naturally heal itself, but I will still use it because of how quickly its helping to get rid of them.  I&#x27;m recommending this to all my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li> Pros:  This product works great for post partum.  I can see it tightens up the skin that were loose after pregnancy and with that it fades away most of the stretch mark. Compared to other products that I use: Medela and Palmer, this cream is thicker and provide more moisture.  I was not afraid that it&#x27;s going to be sticky at first, but it gets absorbed easily and quickly.  Cons:  - I am not sure if it is safe to use during pregnancy. I wish they add that information in their product  - If you like fragrance then this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 8 weeks now and have bad marks on my legs and under my arms, this product has showed noticeable improvement in both areas. I would recommend using it. Also it works well as a nice moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a while back because it was cheap, and i had terrible purple stretch marks all over my arm. After receiving this product i never used it till like a month or so after because i thought it was just another lowsy cream. I started using it with no expectations only because i didn&#x27;t wanna waste my money and OMG prolly like 4 or 5 weeks after my stretch marks became silver. The sad part is that i was ran completely out but of course i&#x27;m gon purchase some more...i highly recommend this especially to brown skin girls. works really great:)</li>
            <li> I used this product for stretch marks I got due to a pregnancy. It really helped moisturize and smooth out my stretch marks. Leaves skin feeling soft and replenished.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a month ago.  I was skeptical at first but read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  This product really fade old and new stretch marks.  After my pregnancy I had stretch marks on my legs and stomach. Now that I have been using skintrition, they are not as deep and starting to fade away.  I can tell a huge difference now that I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> I have just recieved the item in the mail...took about 6 buisiness days to get here. I have just used it two times...it&#x27;s rich and creamy and a little goes a long way. I like how it comes in a round container instead of a squeeze bottle like some other stretch mark cream because you can get every little bit out. Mild smell. Like I said I just got it so I don&#x27;t know if it improves stretch marks but I will keep you updated.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for awhile, though I haven&#x27;t used it on a regular basis yet.  I can say that it does moisturize well and it absorbs easily into your skin.  The cream is very light and not really greasy.  I have sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this cream.  No heavy perfume smell, which I like.  It does have a different smell to it, not necessarily bad though.  I almost think it has a \\&quot;plant-like\\&quot; smell to it. Regardless, it&#x27;s worth a try and I hope it works as well for me as it has for other reviewers!  I&#x27;ve seen similar creams go for $100 so I felt this was sold for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the great reviews. I&#x27;m only 15 wks pregnant, so not much stretching has begun. But hopefully this product works!</li>
            <li> I have horrible dark red stretch marks due to weight gain. I have tried many other products and nothing seemed to work for me. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and my red stretch marks are now barley noticeable!! Its amazing! But you have to be committed, I put the cream on in the mornings and at night. I would recommend this product to anyone with stubborn stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice a day for a month and saw zero results.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but perhaps something, anything but nothing.  I was a bit disappointed, as I went into it thinking I wouldn&#x27;t see a huge change, but I saw no difference at all.  Well, on to the next.</li>
            <li> Based on the other reviews, I was REALLY hoping that this cream would work, but unfortunately I saw no change in the appearence of my stretch marks. Not only was there no change, but the jar is really small, so if you have more than just a couple of lines you&#x27;re trying to soften, then you might wanna go for a different product with a larger bottle/jar.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after I saw all the great reviews, I personally saw results in ONE DAY!!! I put it on when I got out the shower in the morning, then at night I went to apply more, and they were faded already! I feel great already! I would highly recommend this to anyone struggling with embarrassing stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago and started using it as directed. I almost gave up on it, but then in this last week I started to notice MAJOR improvements even in deep stretch marks that I have had since puberty. I have noticed a lot of faxing and smoothing of my skin. I love this product! I&#x27;m starting to feel much more confident. I will definitely purchase it again once mine runs out, which probably won&#x27;t be for another three weeks or so. Using as directed, even in several areas , this little jar lasts Making definitely worth the investment. Thanks to the company for making such a great product!   Cheers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had stretch marks on my thighs since early adolescence, from both weight gain/loss and a growth spurt, and nothing I used over the years has done so much as made the slightest dent in them. Plain Vaseline seemed to work well as a prevention, but it left a trail of grease on everything I touched, stained my pajamas when I applied it before bed, and of course did nothing for the existing stretch marks. Mederma was the only other product that seemed to do anything, but it took several months, lots of $$$, and eventually (maybe because I have very light, sensitive skin) it peeled my skin so badly, it looked and felt like I had burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being desperate to do something -anything!- about this after I lost a good deal of weight this spring and saw marks more pronounced than ever plus loose skin, I tried this product. Mainly because of the cost in relation to how much cream is in the jar. It&#x27;s very thick, soothing, and first thing it did was drastically improve the skin that had been \\&quot;burned\\&quot; by the Mederma. The marks on my inner thighs started to lighten slightly after a week, which is impressive in and of itself since they are so old. Another thing I am noticing is that the surrounding skin is tightening - nothing drastic, though the improvement is undeniable. I also have ones on my upper thighs from the growth spurt that looked like massive tears in the skin, and they are just now, as I approach the 3 week mark, starting to fade, just a little. But again, I&#x27;ve had these particular stretch marks for something around 17-18 YEARS, and this is truthfully the most improvement I&#x27;ve ever seen. I don&#x27;t expect them to ever vanish completely, but they have caused me so much grief and prevented me from wearing shorts or bathing suits and made me so self-conscious for so long, that any reduction is nothing short of a miracle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month now and I am seeing great results. I hardly ever write reviews for anything but this product deserves it. I ordered it not expecting it to work. I was pleasantley surprised.I have noticed an improvement in stretch marks and skin firmness.I will continue to purchase this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen any results but it makes your skin smooth...still have a half of jar left, maybe it will produce better results over the long run...</li>
            <li> I just fininshed my first jar and I do believe I am seeing slight improvement, which is more than I can say for the other products on the market that are even more expensive.  The stretch marks on my legs appear to be lighter and the length seems to be shortening or tightening, I&#x27;m not sure which.  Either way there is a mild improvement.  I did reorder my second jar, so I will let you know if things keep improving, but so far so good.  I would recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> its sounds great with all the things that they list.. but i got a few bottles and i didnt see 1 improvement.. then i went on to getting stri-vectin SD and that works soo much better then this product it might be a biit pricey but its with every cent!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical of beauty products in general, but ever since I got stretch marks from my pregnancy, I became obsessed with getting rid of them and tried every stretch cream product on the market, even considering laser surgery as an option.  My friend swore that this product worked for her, so I decided to give it a try.  After about 2 weeks, I was very pleased that the color of the scars had faded a bit and were definitely less noticeable.  After about 3 months of continuous use, the scars have faded to the point where I don&#x27;t feel self-conscious about them at all and are basically invisible.  It&#x27;s a great deal, especially now that Amazon is offering free shipping. I will continue to recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 years old and I had a baby on Dec. 30, 2010. I no longer breastfeed and have a medium to medium tan complexion. I have stretchmarks on my abdomen and front hip area, if that makes sense, from pregnancy. So far, this product has made no difference in the look or feel of my skin. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week now, but I have used other products like bio oil, excel stretch mark cream, and dermectin. I am using some of these products together with the Skintrition cream in hopes they&#x27;ll work together to make bigger improvements and not give me some awful reaction. I have noticed my skin starting to feel smoother and less wrinkled. I just want to dark stretchmarks to fade. :( I have used celltrixa in the past and they worked to help fade marks on my butt. ( I&#x27;m  slim &amp; fit but my skin is prone to getting stretchmarks anyway.) Maybe I&#x27;ll go back to that or try strivectin.</li>
            <li> When I read all the other reviews on this stretch mark cream I was for sure I thought it would work for me.  I&#x27;m African American and I have thick stretch marks all over body especially on my upper body. I thought this cream was going to thin them out some and at least start to help fade them a little.  Unfortunately, there hasn&#x27;t been much improvement and I have been using it for at least a month.  I am going to continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone but I do not plan on rebuying it. Also, the cream is very thick and you have to really work it in and it is not that smooth.</li>
            <li> I had a mishap with getting this item kin the mail. Note to sellers: USPS is 2008, this is 2013, and I am quite used to the efficiency and convenience of UPS, so I suggest you go that route. However, the product did work well,so I plan on buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa Phillips</li>
            <li> If you are looking to remove stretch marks then grab this before it disappear. It takes little-bit time to repair marks, but it will work. use twice a day on clean skin for two months, you will see results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I had my doubts. After 3 babies, I have more than my share of stretch marks, particularly very deep, dark ones on my stomach; being fair-skinned makes them quite noticeable. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 3 weeks and am impressed! The lighter stretch marks on my thighs are now barely noticeable, while the really deep, dark marks on my stomach have faded quite a bit as well. Obviously I&#x27;m not expecting my stretch marks to be \\&quot;erased\\&quot;, but any improvement is welcome. My results so far are enough motivation to keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Are you plagued by unsightly stretch marks that embarrass you and keep you from wearing some of the cute new styles of clothing that you love? Anyone can get stretch marks, whether it&#x27;s from preganancy, sudden increase in your weight, or rapid growth.  There is no shame in getting stretch marks, but there is no reason to keep these ugly marks from causing you to be uncomfortable or to feel unattractive.  There are several different types of cream for stretch marks available, as well as stretch mark removal by using laser surgery.    learn more at [...]</li>
            <li> I was extremely selective when deciding on a stretch mark product. I don&#x27;t have much money, so I couldn&#x27;t afford to buy a product that didn&#x27;t at least get my hopes up.    I have olive skin and white, deep stretch marks. It was especially frustrating to lose 40 pounds only to discover that the weight had damaged the skin all over my body. I&#x27;m finally 135 pounds, but I still won&#x27;t wear a bathing suit. I&#x27;m 21 and I&#x27;ve never had a child, it&#x27;s just unfair. I came extremely close to coughing up the money for Trilastin, but I became suspicious of their marketing. Urban Skintrition&#x27;s lack of marketing and reviews made me equally suspicious, but I chose it because of the price.    It.    Is.    Awesome.    If you are realistic about stretch mark creams, you will be pleasantly surprised by it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a one and a half weeks and, no, my stretch marks aren&#x27;t gone, but they are improved enough for me to leave a review. My newer stretch marks, the ones from weight gain, tended to be reddish. My old ones tended to be deep and white. The new ones are no longer red at all and the old ones are becoming level with the surrounding skin.     I have been using the cream daily (sometimes twice) and quite generously. I have gone through half the jar in a little over a week. Still, it is relatively inexpensive for a stretch mark cream. If it continues to improve my stretch marks at the same rate, I will order another.    Also, it has the texture of whipped butter. It feels amazing and has a very light, neutral, warm smell. It is a little greasy, but not ridiculous. As an extra precaution, I tend to leave the skin bare for about 15 minutes after putting on the cream. It takes a little while to soak in and I don&#x27;t want it getting absorbed by fabric.    I&#x27;ve been using the product along with Palmer&#x27;s firming lotion. I do not apply them to the same place at the same time, but I do occasionally apply some Palmer&#x27;s lotion in the middle of the day. I was using the Palmer&#x27;s before the Urban Skintrition, so I don&#x27;t know for sure if the Palmer&#x27;s is beneficial. Before the new product, I noticed that the Palmers had little effect on the stretch marks but it did make my skin feel wonderfully velvety.    If you&#x27;re going to try the cream route for stretch mark improvement, you have to make the most of the product by using it often and generously. If not, you&#x27;ll be disappointed by everything.     I did not expect a visible, touchable improvement so soon. I&#x27;m excited to see what happens after another few weeks. I doubt they&#x27;ll ever completely disappear without laser treatment, but I would be completely satisfied if they were at least faint. If I ever decide to get pregnant, I&#x27;ll probably get a few jars of this for prevention.    I know that we&#x27;re all afraid of scam reviews, but I am a real person who is not employed by or affiliated with Urban Skintrition in any way whatsoever. I really am trying to help other people make a good choice. I know how personal and frustrating stretch marks can be.    Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I bought this about 2 months ago. I have been using it religiously on my stretch marks i got from being pregnant. The stretch marks covered from the midpoint between my chest and my belly button down to my thighs. They were mostly new stretch marks with very few light old ones.. I saw absolutely NO improvement. My skins takes everything very well so I assumed this would work. But it didn&#x27;t :(</li>
            <li> cant say enough! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to fade their stretch marks. i say fade because i sincerely believe thats the best that will happen. Ive done my research! cant get rid of them but this product has made a dramatic difference. Im definitely always the negative one but i&#x27;d have to say this is proving me wrong.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my stretch marks. I used them on both white and red and I can honestly say I saw no difference at all. Since the product was so expensive, I decided to use shea butter on my other red stretch marks. I saw a bigger difference with that instead. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I don&#x27;t know how many people were paid to write these reviews, but it is just more false advertising.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I am starting to notice a difference! I have older white stretch marks that I have had for years and they appear to be getting softer in color and texture. The product is very hydrating and I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy. I generally use it twice a day unless I forget. Overall very happy with the product and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The product came fast and feels great just started using it so c  an&#x27;t really say how it does on stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product. I&#x27;m a chubby college student, and I&#x27;ve had stretch marks for a while but recently due to contracting poison oak all over my body and the subsequent itching and scratching made me develop dark red marks on my belly and hips. I bought this product due to the great reviews and I have wasted my money. The product stinks and is greasy and I could swear it made my stretch marks worse with every day usage (like it was directed).</li>
            <li> I have one prominent stretch mark and this did nothing along the lines of making it go away. I used almost a the whole tub of this crap on one mark (over the course of time.. not all at once) and it did nothing. Hopefully it works for you though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 3 weeks, and I can slowly see my stretch marks fading (I have deep ones from pregnancy), but not as fast as I thought they would after reading some reviews. I guess patience is the key! Also, I had a lot of loose skin and this stuff has really helped firm it up! I hardly have any left! So I guess if it doesn&#x27;t work for stretch marks, I&#x27;ll definately buy it as a skin firming agent! Overall, I would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> I used this product every day as directed and have not seen any results.  I have been using it for almost 2 months and cannot notice any change at all in my stretch marks.  My stretch marks are not new, so maybe it would work on newer stretch marks.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad they started selling this on Amazon!  I gave birth last month and have been using this cream on my belly for the past few weeks now.  I can already see an improvement in my stretch marks!  I&#x27;m even using a little around my eyes because of the nourishing ingredients.  This is such a great product and at a low price.   I love this cream so much I&#x27;m buying more for my friends and family.</li>
            <li> This cream works really *GREAT*!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was very skeptical about the cream because I&lt;br /&gt;never heard of it before. It&#x27;s very hard to find a really&lt;br /&gt;good product these days and you want to know what you&#x27;re&lt;br /&gt;investing your money in. The ratings on the cream is what&lt;br /&gt;helped me out alot. I compared the ratings on \\&quot;Skinitron\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;to the ratings on other creams, and I decided&lt;br /&gt;to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some very long and deep stretch marks from body expansion&lt;br /&gt;along with a couple of old stretch marks. Since using the cream&lt;br /&gt;alot of my stretch marks have been removed, the long deep&lt;br /&gt;stretch marks have shortened, the dark stretch marks have lightened&lt;br /&gt;and are starting to fade away. The cream is working on the old&lt;br /&gt;stretch marks also, but it just takes more time and patience because&lt;br /&gt;those marks are older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, the cream should be used twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is very light and moisturized. It leaves&lt;br /&gt;the skin feeling very smoothed. Also the jar lasts for a while if&lt;br /&gt;you apply the cream right. Since the cream is light you only need&lt;br /&gt;to apply a small amount. I&#x27;m gonna stick to this product.&lt;br /&gt;This was a wise investment!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream thinking it would do nothing, but getting laser treatments are so expensive and time consuming! I decided what the heck, what did I have to lose (besides a few bucks)?? I read all the reviews for this product and many others as well, and this one seemed to positively affect many people. I figured it was my best shot at getting rid of these hideous stretch marks. I really, really, hoped this cream would work, but realistically figured it was just a scam like all the others. I have to say it is NOT like all the others, because it actually works!!!!! I cannot stress how happy I am to be leaving this review!!!!!     After receiving it, I put it on right away, and did so for about a week. I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference and didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the marks and if it was doing anything, because I usually was putting it on right before bed. I just looked at them this morning after my shower and I had to take a minute to look for them!!! They weren&#x27;t \\&quot;right there\\&quot; anymore!!! EEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!! I showed my husband had he was completely impressed too. I have about 15 on one side that are SO noticeable, and I really had to look to see them. I can&#x27;t describe what this cream has done, but it has already given me awesome results!! I of course then PILED it on today everywhere else on my body that I had something that I wanted gone! Haha!     It is not a miracle cream though, and does not make the stretch mark disappear, but it DOES makes it highly unnoticeable (which for me is good enough).     *****I have NEVER left a review of any product I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon (I buy here a lot), and I just had to search to figure out how. However, because I am so impressed with the results I am getting, I had to!!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product when you first try it. you put it on and see your stretch marks go away . great but once you stop using the product your stretch marks re appear again .</li>
            <li> It WORKS.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this based on all of the great reviews. I never heard of this product before but I figured I&#x27;ll try it. Well I used the whole bottle and there isnt really a difference. I have white stretchmarks on my inner thighs and also on my lower back. I absolutely hate them and I tried everything and nothing works. So I am very disappointed. The only thing this product did was make my stretchmarks a little smoother.</li>
            <li> &lt;i bought this because I saw good reviews about it. The bottle is empty, and no improvement at all!  I&#x27;m so disappointed, it just didn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> this product did not work, i used it for over a month and with such a small tub i dontknow how it lasted that long. i dont have dark stretch marks at all they are just fairly deep on my stomach and upper thighs, i seen no difference at all and was a little disapointed. its to greasy and smells weird. oh and took way to long to ship even forgot i had ordered it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mederma and Bio-oil previously and this product falls in between those two products price-wise.  I had decent results with Mederma, but Bio-oil didn&#x27;t do much.  I&#x27;m giving this product a 5 star review because of the price point and effectiveness.  It&#x27;s cheaper than Mederma and it continued to work where Mederma stopped.    My stretch marks smoothed out a lot more after using this.  I wasn&#x27; expecting too much more after using Mederma but I was pleasantly surprised.  Shipping was also fast.</li>
            <li> Hey y&#x27;all,  I&#x27;m 19 and have stretch marks along my sides since i was 10. I&#x27;ve tried every product that i could afford...and even a few that i couldn&#x27;t. My biggest insecurity has always been my stretch marks and for years prevented me from wearing bathing suits and other clothing items even around my closest friends. Nothing i had ever tried worked and after using a prescription removal/diminishing cream for nearly 7 months with no results (at all), i gave up. About two months ago and nearly a year of having given up, i stumbled upon a rave about this product on several websites. Considering the picture uploads on one particular blog, i decided it was worth a try being affordable and having potential to work. Within a few days i received Skin Nutrition and applied as directed. As two weeks went by a started noticing that one set of stretch marks in particular seemed lighter and more surfaced. At first i thought it was wishful seeing and got a little silly and only applied it to the deepest and darkest group on my entire stomach. A month later, they are 90% lighter and when i close my eyes and feel over my skin, i don&#x27;t even feel them anymore! Minus wishing i hadn&#x27;t tried my experiment (only because of the results being lovely and not treating the others), i wish i had done this 9 years ago when the problem first started bothering me and worsening. I plan on ordering this once more, unless more is needed, and getting rid...or close to rid, of my stretch marks! While i still have a few in the area i experimented on, the change has been so welcomed and loved that i would recommend this product to ANYone who would be willing to try it. Hopefully it will continue to work and make them vanish all together but even if not- i can settle for having them be nearly gone. I hope it works for everyone as well as it has for me because this has been a true blessing. My sister struggles with stretch marks as well and i&#x27;m buying her a few for her birthday because i&#x27;m so confident itwill be her answer 13 years after starting treatments.</li>
            <li> I started using this after excessive weight gain from bodybuilding. I really like the results I&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s been at least 4-weeks and I notice my stretch marks to be lighter and smoother than before. I did try other products (Maderma) and had no results like this product. The price is affordable and the quantity is fair for the price. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to diminish their stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the ability of this product, but thought I would at least try it for the stretch marks on my stomach. I bought a container and used it for a month and noticed a difference so I bought a second container and have since used it and there is a very noticeable difference. The stretch marks are much lighter and less noticeable and I am very pleased with the results. For this price I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle; this cream did the job.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything in the store to help my stretch marks. This cream worked like a charm. My skin gets really dry during winter so I started to use it all over, it keeps my skin so soft and moisturized. It is now my everyday body lotion!!</li>
            <li> i have just received my first jar of this and it looks like a whipped cream, the smell is not strong but doesn&#x27;t stink just kinda there but the smell fades, i just showered and applied it to my thighs, butt, breast, and my wrinkly belly (pregnancy).  i like the way it feels on my skin and am looking forward for the improvements to come, will keep you guys updated.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream daily for a week now and I can see the difference in my stretch marks and they are fading quite nicely.  I am going to keep using this product for sure!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only 2 weeks and at first i was thinking this stuff don&#x27;t work,  and after a couple of days i have noticed a big difference! there not completely gone but have lighten so much im in shock.  i have 2 kids and have very deep stretch marks . I just want to say thanks to everyone that gave a review on this product it really helped me make my  purchase... i will be buying more ... greAT PRICE ! :)</li>
            <li> I seriously did not have high hopes that this product would work, despite all the great reviews. But I figured what the hell and I ordered it. After two pregnancy&#x27;s I have light minor stretch marks on my stomach and the back of my legs, they are white and you can feel them (depth wise) They are not too bad but I HATE the way my stomach looks in natural light because you can really see them then. Anyways, I just got this product yesterday and after four applications I kid you not, my stomach looks awesome, even in natural light! You can hardly see them and they look much more smooth. This product is no joke, I am sold!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works on my stretch marks.  It&#x27;s so rich and luxurious on my skin, leaving it firm and supple.  I have been looking forever for a product that actually works and finally I found one AND at a reasonable cost.  Highly recommended and will purchase again and again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice daily on the stretch marks on my stomach for three weeks so far and I have not noticed any change or even a slight fading at all. I&#x27;ll keep using it just in case it happens eventually though.</li>
            <li> Just about 3 weeks after birth. This cream really works for me. I can tell the differences very eazy. The stretch marks fade alot. Order 2 more again, wish it keep working for me.</li>
            <li> After only one week of using this product, I&#x27;ve found my recently appearing stomach stretch marks to be fading fast.  I&#x27;ve been applying a small amount of product about 3-4 times per day.  I&#x27;m very impressed and feeling confident that continuing to use the rest of the bottle should take care of my stretch mark problem.  If it doesn&#x27;t, I think one more jar will do the trick.  It&#x27;s non-greasy, doesn&#x27;t smell weird, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.  Received quickly!</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t expensive but for the results, the price seems infinite.  After using the entire jar, this product did not visibly reduce the discoloration or depth of my stretch marks in any way.    I am a 30 year old male who has 10 year old stretch marks from extreme weight loss.  I am light-skinned African American.  I used the product primarily on my arms where my stretch marks are most noticeable.  I would not recommend this product to anyone of tanned to dark skin tones.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of not taking care of my skin while I was pregnant and almost 5 years later, I still have stretch marks. I have been using this cream for 2 months now, and no it is not a miracle cream that has magically erased my stretch marks, but it definitely has decreased the appearance of them. They are lighter and blend in better. I expect with continual use, it can make a greater significance. Just make sure to use it twice a day, consistency is the key with this product.</li>
            <li> After having my 2 beautiful children my poor body has been left looking not so beautiful with several deep stretch marks. This cream is rich, has a nice smell and after using it as directed for 2 weeks I&#x27;ve already begun to see results. The redness of my scars has faded and the silver from old scars is nearly gone, my deep marks are slowly filling in. I&#x27;m confident that in 10 more weeks ill barely notice them. Great product, great price, so far great results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks. I have to say that I am disappointed it does not help relieve an itchy belly :/ and worst it makes you feel all greasy and my stretch marks have gotten worse since using this product the product I used before helped keep those stretch marks at bay Im going back to it I used Mama Mio Tummy Butter much better!!</li>
            <li> I am on my second jar. It&#x27;s my new crack for my skin lol. This stuff works. I am a puerto rican and black female with four kids. I have stretch marks that have been on me for years. This cream has lightned my new and old silvery stretch marks about 50% in a month. I saw results in a week. And this is coming from a person who used to use StriVectin. I wish I knew about this when I was prego I probably wouldn&#x27;t even have stretch marks. LOVET THIS STUFF!!!</li>
            <li> I am so pleasantly surprised by this product.  I have used so many different kinds of creams (including the $135 stuff from strivectin), and this is the only one that I see a difference with.  My stretch marks look so much lighter and smoother.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this at the beginning of summer!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks and within the first few days I noticed a difference... after the full two weeks my stretch marks on my stomach were so light and much smaller I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was working.   I am still using the product because I have stretch marks in other areas that are smaller that I would like to get rid of as well. I am still using the product on my stomach they will never go away, I know that but this has made confidence level much higher. I just wish I had found this product sooner and had this while I was pregnant it would have really made a difference.   I recommend this to all one that suffers from stretch marks of any kind or might be pregnant and would like to prevent stretch marks...big and dark to small and light you will notice a difference!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first review i have written on ANYTHING. ive tried hundreds of products of every kind. I am not pregnant, nor have i ever been. I have struggled with weight my entire life and i had noticable RED stretch marks on my sides and stomach. Ive been using this product for two months (i put it on about a half hour before i go to bed- a con is that is does not dry fast and sticks to clothes ick) but i cannot tell you how big of a difference this product has made. If i would of known this would have worked so well i would of taken before and after pictures. My stretch marks are no longer red, they are so faded  you have to LOOK for them- although im sure they will never fully disappear i am so so happy with this product i reccomend for anyone who is looking for a REAL miracle product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream based on the wonderful \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; reviews before finding out that they&#x27;d been written by the company to increase sales. These great reviews are fake, friends. Before I knew this, I figured I&#x27;d chanced upon a great product that would at the very least lighten my marks to a slight degree.  The instructions advocate using this twice a day on your marks. I did them one better and used it three times a day on certain areas. I did this faithfully for a little over two weeks. Guess what happened? Nothing. I don&#x27;t need to use this for two more to know it&#x27;s not going to work and furthermore, I&#x27;ve pretty much run out of the cream already. If you have many stretch marks, like I do, this cream will not last you a month.   I was aggressive with the cream. I rubbed generous amounts into my marks for at least five minutes three times a day. Two of the times I used it on a daily basis, I applied right after a warm bath so my skin would be more pliant and permeable. Nothing. My marks have not changed whatsoever.   I really don&#x27;t think two more weeks would have changed them, nor two more months. The only thing I&#x27;ll say for this cream is that it soaks in well and seems to have made my skin firmer, but it definitely does not do a thing for stretch marks. I&#x27;m young and my skin is plenty firm. What I need is a product that will do what it says it will do and not come from a company that has to LIE and FABRICATE reviews for it&#x27;s products.  Scargo Scar Massage Lotion at least made them fainter and less pronounced. It&#x27;s also cheaper than this product.    I would not buy this again and found it so disappointing that I&#x27;d never buy any other kind of product from Skintrition. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a drastic difference, especially not after just two weeks, but I certainly figured that I would have at least seen a slight change given the GREAT reviews they gave their product and the fact I used it three times a day faithfully.</li>
            <li> Hi everyone reading this review, I&#x27;ve had stretch marks every since I was really young and now they&#x27;re a light silvery (clearish color), deep, and thick and most of all very embarrassing; I&#x27;ve decided to loose up to about 20 pounds recently and to help with my motivation I thought I could get rid of my stretch marks to build confidence. I&#x27;ve read tons of different reviews about other products but nothing seemed to describe my problem. I heard from other reviews this product is good, bought it and I think it&#x27;s worth every penny I&#x27;ve paid for it. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2-3 weeks (not diligently but a recommended amount (every other night and the next morning) and it is AMAZING! I&#x27;ve never written a review about anything in my life, but this product is worth every word I&#x27;m writing. You would be crazy enough not to get it. I got the mango sent and I like it it&#x27;s not a strong senct but a nice mellow sent. I plan on buying more when I get the money.    I also put it on my face at night because my skin is very sensitive and it dries out quickly after washing my face. I haven&#x27;t gotten a single blemish since using this product. If you try it for about a week you can see a major difference.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a christmas gift for a friend.  She loves this as she calls me all of the time using it.</li>
            <li> This really works! I need to buy another jar of it since the jar is pretty small but I definitely see a lot of my stretch marks fading away. I just need to be patient for much better results!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t ever leave reviews but I had to say something about this amazing cream I just bought.  I gained alot of weight the last couple of years and I have been working it off.  I can get rid of the fat but not the stretch marks that appeared.  I decided to give this cream a shot and I can&#x27;t tell you how satisfied and happy I am to finally take off my shirt off at the beach or pool!!  My stretch marks went from noticible to almost invisible!  I have not felt so sexy in a long time and I have this cream to thank for it!  This is a must buy everyone!</li>
            <li> When I became a lady, my chest grew large very quickly and I had red stretch marks. I was young and embarrassed so I didn&#x27;t know what to do and I never asked my mom for help. At that time I probably would have had a better time getting rid of them. Now they are white/silver and they won&#x27;t be going anywhere any time soon. I&#x27;ve given up trying. This product was my last try and it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> My wife said it is very sticky. Natural feels but not very nice when u leave much on your skins....</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product because of all the 5 and 4 stars. But I really didn&#x27;t see a difference on my stretch marks. I used it every day and would allow time for it to dry before I put on my cloths. No change in my skin. So I am still on the search for something that works. However, the company that sells is do get great customer service. My product was somehow lost in the mail and they mailed me a new one right away. 5 stars for the company but 2 stars on the product. I&#x27;m glad it worked well on everyone else though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 30days and have seen no changes. Did not work for me like it did some and No I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I gained about 40 pounds within a year... then lost 25 within 2 months. I noticed terrible strecth marks ON THE MIDDLE of my arms witch made me very self conscious. After searching long and hard I decided to purchase this. With daily use i noticed a difference honestly within a week. i highly recommened this product!</li>
            <li> I have had stretch marks for twelve years now. I got them right after puberty in my inner thighs and hips. I have tried different creams, and exfoliation but nothing has really worked. The cream is a tad expensive but it is worth it. I tried it only in my inner thighs just to test it out. The stretch marks I have there are like little rivers they are deep and whiter than my skin. The cream does not really give directions on how many times to apply it. Therefore, I used it EVERYDAY twice a day (once in the morning, and once at night after I took a shower). I just massaged the cream into my inner thigh area in a circular motion until the cream was absorbed by my skin. I suggest you get a little at a time because it is really rich and creamy and this makes it harder than other creams to integrate into the skin. You will start to notice after a week that your skin is really soft. When I reached the end of the container I compared my stretch marks to what I had before and they were significantly diminished (the scars looked thinner and shorter). This stuff works! I will order this again and see if continued use diminishes them completely.</li>
            <li> I have really bad stretch marks from rapid weight gain behind my knees. I decided to do something about it when it started to get hot in Texas and it prevented me from wanting to wear knee length dresses or shorts. This is the first product I used because of the good reviews and I haven&#x27;t had the need to try anything else. I apply it almost every night and I noticed a difference within a week. It has been a little over a month now and it hasn&#x27;t completely gotten rid of my stretch marks but it definitely has made them a lot lighter and less noticeable. I still have 3/4 of the tub left so it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a little over two weeks and I&#x27;ve been using it daily. I know different products work best for different skin types, so if you&#x27;re wondering, I have very fair skin, and I have a combination of old and new stretch marks, and unfortunately I get stretch marks very easily...darn genetics. I took a before picture of my stretch marks and I took another picture a few days ago. Before comparing the pictures I couldn&#x27;t see a big difference - but my skin was definitely a lot softer - but once I compared the pictures I could see that the color of the stretch marks was becoming lighter. So it takes awhile, but any product that says it will give immediate results is full of crap, so this is more realistic. My only complaint is that the product runs out very quickly. It says to apply generously, and like I said it&#x27;s been about two weeks but I&#x27;m already almost out of the product. I will buy it again though since I&#x27;ve started to see results. If I end up seeing drastic results after a period of time I will definitely update this and possibly upload pictures for proof. Hope that helps!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because of the good reviews. I first was looking to buy other brands that were popular but then I saw this cream contained collagen a shea butter and it called my attention. I only write reviews when the product is either too good or too bad and this one is exellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was skeptical when I read the label and saw such a little jar containig a regular butter looking cream... but I saw improvement in only two weeks of use and that was a complete win because you know something is good when it starts working right away. I suppose it might not be the same for everyone because we all have different types of skin, but like in anything persistency is the key to get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that it is not cheap and you don&#x27;t only need to use one.. I just bought my third jar but I&#x27;m getting there.. my strechmarks are dissapearing I just hope it keeps working for me until they&#x27;re gone for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is that it not only helped me with those horrible marks but my skin feels anew after using it... soft, replenished and silky. It has become my favorite!</li>
            <li> I just recieved this product about a week ago and already I have to say I am impressed. Before recieving it I was so delighted at how fast it got to me and that I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping. (This will bring me back to your store again and again.) I&#x27;ve never written a review on any of the products that I&#x27;ve gotten on here but I feel that I should. I got the coconut mango scent and it is just fabulous! I wish it was a perfume!&lt;br /&gt;I started putting alot of the cream on my arms and stomach where I developed stretch marks and after only a few times of using this product I can tell it is starting to work. It&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s fading the lines. So even know this is just the beginning I&#x27;m excited to see how this product finishes on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: If you aren&#x27;t bothered by fragrances I wold suggest getting the coconut mango scented one as it is so yummy smelling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Skintrition for leaving my skin beautiful, supple, and soft.</li>
            <li> I have gone through about a jar and a half so far, consistent daily through the first one and slacking on the second, but i started slacking because i wasn&#x27;t seeing much difference after about a month, but i bought a second jar to wait it out. I just had a baby 7 months ago and i think i am seeing more of difference due to the time passing instead. I wont buy a another bottle, searching for something else.</li>
            <li> I used the product for three months applying as directed and saw no results. I&#x27;m not sure how it seemed to work for others, but I didn&#x27;t see any change. I tried to contact the manufacturer to make sure I was applying correctly, but no response. I&#x27;m not sure why everyone else seems to have had such great success, but I have to believe all the positive reviews aren&#x27;t really accurate or honest. I would avoid this product or ask a real doctor if it&#x27;s legitimate.</li>
            <li> It worked to fad my strtch marks a little. I have the deep puple ones from pregnacy and they seem to be a little less dark but not so much that i would recomend this product... at least it didnt work for me as well as i would have liked maybe for someone with lighter marks.</li>
            <li> This product is said to tighten skin and improve the appearance of stretch marks. I used the cream once daily. I generously applied  the cream to my abdomen and arms, areas that were plagued with the problem skin. The cream, however, gave a soft feel to my skin and smelled nice. However, I do not think it is worth the price. Please note that I did not use the cream for new stretch marks, thus I cannot say whether it is effective on new marks.</li>
            <li> I had stretch marks on my breasts and booty and have tried many different products in the past. I was skeptical  about this one, but decided to try it after reading the reviews.It has been 2 months (that&#x27;s how long it lasted) and I can see great improvement: The ones in my breast are so clear now I can barely see it. It is taking a longer time to see the same results in my booty. Although I can say it is better than before. I bought another one and will concentrate more in that area. I will post another review later.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for two months, no difference in stretch marks. Im a bit disappointed. Time to try something new...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cream and oil to avoid getting stretchmark so i bought this and the Bio Oil. I put this first then i put the Bio Oil. The scent is okay, its not too creamy its fine like lotion.I have a lot of stretchmarks so i think no matter what you put and even its expensive if your skin is prone to stretchmarks, its useless</li>
            <li> I only used this cream on my stretch marks for about 2 weeks before stopping completely, so I can&#x27;t say how it is with stretch marks. My stretch marks aren&#x27;t as red as they used to be but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s due to this cream seeing as I haven&#x27;t used it in months. However, it is a very good cream and moisturizes your skin all day long. If women are pregnant or women in general are looking for a good cream that makes your skin feel good, go ahead and get this. Only things I recommend is to not put too much on. Like others have said, a little bit goes a long way, and if you put it on, do it after you shower, as it doesn&#x27;t need to come off after you&#x27;ve applied it. It stays on for a good long while.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve just purchased this, It should be coming in the mail anyday now, I don&#x27;t know how well I trust the reviewers so I&#x27;ve decided to document my stretch mark journey in pictures... I will also be using a derma roller which I heard was really good for stretch marks, I will keep updating on here and If I see results I will post pictures. I am Black female and I know different products work for different people. Crossing Fingers!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know too much about stretch mark creams but decided to give this one a shot.  I used this cream for at least a month. I saw improvements of lightning to my stretch marks and my skin is smoother. I will buy again. Thanks</li>
            <li> I used this after showering when your pores suposedly open up and even then this did nothing for me. I see man good reviews on ths product, maybe its me</li>
            <li> Great product, it works great and has helped me feel better about myself. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I developed very deep stretch marks on my hips and bum and around my navel at the end of my pregnancy. Upon usuing a jar I definitely saw a difference in the lightening of the marks even though I am dark skinned. I would recommend that you buy at least 2 jars to get real results</li>
            <li> This product is seriously a bust. I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews on products that are meant to reverse the appearance of stretch marks before making this purchase, and I was still really disappointed after choosing this one. I used it daily and followed the recommendations, and even after a month I noticed no difference. The only thing that was lighter was my wallet after buying this. :) I found that I was just as well off letting stretch marks fade naturally over time. Perhaps this product works wonders for some people, but it did nothing for me. I would recommend trying something else before this.</li>
            <li> I finished medical school last year, and after getting asked on my dermatology block by so many patients for a solution to stretch marks, I decided to investigate the subject on myself.  My stretch marks are on my inner thighs.  They are about 10 years old, as I got them when I was running in track/cross country in high school.  Topical vitamin E was the only suggestion my colleagues had for stretch marks.  I purchased this cream.  I applied it religiously for about 60 days.  It took a long time for me to notice a difference, but, this product actually worked.  The stretch marks were a deep dark purple.  They have faded a shade or two, and the texture of the skin is improved.  The stretch marks seem much deeper now, and less visible.  Before I could feel the stretch marks as well as see them.  Now the skin overtop feels healthy and smooth, too.  So, here ya go. I am a doctor, I tried this product on myself, and the product impressed me.</li>
            <li> ive been using the product religiously and have seen little to no results so far. i will keep at though because there were so many other successes. patience is key!</li>
            <li> this product smells good and it seemed to lighten my stretchmarks on my thighs all though it didnt do much for the sides of my waist where i also had stretch marks but they where a little bit more puffier in that area im going to buy this product again to see if i can lighten both areas again i do reccomend this product bt fyi my stretch marks are on the newer side so im nt sure how urban skinitration works on older stretch marks o and i also used it twice daily i hope this helps cus i know stretch marks can be a bitch to deal with</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for STRETCH MARKS!! I have four beautiful children, and I had several deep stretchmarks on my stomach, legs, and breast. I have been using this cream for approximately 3 weeks and I can really see a GIGANTIC difference to the problem areas. There are some areas that will take a little longer, but all scars are fading. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I just got mine in the mail, i thought the packaging looked a little different, very plain printout on a sticker basically.  Plus it doesn&#x27;t give the list of ingrediants.  It smells alot like a cream I tried a long time ago I think it was called Strepin or something like that? Not a bad smell just a regular cream smell.  But I am still going to try it, i have some stretch marks that sometimes look darker on some days.  I&#x27;m hoping to make them lessen.  Any suggestions on the packaging or ingredients???</li>
            <li> Used it as directed hoping it would finally fade my old stretch marks but no luck :(  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with existing stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Great product so far, I&#x27;m using it during my first pregnancy and I have yet to get a single stretchmark.</li>
            <li> I never review products but I had to write about this one.  I&#x27;ve always been very skeptical with stretch mark creams because it never works for me and my skin is super sensitive so if I happen to choose the wrong one, I WILL get a bad rash.  My friend actually mentioned this one to me saying it made her skin feel super smooth.  I tried hers and was sold.  I had visible stretch marks on my belly from the pregnancy and now its so light I can barely see them.  On top of that, my skin seriously feels so smooth (the husband loves this btw!).  I just bought my second one and it still works great!</li>
            <li> This cream works pretty good so far.  I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long, so I can&#x27;t comment about the actual end result.  It&#x27;s odd that there are no directions on how you should use the cream.  It doesn&#x27;t say how many times per day to apply or anything.  It&#x27;s seems to be working as my stretch marks are a little better ( I think, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I want to see change or if it&#x27;s actual).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the cream for a while now, and my stretch marks are still there of course, but they are much lighter than they were.  I&#x27;m not embarrassed to wear shorts now.  Good Stuff.</li>
            <li> We live in Arizona and my wife has dry skin pretty much year round. I purchased this for her to try and she loves it. The ingredients list which includes witch hazel, shea butter, aloe are the perfect combination. I love how it&#x27;s not animal tested too will be purchasing again :)</li>
            <li> i never thought there would be a product that actually works and does makes stretchmarks disappear because after trying several products this is the only thing that had given me wonderful results in just weeks..</li>
            <li> There is definitely something special about this cream. You can feel the \\&quot;special quality\\&quot; as soon as you touch it. It just has a different texture compared to other creams and lotions. It&#x27;s super creamy, yet it absorbs immediately into your skin..\\&quot;like butter\\&quot;, but not...because it&#x27;s not in the least bit greasy. I&#x27;ve used many different creams and lotions over the years, and I could feel that a majority of them just sat on top of my skin, probably lending a hand in clogging a large number of my pores. This dreamy stuff \\&quot;disappears\\&quot; into your skin. This scores a lot of points, because I&#x27;ve noticed that other creams (that have come in contact with my hands) end up on everything...like my clothing, my purse, my car, my face, my hair, etc...it took me a while to figure out why my hair looked greasy an hour or so after I&#x27;d just washed it.  I have confidence that this stuff might actually do something to help diminish my stretch marks! I&#x27;ll need to use it for a couple more months to give it a fair analysis. For now, my strtch marks DO seem to be a bit less noticeable!</li>
            <li> I have been losing weight for almost a year, and have been trying to prevent sagging skin. This product is excellent for increasing your skin elasticity and helps it heal and tighten, even helped heal my sunburn. It seems to have lessened existing scars, but it definitely has prevented new stretch marks on my chest and shoulders that have appeared from strength training.</li>
            <li> This product is highly rated on amazon so I gave it a try since it&#x27;s not too expensive.  After about a month of using it my stretch marks were noticeably reduced.  My stretch marks weren&#x27;t extreme so maybe they are easier to treat but I do have darker skin.  Not much more to say other than this product has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I lost a lot of weight and did wonders for my self confidence but left stretch marks all over my body that had me fearing taking off my shirt to show off my new weirs when visiting the beach or the pool.  I stumbled upon this cream and read all of the reviews, hoping for the best.  And I think I got it!  This cream helped me complete a long journey which started the day I decided I didn&#x27;t want to walk around 30 pounds over weight anymore!  A big difference happened quickly and it slowly kept working over the course of the 2 months.  Its been about 5 months now and I highly recommend this cream to anyone whose fear of revealing their stretch marks is keeping them from enjoying life!</li>
            <li> I have had stretch marks for the past few years and decided I needed to do something about it. I did extensive research and came upon this product which I decided to try. Its been a month of using the product and I have already seen results. My skin is lighter and smoother than from what I can remember. For the price, this product does miracles. I will start recommending this product to all my family friends.</li>
            <li> This is the best stretch mark cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It hydrates your skin and leaves it soft and beautiful. I recommend you use it when the marks are still red but it&#x27;s still effective afterwards. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Used daily and saw no results</li>
            <li> The only thing that worked for my post pregnancy stretch marks! Oddly enough I got no stretch marks on my stomach. Instead I got them on the back of my legs in the upper thigh area. It doesn&#x27;t completely erase the stretch marks but they are now very slight and faded especially compared to what they were in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried using this on stretch marks I got as a kid as a side effect to hydrocortisone cream, and sadly it didn&#x27;t work. I think it didn&#x27;t work on those though because they are very severe and well over 15 years old. If, however, you just had a baby and the stretch marks are new and fresh, apply this cream and it should do the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing, thick, and soothing. I noticed a difference in my post pregnancy stretch marks within a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this cream on several occasions. While I&#x27;m using it I can tell that it makes my skin more firm. My stretch marks have lightened some, but I really use it for the tightening aspect and for the softness it gives my skin.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work.  I have three kids and have stretch marks on my tummy and sides.  I used the product as directed every day and have not seen one line, mark or wrinkle disappear.  I wanted to write this review because for some, this product might not work so even though it&#x27;s less expensive and less invasive than a tummy tuck or other procedure, it might not work. Based on the reviews, I had high hopes for this product but the bottom line is that it just does not work..at all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely  love this cream. I started using it after my 4th month of pregnancy all over my belly and my love handles, up until I gave birth.  I have not ONE stretch mark thanks to this I believe. I will totally use this product again if I ever decide to have more children!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream at the end of July and have used it faithfully (twice a day, morning and night) since then.  While it left my skin soft and very moisturized, it did not remove any stretch marks.  Maybe its because all my stretch marks are old (deep, silver ones), but I did not see a reduction in any of them.  Darn - I had so hoped this would have worked!  On to the next product!</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews on this product i have decided to try this product. Well i&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now and i recieved absolutely NO results from this. My new stretch marks are still there along with the old. I dont understand how this has so many good reviews and it doesnt work. When i opened the package it was just the jar of creme there. No info sheet nothing!There is two lines of instruction on the jar that says to apply daily and thats it. i am truly disappointed, just another scam.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream religiously and I am seeing NO results. I only gave it two stars because it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it is useable as just a regular lotion. It is not worth the price as my stretchmarks look exactly the same as they did before I started using it. Save your money!</li>
            <li> Being pregnant to twins, I wanted to apply stretch mark cream to my stomach. I searched for one for a long time and decided to order this one based on excellent reviews. It is also unscented which is what I wanted for my sensitive skin. I did not research enough. After receiving the cream, I realized that it has Retinol Palmitate in it which is a no no product to use in pregnancy. Do not buy this product if you are pregnant because Retinol Palmitate has been shown to cause tumors and cancers in animals. The cream has a consistency of vitamin E cream I have. I doubt that it has anything more than vitamin E. I started searching the company. It seems like they only make this product and nothing else. How is that possible? A company with just four products on market? I started reading the reviews more carefully. If you pay attention to 5 star reviews, you will see that they all have the same language, words, and they all mention same results. This made me think that these reviews were written by the company or by people the company paid. I decided to do a more linguistic detective work and read reviews of other creams where truly the cream is 4 or 5 star. I found out that language varies greatly amongst people who give 5 stars. But for this product, it feels like everybody used the same keywords to write the reviews No other reviews available on any other website. The product is new to the market. I doubt that so many reviewers have had a chance to see \\&quot;wonderful\\&quot; results.  You are better off by buying a jar of vitamin E cream. If you will get stretch marks anyhow because of genetics, you will get them. But if you can prevent them, I believe you can do so by making your skin more elastic by means of applying Vitamin E. Don&#x27;t wast money on this unknown product.</li>
            <li> This cream is an absolute miracle! I&#x27;ve had stretch marks all my life and now that I&#x27;ve started using this cream they are becoming more and more faint. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a while now and I love it! It also makes your skin really soft and moisturized. Love it!! I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20-year old female. I&#x27;ve had stretch marks for a while, the pale white kind (not very deep) from being active in sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 1 jar of this because I read all of the GREAT reviews. I&#x27;ve been using for about 2-3 months now and I&#x27;ve barely seen a difference. Maybe a SLIGHT difference. I&#x27;m a bit skeptical to continue buying because I&#x27;ve read reviews about how this is a scam. It worries me because if this IS a miracle cream, why isn&#x27;t it advertised? I hadn&#x27;t heard of it until I searched on Amazon for a good stretch mark cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do like is that the texture of the cream is awesome. It&#x27;s like a whipped butter almost. I got non-scented so it doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying another jar because I&#x27;m still unsure about the product. There isn&#x27;t much info on the company...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying out Mederma since it&#x27;s about the same price &amp; is very well-known. Wish me luck!</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no results from this stretch mark cream. I am pretty sure it is nothing more than a moisturizer. I used the entire jar and there was no change in the color or texture of my pregnancy stretch marks. I would not recommend this product at all!</li>
            <li> Didnt really work on me!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I am on my second jar right now.  I am 32 weeks with fraternal twins and with not a single stretchmarks so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had stretch marks for some time now and Ive tried a few other products. So far, I&#x27;ve had  luck with this stuff. Been using it for about a month, off and on, and its keeping the color even. So the stretch marks don&#x27;t stand out as much. Skeptical at first but I&#x27;m impressed with the results. I&#x27;ll keep going.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to review this product for awhile...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of stretch mark creams that didn&#x27;t work, but this one really did...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about 2-3 weeks to see any difference, but it became very dramatic change with time (I used it for several months)...my red/purple stretch marks turned pale and eventually white, they thinned out in size, and became hardly visible in some areas. These were old stretch marks too, ones that I had for many years since pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really lathered this stuff on and was religious with it 2x daily sometimes just once daily...it even helped with an old laparscopic surgery scar that was raised in my belly button, it really smoothed it out and lightened its color too....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also dry brushed before showering and then applied after shower (I think this helps to absorb it better, it is thick cream, like someone else mentioned, so also massage it in well, and let it dry, before dressing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product, was very surprised it actually worked, and now I recommended it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Im 20 years old and this didnt really help, I have white stretch marks and after a whole jar they are still there.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> The cream itself is nice and thick, it&#x27;s a whipped lotion and there is no scent, not even the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; smell.  A little lotion covers a large area.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing but hasn&#x27;t done a thing for my stretch marks unfortunately.  I am undecided if I would buy it again but I do like the lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It helped reduce, and in most cases eliminate, my stretch marks. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item based on the load of great comments it got from other amazon users.  However, when I used it, I did not find any results.  Within the first month, after using it generously twice a day, I ran out.</li>
            <li> The cream does not work, applied it liberally and vigurously on a single stretch mark. Studied/examined the stretch mark for weeks, and it did not budge! This product is absolute garbage! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this along with a product called the derma roller. I only gave the cream four stars because I didn&#x27;t start to notice a difference until I started using it with the derma roller device (highly recommended). I&#x27;m happy with both products together though and am finally seeing results after trying so many other expensive products. *does happy dance*</li>
            <li> now i haven&#x27;t noticed any of my old stretchmarks go away (although they may have diminished and i just don&#x27;t realize it) but i am stretch mark-prone, and at 8 months pregnant still don&#x27;t have any on my belly so i believe this product works like a charm!!! A++, i highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of good reviews and thought I could give it a shot. Sadly I can say it didn&#x27;t work for me. Why 2 stars? Because the shipping was pretty fast. I think it&#x27;s expensive and didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li> Not only it does not work, but it also dries up my oily skin. It feels very weird on the skin.</li>
            <li> I would like to say that I finally found the miracle cream that gets rid of strech marks but unfortunately, I have not.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell a difference from the moment I started using this cream and when I stopped, my strech marks look just the same.</li>
            <li> I used this product (fragrance free version) for a month and I swear my stretch marks are wider and longer!!!! I have brown skin and EXTREMELY light colored, good-sized stretch marks on my shoulders so they&#x27;re really noticeable. I swear since using this cream they&#x27;ve gotten wider and longer. They were just on my shoulders now they&#x27;re coming down my entire arm! I never wore strapless dresses before because of them and now thanks to this product I&#x27;m going to be wearing tops/dresses with long sleeves all year round. I know it says to use for atleast two months but after a month my stretch marks should be smaller...not bigger! The only good thing about this product is that it&#x27;s really thick and super creamy but not oily, I loved putting it on but it didn&#x27;t do crap! It only made them worse!! I think all of the good reviews are fake!!!! I want my money back, I&#x27;m so pissed for spending $25 on such a small jar and it didn&#x27;t do squat! When I opened it up I noticed that it&#x27; made with a smaller like jar inside and the cream is in that. A WORD TO THE WISE...STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT...I&#x27;M SO PISSED I WANNA BOYCOTT IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-UPDATE: I WAS GIVEN A FULL REFUNDED...EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li> I am trying it out on strech marks so far it works a lot better on the smaller ones. The big one&#x27;s will have to take some time. Just have to wait and be patient to see if the product will work.</li>
            <li> I just got the lotion today but I will be returning it. It is horribly greasy and very sticky. Putting clothes on after using is awful and it doesn&#x27;t seem to fully absorb into the skin. It also doesn&#x27;t seem \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; at all and the smell is not good in my opinion.  I&#x27;m baffled by all the glowing reviews and have to question their authenticity.</li>
            <li> I love this product... It smells good and feels good... It also works</li>
            <li> I used this whole container but did not notice a difference. If my stretch marks did fade, it was probably because of time and not this product. Save your money</li>
            <li> I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. DID NOT SEE A CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF MY STRETCH MARKS. WILL NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT EVER AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works I don&#x27;t like the consistency of this product and did not continue to use.</li>
            <li> I do not see a difference in my stretch marks after using the product for 4-6 weeks and I do not plan on buying another batch to find out if it really works.</li>
            <li> One of my close friend recommend this cream for me, as i was unable to find any which can bring a good result. I use it for just over  week, and now even my partner noticed the changes. finally i found a cream which is do what its promise. Great Product, Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different creams for years, and by far, this is the best.  I noticed a very noticeable difference in as little as 3 weeks.  Definitely my new favorite product.</li>
            <li> So happy. Turned my stretch marks from red to white in two weeks. I had had my son 2months before and still use it till this day and they look so much better and my son is almost a year old.</li>
            <li> Helped with my marks after pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed after a week of use that the product is starting to work. The stretch marks are lighter already and smoother. Hope the product continues to improve my skin.</li>
            <li> After receiving this product I learned that it contains retinyl palmitate.  It is advertised for the Prevention of stretch marks, yet it uses an ingredient that many avoid while pregnant.  I was unaware that Urban Skintrition has a product exclusively for women during pregnancy, until receiving the response to my post.  Clearly, that is a better alternative.</li>
            <li> so I decided to wasted my money once again in a product that didnt seem to accomplished what it says it does. this is for \\&quot;strectch marks\\&quot; apply it as directed and did nothing else but to smooth my skin. Im a 21 yr old male and did Not work on me. Ive stretch marks on my arms and below my armpit because&lt;br /&gt;of bodybuilding. did nothing.</li>
            <li> Im at the end of my first jar with amazing results! Now waiting on second. Hopefully Ill see even more improvement.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to treat my stretch marks after pregnancy. I started using it 2 months post pregnancy. Did not do a thing. Works like a moisturizer lotion, that&#x27;s all. Not worth it. Save your money</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend, and it improved the appearance of her stretch marks on her butt. It did not make them go completely away, but she wants me to buy her more of this when she runs out.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for old stretch marks that I&#x27;ve had since middle school. I have very large, deep marks on the sites of my bottom from growing, and they&#x27;re lighter than my natural skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes my skin extremely soft and helps to smooth the texture of the marks. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2.5 months, but not as consistently as I should, and I think my marks have become a bit less noticeable. I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle, and I just ordered another. I want to see the results after I finish the second to say for sure. Still keep in mind that my marks are deep, so I have to be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount you get seems small at first, but a small amount covers a large area, since it spreads easily, almost like wet soap spuds. Even if this product were to fail at lessening the appearance of my marks, I would continue to buy it as a body butter. The smell is light and attractive, and it makes my skin feel like silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero side effects-- just soft silky skin.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice a difference on my stretch marks, but it definitely made my skin softer...a little pricer for just a moisture loition, but I figured compared to the other stretch mark creme prices it was worth trying.</li>
            <li> Shipped in no time at all. Was very pleased with the product and the price. Works great. Plan to purchase similar prodcuts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really bad stretch marks for years and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that has not only helped,  but dramatically made a difference.  I&#x27;ve used it for less than a month and the difference is unbelievable.  I&#x27;d 100% recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditions delivered as expected. 100% Recommended. My wife didn&#x27;t saw any results with this cream but each body is unique.</li>
            <li> Tried many many creams with no results. Used this cream for three weeks now and see such an improvement. Already ordered my next jar for when I run out. Def recommend</li>
            <li> this product works great I love it and will be ordering it again thank you I have use other products but nothing works like this stuff</li>
            <li> Listen... dont buy it.... waste of $$ and time....&lt;br /&gt;trying something different... the smell is wweird&lt;br /&gt;.... thick cream... no effect</li>
            <li> This is magic in a bottle. A...smalll....expensive....bottle...It works SO well and leaves my skin so soft and silky. My stretch marks on my thighs really seemed to diminish. I have ordered two bottles so far but it really took a lot for me to decide if I should because of the price. I feel the bottle should be a bit bigger for 25 bucks.</li>
            <li> i use this product for about a month and it worked well it faded my stretch marks and the smell is great and its not greasy at all!! great product! recommended to anyone</li>
            <li> Sad to say, I&#x27;ve tried every cream there is for stretch marks. Unfortunately, they are scars that will never go away. I would recommend either laser surgery or permanent makeup! You may however still use these creams for years to come and maybe they will reduce the appearance, I just didn&#x27;t have that long to invest in time wasted with creams.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take my stretch marks away like I thought it would. I don&#x27;t feel like it lightened them up much either.</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because the ingredients are promising, the consistency is great- like a whipped butter, and the smell is very light. Almost finished a full jar with no change at all in my current stretch marks and didn&#x27;t prevent new ones. Not worth the money. Would not recommend or repurchase.</li>
            <li> I think that this product worked for me. I have stretch marks in various places but I was mainly concerned about the ones on my arm. So I used this only for my arms and I began to notice them fading away after 1 month of use. I used it in the morning and at night. I also reordered a jar and will continue to use this product. Not sure how it works but I am a fan.&lt;br /&gt;-AB</li>
            <li> I was excited since the reviews seemed all about the same the cream helped with stretch marks I has hopes this would be my miracle cream. I was wrong used it for 1 month no change what&#x27;s so ever. Id recommend this in case it does/did work for the others.</li>
            <li> So this product is good for newer stretch marks (so the red ones)... I had some on my waist and my thighs which I got at the beginning of college and this product got rid of the ones on my waist but not really the ones on my thighs... it might have made the old ones a LITTLE lighter but its hard to tell.  And in order for it to work, you have to use it religiously.  I&#x27;ve bought 3 bottles of it already to prevent further stretch marks and keep the old ones from resurfacing.  I would say if you really want to get rid of your stretch marks, give it a try... it might work differently for different skin types.</li>
            <li> This did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, and I do mean NOTHING, its just another hyped up GIMMICK with Merchants trying to sell the product and ENHANCE SALES, And I think the REVIEWS are FAKE.  Try EXCEL stretch mark cream you want be dissappointed.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that this product prevents stretch marks and it has made my stretch marks a tad bit lighter, but it separates easily.  My package was left outside in freezing temperatures then I put it into room temperature and the oil separated I had to mix it and now its fine.  It&#x27;s not a big issue but just store at room temperature and it should be fine.</li>
            <li> I used to use mederma, which had a bad smell to it, for two years. I only saw a few noticeable differences. However, I have already noticed a difference in my stomach and hip stretch marks and its only been two months. They&#x27;ve gotten a lot smoother and way less pink. I definitely recommend this product and I am about to buy my second tub of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time Amazon user but I&#x27;ve never felt compelled to write a review until after I tried Urban Skintrition&#x27;s Stretch Mark Cream.  As a well-educated girl, I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of creams that claim to reduce the appearance of stretch marks but I ABSOLUTELY noticed a difference after using Urban Skintrition.  I&#x27;m a pale caucasian who had noticeable stretch marks on her lower back and hips.  I tried this product on new and old (we&#x27;re talking 12 year old) stretch marks.  By the time I finished my first jar, the new ones had faded pretty significantly.  By the time I finished my second, the older ones had faded too!  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, my stretch marks are still there but you have to look pretty closely to see them - they&#x27;re not as glaringly obvious as before.  I actually just bought my third jar.  Since this cream a great moisturizer, I now view it as preventative.  I feel a lot better running around town, bending and stretching (especially in the winter) after having applied a little Urban Skintrition.  I&#x27;m sure results vary a bit from one person to the next but this product really worked for me!</li>
            <li> This did nothing. A good moisturizer and that&#x27;s about it. I would not recommend for older stretch marks, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all. I am now doing skin needling, scientifically it makes sense...time will tell.</li>
            <li> I bought this knowing its not a miracle cure. It has lightened them and smoothen my skin out so they dont feel as deep. Happy with it and I will update in 6 months</li>
            <li> I have used this product for my wife for two weeks so far and it has been a great result for my wife. Product does what it promise and I will be buying couple more. Within two week her stretch marks are starting to go away slowly. Still need more for a complete result. The cream last about 20 days and We&#x27;re are very happy so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it had a lot of good reviews. I choose the fragrance free version and it really does not have any smell.  It&#x27;s very thick so it provides some good moisture to the skin. However, I tried to use it on old white stretch marks and I didn&#x27;t see real results after using all the product (it lasted a couple of months). The marks faded a little bit, but I think that&#x27;s more because of the extra care and that any regular moisturizer would do the same. The marks were still very visible. Now I&#x27;m trying Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula and I can see some more concrete results. Since Palmer&#x27;s is also cheaper, I really recommend trying that one instead of this.</li>
            <li> You may have to buy this in bulk for it to work. But I wont be doing that. Bought my first jar applied twice a day sometimes 3. This product does nothing. Decided to go the natural route to help with stretch marks and purchased shea butter instead, much more affordable and there is plenty to purchase here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Be aware this product is more for preventing then getting rid of stretch marks so if you&#x27;re looking for something to get rid of stretch marks this is not the product. I used it because I have some stretch marks on my breasts so I wanted something to get rid of them even though I don&#x27;t have them as much is still did nothing for me and I used it for more than a month.</li>
            <li> Used the first bottle and did not notice a huge difference with existing stretch marks.Only mild change. I&#x27;ve been using it on my rear because I would like to wear a bikini again someday. I did notice butt acne went away,so bonus I guess for that, but stretch marks may need longer treatment. I will continue to use If I can get it at a place where it is a little more affordable. I guess if I use this in conjunction with other methods like slight tanning ,marks should start to fade or appear less... marky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on it seeing a little improvement need more time.Hopefully does this does the trick!I should&#x27;ve gotten the scented though:(</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased the Urban Skintrition Stretch Mark Cream.  I am trying to fade a bunch of old stretch marks after losing a large amount of weight.  This stuff really is effective, but the results are slow and gradual.  I imagine this would be super-effective in preventing stretch marks or fading fresh marks, mine are from many years ago and harder to rid of, but it IS working and so far, nothing else I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many) has made any difference at all.  I use this cream every morning after a shower.  It is very thick, almost smell-free and absorbs completely.  Also, I have very sensitive skin, and haven&#x27;t had any problems with this breaking me out/turning me red/making me itch.  I&#x27;m giving this four-stars because I&#x27;m still searching for the miracle cream that actually makes my stretch marks disappear... but this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.  I keep seeing gradual results with every tub of this and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> If you have hard stretch marks then this is a product for you to try it actually works and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about three weeks and I have already seen very noticeable differences in my skin.  The marks have been fading and the scent is pleasant.  Definitely worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li> This lotion works really well and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now and am seeing great results.  I&#x27;m going to continue to use it.  You can&#x27;t expect your stretch marks to completely dissapear overnight but I&#x27;ve definitely seen improvement which is great.  It has really good ingredients in it too.  No funky chemicals like all the other stretch mark creams.</li>
            <li> I was excited to have found this cream with such great reviews but it didn&#x27;t do much of anything for my skin .</li>
            <li> Great product! I used the pregnancy version throughout my 10 months and never got a single stretch mark..and had a 9lb 9oz baby! I figured I was doomed to get stretch marks because my mom got stretch marks..but not-a-one! I&#x27;m sure Urban Skintrition helped!</li>
            <li> Just started using this stretch mark cream 4 days ago and so far im feeling optimistic.  Makes my skin feel so soft all day.  I plan to continue using this cream twice a day as directed and pray for the results i want.  Only problem I found is a little does not go a long way.  The texture is more thick so you need a bigger blob of lotion to cover a large area.  So if your like me and have several problem areas, you may need more than one tub.</li>
            <li> I have tried other stretch mark creams and celtrixa. This beats all of them!! I saw results instantly! I am already purchasing another containter.</li>
            <li> I have lost over 100lbs in the last two years so I purchased this cream to help with the expected stretch marks. I did not notice it having any effect. Still, it was a nice moisturizer and it didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently nearing the end of my second trimester. While it has not stopped new stretch marks from appearing, it has help fade the existing ones. Not to mention, the lotion is so hydrating, it definitely helps with itching.</li>
            <li> This is better than some of the other products out there on the market. I only use it a few times a week and it still does noticeable change.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item due to the other reviews, and I&#x27;m glad it did. I began to see results of this product in just a few weeks. I had a dark stretch mark on both of my arms and it has completely turned them to a lighter color. I was very satisfied with this purchase. I do want to make sure that say stretch marks can never be completely removed so, don&#x27;t expect too much from this product.</li>
            <li> Manufactures of stretch mark creams have their work cut out for them, as they are very hard (if not, impossible) to get rid of. Used as directed, this is the first route I went with in hopes of at least fading mine. That it didn&#x27;t. This would be a good moisturizer to PREVENT but does nothing to reduce or erase. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. If you are looking to fade or prevent, you should save your money and look elsewhere. The seller provided an excellent experience as far as shipping and packaging went, but the product failed me.</li>
            <li> This cream really reduces the visual of  my stretchmarks.  I used to be overweight and during my process of losing weight, I had some new stretch marks.  I decided to purchase this cream and I am glad I did because it does make a difference.  I will re-invest in this cream again once I&#x27;m done with the first one.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only been using this for a month but my stretch marks have really improved and they&#x27;re definitely lighter. Improvements showed the first few days i used it and i loved it. I recommend this to try and its cheaper than some other products and has great results. I&#x27;m in my second jar and results are still good especially on my arms. Hopefully these work on my legs because I would really love to wear shorts especially for P.E. I&#x27;m so self conscious with my guy friend behind be while i&#x27;m stretching ;_; stretch marks are getting lighter and hopefully they continue to do so. For everyone that is searching for a stretch mark solution and saving a couple of bucks, you definitely get the bang for this product :)</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this would work for me. Seemed like an easy fix and who doesnt like easy...whelp try try again</li>
    </ol>
