            <li>I love this brand!</li>
            <li>A brilliant product that is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>These Vichy antiperspirants are pretty good, but the descriptions aren&#x27;t good about letting us know the scents these roll-ons have.  </li>
            <li>My all time favorite deodorant is Vichy.</li>
            <li>So I gave one of them to my husband Ryan :)  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many deodorants/antiperspirants to keep it under control.</li>
            <li>Okay I maybe hurting myself by sharing this product with others...</li>
            <li>It helps my daytime antiperspirant do its job better.</li>
            <li>, feels more like water, not waxy.</li>
            <li>Smells OK.</li>
            <li>Great deodorant, been buying before for a while, pleasant smell, dries quick, hold very well, a bit pricey ,but worth it.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t as strong as the one you can buy overseas.</li>
            <li>It is worth every cent!</li>
            <li>I LOVED the smell of the green cup one, however, they stopped selling that kind.</li>
            <li>It smells like a pleasant male deodorant.</li>
            <li>It works great and keeps me feeling fresh and dry.  </li>
            <li>I tried others without any success.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands, and this is honestly the only one that keeps me relatively dry.</li>
            <li>I kept one for myself just in case when weather is hot.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>It is easy to remove white marks and doesn&#x27;t permanent discolor clothing.</li>
            <li>I also use the Vichy 48hrs, it has a milder fragrance, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be any less effective.</li>
            <li>It keeps me feeling fresh and comfortable all day long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually use deodorant, bought for my teenage daughter, she is so happy, says it doesn&#x27;t stain her clothes as other deodorants bought in CVS or Target and smells nice.</li>
            <li>very dissappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li>I have issues with perspiration and this really does work.</li>
            <li>I use this at night and it really helps keep me drier during the day.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much-I can use it once and not notice any odor for three days.</li>
            <li>this is very good keep me fresh all day, no need to worry about unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li>So I ordered this red cap one, maybe this has the same fragrance that I love so much.</li>
            <li>The red tops have sort of a &#x27;manly&#x27; smelling smell, and the blue tops have a more feminine smell.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>and I like that it&#x27;s not thick when applied</li>
            <li>I prefer the unscented, which has a plain, translucent top.  </li>
            <li>Neither of the scented types have much of a scent unless they&#x27;re wet, and either one could really be worn by a man or a woman without wierdness, but I still prefer the unscented.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many of the antiperspirants that claim to deal with serious B.O.</li>
            <li>Now I use the Vichy Intense 72 hrs in combination with 1 spray of Vichy Deodorant Fraicheur Extreme every day and it works.</li>
            <li>I tried every different brand of anti-perspirant, including Kiehl&#x27;s, odoban, prescription (which caused a rash) but when I got hot (Texas summers, Zumba classes etc), they all had a strong unpleasant cheap-perfume odor, or else I would just smell of perspiration - not the desired effect.</li>

            <li> very dissappointed with this purchase. I used to use vichy antiperspirants for couple years before and i really loved it. Didn&#x27;t sweat at all. With this one i cannot even go for 24hrs. I can smell myself (which i don&#x27;t even get with Secret Clinical) and it really bothers me. Will never order this again.</li>
            <li> I love this brand! I tried it in Italy and nothing else compares. Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite deodorant is Vichy. The best! I used not this one but the green cap Vichy. I LOVED the smell of the green cup one, however, they stopped selling that kind. Now, they sell that without fragrance. So I ordered this red cap one, maybe this has the same fragrance that I love so much. Unfortunately, it does not. It smells like a pleasant male deodorant. So I gave one of them to my husband Ryan :)  It works effectively though!</li>
            <li> this is very good keep me fresh all day, no need to worry about unpleasant odor.</li>

            <li> I love this deodorant, it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I had perspiration issues my entire life and there is no product on the market that helped me until I purchased Vichy 72H Excessive Perspiration. I will never buy any other product.</li>
            <li> The best deodorant !!!!!</li>
            <li> Great deodorant, been buying before for a while, pleasant smell, dries quick, hold very well, a bit pricey ,but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have problem B.O. and I&#x27;ve tried many deodorants/antiperspirants to keep it under control. This Vichy product is excellent: the best. Unlike many of the antiperspirants that claim to deal with serious B.O. this one never irritates my skin. It keeps me feeling fresh and comfortable all day long. A brilliant product that is well worth the money. For the record, I&#x27;m a 50+ female university professor, often under stress. I&#x27;ve also used the men&#x27;s version of this -- the 72-hour intensive one -- and it&#x27;s also excellent.</li>
            <li> It was good but it wasn&#x27;t as strong as the one you can buy overseas.</li>
            <li> Okay I maybe hurting myself by sharing this product with others... It works!!! I have issues with perspiration and this really does work. It is worth every cent! It saved my summer. Let it completely dry before getting dressed - white marks will happen. Just wash it off using a damp towel. It is easy to remove white marks and doesn&#x27;t permanent discolor clothing.</li>
            <li> These Vichy antiperspirants are pretty good, but the descriptions aren&#x27;t good about letting us know the scents these roll-ons have.  I prefer the unscented, which has a plain, translucent top.  The red tops have sort of a &#x27;manly&#x27; smelling smell, and the blue tops have a more feminine smell.  Neither of the scented types have much of a scent unless they&#x27;re wet, and either one could really be worn by a man or a woman without wierdness, but I still prefer the unscented.  As for performance, they do work pretty well, but I think the descriptions could be a bit clearer so that people could get the scent they wanted without expensive trial and error..  Hence, the 3 stars.  Otherwise, they&#x27;re at least 4 stars.</li>
            <li> the quality is good but the smell is disadvantage - it smells men perfume</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I can not use the typical over tbe counter deodorants.  My sk8n is sensitive and the ordinary deodorants burn my skin.  This is perfect. A bit pricey but it works. It last all day and some days i can actually go 48 hrs .i have never made it to 72 hours. Hifhly recommended it..&lt;br /&gt;thank goodness for this seller as its hard to find in the U..S.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and it really helps keep me drier during the day.  It helps my daytime antiperspirant do its job better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use deodorant, bought for my teenage daughter, she is so happy, says it doesn&#x27;t stain her clothes as other deodorants bought in CVS or Target and smells nice. I kept one for myself just in case when weather is hot. I used it just once and I like that it&#x27;s not thick when applied, feels more like water, not waxy. Smells OK.</li>
            <li> It really works! I apply it in the evening before I go to bed, let it dry and next day there is no sweat!</li>
            <li> I tried every different brand of anti-perspirant, including Kiehl&#x27;s, odoban, prescription (which caused a rash) but when I got hot (Texas summers, Zumba classes etc), they all had a strong unpleasant cheap-perfume odor, or else I would just smell of perspiration - not the desired effect. Now I use the Vichy Intense 72 hrs in combination with 1 spray of Vichy Deodorant Fraicheur Extreme every day and it works. I also use the Vichy 48hrs, it has a milder fragrance, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be any less effective. I do have to apply the combination (roll-on plus spray) every day.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much-I can use it once and not notice any odor for three days.It doesn&#x27;t irritate or leave any orange mark on my white shirts.</li>
            <li> The only antiperspirant that works for me. I&#x27;ve tried so many brands, and this is honestly the only one that keeps me relatively dry. No gunk on my shirts, no overpowering perfume stench. The only down side is the price, but it lasts quite a while.</li>
