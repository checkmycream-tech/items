            <li>great product!  </li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve used in 2 months!</li>
            <li>Best polish ever!!</li>
            <li>and I hope they keep making it and making more colors too!!!</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best prices for this too - CVS has these for $8-$9, but you can get them here for $4-$5 which is great.</li>
            <li>not when I want to go on vacation and look good for a week!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase...</li>
            <li>That method worked great for me, my polish would stay bright and not chip for 6-7days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a nutshell - if you are fed up with the time and cost of a nail salon, and want to wear bright colors that do not chip -</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay line is in a word - amazing.</li>
            <li>I happen to own a UV flashlight</li>
            <li>Not the longest wearing solution, but better most.  </li>
            <li>I wish they had some better colors for nude</li>
            <li>, then top it off with Out The Door topcoat.  </li>
            <li>Also - I do lots of sewing and my manicures stand up better to picking at fabric, threads and</li>
            <li>I used 2 coats of Revlon and 1 coat of Gel manicure top coat by Sally Hansen and</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have asked me if my manicures are gel when I use this stuff.</li>
            <li>top coats and nothing has come close to this.  </li>
            <li>I use with Revlon colorstay top coat.</li>
            <li>no chipping, no peeling, it looks shiny; and even better, it comes off in seconds when I want it to with a quick swipe of an acetone soaked cotton ball!</li>
            <li>a very longwearing, nice looking manicure that comes off easily.</li>
            <li>it dries almost instantly and if worn with a topcoat alone the nails look great</li>
            <li>It really does work best with all other polishes in the Colorstay line (color and top coat), and no I don&#x27;t work for Revlon.</li>
            <li>There is a huge selection of colors for this system (purported to offer a gel like look right out of the bottle, which it does) which is another plus!</li>
            <li>Since I have always done my nails indoors and at night I figured I wasn&#x27;t getting the full benefit.  </li>
            <li>Combined with the polish and top coat, it stays on like glue, and I mainly have to change my polish because my nails grew, not because of chipping.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, item as described.</li>
            <li>and as they were out of top coat, used the Opi regular top</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really happy with the Colorstay nail products, but then I read somewhere that they were designed to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; similar to gel polish, but using the natural UV light from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>Tried Shellac, big fan of that, worked well - chipped anywhere from a week to 10 days  - relatively easy to soak off; about 5 minutes in acetone!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I am a huge fan of the new Revlon \\&quot;Colorstay\\&quot; nail line.  </li>
            <li>I have a ridiculous collection of nail polish bottles, always trying to get new colors and find the perfect basecoat.</li>
            <li>Then decided no more salons - bought my own UV Lamp and Shellac system and sure it worked, but finally grew old of time it took, potential damages from UV lamps, and it still does not do a world of good for your nails when the acetone soaks are involved!</li>
            <li>great base coat and makes my nails feel nice and strong for my polish to be applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try the same process but use Colorstay polish and see if I get better results.  </li>
            <li>You get pretty close to \\&quot;gel\\</li>
            <li>And personally I am going to stick with the Opi top coat as this is working well for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly though I don&#x27;t know if the difference I now see is due to this nail polish or a combination.  </li>
            <li>The red polish on my nails that I applied 6 days ago looks great - helped by an extra clear coat to make it look fresher on day 3.  </li>
            <li>but the combination of the three is really working.  </li>
            <li>I can say is WOW!!!</li>
            <li>but aside from this small issue I LOVE THIS POLISH!</li>
            <li>My nails grow pretty fast so after about one week I actually have to change my polish because you see that my nails have grown</li>
            <li>(right middle)</li>
            <li>After about a week, I start to get more than normal tip wear, so I usually change polish at that time, but I am able to last two weeks with very minor wear.  </li>
            <li>I almost want to throw out all my other bottles and only keep the Revlon polishes because honestly these are the only ones I ever use...</li>
            <li>This basecoat leaves a slightly sticky and smooth surface for the color.</li>
            <li>I did get a gel manicure once that lasted for nearly 2 weeks, but my nails were ruined in removing it.  </li>
            <li>the BEST base coat ever.</li>
            <li>This base does a great job of keeping my nails from getting discolored by my polish!</li>
            <li>I should preface this review by noting the following - nail polish chips off for me in one to two days; tried Opi Gel manicure - looked great, impossible to get off; even with a long acetone soak - nails not so pretty after that!</li>
            <li>then two thin layers of color (I mostly use OPI polish)</li>
            <li>Most recently I&#x27;ve been using Seche base &amp; top but still chipping on day #2.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best base coat I&#x27;ve used--my polish lasts over a week with no dipping or peeling!  </li>
            <li>I have fairly long natural nails, but had given up on wearing nail polish.</li>
            <li>we are 4 days later and there is not a single chip to be found.  </li>
            <li>the Colorstay Base &amp; Top coats are critical, a final coat with Seche Vite helps it to dry in minutes, and a flash of UV light added 4+ days to the finish.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it - using their basecoat and topcoat - my nail polish stayed on OVER 10 days with only a little edgewear at the tips!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to believe that my precious Revlon base would cause my normally strong, long nails to wither way, but I&#x27;ve had more breaks and bad peels since using this polish than ever, and while before I only had peeling problems on on nail</li>
            <li> The title I just wrote says it all - Revlon Colorstay Polish lasts, and now that I have the base and top coats, I am so much happier with my long-lasting, great-looking manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;ll use the Colorstay base coat, 2 coats of polish, the Colorstay top coat, and a final coat with Seche Vite to hasten drying time</li>
            <li> so I can see how long they&#x27;ll make it without a chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this lasts so long.</li>
            <li> This Revlon base coat is a superior product.  </li>
            <li> (otherwise I&#x27;ve found it takes too long to dry).  </li>
            <li> yet do not require a long soak off time - this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> The base coat goes on easily, dries in about a minute and really provides a great base for the color of your choice!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve found that I can use the Revlon basecoat, let it dry, and then use any of my other nail polish colors - e.g. Zoya, etc. -</li>
            <li> The only thing I had to touch up was the end of the nails where it wore off a bit after a few days.</li>
            <li> I have since gone back and bought almost all the colors and more of the base and topcoat.  </li>
            <li> I then tried some other brand of gel nail polish - chipped on day</li>
            <li> I, too, was blown away with how long my polish lasted when I started using the Revlon Gel Smooth (sometimes branded as Colorstay) base coat.  </li>
            <li> This base is OK, I get about 3-4 days wear out of my polish with this.  </li>
            <li> When you use it with both the base coat and top coat and 2 COATS OF NAIL POLISH</li>
            <li> LOVE this base coat.</li>
            <li> so I went out and bought a base, color, and top coat from that</li>
            <li> use the Colorstay base coat and top coat.  </li>
            <li> Since purchasing this, I&#x27;ve always used this as a base, Sally Hansen and Out the Door as a top coat.  </li>
            <li> Manicures that last longer mean fewer polish changes and healthier nails.  </li>
            <li> so I tried using the Colorstay base &amp; top coat (with Essie polish and finished with Seche Vite) - but followed up with ~30 seconds under my little UV flashlight.  </li>
            <li> such long wear out of polish that I was changing it because I was bored rather than</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the base coat, the top coat, or the color that is doing all of the heavy lifting</li>
            <li> I use it when I want a funky color for a few days...</li>
            <li> The benefit I get from longer-lasting manicures is worth the cost and time of applying a base coat.  </li>
            <li> , it makes ANY nail polish stick like glue (I finally changed it each time because I was bored with the color).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to rotating a few random base coats to get my nails length and strength back to where it used to be.</li>
            <li> It was on sale at the local grocery store so purchased this base coat, a few colors</li>
            <li> I used to get manicures and my nails would look awful after 2 days, they polish always chipped, and then I&#x27;d start picking, and next thing</li>
            <li> With this base coat it lasts a few days.</li>
            <li> I start with a thin layer of this base coat,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive on-line.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews for the Revlon Colorstay base coat and gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> Forget the base coat.</li>
            <li> , noticed that after using this as our base coat, our nails began peeling uncontrollably.  </li>
            <li> Or worst, paint now, remove and repaint in a couple of hours.  </li>

            <li> I went through a phase where I was determined to find a way to make nail polish last longer than 2 hours.  This base is OK, I get about 3-4 days wear out of my polish with this.  Not the longest wearing solution, but better most.  I use it when I want a funky color for a few days...not when I want to go on vacation and look good for a week!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  When you use it with both the base coat and top coat and 2 COATS OF NAIL POLISH it stays on over a week.  My nails grow pretty fast so after about one week I actually have to change my polish because you see that my nails have grown and there is no polish there.  I wish they had some better colors for nude but aside from this small issue I LOVE THIS POLISH!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t kidding, this stuff works. Combined with the polish and top coat, it stays on like glue, and I mainly have to change my polish because my nails grew, not because of chipping.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best base coat I&#x27;ve used--my polish lasts over a week with no dipping or peeling!  After about a week, I start to get more than normal tip wear, so I usually change polish at that time, but I am able to last two weeks with very minor wear.  I start with a thin layer of this base coat, then two thin layers of color (I mostly use OPI polish), then top it off with Out The Door topcoat.  HG combo for long-wear for me.</li>
            <li> great base coat and makes my nails feel nice and strong for my polish to be applied. Worth the money</li>
            <li> I used to get manicures and my nails would look awful after 2 days, they polish always chipped, and then I&#x27;d start picking, and next thing you know I&#x27;d be hiding my hands during meetings...  I did get a gel manicure once that lasted for nearly 2 weeks, but my nails were ruined in removing it.  A coworker told me about the Revlon Colorstay line and I am converted!  Normally I&#x27;ll use the Colorstay base coat, 2 coats of polish, the Colorstay top coat, and a final coat with Seche Vite to hasten drying time (otherwise I&#x27;ve found it takes too long to dry).  That method worked great for me, my polish would stay bright and not chip for 6-7days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really happy with the Colorstay nail products, but then I read somewhere that they were designed to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; similar to gel polish, but using the natural UV light from the sun.  Since I have always done my nails indoors and at night I figured I wasn&#x27;t getting the full benefit.  I happen to own a UV flashlight (I have this one:  http://www.amazon.com/Ledwholesalers-Violet-Blacklight-Flashlight-7301uv400/dp/B001VZC5LA/) so I tried using the Colorstay base &amp; top coat (with Essie polish and finished with Seche Vite) - but followed up with ~30 seconds under my little UV flashlight.  That was 11 days ago and my nails haven&#x27;t faded or chipped at all.  They are beginning to grow out so I&#x27;ll have to redo them soon, but I&#x27;d like to hold out so I can see how long they&#x27;ll make it without a chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I do eventually take this off I&#x27;ll try the same process but use Colorstay polish and see if I get better results.  Based on my experience the Colorstay Base &amp; Top coats are critical, a final coat with Seche Vite helps it to dry in minutes, and a flash of UV light added 4+ days to the finish.</li>
            <li> This Revlon base coat is a superior product.  The benefit I get from longer-lasting manicures is worth the cost and time of applying a base coat.  The red polish on my nails that I applied 6 days ago looks great - helped by an extra clear coat to make it look fresher on day 3.  Manicures that last longer mean fewer polish changes and healthier nails.  I have super weak nails and wear polish not only for looks, but to reinforce the nail.  Also - I do lots of sewing and my manicures stand up better to picking at fabric, threads and pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> great product!  It helps your nails to keep the polish on longer w/o touch-ups.  Wish I could buy it in the store.  It&#x27;s very expensive on-line.</li>
            <li> I have what a nail tech called \\&quot;oily nail beds\\&quot; - polish literally peels off in one sheet within 24 hours of application. I have fairly long natural nails, but had given up on wearing nail polish. I read some reviews for the Revlon Colorstay base coat and gave it a shot. I have used it four times and it made not only the Revlon Colorstay polish stay on for over a week, it makes ANY nail polish stick like glue (I finally changed it each time because I was bored with the color). The only thing I had to touch up was the end of the nails where it wore off a bit after a few days. This stuff is THE BOMB!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I am a huge fan of the new Revlon \\&quot;Colorstay\\&quot; nail line.  The first time I tried it - using their basecoat and topcoat - my nail polish stayed on OVER 10 days with only a little edgewear at the tips!  I have since gone back and bought almost all the colors and more of the base and topcoat.  You get pretty close to \\&quot;gel\\&quot; manicure results without the hassle and expense.  And I&#x27;ve found that I can use the Revlon basecoat, let it dry, and then use any of my other nail polish colors - e.g. Zoya, etc. - then use the Revlon topcoat and *voila* a very longwearing, nice looking manicure that comes off easily. Great stuff and I hope they keep making it and making more colors too!!!</li>
            <li> Forget the base coat. I used 2 coats of Revlon and 1 coat of Gel manicure top coat by Sally Hansen and my polish is like glass. This has lasted through a weekend of home projects (even through washing dishes). Best I&#x27;ve used in 2 months!</li>
            <li> i like it.  it seems to make the pollish stay longer.  it dries almost instantly and if worn with a topcoat alone the nails look great</li>
            <li> I have a ridiculous collection of nail polish bottles, always trying to get new colors and find the perfect basecoat. Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay line is in a word - amazing. I had getting manicures because there is always a chip guaranteed within 24 hours, and forget after a shower you might as well have not had your nails done. This basecoat leaves a slightly sticky and smooth surface for the color. I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have asked me if my manicures are gel when I use this stuff. And I don&#x27;t see a chip until day 6/7, but without the hassle of removing the gel. I wash dishes, do laundry, and shower daily. I don&#x27;t know how this lasts so long. It really does work best with all other polishes in the Colorstay line (color and top coat), and no I don&#x27;t work for Revlon. Amazon has the best prices for this too - CVS has these for $8-$9, but you can get them here for $4-$5 which is great. I almost want to throw out all my other bottles and only keep the Revlon polishes because honestly these are the only ones I ever use...</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, item as described. LOVE this base coat. the BEST base coat ever. My polish always chipped within a day of painting my nails. With this base coat it lasts a few days. LOVE! I heard Revlon is discontinuing and so I&#x27;m stocking up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of different base/top coats and nothing has come close to this.  Most recently I&#x27;ve been using Seche base &amp; top but still chipping on day #2.  I was on reddit in the laquerista sub and they recommended colorstay...so I went out and bought a base, color, and top coat from that line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we are 4 days later and there is not a single chip to be found.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the base coat, the top coat, or the color that is doing all of the heavy lifting but the combination of the three is really working.  And the color is a glitter polish!  Glitter ALWAYS chips!  But not today!  I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase...I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch again.  Next I will try a different brand of color sandwiched between the two and see if it holds up as well.</li>
            <li> The title I just wrote says it all - Revlon Colorstay Polish lasts, and now that I have the base and top coats, I am so much happier with my long-lasting, great-looking manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Colorstay base coat and top coat.  I use a Revlon Colorstay solid color, one or two coats, and then put my glitter polish on over that, followed by the basecoat.  It lasts and does not have to soak forever to be removed.</li>
            <li> I should preface this review by noting the following - nail polish chips off for me in one to two days; tried Opi Gel manicure - looked great, impossible to get off; even with a long acetone soak - nails not so pretty after that! Tried Shellac, big fan of that, worked well - chipped anywhere from a week to 10 days  - relatively easy to soak off; about 5 minutes in acetone! Then decided no more salons - bought my own UV Lamp and Shellac system and sure it worked, but finally grew old of time it took, potential damages from UV lamps, and it still does not do a world of good for your nails when the acetone soaks are involved! I then tried some other brand of gel nail polish - chipped on day one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I tried this! It was on sale at the local grocery store so purchased this base coat, a few colors and as they were out of top coat, used the Opi regular top coat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is WOW!!! I can now have nail polish that lasts a week - no chipping, no peeling, it looks shiny; and even better, it comes off in seconds when I want it to with a quick swipe of an acetone soaked cotton ball! The base coat goes on easily, dries in about a minute and really provides a great base for the color of your choice! There is a huge selection of colors for this system (purported to offer a gel like look right out of the bottle, which it does) which is another plus! And personally I am going to stick with the Opi top coat as this is working well for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell - if you are fed up with the time and cost of a nail salon, and want to wear bright colors that do not chip - yet do not require a long soak off time - this is the way to go! Best polish ever!!</li>
            <li> I, too, was blown away with how long my polish lasted when I started using the Revlon Gel Smooth (sometimes branded as Colorstay) base coat.  I was getting such long wear out of polish that I was changing it because I was bored rather than it looking bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beware: I myself, as well as a lot of nail polish junkies I&#x27;m friends with, noticed that after using this as our base coat, our nails began peeling uncontrollably.  I didn&#x27;t want to believe that my precious Revlon base would cause my normally strong, long nails to wither way, but I&#x27;ve had more breaks and bad peels since using this polish than ever, and while before I only had peeling problems on on nail (right middle) I currently am battling peels on 4-5 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m back to rotating a few random base coats to get my nails length and strength back to where it used to be.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this.  All these years I&#x27;ve never had nail polish to stick.  Paint today, need to take off and repaint tomorrow.  Or worst, paint now, remove and repaint in a couple of hours.  Honestly though I don&#x27;t know if the difference I now see is due to this nail polish or a combination.  Since purchasing this, I&#x27;ve always used this as a base, Sally Hansen and Out the Door as a top coat.  Now I get almost 2 weeks wear before they start to chip.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My color stays for a week or so.</li>
            <li> This base coat is great.  Manicure will last a week.  I use with Revlon colorstay top coat.</li>
            <li> This base does a great job of keeping my nails from getting discolored by my polish!</li>
