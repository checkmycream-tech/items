            <li>I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>It also has a nice lavender scent.</li>
            <li>I liked the aroma, but my wife did not.  </li>
            <li>and I liked what I smelled.  </li>
            <li>All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: Nice product.</li>
            <li>I got this product in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li>I wish they had added a nice lavender scent, or even made it unscented..</li>
            <li>(I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>spray smells good but strong - lavender and basil as the strongest smells.</li>
            <li>He uses it every night now and he loves that the solution comes in a spray bottle because it is very easy to apply and the mist spreads evenly on his skin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very strong and woodsy.</li>
            <li>Honestly though I love this stuff, it gives me great temporary instant relief and smells really good too!</li>
            <li>This is a excellent spray to use it has all natural in ingredients and no fillers.</li>
            <li>I am very happy that we have found an all natural solution to my husband&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came in a nice 4.46 fl oz bottle with a sprayer top.</li>
            <li>So far so awesome!!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s most effective when you rub in the spray.</li>
            <li>okay is a more honest description.</li>
            <li>I received an email from a very nice lady asking if I would be interested in reviewing a couple of products from Vi-Tae.  </li>
            <li>The coloring and fonts were appealing and I was able to read everything, which was a plus.</li>
            <li>and yes I will be getting more before the spring for all the bug bites and rashes</li>
            <li>He said it is feeling better as well.</li>
            <li>I have been suffering from psoriasis mostly on my scalp for years now and have been trying everything from creams, oils, shampoos, steroid shots, prescriptions, and non-prescriptions.</li>
            <li>I knew my husband would love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I simply added a couple of drops of tea tree oil and lavender which made the treatment smell great!</li>
            <li>My psoriasis has not gotten any better.</li>
            <li>It was work ok.</li>
            <li>Vi-Tae&#x27;s Make it Better spray.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would go over.  </li>
            <li>and I am extremely glad that I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is completely in love, there is no dryness or itching.  </li>
            <li>This is even better then prescriptions that she was given.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and this one seems to work the fastest.</li>
            <li>Okay, I am a believer.</li>
            <li>I do hope the manufacturer can provide an odor-free product as this is so much better to use than medication that affects your body.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found most lotions don&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, it is not thick and greasy and honestly helps with the itching.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for her super itchy, flare days since it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel comfortable no itch or dryness will continue to use and give a more in depth review as I use it more</li>
            <li>This product works wonders for relieving the itching very quickly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fairly strong.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to my loved ones and vouch that the mist reduces itchiness, discomfort and improves the appearance of skin psoriasis.</li>
            <li>and she really has to rub it real good so that it will not mess up her clothes.  </li>
            <li>What I have been mostly using to try to calm my outbreaks is a prescription of Clobex spray.</li>
            <li>I was  given a free copy of this product to test and review</li>
            <li>I was given a free sample of this product to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great</li>
            <li>So far so good, my son gets eczema patches and I&#x27;ve been using this to help.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it made my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>So I am always looking for good, natural remedies to soothe the symptoms.</li>
            <li>She really likes it!!!  </li>
            <li>Once again, it is a strong smell, not unpleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reviewed by Jen&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for review&lt;br /&gt;Review originally posted at Romancing the Book</li>
            <li>It is also a rich source of iron and potassium.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>is pretty convenient:)</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural and safe to use on anyone.</li>
            <li>So far I have came to the conclusion that there is no cure and nothing really works all that great for me.</li>
            <li>Very nice spray for dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product, really does sooth the itch.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for eczema; didn&#x27;t do much for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the company did refund my full purchase price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s full of oil</li>
            <li>After a week straight of using it after bath time her skin was so much better</li>
            <li>This is a true story.</li>
            <li>I really like how effective it is, but the smell really needs significant improvement.</li>
            <li>Her first comment was that the smell was strong, and it is.  </li>
            <li>This product give us both QUICK relief.</li>
            <li>so when I was offered a review sample of this spray I quickly accepted.</li>
            <li>Light mist helps comfort pretty quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but is noticeable.</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be able to write what I have here, but Vi-Tae (Soothing Relief Spray) has given me a new lease on life.</li>
            <li>His skin is less itchy and the appearance of the skin has also greatly improved.</li>
            <li>I would recommend fairly liberal use for the first week to ten days.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s really what happened!!</li>
            <li>I simply love this all natural treatment!</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited when I got the box</li>
            <li>I think a few more uses is going to be completely healthy !</li>
            <li>spray is very gentle and does not irritate my husband&#x27;s skin and has been the natural easy to apply solution I have been searching!</li>
            <li>It’s nice to see a product that only has 5 ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mist is quickly absorbed onto the skin and provides and almost immediate relief in skin discomfort.</li>
            <li>Rarely do I say &#x27;miracle&#x27; but I will now.</li>
            <li>But the great thing - thus far - is this spray actually works and does so</li>
            <li>There is no staining of clothing and it soaks in to the skin pretty quickly</li>
            <li>I thankfully don&#x27;t have poison anything right now</li>
            <li>I tried it right away to see what it does on my skin.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I saw results in the first three or four days - especially my arms and hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true that what works for one may not work for another due to the nature of psoriasis, but I was getting very discouraged when I stumbled across this and was so relieved when it started working - especially so quickly.</li>
            <li>scent is rather unique, strong, woodsy, reminiscent of insect spray, but</li>
            <li>However, since having this spray I have used the spray instead and it is so much faster, easier, smells better and is a natural choice</li>
            <li>Very much would recommend  for usage.</li>
            <li>the good side, despite containing mostly herbal oils as its main ingredient I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn&#x27;t as messy as I&#x27;d come to expect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several products from Vi-tae and have really liked every one, so I had high hopes that this one would be great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soothing Relief is a little more gentle than Make it Better.</li>
            <li>With in the first day of using, my legs no longer itched,  </li>
            <li>It was greasy at first then turned to sticky.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future!!</li>
            <li>I believe this is a sign that it&#x27;s being absorbed into the skin rather than simply clinging to it, which is good because I found my skin becoming firmer and smoother after a few applications.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this spray it immediately stopped the pain from my cracked skin.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to work slightly better than acne specific medicines with salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li>I can only say try it sparingly and make sure it does not cause you any problems.</li>
            <li>After looking at the product pages on Amazon, I went ahead and said sure and was sent out a box containing all of the items above.  </li>
            <li>Really helps sooth my skin and helps stop itching!</li>
            <li>It Better!&amp;#34;]]</li>
            <li>It relieved my itchy skin the first time I tried it.  </li>
            <li>The spray certainly reduces the itching right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the apparent effectiveness, this spray actually smells good.</li>
            <li>When the itchiness came back, I tried the spray again with the same good results.  </li>
            <li>you do decide to give this spray a try it would probably be helpful to know that you will have better results if you rub it in the affected area not just spray it, and don&#x27;t worry the smell will dissipate and it won&#x27;t be so strong a little while after applying!</li>
            <li>This is not a convenient product to simply grab and use, as you need to immediately wash your hands with soap in order to remove the oily residue, and the scent is pretty strong for about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li>My four year old has mild eczema.</li>
            <li>he had some patches of really dry skin and it looks so much better</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t go into contortions to see if I could smell it on my legs, but the fact that I pretty much forgot I had it one is a decent sign that the scent wasn&#x27;t a bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this for two days and it has made a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>I do really like the spray pump on it,</li>
            <li>It was very soothing on my cracked hands.</li>
            <li>Worked really well.</li>
            <li>so I like it much much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(It smelled like walking into Whole Foods, a smell that I find very relaxing and</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Too much comes out at once with the spray</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very greasy.</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t like the smell of this</li>
            <li>spraying action works well and does not drip, and the spray goes on the skin without stickiness, getting absorbed by the skin soon</li>
            <li>When I was offered a free sample of this spray, I hoped it would be an organic option for daily</li>
            <li>but I will admit it is very greasy</li>
            <li>I have NEVER found anything that helped much until now.</li>
            <li>(I gently rub it in).</li>
            <li>and I have not noticed any real difference in the relief by its claims.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s all the natural oils that are in it which i love</li>
            <li>The oil is not too thick and the bottle is a good size.</li>
            <li>My wife had some minor skin irritation and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for it, but she does not have Psoriasis-Eczema (and neither do I), so we don&#x27;t know if it is effective for that specific purpose.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and highly recommend it for any itch problems..  </li>
            <li>B00IWH6MH8 First Aid Spray, All Natural - &amp;#34;Make</li>
            <li>I only need to apply it about twice a day, so that&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin and is very picky about her skin products</li>
            <li>do I like it, is is good, or is it bad, and I will not give a free product a higher rating just because it was free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who receives chaffing in the area that I have specified.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it so wet, but it  makes less itch, also good, thanks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a little tweaking, perhaps adding something to make it smell better, could improve this spray.</li>
            <li>He says it stings a little and it does have a potent smell, but after 1 use the redness in test patch we tried it on was gone.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product for dry itchy skin, I get really dry skin during the winter</li>
            <li>This really does work I used it and also used it on my 2 year old grandson.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for creating a natural remedy to help sufferers of Psoriasis.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li>But its well worth the extra minutes of rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li>The real difference that I found is that it is a little bit more oily than the Clobex, so with most of my outbreaks being on my scalp and me having really long hair, I had to be careful of the time of day of when I used it because my hair would turn super gross and oily.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you are looking for an organic, all natural alternative.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure which of these ingredients is responsible for the strong smell</li>
            <li>So when I was able to purchased this on promotion I was excited but a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li>spray itself when used to provide general soothing and moisturizing to the skin, it works really well.</li>
            <li>, it squirts out instead of coming out like a mist, and it will run, but learning how to spray it on wasn&#x27;t too difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 15 to 20 minutes after I used the spray, the itching on my legs had almost stopped, I was amazed that this herbal spray could actually help almost as well as the medicine I get from my doctor, because I didn&#x27;t really believe it would help at all, but it did help and it is probably worth a try if you have eczema, especially on your legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was interested if this would help especially since it&#x27;s all natural and</li>
            <li>It’s rather harsh, strong and it lingers.</li>
            <li>It helps for a little while since it absorbs quickly, but it also dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the fence with the Vitae Soothing Relief spray, I appreciate that the ingredient list is short and is natural, but this is kind of a hard product to use.</li>
            <li>My husband was very happy with the oils, but would never put them on because they were messy or difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>My arms and backs of my hands are now 99.9% clear and</li>
            <li>so far i am liking it</li>
            <li>I had resent surgery and have developed patches of itchy skin in palms of my hands.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural way to get relief.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for an all natural solution and have tried tons of oils, creams and rubs for his skin.</li>
            <li>When I saw Vi-Tae&#x27;s all natural mist</li>
            <li>But so far, it seems to do as advertised - spray it on an area with an itch, massage it in, and the itch subsides.</li>
            <li>far as effectiveness, I found that it does soothe itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Flaking has already reduced markedly and I&#x27;m using a moisturizer in conjunction to fight dryness.</li>
            <li>I like it so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this for two days and it has made a genuine difference, especially on the back of my neck and earlobes where my attacks seem to be concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the product 1 time a day for 2 weeks (so far).  </li>
            <li>This product works exceptionally well on dry patches of skin with visible results in about a week and no allergic or negative reactions at all.</li>
            <li>After trying a number of different lotions and potions to eliminate these dried patches, this was the only one that was 100% effective.</li>
            <li>I am only using it for a few days now, but I sure will keep it in my purse.</li>
            <li>I am going to probably use this for the lesser outbreaks and the Clobex for the more serious ones that seem to plague me when I am really stressed.</li>
            <li>It burned her skin a little the first time we used it because her skin was a bit inflamed but after that it really helped relieve the itching.</li>
            <li>this is due to the fact that the spray&#x27;s nutrients need time to get absorbed and work its way through the skin layers to take effect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did make my skin smell slightly like a herbal garden, particularly for the first fifteen minutes after application.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance of the spray itself is a little on the strong side when you first apply it, but it dissipates in a few hours.</li>
            <li>However, a side effect of this is that I often have tender or irritated scalp in the days immediately following the new style being installed.  </li>
            <li>It will not dry out the skin and leaves it moisturized so that your skin stays soft.</li>
            <li>I get an occasional rash from spending too much time in the bath, this works so well on the back of my legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first thought was going to be oily but far from it it also cut down on the urge to of my itching.</li>
            <li>The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free.</li>
            <li>I have very stubborn psoriasis and even though I&#x27;ve used this for only a few days, so far, it really seems to be helping.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I particularly did not like was how the oils just sat on my skin and took a long time to absorb.  </li>
            <li>This works great to stop bad itch from psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it daily and my skin feels soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate me anymore.  </li>
            <li>My 14yr old daughter has suffered from severe eczema her entire life</li>
            <li>In fact the entire area has completely healed after a couple of weeks of usage.  </li>
            <li>When used regularly this product really helped to soothe and moisturize dry, itchy areas of skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is not dry and it is not broke out either.  </li>
            <li>But this may be due to the fact that he had an extensive breakout when he used it so sprayed quite a large area.</li>
            <li>For the first few minutes it felt greasy but that also faded quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little greasy at first, but it soaks in soon enough if you rub at it for a while.</li>
            <li>So far it relieves temporary itching and discomfort, haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any longer term benefits.</li>
            <li>and we have been through a whole mess of products.  </li>
            <li>Since you can&#x27;t use steroid creams constantly, I also have another medicated lotion for daily, frequent use to keep my elbows from getting overly dry.</li>

            <li> It also has a nice lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I liked the aroma, but my wife did not.  </li>

            <li> All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: Nice product.</li>
            <li> I got this product in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> I wish they had added a nice lavender scent, or even made it unscented..</li>
            <li> (I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> spray smells good but strong - lavender and basil as the strongest smells.</li>
            <li> He uses it every night now and he loves that the solution comes in a spray bottle because it is very easy to apply and the mist spreads evenly on his skin.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very strong and woodsy.</li>
            <li> Honestly though I love this stuff, it gives me great temporary instant relief and smells really good too!</li>
            <li> This is a excellent spray to use it has all natural in ingredients and no fillers.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that we have found an all natural solution to my husband&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in a nice 4.46 fl oz bottle with a sprayer top.</li>
            <li> So far so awesome!!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s most effective when you rub in the spray.</li>
            <li> okay is a more honest description.</li>
            <li> I received an email from a very nice lady asking if I would be interested in reviewing a couple of products from Vi-Tae.  </li>
            <li> The coloring and fonts were appealing and I was able to read everything, which was a plus.</li>
            <li> and yes I will be getting more before the spring for all the bug bites and rashes</li>
            <li> He said it is feeling better as well.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from psoriasis mostly on my scalp for years now and have been trying everything from creams, oils, shampoos, steroid shots, prescriptions, and non-prescriptions.</li>
            <li> I knew my husband would love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I simply added a couple of drops of tea tree oil and lavender which made the treatment smell great!</li>
            <li> My psoriasis has not gotten any better.</li>
            <li> It was work ok.</li>
            <li> Vi-Tae&#x27;s Make it Better spray.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would go over.  </li>
            <li> and I am extremely glad that I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is completely in love, there is no dryness or itching.  </li>
            <li> This is even better then prescriptions that she was given.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and this one seems to work the fastest.</li>
            <li> Okay, I am a believer.</li>
            <li> I do hope the manufacturer can provide an odor-free product as this is so much better to use than medication that affects your body.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found most lotions don&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, it is not thick and greasy and honestly helps with the itching.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for her super itchy, flare days since it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel comfortable no itch or dryness will continue to use and give a more in depth review as I use it more</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for relieving the itching very quickly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fairly strong.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to my loved ones and vouch that the mist reduces itchiness, discomfort and improves the appearance of skin psoriasis.</li>
            <li> and she really has to rub it real good so that it will not mess up her clothes.  </li>
            <li> What I have been mostly using to try to calm my outbreaks is a prescription of Clobex spray.</li>
            <li> I was  given a free copy of this product to test and review</li>
            <li> I was given a free sample of this product to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great</li>
            <li> So far so good, my son gets eczema patches and I&#x27;ve been using this to help.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it made my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> So I am always looking for good, natural remedies to soothe the symptoms.</li>
            <li> She really likes it!!!  </li>
            <li> Once again, it is a strong smell, not unpleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reviewed by Jen&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for review&lt;br /&gt;Review originally posted at Romancing the Book</li>
            <li> It is also a rich source of iron and potassium.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> is pretty convenient:)</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural and safe to use on anyone.</li>
            <li> So far I have came to the conclusion that there is no cure and nothing really works all that great for me.</li>
            <li> Very nice spray for dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product, really does sooth the itch.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better for eczema; didn&#x27;t do much for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the company did refund my full purchase price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s full of oil</li>
            <li> After a week straight of using it after bath time her skin was so much better</li>
            <li> This is a true story.</li>
            <li> I really like how effective it is, but the smell really needs significant improvement.</li>
            <li> Her first comment was that the smell was strong, and it is.  </li>
            <li> This product give us both QUICK relief.</li>
            <li> so when I was offered a review sample of this spray I quickly accepted.</li>
            <li> Light mist helps comfort pretty quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but is noticeable.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be able to write what I have here, but Vi-Tae (Soothing Relief Spray) has given me a new lease on life.</li>
            <li> His skin is less itchy and the appearance of the skin has also greatly improved.</li>
            <li> I would recommend fairly liberal use for the first week to ten days.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s really what happened!!</li>
            <li> I simply love this all natural treatment!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited when I got the box</li>
            <li> I think a few more uses is going to be completely healthy !</li>
            <li> spray is very gentle and does not irritate my husband&#x27;s skin and has been the natural easy to apply solution I have been searching!</li>
            <li> It’s nice to see a product that only has 5 ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mist is quickly absorbed onto the skin and provides and almost immediate relief in skin discomfort.</li>
            <li> Rarely do I say &#x27;miracle&#x27; but I will now.</li>
            <li> But the great thing - thus far - is this spray actually works and does so</li>
            <li> There is no staining of clothing and it soaks in to the skin pretty quickly</li>
            <li> I thankfully don&#x27;t have poison anything right now</li>
            <li> I tried it right away to see what it does on my skin.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I saw results in the first three or four days - especially my arms and hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true that what works for one may not work for another due to the nature of psoriasis, but I was getting very discouraged when I stumbled across this and was so relieved when it started working - especially so quickly.</li>
            <li> scent is rather unique, strong, woodsy, reminiscent of insect spray, but</li>
            <li> However, since having this spray I have used the spray instead and it is so much faster, easier, smells better and is a natural choice</li>
            <li> Very much would recommend  for usage.</li>
            <li> the good side, despite containing mostly herbal oils as its main ingredient I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn&#x27;t as messy as I&#x27;d come to expect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products from Vi-tae and have really liked every one, so I had high hopes that this one would be great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soothing Relief is a little more gentle than Make it Better.</li>
            <li> With in the first day of using, my legs no longer itched,  </li>
            <li> It was greasy at first then turned to sticky.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the future!!</li>
            <li> I believe this is a sign that it&#x27;s being absorbed into the skin rather than simply clinging to it, which is good because I found my skin becoming firmer and smoother after a few applications.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this spray it immediately stopped the pain from my cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to work slightly better than acne specific medicines with salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> I can only say try it sparingly and make sure it does not cause you any problems.</li>
            <li> After looking at the product pages on Amazon, I went ahead and said sure and was sent out a box containing all of the items above.  </li>
            <li> Really helps sooth my skin and helps stop itching!</li>
            <li> It Better!&amp;#34;]]</li>
            <li> It relieved my itchy skin the first time I tried it.  </li>
            <li> The spray certainly reduces the itching right away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the apparent effectiveness, this spray actually smells good.</li>
            <li> When the itchiness came back, I tried the spray again with the same good results.  </li>
            <li> you do decide to give this spray a try it would probably be helpful to know that you will have better results if you rub it in the affected area not just spray it, and don&#x27;t worry the smell will dissipate and it won&#x27;t be so strong a little while after applying!</li>
            <li> This is not a convenient product to simply grab and use, as you need to immediately wash your hands with soap in order to remove the oily residue, and the scent is pretty strong for about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li> I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> My four year old has mild eczema.</li>
            <li> he had some patches of really dry skin and it looks so much better</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t go into contortions to see if I could smell it on my legs, but the fact that I pretty much forgot I had it one is a decent sign that the scent wasn&#x27;t a bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for two days and it has made a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> I do really like the spray pump on it,</li>
            <li> It was very soothing on my cracked hands.</li>
            <li> Worked really well.</li>
            <li> so I like it much much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (It smelled like walking into Whole Foods, a smell that I find very relaxing and</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Too much comes out at once with the spray</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very greasy.</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t like the smell of this</li>
            <li> spraying action works well and does not drip, and the spray goes on the skin without stickiness, getting absorbed by the skin soon</li>
            <li> When I was offered a free sample of this spray, I hoped it would be an organic option for daily</li>
            <li> but I will admit it is very greasy</li>
            <li> I have NEVER found anything that helped much until now.</li>
            <li> (I gently rub it in).</li>
            <li> and I have not noticed any real difference in the relief by its claims.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s all the natural oils that are in it which i love</li>
            <li> The oil is not too thick and the bottle is a good size.</li>
            <li> My wife had some minor skin irritation and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for it, but she does not have Psoriasis-Eczema (and neither do I), so we don&#x27;t know if it is effective for that specific purpose.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and highly recommend it for any itch problems..  </li>
            <li> B00IWH6MH8 First Aid Spray, All Natural - &amp;#34;Make</li>
            <li> I only need to apply it about twice a day, so that&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin and is very picky about her skin products</li>
            <li> do I like it, is is good, or is it bad, and I will not give a free product a higher rating just because it was free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who receives chaffing in the area that I have specified.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it so wet, but it  makes less itch, also good, thanks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a little tweaking, perhaps adding something to make it smell better, could improve this spray.</li>
            <li> He says it stings a little and it does have a potent smell, but after 1 use the redness in test patch we tried it on was gone.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product for dry itchy skin, I get really dry skin during the winter</li>
            <li> This really does work I used it and also used it on my 2 year old grandson.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for creating a natural remedy to help sufferers of Psoriasis.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li> But its well worth the extra minutes of rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li> The real difference that I found is that it is a little bit more oily than the Clobex, so with most of my outbreaks being on my scalp and me having really long hair, I had to be careful of the time of day of when I used it because my hair would turn super gross and oily.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you are looking for an organic, all natural alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which of these ingredients is responsible for the strong smell</li>
            <li> So when I was able to purchased this on promotion I was excited but a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> spray itself when used to provide general soothing and moisturizing to the skin, it works really well.</li>
            <li> , it squirts out instead of coming out like a mist, and it will run, but learning how to spray it on wasn&#x27;t too difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 15 to 20 minutes after I used the spray, the itching on my legs had almost stopped, I was amazed that this herbal spray could actually help almost as well as the medicine I get from my doctor, because I didn&#x27;t really believe it would help at all, but it did help and it is probably worth a try if you have eczema, especially on your legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was interested if this would help especially since it&#x27;s all natural and</li>
            <li> It’s rather harsh, strong and it lingers.</li>
            <li> It helps for a little while since it absorbs quickly, but it also dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence with the Vitae Soothing Relief spray, I appreciate that the ingredient list is short and is natural, but this is kind of a hard product to use.</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy with the oils, but would never put them on because they were messy or difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> My arms and backs of my hands are now 99.9% clear and</li>
            <li> so far i am liking it</li>
            <li> I had resent surgery and have developed patches of itchy skin in palms of my hands.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural way to get relief.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for an all natural solution and have tried tons of oils, creams and rubs for his skin.</li>
            <li> When I saw Vi-Tae&#x27;s all natural mist</li>
            <li> But so far, it seems to do as advertised - spray it on an area with an itch, massage it in, and the itch subsides.</li>
            <li> far as effectiveness, I found that it does soothe itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Flaking has already reduced markedly and I&#x27;m using a moisturizer in conjunction to fight dryness.</li>
            <li> I like it so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for two days and it has made a genuine difference, especially on the back of my neck and earlobes where my attacks seem to be concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the product 1 time a day for 2 weeks (so far).  </li>
            <li> This product works exceptionally well on dry patches of skin with visible results in about a week and no allergic or negative reactions at all.</li>
            <li> After trying a number of different lotions and potions to eliminate these dried patches, this was the only one that was 100% effective.</li>
            <li> I am only using it for a few days now, but I sure will keep it in my purse.</li>
            <li> I am going to probably use this for the lesser outbreaks and the Clobex for the more serious ones that seem to plague me when I am really stressed.</li>
            <li> It burned her skin a little the first time we used it because her skin was a bit inflamed but after that it really helped relieve the itching.</li>
            <li> this is due to the fact that the spray&#x27;s nutrients need time to get absorbed and work its way through the skin layers to take effect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did make my skin smell slightly like a herbal garden, particularly for the first fifteen minutes after application.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance of the spray itself is a little on the strong side when you first apply it, but it dissipates in a few hours.</li>
            <li> However, a side effect of this is that I often have tender or irritated scalp in the days immediately following the new style being installed.  </li>
            <li> It will not dry out the skin and leaves it moisturized so that your skin stays soft.</li>
            <li> I get an occasional rash from spending too much time in the bath, this works so well on the back of my legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first thought was going to be oily but far from it it also cut down on the urge to of my itching.</li>
            <li> The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free.</li>
            <li> I have very stubborn psoriasis and even though I&#x27;ve used this for only a few days, so far, it really seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I particularly did not like was how the oils just sat on my skin and took a long time to absorb.  </li>
            <li> This works great to stop bad itch from psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it daily and my skin feels soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate me anymore.  </li>
            <li> My 14yr old daughter has suffered from severe eczema her entire life</li>
            <li> In fact the entire area has completely healed after a couple of weeks of usage.  </li>
            <li> When used regularly this product really helped to soothe and moisturize dry, itchy areas of skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is not dry and it is not broke out either.  </li>
            <li> But this may be due to the fact that he had an extensive breakout when he used it so sprayed quite a large area.</li>
            <li> For the first few minutes it felt greasy but that also faded quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little greasy at first, but it soaks in soon enough if you rub at it for a while.</li>
            <li> So far it relieves temporary itching and discomfort, haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any longer term benefits.</li>
            <li> and we have been through a whole mess of products.  </li>
            <li> Since you can&#x27;t use steroid creams constantly, I also have another medicated lotion for daily, frequent use to keep my elbows from getting overly dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the effectiveness of this amazing spray, the smell is not half bad.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s because when my wife look at the list products we were invited to try/review, she mistakenly thought this product was for general skin irritation/rashes (her English is very limited</li>
            <li> Psoriasis is something that my grandfather (my mom&#x27;s dad) has dealt with for a long time (on his legs) and something that my mother and I both have small patches of that can sometimes be very bothersome, so this was something I definitely wanted to try out.  </li>
            <li> I have a small patch on the side of my leg about the size of a quarter that gets very itchy.  </li>
            <li> I have never been diagnosed with psoriasis-eczema, but I do get dry itching patches on the back of my calf.</li>
            <li> I have even used it on a dry, scaly, itchy hotspots on my dog&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> This winter my skin on my back and arms has gotten quite dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> Because my skin seemed to toughen I did loose a tiny bit of sensitivity in my fingers, but that may be my imagination since the effect was so small.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the fact that it’s all natural and it’s supposed to be soothing since my patches tend to get a little itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i would rather be putting something all natural on me everyday rather then  steroid creams</li>
            <li> Once applied the smell does not linger for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a strange smell.</li>
            <li> The flare went down however after I was prescribed a one-week course of Prelone and a shot of Prednisolone by a general practitioner just two days before my spray arrived.</li>
            <li> Pretty much everyone in my household suffers from eczema and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used it for dry skin on my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helped my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days but the itch relief you get the instant</li>
            <li> Even a single pump distributes a lot of dripping oil to rub in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not particularly oily and soaks in well, leaving the skin feeling moisturized and invigorated.</li>
            <li> Oftentimes, when I spray the product on my knees, it actually burns a little before it soothes, which isn’t what I’d</li>
            <li> sprayed it several times and it hardly looks like I used it at all, so I&#x27;m betting it will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint about Vi-Tae products (I&#x27;ve used a lot of them); the liquids are all in identical bottles with the same color label.</li>
            <li> the few days that I have been using this relief spray I have applied it 5 times and so this bottle should last me well over a month probably around six weeks</li>
            <li> I was really rooting for this product because I suffer so with psoriasis on my neck hairline and behind my ears.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t just for those ailments - the heartbreak of psoriasis, eczema, and dermatitis - it works on just about any itch, mosquito bites and places where skin has dried out, like the back of knees or elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to read the name carefully when you choose the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the spray-oil formulation and scent are two things that I really do not like about this product.</li>
            <li> It last for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely certain that I would want to smell like this all the time, so I&#x27;m a bit concerned about that.</li>
            <li> I have eczema in a few small areas on my hands, and have been using the spray on those areas several times daily.  </li>
            <li> I have the worst dry skin ever and its sensitive on top of that.  </li>
            <li> I put on with a cotton ball on the effected areas (hair line and behind my ears and on my cheeks) and today I woke up with clear skin!!</li>
            <li> I have an eczema on my knee and it really itchy and really uncomfortable when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> But I tried it and it worked in ways the other treatments had not.  </li>
            <li> I used this product on my daughter who often gets a rash between her breast due to size.  </li>
            <li> It only requires a smallsquirt of this treatment and boom no more rash.  </li>
            <li> Light therapy has worked some but not that well and is very uncomfortable and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I am not being reimbursed in any way to write this review, other than receiving a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is too herbal for my tastes---it smells woodsy and enough like food that it causes my dogs to follow me around sniffing for at least a half-hour after spraying it.</li>
            <li> Other than that little issue, he says this product has helped him out</li>
            <li> As others have said, it has a slight odor - to me it smells like tea, but it&#x27;s not offensive at all.</li>
            <li> I normally use a prescription steroid for my psoriasis supplemented with expensive over the counter moisturizing creams.  </li>
            <li> I did get around that by changing steroids (gas carrier not oil), but my new treatment is expensive (even with insurance) .  </li>
            <li> As a person with Psoriasis, I have a few areas that are typically inflamed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it, I do find my skin is a little softer.</li>
            <li> It also doesn’t help that it is a little oily</li>
            <li> I had used lots of products and some with lots of oils smelll a little off.</li>
            <li> He got a little of this product on an area he scratched and it started stinging.</li>
            <li> I recently suffered from an eczema flare, the worst I&#x27;ve had in 15+ years to be precise.</li>
            <li> Seemed to take a few applications for its anti-itching properties to kick in for me, though I take it</li>
            <li> I could get my hands on (some actually make things worse)</li>
            <li> Dried the skin instead of nourishing it.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of the Soothing Relief from Sari this past summer but had no occasion to use it until now.  </li>
            <li> but it is unbelievably soothing.</li>
            <li> summer I would usually see some lessening of symptoms but not this year -</li>
            <li> I usually break out.  </li>
            <li> but I would still be left with painful dry sometimes cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was actually surprised that this worked, I was very doubtful when I tried it, but I suffer from some pretty bad eczema, especially on my legs</li>
            <li> product works as advertised, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> My daughter used it on her itchy summer eczema and complained that it burned.</li>
            <li> - at least it doesn&#x27;t sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even at that rate I am estimating that this is at least a six week supply, but could be up to three months.</li>
            <li> or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have bouts of hives and have to use a thick steroid cream during breakouts.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t know how I could test this product, but just recently, my wife suddenly had a terrible case of itchy skin, apparently eczema, from which she suffers.</li>
            <li> the smell is a little weird</li>
            <li> I have had a tough time with psoriasis lately.</li>
            <li> It might double as an insect repellant, it smells that bad.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has bad eczema from time to time and this has helped him find relief when it starts acting up.</li>
            <li> Not effective at all in my case, actualy made it worse.</li>
            <li> Some of you may like it, and some of you may not, I am not saying that the product is not good because it did provide the moisture</li>
            <li> When I have an exceptionally bad flare-up, this is the only product that will ease the discomfort and not make it worse.</li>
            <li> Long term steroid usage had also created a massive staph infection that was difficult  to treat, ugly to look at and painful.  </li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe how fast the flaking stopped and the horrible redness began to disappear.</li>
            <li> the cream he uses contains steroids which thin the skin and affect his blood sugar levels.</li>
            <li> I put my hair in complicated braided styles to keep it up and out of the way, and to protect it from manipulation.  </li>
            <li> So I was skeptical when offered an over the counter solution.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t fell there is a signefecant  relief of my itchy scalp, beside it is so expensive</li>
            <li> I do advise anyone who will be using this to not use it on broken skin!</li>
            <li> some treatments I have found to be very difficult to almost useless to get to my scalp through my hair because of the consistency or type of application that comes with the product</li>
            <li> I have tried the Psoriasis-Eczema Treatment and it did provide the moisture that I needed and the smell is not that bad.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it irritated my skin horribly, which resulted in making my eczema MUCH worse.  </li>
            <li> I hate it when I have an itch</li>
            <li> , I broke out in a bad rash!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell terrible and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> my knees (where it&#x27;s been the worst) are 65% clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Immediately, the terrible itching stopped, and did not return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good to use. I used this product on my niece and wanted to see the effects over a period of time after getting the product. As for as I can see and viewing this relief the irritation and itching for my niece it was gradual and not instant but still worked well.</li>
            <li> This is a excellent spray to use it has all natural in ingredients and no fillers. It will not dry out the skin and leaves it moisturized so that your skin stays soft.</li>
            <li> With in the first day of using, my legs no longer itched,  this is an every day battle in the south.  I shared with two of my friends and they ordered some too.  I love it !!!</li>
            <li> Reviewed by Jen&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for review&lt;br /&gt;Review originally posted at Romancing the Book&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some patches of psoriasis on my knees and elbows, so I thought I’d give this product a try. I was intrigued by the fact that it’s all natural and it’s supposed to be soothing since my patches tend to get a little itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the bottle arrived, I found the packaging to be attractive. The coloring and fonts were appealing and I was able to read everything, which was a plus. I was especially drawn to the short list of ingredients. It’s nice to see a product that only has 5 ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been trying this product for about 6 weeks now. I’m still not used to the smell. It’s rather harsh, strong and it lingers. It’s also not as soothing as I’d like. Oftentimes, when I spray the product on my knees, it actually burns a little before it soothes, which isn’t what I’d expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it, I do find my skin is a little softer. But, with the smell, I probably don’t use it often enough to “relieve the symptoms of psoriasis” as the description states. It also doesn’t help that it is a little oily and I have to wash my hands after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a little tweaking, perhaps adding something to make it smell better, could improve this spray.</li>
            <li> This really does work I used it and also used it on my 2 year old grandson.  It stoped the itching with in 15 mins,  I use all the time now when ever anyone states that they itch any where here I come with Psoriasis Eczema Treatment and I also give out the name and where I got it and yes I will be getting more before the spring for all the bug bites and rashes thank you so much I love that it is all natural and safe to use on anyone.</li>
            <li> So far so good, my son gets eczema patches and I&#x27;ve been using this to help. He says it stings a little and it does have a potent smell, but after 1 use the redness in test patch we tried it on was gone. He said it is feeling better as well.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days but the itch relief you get the instant you spray it on is amazing the smell is a little weird but that&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s all the natural oils that are in it which i love i would rather be putting something all natural on me everyday rather then  steroid creams so far i am liking it</li>
            <li> So far it relieves temporary itching and discomfort, haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any longer term benefits.</li>
            <li> I have never been diagnosed with psoriasis-eczema, but I do get dry itching patches on the back of my calf. This product works wonders for relieving the itching very quickly. I have even used it on a dry, scaly, itchy hotspots on my dog&#x27;s back. When she sees me using she runs to me and sits in front of me with her back to me waiting for me to spray it on her. This product give us both QUICK relief. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, really does sooth the itch. I had resent surgery and have developed patches of itchy skin in palms of my hands. Product has nice fragrance and does stop itching when applied.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from psoriasis mostly on my scalp for years now and have been trying everything from creams, oils, shampoos, steroid shots, prescriptions, and non-prescriptions. So far I have came to the conclusion that there is no cure and nothing really works all that great for me. What I have been mostly using to try to calm my outbreaks is a prescription of Clobex spray. I found this treatment from Vi-Tae to be a great alternative for that without needing the prescription. It works almost the same! The real difference that I found is that it is a little bit more oily than the Clobex, so with most of my outbreaks being on my scalp and me having really long hair, I had to be careful of the time of day of when I used it because my hair would turn super gross and oily. I do really like the spray pump on it, some treatments I have found to be very difficult to almost useless to get to my scalp through my hair because of the consistency or type of application that comes with the product but I did not have that problem with this one. Honestly though I love this stuff, it gives me great temporary instant relief and smells really good too!</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better for eczema; didn&#x27;t do much for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I tried it as soon as I got it in. I will admit the smell takes some getting used to. It does fade but it&#x27;s fairly strong. I sprayed it on my hands as that&#x27;s where my problem is. It was greasy at first then turned to sticky. I kept rubbing it in and the stickiness went away. The moisture was great. It was very soothing on my cracked hands. Didn&#x27;t burn. Worked really well. With continued use I hope my hands stop cracking and hurting. Received this product for review.</li>
            <li> I put my hair in complicated braided styles to keep it up and out of the way, and to protect it from manipulation.  However, a side effect of this is that I often have tender or irritated scalp in the days immediately following the new style being installed.  I have used about a billion different store-bought sprays to try to soothe the discomfort, but they either worsen the issue (because of the junk ingredients) or do nothing to help.  This immediately makes a difference, and (although I was a bit worried) the salt didn&#x27;t cause any damage to my hair or scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: laminaria digitata (kelp extract), sea water, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, ocimum sanctium (basil holy) oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discounted cost in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have had a tough time with psoriasis lately. I was looking for a natural way to get relief. So when I was able to purchased this on promotion I was excited but a bit skeptical. I am going to be completely honest when I say this work wonderful!! I put on with a cotton ball on the effected areas (hair line and behind my ears and on my cheeks) and today I woke up with clear skin!! I know that&#x27;s sounds like it worked too soon but that&#x27;s really what happened!! I&#x27;m so happy I got this product. It&#x27;s oil based and to me has a lavender and mint mixed smell. The smell is a bit strong but very pleasant. The oil is not too thick and the bottle is a good size. I will be purchasing more in the future!! 2 thumbs up 👍👍</li>
            <li> I suffer from routine bouts of psoriasis so when I was offered a sample of this spray I was thrilled!. I&#x27;ve only had this for two days and it has made a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the effectiveness of this amazing spray, the smell is not half bad. I had used lots of products and some with lots of oils smelll a little off. In my opinion the basil oil dominates the fragrance, with a very tiny hint of lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the few days that I have been using this relief spray I have applied it 5 times and so this bottle should last me well over a month probably around six weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have bouts of hives and have to use a thick steroid cream during breakouts. However, since having this spray I have used the spray instead and it is so much faster, easier, smells better and is a natural choice so I like it much much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do decide to give this spray a try it would probably be helpful to know that you will have better results if you rub it in the affected area not just spray it, and don&#x27;t worry the smell will dissipate and it won&#x27;t be so strong a little while after applying! I would recommend this spray to anyone who needs relief from a skin condition.</li>
            <li> My husband has skin psoriasis and constantly complains about itchy skin. He has gone to the doctor and was prescribed a cream which he never uses because he dislikes the toxins and chemicals in the cream. I have been searching for an all natural solution and have tried tons of oils, creams and rubs for his skin. My husband was very happy with the oils, but would never put them on because they were messy or difficult to apply. When I saw Vi-Tae&#x27;s all natural mist I knew my husband would love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the bottle arrived I was beyond excited and my husband tested the soothing relief spray and loved it! He uses it every night now and he loves that the solution comes in a spray bottle because it is very easy to apply and the mist spreads evenly on his skin. The only thing my husband did not like is the scent and I simply added a couple of drops of tea tree oil and lavender which made the treatment smell great! My husband has now been using this spray for over a week and is very pleased with the results. His skin is less itchy and the appearance of the skin has also greatly improved. I am very happy that we have found an all natural solution to my husband&#x27;s skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray is very gentle and does not irritate my husband&#x27;s skin and has been the natural easy to apply solution I have been searching! I would highly recommend this product to my loved ones and vouch that the mist reduces itchiness, discomfort and improves the appearance of skin psoriasis. The mist is quickly absorbed onto the skin and provides and almost immediate relief in skin discomfort. I simply love this all natural treatment!</li>
            <li> I must be allergic to an ingredient in this product, I tested it in my wrist, rubbed a tiny portion of it, I broke out in a bad rash!</li>
            <li> I recently suffered from an eczema flare, the worst I&#x27;ve had in 15+ years to be precise. The flare went down however after I was prescribed a one-week course of Prelone and a shot of Prednisolone by a general practitioner just two days before my spray arrived. But so far, it seems to do as advertised - spray it on an area with an itch, massage it in, and the itch subsides. I&#x27;ll continue using it to see if regular use can help to prevent future flare-ups and itch-scratch cycles once I&#x27;ve come off my Prednisolone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: April 24, 2015&lt;br /&gt;On the good side, despite containing mostly herbal oils as its main ingredient I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn&#x27;t as messy as I&#x27;d come to expect. Doesn&#x27;t stain fabrics, and I can even pick up papers with my hands after applying, without them being soaked in oils. I believe this is a sign that it&#x27;s being absorbed into the skin rather than simply clinging to it, which is good because I found my skin becoming firmer and smoother after a few applications. Seemed to take a few applications for its anti-itching properties to kick in for me, though I take it this is due to the fact that the spray&#x27;s nutrients need time to get absorbed and work its way through the skin layers to take effect.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully! Doesn&#x27;t smell terrible and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on the skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> When used regularly this product really helped to soothe and moisturize dry, itchy areas of skin.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of the Soothing Relief from Sari this past summer but had no occasion to use it until now.  This winter my skin on my back and arms has gotten quite dry and itchy.  I thought this would be a good opportunity to try Soothing Relief.  I asked my wife to spray my itchy back with the product.  Her first comment was that the smell was strong, and it is.  I just sprayed some on my hand and am thinking the smell is somewhat similar to cloves.  Once again, it is a strong smell, not unpleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works as advertised, at least for me.  The itchiness in my back subsided immediately and stayed away for a couple of days.  When the itchiness came back, I tried the spray again with the same good results.  When I sprayed the product on the redness on my arms the discomfort and redness went away, again for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number one ingredient in this product is laminaria digitata.  The Internet tells me that \\&quot;Laminaria is a type of seaweed that is native to Japan. Laminaria contains iodine, an element that the body needs to make thyroid hormones. It is also a rich source of iron and potassium.\\&quot;  Lavender oil and basil are also added to the mix. I&#x27;m not sure which of these ingredients is responsible for the strong smell and I don&#x27;t know how it all works together except to say that it this product has been helpful to me.</li>
            <li> This product might work for others, but it did not work for me. In fact, it irritated my skin horribly, which resulted in making my eczema MUCH worse.  Thankfully, the company did refund my full purchase price.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  I have been using this product for about two weeks. I was really rooting for this product because I suffer so with psoriasis on my neck hairline and behind my ears. The product doesn&#x27;t have a very pleasant odor but it is unbelievably soothing. It did not leave a greasy residue in my hair which impresses me but I need to use Viotae several times a day to continue getting relief. I feel that it&#x27;s just a temporary fix. My psoriasis has not gotten any better.</li>
            <li> It was work ok. But smell sting .</li>
            <li> My four year old has mild eczema. This product is perfect for her super itchy, flare days since it&#x27;s all natural. It stops the itching on contact and moisturizes. It also has a nice lavender scent. Highly recommend if you are looking for an organic, all natural alternative.</li>
            <li> Helped a lot with both the itching from my eczema and some bug bites on my fiance. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> this is working great on my husband skin he had some patches of really dry skin and it looks so much better I think a few more uses is going to be completely healthy !</li>
            <li> Can already see and feel the improvement!!</li>
            <li> No problems with packaging and delivery.  This works great to stop bad itch from psoriasis.  I really like this product and highly recommend it for any itch problems..  Thank you for a  great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it so wet, but it  makes less itch, also good, thanks.</li>
            <li> I normally use a prescription steroid for my psoriasis supplemented with expensive over the counter moisturizing creams.  So I was skeptical when offered an over the counter solution.  But I tried it and it worked in ways the other treatments had not.  The creams would stop the itching,and control flaking but I would still be left with painful dry sometimes cracked skin.  Long term steroid usage had also created a massive staph infection that was difficult  to treat, ugly to look at and painful.  I did get around that by changing steroids (gas carrier not oil), but my new treatment is expensive (even with insurance) .  The first time I used this spray it immediately stopped the pain from my cracked skin.  Instead of leaving me with softer skin like the creams it seemed to toughen the skin.  Because my skin seemed to toughen I did loose a tiny bit of sensitivity in my fingers, but that may be my imagination since the effect was so small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did make my skin smell slightly like a herbal garden, particularly for the first fifteen minutes after application.  I liked the aroma, but my wife did not.  For the first few minutes it felt greasy but that also faded quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently  I had acne pimple occur and had no acne medicine at home.  So I tossed some of this on the pimple.  It seemed to work slightly better than acne specific medicines with salicylic acid.  This is not one of the things the product is noted for;  but it worked for me.  I can only say try it sparingly and make sure it does not cause you any problems. It stings some when it goes on open skin.</li>
            <li> I received an email from a very nice lady asking if I would be interested in reviewing a couple of products from Vi-Tae.  After looking at the product pages on Amazon, I went ahead and said sure and was sent out a box containing all of the items above.  Not sample amounts - full-sized amounts for me to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;  I was pretty excited when I got the box - I could smell the items through the outside of the box and I liked what I smelled.  (It smelled like walking into Whole Foods, a smell that I find very relaxing and intoxicating.)&lt;br /&gt;  All of the products from Vi-Tae are organic/natural products, plus they have a 100% money back guaranteed, which they have extended to a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soothing Relief is an item made for people who have Psoriasis and/or Eczema.  It is a liquid that mists out when you spray on it.  Psoriasis is something that my grandfather (my mom&#x27;s dad) has dealt with for a long time (on his legs) and something that my mother and I both have small patches of that can sometimes be very bothersome, so this was something I definitely wanted to try out.  It definitely &amp;#34;soothes&amp;#34; the itch and is something I would recommend to anyone dealing with either one of these things.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product! Really helps sooth my skin and helps stop itching! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product works exceptionally well on dry patches of skin with visible results in about a week and no allergic or negative reactions at all. It&#x27;s not particularly oily and soaks in well, leaving the skin feeling moisturized and invigorated. After trying a number of different lotions and potions to eliminate these dried patches, this was the only one that was 100% effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence with the Vitae Soothing Relief spray, I appreciate that the ingredient list is short and is natural, but this is kind of a hard product to use. It would be easier if it was a roller-ball applicator instead of a spray. Too much comes out at once with the spray and it&#x27;s full of oil so it&#x27;s very greasy. It does, however, take the itch away shortly after application. I used it on mosquito bites and my spouse used it on a poison oak rash. It soothed the skin. My daughter used it on her itchy summer eczema and complained that it burned. She refuses to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this, it&#x27;s very strong and woodsy. It might double as an insect repellant, it smells that bad.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t fell there is a signefecant  relief of my itchy scalp, beside it is so expensive</li>
            <li> Light mist helps comfort pretty quickly</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel comfortable no itch or dryness will continue to use and give a more in depth review as I use it more</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has bad eczema from time to time and this has helped him find relief when it starts acting up. He sprays it on his arms and rubs it in when he gets itchy. I do advise anyone who will be using this to not use it on broken skin! He got a little of this product on an area he scratched and it started stinging. Other than that little issue, he says this product has helped him out a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> (Disclaimer - My wife and I were invited by the seller to try and review their products. I only agree to these requests when it&#x27;s something we would actually use, and in this case, we picked some products to try and review. The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free. Also, for this type of invited review, I always begin with a disclaimer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spraying action works well and does not drip, and the spray goes on the skin without stickiness, getting absorbed by the skin soon, so you can spray and then immediately return to whatever you were doing before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray has a pleasant herbal fragrance that&#x27;s soothing and calming, and it also has a tingling/cooling effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray itself when used to provide general soothing and moisturizing to the skin, it works really well. My wife had some minor skin irritation and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for it, but she does not have Psoriasis-Eczema (and neither do I), so we don&#x27;t know if it is effective for that specific purpose. And if you&#x27;re wondering why we agreed to try/review this product if we don&#x27;t have Psoriasis-Eczema, it&#x27;s because when my wife look at the list products we were invited to try/review, she mistakenly thought this product was for general skin irritation/rashes (her English is very limited and she used an online translator, which gave an incorrect translation of &amp;#34;Psoriasis-Eczema&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Got an itch? This is the spray to stop that itching. It isn&#x27;t just for those ailments - the heartbreak of psoriasis, eczema, and dermatitis - it works on just about any itch, mosquito bites and places where skin has dried out, like the back of knees or elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray smells good but strong - lavender and basil as the strongest smells. It is very similar to Vi-Tae&#x27;s Make it Better spray. Soothing Relief is a little more gentle than Make it Better. Once applied the smell does not linger for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on mosquito bites and it is incredible - no itching at all. The mosquito bite essentially goes away. I get an occasional rash from spending too much time in the bath, this works so well on the back of my legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about Vi-Tae products (I&#x27;ve used a lot of them); the liquids are all in identical bottles with the same color label. You have to read the name carefully when you choose the bottle. I hate it when I have an itch and I spray the deodorant on the itch - at least it doesn&#x27;t sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00IWH6MH8 First Aid Spray, All Natural - &amp;#34;Make It Better!&amp;#34;]]</li>
            <li> Very nice spray for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little greasy at first, but it soaks in soon enough if you rub at it for a while. I used it for dry skin on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is rather unique, strong, woodsy, reminiscent of insect spray, but I like of like it. Also, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger once it&#x27;s rubbed in. I didn&#x27;t go into contortions to see if I could smell it on my legs, but the fact that I pretty much forgot I had it one is a decent sign that the scent wasn&#x27;t a bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I thankfully don&#x27;t have poison anything right now, I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s ability to take itch away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it several times and it hardly looks like I used it at all, so I&#x27;m betting it will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Nice product.</li>
            <li> I have patches of psoriasis that flare up on my elbows, which I treat with a prescription steroid cream when necessary. Since you can&#x27;t use steroid creams constantly, I also have another medicated lotion for daily, frequent use to keep my elbows from getting overly dry. When I was offered a free sample of this spray, I hoped it would be an organic option for daily relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the spray-oil formulation and scent are two things that I really do not like about this product. Even a single pump distributes a lot of dripping oil to rub in. The scent is too herbal for my tastes---it smells woodsy and enough like food that it causes my dogs to follow me around sniffing for at least a half-hour after spraying it. This is not a convenient product to simply grab and use, as you need to immediately wash your hands with soap in order to remove the oily residue, and the scent is pretty strong for about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as effectiveness, I found that it does soothe itchy skin. In addition to my psoriasis patches, I used this on insect bites and some sunburned skin. In all those cases there was an immediate benefit to using it. It didn&#x27;t have any long-lasting effect, however, and didn&#x27;t seem to offer any healing benefit to keep my psoriasis in check.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product.  It relieved my itchy skin the first time I tried it.  I&#x27;m using it daily and my skin feels soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate me anymore.  The only downfall is I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.  But it works!</li>
            <li> My 14yr old daughter has suffered from severe eczema her entire life and we have been through a whole mess of products.  I got this spray for her in the hopes that it would offer relief for the constant itching.  She has very sensitive skin and is very picky about her skin products so I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would go over.  She really likes it!!!  It has a pleasant smell, it is not thick and greasy and honestly helps with the itching. Thanks for making such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I was  given a free copy of this product to test and review and I am extremely glad that I tried this product.  I used this product on my daughter who often gets a rash between her breast due to size.  We have tried everything from powders to vaseline in trying to keep that area moisturized.  I want you to know the results and soothing relief that she receives from this product are terrific.  It only requires a smallsquirt of this treatment and boom no more rash.  My daughter is completely in love, there is no dryness or itching.  In fact the entire area has completely healed after a couple of weeks of usage.  Although this product is known for Psoriasis and Eczema I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who receives chaffing in the area that I have specified.  This is even better then prescriptions that she was given.  I would have rated it a five but I will admit it is very greasy and she really has to rub it real good so that it will not mess up her clothes.  But its well worth the extra minutes of rubbing it in.  We Love It.!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a couple patches of what I suspect to be eczema. I&#x27;ve tried many products and this one seems to work the fastest. My patches are softening and shrinking. I&#x27;m so happy to have a product that works.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it made my skin really soft. At first thought was going to be oily but far from it it also cut down on the urge to of my itching. Very much would recommend  for usage.</li>
            <li> I got this for my young daughter who struggles with itchy rough skin caused by eczema. I got this product in exchange for an honest review so I figured why not try it. It burned her skin a little the first time we used it because her skin was a bit inflamed but after that it really helped relieve the itching. After a week straight of using it after bath time her skin was so much better and she&#x27;s sonhappy not to deal with the itching. It drove her nuts. All in all its a good product and it being a spray bottle is pretty convenient:)</li>
            <li> I was given a free sample of this product to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the same criteria for products given to me as I do for products that I have purchased, does it work, do I like it, is is good, or is it bad, and I will not give a free product a higher rating just because it was free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually surprised that this worked, I was very doubtful when I tried it, but I suffer from some pretty bad eczema, especially on my legs and I am not supposed to use my medicated ointment every day.  So on a day when my legs were breaking out and itching unbearably, but I wasn&#x27;t supposed to use my medicine, I went ahead and tried this spray, I will tell you straight up that it is messy, it squirts out instead of coming out like a mist, and it will run, but learning how to spray it on wasn&#x27;t too difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 15 to 20 minutes after I used the spray, the itching on my legs had almost stopped, I was amazed that this herbal spray could actually help almost as well as the medicine I get from my doctor, because I didn&#x27;t really believe it would help at all, but it did help and it is probably worth a try if you have eczema, especially on your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Helped my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very stubborn psoriasis and even though I&#x27;ve used this for only a few days, so far, it really seems to be helping. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried everything else I could get my hands on (some actually make things worse) but this might be the best yet. As others have said, it has a slight odor - to me it smells like tea, but it&#x27;s not offensive at all. The spray/mist application is especially convenient. Flaking has already reduced markedly and I&#x27;m using a moisturizer in conjunction to fight dryness. A second order is on my calendar already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/14/2014:&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered from psoriasis since the 70&#x27;s from exposure to Agent Orange. I have NEVER found anything that helped much until now. Light therapy has worked some but not that well and is very uncomfortable and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;In summer I would usually see some lessening of symptoms but not this year - until I found this product 6 weeks ago. Rarely do I say &#x27;miracle&#x27; but I will now. All you sufferers - don&#x27;t give up in despair - try it! My arms and backs of my hands are now 99.9% clear and my knees (where it&#x27;s been the worst) are 65% clear.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that what works for one may not work for another due to the nature of psoriasis, but I was getting very discouraged when I stumbled across this and was so relieved when it started working - especially so quickly. I still can&#x27;t believe how fast the flaking stopped and the horrible redness began to disappear. I only use it once in the morning and once in the evening now and that seems to keep things under control. I would recommend fairly liberal use for the first week to ten days. If it&#x27;s going to work you&#x27;ll know by then. Honestly, I saw results in the first three or four days - especially my arms and hands. I never thought I&#x27;d be able to write what I have here, but Vi-Tae (Soothing Relief Spray) has given me a new lease on life. There is no staining of clothing and it soaks in to the skin pretty quickly (I gently rub it in).</li>
            <li> Works for awhile but not a permanent fix.</li>
            <li> Dried the skin instead of nourishing it.</li>
            <li> Great psoriasis/eczema treatment mist! Pretty much everyone in my household suffers from eczema and dry skin. So I am always looking for good, natural remedies to soothe the symptoms. I&#x27;ve tried several products from Vi-tae and have really liked every one, so I had high hopes that this one would be great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a nice 4.46 fl oz bottle with a sprayer top. It has a bit of a strange smell. I&#x27;m not entirely certain that I would want to smell like this all the time, so I&#x27;m a bit concerned about that. I wish they had added a nice lavender scent, or even made it unscented..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is immediately soothing when I spray it on. I mean..IMMEDIATELY. The itch and irritation just vanishes! I only need to apply it about twice a day, so that&#x27;s not bad at all. I really like how effective it is, but the smell really needs significant improvement. If that changed, this would be the best product for eczema i&#x27;ve ever tried. (I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> The Psoriasis Eczema Treatment was delivered protectively packaged and in excellent condition as described on product page.  We purchased this treatment spray in a promotion for testing and review.  I have eczema in a few small areas on my hands, and have been using the spray on those areas several times daily.  The spray certainly reduces the itching right away.</li>
            <li> When I have an exceptionally bad flare-up, this is the only product that will ease the discomfort and not make it worse.</li>
            <li> Hello!!! I have the worst dry skin ever and its sensitive on top of that.  So it doesn&#x27;t matter what I use I usually break out.  But I have finally found this.  So far so awesome!!  My skin is not dry and it is not broke out either.  I AM SO THRILLED!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I try never to jinx myself so I waited and now I know this is for me!  THANK YOU&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Works great on the kids eczema. Already ordered another one for a backup.</li>
            <li> This is a true story. I am not being reimbursed in any way to write this review, other than receiving a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know how I could test this product, but just recently, my wife suddenly had a terrible case of itchy skin, apparently eczema, from which she suffers. She remembered that we had this product nearby, and she sprayed it on her hand. Immediately, the terrible itching stopped, and did not return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not in any way an exaggeration. If the product had not worked, I would have stated so. Okay, I am a believer.</li>
            <li> It was sealed properly when it came. I tried it right away to see what it does on my skin. I did not get any allergic reaction at all. I have an eczema on my knee and it really itchy and really uncomfortable when it&#x27;s dry. I tried this product to see if it will help me. It indeed help ease the itchy-ness. What a relief. Thank you Vi-Tae. I also like the soothing smell. It&#x27;s not stinky or not bothered me at all. It helps for a little while since it absorbs quickly, but it also dry quickly. It last for a few hours. I had to spray it again so that my skin will remain hydrated. I like it so far so I am giving a four star. I am only using it for a few days now, but I sure will keep it in my purse. It&#x27;s a life saver for a people like me who has eczema and itch a lot. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** This product was received either at no cost or low cost for a review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based only on mine or my families experience with the product. I never guarantee a positive review. ***</li>
            <li> I suffer from routine bouts of psoriasis so when I was offered a review sample of this spray I quickly accepted. I&#x27;ve only had this for two days and it has made a genuine difference, especially on the back of my neck and earlobes where my attacks seem to be concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the apparent effectiveness, this spray actually smells good. Well, it smells okay is a more honest description. The basil oil dominates the fragrance, with a very tiny hint of lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the two days that I have been using this I&#x27;ve applied it a total of four times. If you follow the recommendation on the label you can use it up to four times per day. Even at that rate I am estimating that this is at least a six week supply, but could be up to three months. Time will tell on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Clobex to treat my outbreaks, but used this spray exclusively since I&#x27;ve had it. I am going to probably use this for the lesser outbreaks and the Clobex for the more serious ones that seem to plague me when I am really stressed. But the great thing - thus far - is this spray actually works and does so organically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do give this a try it&#x27;s most effective when you rub in the spray. The fragrance of the spray itself is a little on the strong side when you first apply it, but it dissipates in a few hours. It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but is noticeable.</li>
            <li> My husband has psoriasis which at times is extensive so I was interested if this would help especially since it&#x27;s all natural and the cream he uses contains steroids which thin the skin and affect his blood sugar levels. The only complaint he had with this spray is the odor, which he did not like and felt was too powerful. But this may be due to the fact that he had an extensive breakout when he used it so sprayed quite a large area. Otherwise he found it to be a great product for psoriasis treatment. I do hope the manufacturer can provide an odor-free product as this is so much better to use than medication that affects your body.</li>
            <li> As a person with Psoriasis, I have a few areas that are typically inflamed.  The bottle recommends that you use this product 1 to 4 times daily.  I used the product 1 time a day for 2 weeks (so far).  This product helped with the dryness of the psoriasis patches and some of the spots, within the patches, have cleared up all together.  I will be continuing the use of the product and see if I can&#x27;t get all of the spots to disappear.  Thanks for creating a natural remedy to help sufferers of Psoriasis.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product for dry itchy skin, I get really dry skin during the winter and I&#x27;ve found most lotions don&#x27;t help. This is really good and not oily.</li>
            <li> Not effective at all in my case, actualy made it worse. Spray cap on the buttle doesn&#x27;t  work either.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great... I have tried several others .. this one works..!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a week now and I have not noticed any real difference in the relief by its claims.  I have a small patch on the side of my leg about the size of a quarter that gets very itchy.  I have tried the Psoriasis-Eczema Treatment and it did provide the moisture that I needed and the smell is not that bad.  The one thing that I particularly did not like was how the oils just sat on my skin and took a long time to absorb.  Some of you may like it, and some of you may not, I am not saying that the product is not good because it did provide the moisture, I just did not like some of the features. I would recommend that you try it as it may be the best product for your condition.</li>
