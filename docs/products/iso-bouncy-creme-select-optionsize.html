            <li>It is awesome for curly and permed hair.</li>
            <li>This makes it perfect for me to use in winter as well as summer (I use -cone products in summer to help with humidity issues and use non-cone products in winter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This is a great product.  </li>

            <li>Smells great on others which is why i purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I love the bouncy creme!!  </li>
            <li>It helps to take away the frizz and makes my curls set very nicely.  </li>
            <li>It does smell amazing though!</li>
            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>I always loved Bouncy Cream.</li>
            <li>This had really good reviews on this stuff</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good transaction all around.</li>
            <li>It makes the growing out process much more graceful and attractive.</li>
            <li>so I went to my VERY favorite online store - Amazon.  </li>
            <li>After I wash and condition my chemical free hair with Pantene women of color hair products, I follow up with ISO Bouncy creme and it makes my hair look really good!</li>
            <li>I had read about this product so many times and could not wait for it to arrive!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I really love this!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and I liked it</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>, that was kind of embarrassing.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Great product for a great price!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves you hair soft and curly...</li>
            <li>The first time I used this stuff, my hair looked great.</li>
            <li>This had so many good reviews that I was really excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Plus was quick ship and good price.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE ISO bouncycreme.</li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>God I wanted to love this...</li>
            <li>Most non sticky, non \\&quot;hardening\\&quot; hair gels for men have been taken off the market.</li>
            <li>I guess there are no miracle products out there for aging :).</li>
            <li>I used this upon recommendation and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>No holding power, more like a leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then again, I don&#x27;t like most scented items.</li>
            <li>I diffuse and use a curling iron to get some more wave in my hair and after using this my hair seemed just as frizzy as it would be without using it.</li>
            <li>It does not make my waves more separated, and does not add more shine as claimed.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Tried ONCE more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Eliminates frizz, and effects of south TX humidity :)</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything great for my hair which is wavy but not thick.  </li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time for how it defines my otherwise naturally kinky hair giving me beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>At first I loved it.</li>
            <li>Makes hair nice an full.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely smell, is easy to use, and never makes hair crunchy or greasy.   </li>
            <li>I have really fine hair and the foams work better for me.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, gives control with no stick or hardening, looks and feels natural and controls hair all day.</li>
            <li>and i received it super fast and for a great price.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>but it is pleasant and not too strong (and I am one who is sensitive to them).  </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair, so maybe this is for people with thicker hair.</li>
            <li>product is fine and works as advertised.</li>
            <li>It smells awesome and feels very soft, but it is too soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light yet holds my fine curly hair,  non sticky nor crunchy.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a light product</li>
            <li>It turns my light waves into ringlets, without leaving any stickiness.  </li>
            <li>I have used Bouncy Creme for several years now and have had great results.</li>
            <li>This product keeps the curls smooth and &amp;#34;organized&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is light</li>
            <li>Is soft and smells good.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh, clean scent, too.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it was exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li>I was excited to use it again.</li>
            <li>If your hair is like mine, look for one of those sites first and be sure this (or any product) fits for you before you buy it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sound like a commercial but it is good stuff.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after seeing many positive reviews...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that gives my curls the natural support they need, but not that crunchy feel like most products!</li>
            <li>It smelled okay, but it really did NOTHING.</li>
            <li>May be good for someone with a different type of curl.</li>
            <li>Also there is no plastic or crunchy feeling; it leaves my hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the cheapest, most effective way I&#x27;ve found to tame my hair :).</li>
            <li>was delivered in great shape well before the expected date!</li>
            <li>It really makes you hatr nice and soft and shiny and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a nice product that is reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes but there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy and this made it keep the curl better but also stay soft!</li>
            <li>Works really well on fine hair with lots if body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a firm believer that a product works best after a good cut, but even 6 weeks after my last cut, Bouncy Creme helps the curls look like actual curls instead of straggly straw.</li>
            <li>But this one is kind of sticky, it even leaves a gross residue afterwards.</li>
            <li>It works great and makes my hair so soft when I flat iron it.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida where it&#x27;s always super humid, leaving me looking like a poodle if I don&#x27;t have the right product in my hair!</li>
            <li>and I only use about two pumps, any more than that</li>
            <li>This works fabulous in my naturally wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I did give them an extra star for using the biodegradable packing peanuts :)</li>
            <li>No one wants their hair to smell like that!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always risky buying hair products w/o trying them first-</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the same one that I used to purchase, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I have used pretty much every product under the sun and have never found a product that can define my curls and eliminate frizz without making it too crunchy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked this product because it holds my hair well and does weigh it down.</li>
            <li>It made mine kind of stringy and weighed down-</li>
            <li>If I use it by itself, my curls look a bit limp, but it makes my hair much better defined and less poofy if I use it with another product (I&#x27;ve had good luck with TIGI Catwalk Curls Rock Amplifier).  </li>
            <li>for the scent, too much for me.  </li>
            <li>It defined my wavy curls in a way nothing to date really has.</li>
            <li>I tried to lessen the amount I put in but that didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>It really helped loosen the tangles.</li>
            <li>Did not do much for my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I found some websites (for naturally curly girls) that help analyze hair types and helped me find my right products.</li>
            <li>I think this is a product better suited to super thick really curly hair.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more definition and less frizz but didn&#x27;t really get either.</li>
            <li>This also didn&#x27;t stand up to humidity particularly well.</li>
            <li>It does not boost my curl, instead it leaves my hair kind of flat and my curls loose.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I need a cream with a little more weight for my 3b porous hair.</li>
            <li>I use this in combo with my hair gel and never have frizz and my hair is easy to comb through when wet!</li>
            <li>I always use this product in conjunction with another cream or gel designed for curly hair, because it reduces frizz and makes hair soft and shiny, but does not have much hold.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, great product, careless and inconsiderate seller.</li>
            <li>I love this creme for my long, wavy coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair that tends to be too dry and frizzy on the ends and read great reviews and suggestions for use for this product as well as the defining/ texturizing creme ( which I also bought to use on my ends).</li>
            <li>The bottle is also different then the one pictured, so maybe I didn&#x27;t even get the right product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t love it for the texture it provided (as in, not much of a noticeable difference in my wavy/curly hair at all on its own without at least 2 other products supporting it).  </li>
            <li>When the stores around where I live discontinued selling it</li>
            <li>The price is great, however unfortunately it did not tame my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It also smells heavily floral and the smell sticks around for a while, so you have to enjoy that scent as well (which I really don&#x27;t.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Bouncy products for years,  they don&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It feels very natural, and helps hold shape.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve bought cream, liquids and aerosol hair products online for years and have never before received anything that did not have the cap/top taped in place, and in most all cases cream/liquid products are sealed in a plastic bag and usually shipped in a box.  </li>
            <li>it helps support my curls and most importantly it is not sticky or crunchy at all!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, fine hair and lots of products tend to weigh it down or make it frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my soft curls defined, but not stiff or crunchy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly kinky hair and have spent my whole life looking for a miracle.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, wavy longer hair.</li>
            <li>I even use it in my twenty three month old grandaughter&#x27;s hair at bath time when she is visiting, and her hair goes into corkscrew curls that hold and hold.</li>
            <li>I had to finally use a clarifying shampoo because the product built up so much.</li>
            <li>Once I washed it out with regular clarifying shampoo, I tried again, because I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft &amp; silky feeling.</li>
            <li>used it once and ended giving it away to my 6 years old</li>
            <li>Keep it away from your roots, don&#x27;t overapply, and you should get a natural looking and feeling (ie., not sticky or crunchy)</li>
            <li>I used both this morning and my hair is soft and wavy and, yes, bouncy.</li>
            <li>They made no effort to protect the bottle with additional packing material nor did they secure the cap; it was either placed in the envelope with the screw-on cap already loose, or it became loose (no surprise since it was not secured) being thrown around during transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>I have tried it several different ways, on wetter hair, just damp hair and on drier hair and all I get is hair with no shine, very straw</li>
            <li>If seller didn&#x27;t want to spring for a box,  it was necessary to at least seal seal the top and add filler packing in the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It used to be a slick, nice cream that didn&#x27;t weigh down your curls.</li>
            <li>My curls are very curly at the roots and stick straight at the ends after using the product, and once it dries my hair is a frizzy mess!</li>
            <li>seller placed this item AS IS in one of those tiny bubble-lined 8 x 10 paper envelope mailers and less than two-thirds of the product arrived actually IN the bottle, because more than one third was coating the inside of the envelope and outside of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The packaging has changed since I last purchased it, but the dispensing pump is a plus compared to the old flip-top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent my life looking for a product that would leave my hair defined, but not hard.</li>

            <li> This product keeps the curls smooth and &amp;#34;organized&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is light</li>
            <li> Is soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh, clean scent, too.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it was exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li> I was excited to use it again.</li>
            <li> If your hair is like mine, look for one of those sites first and be sure this (or any product) fits for you before you buy it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sound like a commercial but it is good stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing many positive reviews...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that gives my curls the natural support they need, but not that crunchy feel like most products!</li>
            <li> It smelled okay, but it really did NOTHING.</li>
            <li> May be good for someone with a different type of curl.</li>
            <li> Also there is no plastic or crunchy feeling; it leaves my hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the cheapest, most effective way I&#x27;ve found to tame my hair :).</li>
            <li> was delivered in great shape well before the expected date!</li>
            <li> It really makes you hatr nice and soft and shiny and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a nice product that is reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes but there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and this made it keep the curl better but also stay soft!</li>
            <li> Works really well on fine hair with lots if body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer that a product works best after a good cut, but even 6 weeks after my last cut, Bouncy Creme helps the curls look like actual curls instead of straggly straw.</li>
            <li> But this one is kind of sticky, it even leaves a gross residue afterwards.</li>
            <li> It works great and makes my hair so soft when I flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida where it&#x27;s always super humid, leaving me looking like a poodle if I don&#x27;t have the right product in my hair!</li>
            <li> and I only use about two pumps, any more than that</li>
            <li> This works fabulous in my naturally wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I did give them an extra star for using the biodegradable packing peanuts :)</li>
            <li> No one wants their hair to smell like that!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always risky buying hair products w/o trying them first-</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the same one that I used to purchase, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I have used pretty much every product under the sun and have never found a product that can define my curls and eliminate frizz without making it too crunchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this product because it holds my hair well and does weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It made mine kind of stringy and weighed down-</li>
            <li> If I use it by itself, my curls look a bit limp, but it makes my hair much better defined and less poofy if I use it with another product (I&#x27;ve had good luck with TIGI Catwalk Curls Rock Amplifier).  </li>
            <li> for the scent, too much for me.  </li>
            <li> It defined my wavy curls in a way nothing to date really has.</li>
            <li> I tried to lessen the amount I put in but that didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> It really helped loosen the tangles.</li>
            <li> Did not do much for my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I found some websites (for naturally curly girls) that help analyze hair types and helped me find my right products.</li>
            <li> I think this is a product better suited to super thick really curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more definition and less frizz but didn&#x27;t really get either.</li>
            <li> This also didn&#x27;t stand up to humidity particularly well.</li>
            <li> It does not boost my curl, instead it leaves my hair kind of flat and my curls loose.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I need a cream with a little more weight for my 3b porous hair.</li>
            <li> I use this in combo with my hair gel and never have frizz and my hair is easy to comb through when wet!</li>
            <li> I always use this product in conjunction with another cream or gel designed for curly hair, because it reduces frizz and makes hair soft and shiny, but does not have much hold.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, great product, careless and inconsiderate seller.</li>
            <li> I love this creme for my long, wavy coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that tends to be too dry and frizzy on the ends and read great reviews and suggestions for use for this product as well as the defining/ texturizing creme ( which I also bought to use on my ends).</li>
            <li> The bottle is also different then the one pictured, so maybe I didn&#x27;t even get the right product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love it for the texture it provided (as in, not much of a noticeable difference in my wavy/curly hair at all on its own without at least 2 other products supporting it).  </li>
            <li> When the stores around where I live discontinued selling it</li>
            <li> The price is great, however unfortunately it did not tame my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It also smells heavily floral and the smell sticks around for a while, so you have to enjoy that scent as well (which I really don&#x27;t.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Bouncy products for years,  they don&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It feels very natural, and helps hold shape.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought cream, liquids and aerosol hair products online for years and have never before received anything that did not have the cap/top taped in place, and in most all cases cream/liquid products are sealed in a plastic bag and usually shipped in a box.  </li>
            <li> it helps support my curls and most importantly it is not sticky or crunchy at all!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, fine hair and lots of products tend to weigh it down or make it frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my soft curls defined, but not stiff or crunchy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly kinky hair and have spent my whole life looking for a miracle.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, wavy longer hair.</li>
            <li> I even use it in my twenty three month old grandaughter&#x27;s hair at bath time when she is visiting, and her hair goes into corkscrew curls that hold and hold.</li>
            <li> I had to finally use a clarifying shampoo because the product built up so much.</li>
            <li> Once I washed it out with regular clarifying shampoo, I tried again, because I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft &amp; silky feeling.</li>
            <li> used it once and ended giving it away to my 6 years old</li>
            <li> Keep it away from your roots, don&#x27;t overapply, and you should get a natural looking and feeling (ie., not sticky or crunchy)</li>
            <li> I used both this morning and my hair is soft and wavy and, yes, bouncy.</li>
            <li> They made no effort to protect the bottle with additional packing material nor did they secure the cap; it was either placed in the envelope with the screw-on cap already loose, or it became loose (no surprise since it was not secured) being thrown around during transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> I have tried it several different ways, on wetter hair, just damp hair and on drier hair and all I get is hair with no shine, very straw</li>
            <li> If seller didn&#x27;t want to spring for a box,  it was necessary to at least seal seal the top and add filler packing in the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It used to be a slick, nice cream that didn&#x27;t weigh down your curls.</li>
            <li> My curls are very curly at the roots and stick straight at the ends after using the product, and once it dries my hair is a frizzy mess!</li>
            <li> seller placed this item AS IS in one of those tiny bubble-lined 8 x 10 paper envelope mailers and less than two-thirds of the product arrived actually IN the bottle, because more than one third was coating the inside of the envelope and outside of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The packaging has changed since I last purchased it, but the dispensing pump is a plus compared to the old flip-top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent my life looking for a product that would leave my hair defined, but not hard.</li>
            <li> This really keeps my hair in place without making it stiff or oily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, it tames my frizzies when it gets humid, &amp; it makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> The only other product that I have found at the grocery store that is similar to this is Biotera Curl</li>
            <li> Been using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick, naturally curly hair, gets frizzy easily especially in the slightest humid or windy conditions.</li>
            <li> cream to add to wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> And the scent, well....it reminded me of the &#x27;setting lotion&#x27; my grandmother used with her little pink plastic curlers: kind of unpleasant &amp; chemically.</li>
            <li> Im a 3c with very thin hair and this product weighed my hair down and left it super sticky and greasy even with the cowashes.....</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little granddaughter who has the curliest, finest hair that tangles constantly.</li>
            <li> but it did nothing for my hair at all total waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> With this I apply it to wet hair scrunch it &amp; sometimes use a diffuser.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, but needs a solid product to get curl to amp up my naturally thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Lasts for a long time because you just use a minimal amount in your palm!!</li>
            <li> Usually stuff for curly hair is too heavy for my naturally wavy hair, but this product is the exception.  </li>
            <li> I used a little less, and again, the same result.</li>
            <li> But keep in mind that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It helps a LITTLE with taming frizzies, but not a huge amount.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy again though.</li>
            <li> The only product to come along that helps retain (and tame!)</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, but thin, hair.</li>
            <li> and it will start to weigh down your curls.  </li>
            <li> so doesn&#x27;t weigh down the waves.  </li>
            <li> My previous hairdresser loves this item, told me to buy it, and it worked for her.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, the negative reviews regarding smell were right on.</li>
            <li> Firm curls without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my curls down and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes add a little baby oil after I put the bouncy creme in to help define my curls -</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have quite that effect on my fine,thinning hair,but it helps it a little.</li>
            <li> Just scrunch in a little and</li>
            <li> White consistency and very thick.</li>
            <li> This stuff did not do wonders for my limp, frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> Poor Packaging of Shipment - Lost 1/3 of the bootle due to loose cap on the bottle that acually fell off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was expecting stiff crunchy hair.</li>
            <li> I have such bad luck with hair products, though, so I&#x27;m not really surprised.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have to put any harsh chemicals in my hair or go to a salon to achieve this style!</li>
            <li> I usually wash then put in anti freeze  </li>
            <li> Did not leave my curl defined, was very heavy.</li>
            <li> The 8.5 oz bottle lasts me at least three months.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product, I has an unpleasant smell and didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> However, even if this stuff worked miracles, it might not be worth using for the awful smell!</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time finding it</li>
            <li> The base is water and propylene glycol.  </li>
            <li> This has a horrible chemical smell.</li>
            <li> It also smells TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst product out there for curls that I&#x27;ve tried, but my hair must just be helpless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love it for the texture it provided (as in, not much of a noticeable difference in my wavy/curly hair at all on its own without at least 2 other products supporting it).  It also smells heavily floral and the smell sticks around for a while, so you have to enjoy that scent as well (which I really don&#x27;t.)</li>
            <li> The price is great, however unfortunately it did not tame my curly hair.  My hair is naturally curly, but needs a solid product to get curl to amp up my naturally thin hair.  This product helped a bit, but left it a bit frizzy and not as curly has alternative products.  Is soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> The best product on the market  I would never use anything else It really makes you hatr nice and soft and shiny and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it was exactly what i was looking for and i received it super fast and for a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Bouncy products for years,  they don&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down and when I curl it , the curl actually holds!!  Lasts for a long time because you just use a minimal amount in your palm!! Good price too.</li>
            <li> Works great- smells delicious</li>
            <li> Great product-smoothes, adds volume &amp; bounce &amp; revives style even a couple of days after a visit to the salon.  Just rub a small amount of product thru-out the hair, style again, and you&#x27;re ready for a day out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent my life looking for a product that would leave my hair defined, but not hard. I absolutely LOVE ISO bouncycreme. I bought it from my hairdresser about 6-7 months ago. Sometimes I find a product I like okay, but after a while it doesn&#x27;t work as well - not this one though! It still leaves my hair looking great. I also get asked all the time what product I use in my hair. I live in Florida where it&#x27;s always super humid, leaving me looking like a poodle if I don&#x27;t have the right product in my hair! I sometimes add a little baby oil after I put the bouncy creme in to help define my curls - it&#x27;s the cheapest, most effective way I&#x27;ve found to tame my hair :).</li>
            <li> I always loved Bouncy Cream. For years I couldn&#x27;t find it, so when I found it on Amazon  I was excited to use it again. This has a horrible chemical smell. I continued to use it for a couple days and just couldn&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
            <li> I always use this product in conjunction with another cream or gel designed for curly hair, because it reduces frizz and makes hair soft and shiny, but does not have much hold.  If I use it by itself, my curls look a bit limp, but it makes my hair much better defined and less poofy if I use it with another product (I&#x27;ve had good luck with TIGI Catwalk Curls Rock Amplifier).  It has a lovely smell, is easy to use, and never makes hair crunchy or greasy.   Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This had really good reviews on this stuff but it did nothing for my hair at all total waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I had read about this product so many times and could not wait for it to arrive! I have thick curly hair that tends to be too dry and frizzy on the ends and read great reviews and suggestions for use for this product as well as the defining/ texturizing creme ( which I also bought to use on my ends). I have tried it several different ways, on wetter hair, just damp hair and on drier hair and all I get is hair with no shine, very straw like and a bit tacky/ sticky. God I wanted to love this...</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, wavy longer hair. Most non sticky, non \\&quot;hardening\\&quot; hair gels for men have been taken off the market. This stuff is great, gives control with no stick or hardening, looks and feels natural and controls hair all day. I sound like a commercial but it is good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have very curly kinky hair and have spent my whole life looking for a miracle. I have used pretty much every product under the sun and have never found a product that can define my curls and eliminate frizz without making it too crunchy. This product is no exception. It smells awesome and feels very soft, but it is too soft. The directions on the back said it will define curls while eliminating frizz. It does neither. My curls are very curly at the roots and stick straight at the ends after using the product, and once it dries my hair is a frizzy mess! I was using Catwalk Curls Rock before this and I liked it but thought maybe it was time for a change, now I think it is time to change back. The only thing that I like about this product is the smell and that my hair isnt crunchy after.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, but thin, hair. The only product to come along that helps retain (and tame!) the curls without leaving my hair a goopy, sticky tangle has been ISO&#x27;s Bouncy Creme. My stylist used it (and I bought it from her) for two years, but last year she stopped carrying the product line. I am so happy to find it again via Amazon.com. The packaging has changed since I last purchased it, but the dispensing pump is a plus compared to the old flip-top. I&#x27;m a firm believer that a product works best after a good cut, but even 6 weeks after my last cut, Bouncy Creme helps the curls look like actual curls instead of straggly straw.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time. I&#x27;ve always liked this product because it holds my hair well and does weigh it down. Mustn&#x27;t be applied too liberally because it tends to harden up a bit. But it&#x27;s a light product and I&#x27;ve ordered it twice already. Lasts for ever!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I even use it in my twenty three month old grandaughter&#x27;s hair at bath time when she is visiting, and her hair goes into corkscrew curls that hold and hold. It doesn&#x27;t have quite that effect on my fine,thinning hair,but it helps it a little. I guess there are no miracle products out there for aging :).</li>
            <li> Excellent service and good quality merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;Item was delivered in great shape well before the expected date!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product, I has an unpleasant smell and didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. I was hoping for more definition and less frizz but didn&#x27;t really get either.</li>
            <li> I used this upon recommendation and I love it.  It does not weigh my curls down and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or stiff.  But keep in mind that a little goes a long way.  I have shoulder length curls and I only use about two pumps, any more than that and it will start to weigh down your curls.  For me, this is a must have.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing many positive reviews...unfortunately, the negative reviews regarding smell were right on. It smelled like permanent solution and did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a African-American woman who loves this product though its probably not intended for me. After I wash and condition my chemical free hair with Pantene women of color hair products, I follow up with ISO Bouncy creme and it makes my hair look really good! I get compliments all the time for how it defines my otherwise naturally kinky hair giving me beautiful curls. And I don&#x27;t have to put any harsh chemicals in my hair or go to a salon to achieve this style!</li>
            <li> The store where I used to buy Bouncy Cream around here discontinued selling the item about a year ago. I have not been able to find it anywhere. I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon. It works great and makes my hair so soft when I flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years, but it disappeared from store shelves.  It feels very natural, and helps hold shape.</li>
            <li> I think someone with only &amp;#34;kind of&amp;#34; frizzy hair could benefit from this product but it did not work for me and 2C/3B curls. Not enough hold or frizz control. It does smell amazing though!</li>
            <li> As a curling creme I give it a &amp;#34;Meh.&amp;#34;  No holding power, more like a leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, too much for me.  Then again, I don&#x27;t like most scented items.</li>
            <li> I have type 2B (wavy) hair, and bought this hoping to get some frizz control. I diffuse and use a curling iron to get some more wave in my hair and after using this my hair seemed just as frizzy as it would be without using it. It does not make my waves more separated, and does not add more shine as claimed. I am pretty disappointed with this purchase, and will be keeping my eye out for better products.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have wavy hair &amp; it frizzes if I don&#x27;t put any product in it. With this I apply it to wet hair scrunch it &amp; sometimes use a diffuser. Defines &amp; evens out curl!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It turns my light waves into ringlets, without leaving any stickiness.  A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this creme for my long, wavy coarse hair.  Gives my hair incredible bounce, softness and takes out the frizz.</li>
            <li> This works fabulous in my naturally wavy/curly hair.  It helps to take away the frizz and makes my curls set very nicely.  Thanks for a nice product that is reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> Firm curls without weighing hair down. Works really well on fine hair with lots if body. Can&#x27;t wait for summer</li>
            <li> The first time I used this stuff, my hair looked great. It never worked again, so I guess that was a fluke. It does not boost my curl, instead it leaves my hair kind of flat and my curls loose. It also makes my hair dull-looking. I had high hopes but there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair and the foams work better for me. My friend loves this and her hair does well with it.</li>
            <li> This really keeps my hair in place without making it stiff or oily. I&#x27;ll definitely try it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I was expecting stiff crunchy hair. What I got was soft pliable manageable hair minus any frizz.  Easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.  I wish I had known about this stuff a year ago when I started growing out my pixie.  It makes the growing out process much more graceful and attractive.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Been using it for a long time.  Makes my hair feel manageable and shiny</li>
            <li> I use this in combo with my hair gel and never have frizz and my hair is easy to comb through when wet! I&#x27;ve been using this now for years.</li>
            <li> At first I loved it. It defined my wavy curls in a way nothing to date really has. But after using it for several weeks now, I&#x27;ve changed my mind. I had to finally use a clarifying shampoo because the product built up so much. My curly-girl method of using baking soda +water did nothing to remove it. Once I washed it out with regular clarifying shampoo, I tried again, because I really wanted this to work. I used a little less, and again, the same result. Tried ONCE more. Then, it simply looked dirty, liked it wasn&#x27;t even shampooed. Sigh.     Back to the drawing board. I think this is a product better suited to super thick really curly hair. Not wavy.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my hair. like NOTHING. I have 3C/4A hair. It smelled okay, but it really did NOTHING.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have naturally curly, fine hair and lots of products tend to weigh it down or make it frizzy.  I have used Bouncy Creme for several years now and have had great results. A little goes a long way.  The 8.5 oz bottle lasts me at least three months.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the pump tube is too short so you&#x27;re left with product at the bottom that you can&#x27;t get out using the pump.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Leaves my soft curls defined, but not stiff or crunchy feeling.  Eliminates frizz, and effects of south TX humidity :)</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves you hair soft and curly...though I wish it would last longer through out the day.</li>
            <li> This had so many good reviews that I was really excited to try it. My hair hates it, however! I have fine, wavy hair, so maybe this is for people with thicker hair. It made mine kind of stringy and weighed down- I tried to lessen the amount I put in but that didn&#x27;t do much. I have such bad luck with hair products, though, so I&#x27;m not really surprised. I did give them an extra star for using the biodegradable packing peanuts :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little granddaughter who has the curliest, finest hair that tangles constantly. It really helped loosen the tangles.</li>
            <li> Bouncy Creme is the only leave-in conditioner that I use in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, it tames my frizzies when it gets humid, &amp; it makes my hair feel so soft. When the stores around where I live discontinued selling it I was lost, but I&#x27;m happy to know that I can get it through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This product helps keep the bounce and wave in my hair the day after I take out French braids.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and this made it keep the curl better but also stay soft! I love it!</li>
            <li> Did not do much for my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I need a cream with a little more weight for my 3b porous hair. This also didn&#x27;t stand up to humidity particularly well. And the scent, well....it reminded me of the &#x27;setting lotion&#x27; my grandmother used with her little pink plastic curlers: kind of unpleasant &amp; chemically. I like the convenient pump bottle, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Poor Packaging of Shipment - Lost 1/3 of the bootle due to loose cap on the bottle that acually fell off.&lt;br /&gt;The product is fine and works as advertised. Makes hair nice an full. It gives the hair body.</li>
            <li> I love the bouncy creme!!  It&#x27;s light yet holds my fine curly hair,  non sticky nor crunchy.</li>
            <li> I really love this! It reminds me of BedHead&#x27;s After Party (smells different of course.)&lt;br /&gt;Nice cream to add to wet or dry hair. Makes my hair soft &amp; silky feeling. It helps a LITTLE with taming frizzies, but not a huge amount.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy again though.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly or wavy hair. This product keeps the curls smooth and &amp;#34;organized&amp;#34;. Love the fresh, clean scent, too.</li>
            <li> Left my curls sticky and greasy...and I didnt like the smell at all. Im a 3c with very thin hair and this product weighed my hair down and left it super sticky and greasy even with the cowashes.....&lt;br /&gt;I used it once and ended giving it away to my 6 years old niece.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue my journey testing different products...</li>
            <li> This stuff did not do wonders for my limp, frizzy curls. It also smells TERRIBLE. It&#x27;s not the worst product out there for curls that I&#x27;ve tried, but my hair must just be helpless. However, even if this stuff worked miracles, it might not be worth using for the awful smell! No one wants their hair to smell like that!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always risky buying hair products w/o trying them first- this product did not work for me. Did not leave my curl defined, was very heavy. White consistency and very thick. May be good for someone with a different type of curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that gives my curls the natural support they need, but not that crunchy feel like most products! This is it!!! I usually wash then put in anti freeze  product, then the ISO Bouncy Cream. Holds all day!! And since I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily, then next day it&#x27;s still wavy sometimes even curl, without all that product build up!! &amp;#60;3 will be buying again when I run out!!</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Makes my hair do wonders.</li>
            <li> My previous hairdresser loves this item, told me to buy it, and it worked for her. It just wasn&#x27;t for me. I have coarse, thick, naturally curly hair, gets frizzy easily especially in the slightest humid or windy conditions. It didn&#x27;t give me the hold and definition, or humidity protection. I found some websites (for naturally curly girls) that help analyze hair types and helped me find my right products. If your hair is like mine, look for one of those sites first and be sure this (or any product) fits for you before you buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Might work great for you, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years. Keep it away from your roots, don&#x27;t overapply, and you should get a natural looking and feeling (ie., not sticky or crunchy) result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller placed this item AS IS in one of those tiny bubble-lined 8 x 10 paper envelope mailers and less than two-thirds of the product arrived actually IN the bottle, because more than one third was coating the inside of the envelope and outside of the bottle. An incredible M-E-S-S. They made no effort to protect the bottle with additional packing material nor did they secure the cap; it was either placed in the envelope with the screw-on cap already loose, or it became loose (no surprise since it was not secured) being thrown around during transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought cream, liquids and aerosol hair products online for years and have never before received anything that did not have the cap/top taped in place, and in most all cases cream/liquid products are sealed in a plastic bag and usually shipped in a box.  If seller didn&#x27;t want to spring for a box,  it was necessary to at least seal seal the top and add filler packing in the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, great product, careless and inconsiderate seller.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I had a very hard time finding it so I went to my VERY favorite online store - Amazon.  Got it for a great price as always.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It is awesome for curly and permed hair. It is weightless in your hair. I use it everyday and will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> Usually stuff for curly hair is too heavy for my naturally wavy hair, but this product is the exception.  It is light so doesn&#x27;t weigh down the waves.  Also there is no plastic or crunchy feeling; it leaves my hair nice and soft.  There is a fragrance but it is pleasant and not too strong (and I am one who is sensitive to them).  The base is water and propylene glycol.  The only other product that I have found at the grocery store that is similar to this is Biotera Curl Creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients include soy and wheat proteins, which my hair loves.  Also, there are no -cones (silicone derivatives) that I can identify.  This makes it perfect for me to use in winter as well as summer (I use -cone products in summer to help with humidity issues and use non-cone products in winter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I also purchased the related shampoo and conditioner - ISO Bouncy Cleanse and Bouncy Condition.  These have proteins in them as well as amodimethicone.  I used both this morning and my hair is soft and wavy and, yes, bouncy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it daily on my hair. Just scrunch in a little and it helps support my curls and most importantly it is not sticky or crunchy at all!</li>
            <li> I guess they changed the formula? It used to be a slick, nice cream that didn&#x27;t weigh down your curls. But this one is kind of sticky, it even leaves a gross residue afterwards. My BF thought I had dandruff, that was kind of embarrassing. It isn&#x27;t the same one that I used to purchase, that&#x27;s for sure. The bottle is also different then the one pictured, so maybe I didn&#x27;t even get the right product.</li>
            <li> Terrific product at a terrific price.  Good transaction all around.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything great for my hair which is wavy but not thick.  Smells great on others which is why i purchased it.  Will not buy again.  Plus was quick ship and good price.</li>
