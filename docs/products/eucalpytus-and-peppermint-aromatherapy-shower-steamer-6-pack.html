            <li>all scents - all potent and does what they promise - steams the shower with scent.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly, and was so nicely packaged that I didn&#x27;t have to re-wrap it - I just popped it in a gift bag.  </li>
            <li>I love both of the scents, but they are strong smelling, so if you are sensitive to that sort of thing, this product might not be good for you.</li>
            <li>Although, I am very satisfied with these, and I really like them, so I will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I decided to make my own - bought all the ingredients mold and oils - this way i can make a bunch at once and make the exact scents I want (wanted a rosemary</li>
            <li>He spends a great deal of time showering (so he says!) due to various injuries, and says that his hydro-therapy certainly smells great now!</li>
            <li>and I was excited for the peppermint.</li>
            <li>I just love the smells I really believe is aromatherapy</li>
            <li>Nice smell and strong enough, but costly per shower usage.  </li>
            <li>and they are huge and lasted for a nice long bath and shower.</li>
            <li>so these are really better for busy lifestyles.</li>
            <li>Make sure you put them away from direct water and the drain</li>
            <li>They are just right when you are feeling achy or have a stuffy nose.  </li>
            <li>so I jumped right on a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Without the pleasant smell and the relief I thought I would get from the vapors, this purchase was basically a waste.</li>
            <li>you have no idea how much!</li>
            <li>They are well worth the price since they are very fragrant.</li>
            <li>These little gems, especially the peppermint ones, make for a great showering experience for your nose even if you don&#x27;t have sinus problems (like me).</li>
            <li>I was a huge fan of bath bombs especially the &amp;#34;lush&amp;#34; ones - omg</li>
            <li>Before I purchased these, I had never tried any type of steamer before, so I really can&#x27;t compare these to any others.</li>
            <li>These helped me when feeling very stressed and lacking focus.</li>
            <li>I really like the peppermint and the eucalpytus.  </li>
            <li>- the peppermint is VERY</li>
            <li>I was able to make one peppermint steamer ball last for two showers by pushing it into the shower corner out of the water stream and it was still strong enough for the next days shower.</li>
            <li>no it wont make your skin soft like bath bombs but peppermint will really clear your sinuses and lavender will relax you perfectly right before bed.</li>
            <li>I am not sure all items like this really have benefit, but these work really well and are worth the investment.</li>
            <li>They last for almost the whole shower and the aroma lasts for awhile afterwards.</li>
            <li>but if its just splashed by the water it could last up to 3 showers depending on how much scent you want.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one of the bombs so far</li>
            <li>loved them but expensive</li>
            <li>The balls don&#x27;t dissolve completely in 1 very long, hot shower which was a surprise.</li>
            <li>They last the length of my hot shower, and sometimes I find there is still a little piece that has not dissolved by the time I&#x27;m ready to get out.</li>
            <li>These barely emit any aroma</li>
            <li>Very relaxing and mentally calming.</li>

            <li> They help me to wake up when I am super exhausted.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful they can last for 3 or 4 showers each.</li>
            <li> its not like the aroma had to travel a long distance....</li>
            <li> I put it on the side of my shower so water is not directly hitting it - if water is it will disintegrate in a minute</li>
            <li> The aroma was pleasing but not overwhelming and my skin felt very soft and hydrated afterward.</li>
            <li> they last longer and are less money.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t give off enough steam vapors in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> Used one, throwing the rest away so that they don&#x27;t ruin other things that happen to come into contact with them.</li>
            <li> have tried other brands and they have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Not really thrilled with these- not strong enough to open my sinuses....</li>
            <li> It made the shower smelled nicer, but it did not help with my stuffy nose at all.&lt;br /&gt;So not worth $27</li>
            <li> They are small, so I worried about how much aroma there would be, but my concern was unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> i could get a whif of fragrance if I bent over at the waist and hung my hea down directly above the slowly dissolving ball.</li>
            <li> hands down.</li>
            <li> 5-10 seconds tops before it disappears down the drain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them everyday because they are a bit pricey, but I do every once in awhile when I am just dragging to get going.</li>
            <li> Oily and horrible (with a nice scent).  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money - get the oils elsewhere .</li>
            <li> We hardly smelled the scent at all.</li>
            <li> My husband had a cold and the balls helped immensely.  </li>
            <li> It smelled pretty awful to me and it took a while to dissolve.</li>
            <li> This sounds weird, but the foil on each of the balls was dirty and seemed like it had been sitting in someone&#x27;s closet for a long time.  </li>
            <li> have to say - they are very expensive - small about the size of a golf ball -</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found them to be an over priced novelty and didn&#x27;t help my sinus</li>
            <li> The recipient has given it a glowing report - and he&#x27;s difficult to please!  </li>
            <li> Well, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> The product arrived quickly, and was so nicely packaged that I didn&#x27;t have to re-wrap it - I just popped it in a gift bag.  The recipient has given it a glowing report - and he&#x27;s difficult to please!  He spends a great deal of time showering (so he says!) due to various injuries, and says that his hydro-therapy certainly smells great now!</li>
            <li> These are very strong. I wished they were smaller. They smell great tho</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gptten these for my mother a couple of times and decided to try them myself. The aromas are very pleasant and add a nice touch to the shower.</li>
            <li> This sounds weird, but the foil on each of the balls was dirty and seemed like it had been sitting in someone&#x27;s closet for a long time.  The product is good, but embarrassing because of the packaging if giving as a gift.</li>
            <li> We got these for our dual head shower for the at home spa experience. We also bought Eucalyptus spray and compared them. The spray won out... hands down. The balls don&#x27;t dissolve completely in 1 very long, hot shower which was a surprise. They don&#x27;t give off enough steam vapors in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> Not really thrilled with these- not strong enough to open my sinuses....</li>
            <li> loved them but expensive</li>
            <li> These little gems, especially the peppermint ones, make for a great showering experience for your nose even if you don&#x27;t have sinus problems (like me). If you&#x27;re careful they can last for 3 or 4 showers each.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these steamers! They help me to wake up when I am super exhausted. I don&#x27;t use them everyday because they are a bit pricey, but I do every once in awhile when I am just dragging to get going. I love both of the scents, but they are strong smelling, so if you are sensitive to that sort of thing, this product might not be good for you. They last the length of my hot shower, and sometimes I find there is still a little piece that has not dissolved by the time I&#x27;m ready to get out. Before I purchased these, I had never tried any type of steamer before, so I really can&#x27;t compare these to any others. Although, I am very satisfied with these, and I really like them, so I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Oily and horrible (with a nice scent).  Stained my fingers for 2 days and could not get customer support.  Used one, throwing the rest away so that they don&#x27;t ruin other things that happen to come into contact with them.</li>
            <li> The eucalyptus and peppermint balls add a relief when you need to open your lungs. My husband had a cold and the balls helped immensely.  I only wish they lasted for longer than ones shower session.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other brands and they have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> The 2 stars is because the packaging is cute. I did eead the reviews before buying, so I knew I was taking a risk. The peppermint smells wonderful, strong and lovely when still wrapped. But put it in the shower and ....nothing. Being only 5&#x27;2 its not like the aroma had to travel a long distance....LOL...i could get a whif of fragrance if I bent over at the waist and hung my hea down directly above the slowly dissolving ball. But really...that&#x27;s not hiw it should work. I wanted to love this...you have no idea how much! So save your money.</li>
            <li> These barely emit any aroma</li>
            <li> I bought several packages and still using them.  Nice smell and strong enough, but costly per shower usage.  I liked the concept.</li>
            <li> We hardly smelled the scent at all. We won&#x27;t purchase any more.  I miss the product Sudafed used to put out.</li>
            <li> It made the shower smelled nicer, but it did not help with my stuffy nose at all.&lt;br /&gt;So not worth $27</li>
            <li> It smells good but amazingly short-lived. 5-10 seconds tops before it disappears down the drain.</li>
            <li> I am not sure all items like this really have benefit, but these work really well and are worth the investment. I preferred the pepermint but liked both. They last for almost the whole shower and the aroma lasts for awhile afterwards. Very relaxing and mentally calming. I like the ones for bath but don&#x27;t always have time for a bath so these are really better for busy lifestyles. These helped me when feeling very stressed and lacking focus. They had a calming effect</li>
            <li> I like this concept and they seem to melt in the shower like stated but the aroma wasn&#x27;t very strong.  I couldn&#x27;t even tell which scent I had.  I&#x27;m prone to sinus headaches and had hoped these would help.  Unfortunately I found them to be an over priced novelty and didn&#x27;t help my sinus issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After giving these shower steamers another try, I wanted to update my initial review. I have determined the eucalyptus is the one that isn&#x27;t very strong. The peppermint is very strong and that is what I was looking for.  I was able to make one peppermint steamer ball last for two showers by pushing it into the shower corner out of the water stream and it was still strong enough for the next days shower. For me, I will order just the peppermint steamer pack and not the mixed pack.</li>
            <li> These smell very strong.  They are small, so I worried about how much aroma there would be, but my concern was unnecessary.  They are really great (if not a bit pricey), and I have tossed them in the bathtub as well as a bath bomb.  I really like the peppermint and the eucalpytus.  They are just right when you are feeling achy or have a stuffy nose.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I loved these! They help clear my sinuses from allergies and smell wonderful. Make sure you put them away from direct water and the drain and they will last longer. They are well worth the price since they are very fragrant.</li>
            <li> I LOVE shower steamers. I was a huge fan of bath bombs especially the &amp;#34;lush&amp;#34; ones - omg so great. I just love the smells I really believe is aromatherapy - i didn&#x27;t want to have to take bats all the time and I heard of these so I jumped right on a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought all scents - all potent and does what they promise - steams the shower with scent. no it wont make your skin soft like bath bombs but peppermint will really clear your sinuses and lavender will relax you perfectly right before bed. Even my boyfriend uses them with me. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say - they are very expensive - small about the size of a golf ball - I put it on the side of my shower so water is not directly hitting it - if water is it will disintegrate in a minute but if its just splashed by the water it could last up to 3 showers depending on how much scent you want. - the peppermint is VERY strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because these are so pricey to me about $5 a ball I decided to make my own - bought all the ingredients mold and oils - this way i can make a bunch at once and make the exact scents I want (wanted a rosemary one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to each his own! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Bought these thinking it would be perfect in the shower to help my sinuses. Well, I was disappointed. Very disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t smell the way I was hoping it would! It smelled pretty awful to me and it took a while to dissolve. Without the pleasant smell and the relief I thought I would get from the vapors, this purchase was basically a waste. I was bummed out.</li>
            <li> These smell amazing and make showering an even better experience.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money - get the oils elsewhere . they last longer and are less money.</li>
            <li> she was into eucalyptus and I was excited for the peppermint. I&#x27;ve used one of the bombs so far and they are huge and lasted for a nice long bath and shower. The aroma was pleasing but not overwhelming and my skin felt very soft and hydrated afterward. My only draw back is the price. This was a Christmas splurge.</li>
