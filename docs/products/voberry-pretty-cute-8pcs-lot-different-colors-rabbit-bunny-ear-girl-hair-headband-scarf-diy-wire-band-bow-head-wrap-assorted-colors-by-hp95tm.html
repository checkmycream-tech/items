            <li> The ones with larger polka dots (red, black, brown, blue) are silky.</li>

            <li> Was delivered before expected..</li>
            <li> I received it 3 weeks before the expected shipping time!</li>
            <li> but one reviewer said they didn&#x27;t work for her daughter&#x27;s hair, which I could see how a silky band wouldn&#x27;t stay in an active child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I have searched all over for a headband that doesn&#x27;t just slide and pop off my head or grip so tight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of $.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying</li>

            <li> I have a small head, so most headbands slip off. These are amazing for me! They stay on my head and I never have to readjust them! I&#x27;m happy I bought these!</li>
            <li> It came with all of them and they&#x27;re absolutely adorable! I can&#x27;t wait to wear these with my cute dresses :)!</li>
            <li> Quality so so , and they arrive in 4 colors only . Who need a pair of same color bunny ears?</li>
            <li> These are super cute and comfortable. They stay on my head no problem. I was surprised at how quickly they shipped, less than what was stated.</li>
            <li> Love! Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I only received doubles of 4 styles. They are pretty decent though.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to arrive since they ship from overseas but I got every one of the designs exactly as pictured. The ones with larger polka dots (red, black, brown, blue) are silky. They stay in my fine hair easily but one reviewer said they didn&#x27;t work for her daughter&#x27;s hair, which I could see how a silky band wouldn&#x27;t stay in an active child&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;m surprised by the quality considering the price. Very happy with the purchase...just be prepared to wait on shipping. It took 20 days from day of purchase to receiving on my doorstep in the state of Washington.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical on what the quality of these would be since I got them for such a great price. I ordered a lot of them because they were for a &amp;#34;Pin-Up&amp;#34; table at my sons 1950s themed wedding. They were absolutely the perfect addition to the wedding. People loved them so much that I didn&#x27;t have any left. Each one has a wire in it so when you put it on you have the 1950&#x27;s look. They are the perfect size and the colors are great. Nice mixture of colors in each package. Everyone was able to find a color that suited them!</li>
            <li> Perfect, fits all head sizes. Easy to tie.</li>
            <li> Ummmm. I ordered a jean one that was supposed to be included. it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> very nice and as expected</li>
            <li> Was delivered before expected.. Made me happy</li>
            <li> These work very well for me and the variety of colors makes it easy to find one that matches what I&#x27;m wearing. I have searched all over for a headband that doesn&#x27;t just slide and pop off my head or grip so tight I get a headache from them and these do the trick. I will be ordering more in other colors!</li>
            <li> I received it 3 weeks before the expected shipping time! its really cute and good quality too (usually anything i order that is shipped from china is kind of sketchy). I would recommend this :)</li>
            <li> I adore this set of headbands. They stay put, are adorable, and comfortable. It&#x27;s so fun having one to match every outfit!</li>
            <li> Love it! It took a while but surprisingly very strong for being such a cheap and low price! Love it!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!!! Super cute! Great Bargain! Thank you for my super cute accessories! Also, they got here like weeks ahead of time.</li>
            <li> I used a couple of times, but now my hair has been cut short, so I don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> Cute and perky additions to any wardrobe.  Stay put in the thickest of hair.  Marvelous!</li>
            <li> Super cute as shown... but don&#x27;t expect to get a nice assortment.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cute. I didn&#x27;t realize it had wire in them, but I figured well maybe that will make them stay. I bought them for my daughters and it slides right off. It&#x27;s annoying so I don&#x27;t use them. It&#x27;s a waste of $.</li>
