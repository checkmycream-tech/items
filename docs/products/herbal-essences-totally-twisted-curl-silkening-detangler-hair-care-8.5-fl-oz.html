            <li>I love the smell, it doesn&#x27;t smell like a kid product to me</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent, not overpowering, but my first choice is always the Marrakesh line now.</li>
            <li>Great at detangeling an great leave in conditioner without the sticky, heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>Love this product it helps my hair to softening and easy manageable.</li>
            <li>This product is great for naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>and really does a world of good to my hair</li>
            <li>My purchase was delivered very quickly and right to my door, which I love!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to get tangles out.</li>
            <li>My hair is super cute and curly, without being crunchy like their curling foam leaves it.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair, and sometimes it really just needs more moisture!  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Overall this product works great for every day use.</li>
            <li>I have VERY frizzy hair and this smoothed out my curls nicely.</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant scent, and does not weight down my curls at all.</li>
            <li>Perfect for thick or fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews, some said it didn&#x27;t detangle very well but liked it as a leave in hair product and that it smelled great.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this detangler smells and most importantly the way it makes my hair feel!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping it had something special in it to help with curls...</li>
            <li>I think it works good only used it twice.</li>
            <li>I was searching for sometime to help with the head full of tangles</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a fresh and clean type fragrance--not fruity or floral.</li>
            <li>but it does help tremendously.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have curly hair but straight to light wavy hair so should by theory be easier to detangle</li>
            <li>Honestly have tried this several times now and it does not help in detangling.</li>
            <li>like to put some in right out of the shower and also before I straighten my hair</li>
            <li>I notice a distinct difference when I don&#x27;t use the detangler first.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair clean feeling, smells amazing and no fly away like most products.</li>
            <li>we did use it on dry first before bath and that was amazing but even faster after the bath as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using it very much</li>
            <li>she for the first time did NOT cry when we did her hair</li>
            <li>It has made such a difference in our morning routine :)</li>
            <li>Not only is perfect for gently detangling my naturally long and curly hair after washing it, but the conditioner in this spray has had a MAJOR healing effect on my hair.</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant to put too much, but now I spritz away.</li>
            <li>I really Love the smell of the product and how easy it untangles my daughters thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have curly hair, but it works just as well on naturally straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I put this on my straight hair after I wash it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for sometime now and really like them.</li>
            <li>item works really well</li>
            <li>really detangles my hair ( my hair is not curly,</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite detangler so far.</li>
            <li>Will last for a long time I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li>My 10 year old daughter uses it on her naturally curly waist-length hair, we use it on our 2 year old&#x27;s wispy curls that get matted up from bed or his carseat, and I use it on my own hair when I want to tame some bedhead frizz and smooth out my hair.</li>
            <li>I have dry, fine (but a lot of it) curly hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>And I highly recommeded it to all my friends at work.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Totally Twisted Curl Silkening Detangler makes that easy, and also helps her hair have more body.</li>
            <li>Not super easy to detangle with it,</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>one thing I noticed is if I spray the product near my bangs, my hair begins to look greasy by the end of the day (which isn&#x27;t normal), so I avoid that area when spraying.</li>
            <li>With long, thick, wavy hair, I am always looking for a good detangler.  </li>
            <li>Tangles came right out of my naturally curly long hair</li>
            <li>still when I&#x27;m old and grey.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>No, it leaves it quite soft and</li>
            <li>So far it does so so on my semi wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and a different brand product I was using doubled their price.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and always use a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Along with some natural shampoos and conditioners that I bought to help replace the natural oils that I lost when I used cornstarch on it, I bought a bottle of this.</li>
            <li>I forgot how much care long hair takes!</li>
            <li>I purchased this and had a problem with my shipment the seller sent me new product before mine went back to them</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for detangling natural African American hair.</li>
            <li>This year I grew my hair past my shoulders for the first time since high school.</li>
            <li>In the winter, when it is really dry around here, I have had a lot of luck with keeping my curls vibrant and bouncy by using this product.  </li>
            <li>My personal standard of near perfection is the Pantene Pro V detangler, but this one definitely helps.  </li>
            <li>This leaves your hair feeling incredibly soft when left to air dry.  </li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product for detangling natural African American hair.</li>
            <li> This year I grew my hair past my shoulders for the first time since high school.</li>

            <li> This leaves your hair feeling incredibly soft when left to air dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my already heavy hair at all!</li>
            <li> However, if your child has really super long, thick, curly hair, this does nothing.</li>
            <li> Smells good and my little one&#x27;s crazy curls were undone in a flash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using harsher items on my hair for leave-in because I&#x27;d like to have waist long hair</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has loads of long hair and struggles to get the knots out after a shampoo, but Herbal Essence</li>
            <li> I use this as a lightweight conditioning spray when my hair is still wet, and a curl refresher for the next day.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and need a detangler</li>
            <li> If this is the case I would recommend a thick pomade-type conditioner which takes away the need for a detangler really.</li>
            <li> use this product by spraying it in my hair while still damp after a shower, toussle it, then let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It seems to help keep my hair from feeling too dry</li>
            <li> and I can use it even though I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> I use this after I wash my hair and towel dry it.</li>
            <li> and I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I spray it on damp hair before I comb it out (with a wide tooth comb) and the snags are easier to comb through and it helps to give my hair a smoother appearance once dry.</li>
            <li> It really helps me get through those tough tangles.</li>
            <li> my hair is wavy when wet</li>
            <li> When I bought it, it was only a few dollars and had Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very low maintenance with my hair but usually use a cream or gel after this and air dry.</li>
            <li> I have always let my hair air dry, and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is smoother looking and has less of that &amp;#34;frazzled&amp;#34; look on the ends.</li>
            <li> It actually does help detangle my long, thick hair after washing.</li>
            <li> I use it from the bottom of my ear and down as don&#x27;t put conditioner in my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lite weight and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> and i ve had problem with her tangly mess of a hair since about age 2</li>
            <li> her tangled mess was untangled in about 4 minutes</li>
            <li> I use it regularly as do a few members of my family.</li>
            <li> , shes autistic</li>
            <li> Can make my hair a little dirty looking prematurely, but I have naturally oily hair, so it&#x27;s no surprise.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really tight curls and they can be hard to manage.</li>
            <li> As a follow up to this review, I have been finding it difficult to find Aveeno Nourish + Condition Treatment Spray (the one I recommend above).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what this product is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have natural curly hair that knots up badly</li>
            <li> She cries when her hair is brushed--or at least she used to.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and curly, and I won&#x27;t take a brush to my hair without a couple sprays.</li>
            <li> In order to get rid of the petroleum jelly, I was forced to use cornstarch, which DID remove the petroleum jelly but also RUINED my hair.</li>
            <li> I have semi thick curly hair and this product doesnt help at all!</li>
            <li> Not perfect.  </li>
            <li> keep in mind that this isn&#x27;t a miracle product and some tangles will still be difficult to comb through.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my hair was so bad it was</li>
            <li> This spray does not leave her hair dirty or oily looking as some others have a tendency to do.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I use it regularly as do a few members of my family. Works like a charm</li>
            <li> Honestly have tried this several times now and it does not help in detangling. I don&#x27;t have curly hair but straight to light wavy hair so should by theory be easier to detangle but this did not work. I will stick with Aveeno Nourish+ Condition Treatment Spray, 5.2-Ounce Bottle. This is listed as a Leave In conditioner however does a great job of detangling. I use it from the bottom of my ear and down as don&#x27;t put conditioner in my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 2014: As a follow up to this review, I have been finding it difficult to find Aveeno Nourish + Condition Treatment Spray (the one I recommend above). I suspect it is being discontinued. If this is the case I would recommend a thick pomade-type conditioner which takes away the need for a detangler really.</li>
            <li> my daughter is almost 8 and i ve had problem with her tangly mess of a hair since about age 2, I cannot believe how wonderful this product is. she for the first time did NOT cry when we did her hair, shes autistic and she even said I love it. i will only use this from now on. her tangled mess was untangled in about 4 minutes we did use it on dry first before bath and that was amazing but even faster after the bath as well.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that when styled correctly goes quite curly.  I don&#x27;t like using harsher items on my hair for leave-in because I&#x27;d like to have waist long hair still when I&#x27;m old and grey.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product by spraying it in my hair while still damp after a shower, toussle it, then let it air dry.  My hair is super cute and curly, without being crunchy like their curling foam leaves it.  No, it leaves it quite soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> I really Love the smell of the product and how easy it untangles my daughters thick hair.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to get tangles out. Smells nice, Fast shipping. So far it does so so on my semi wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have been trying dozens of sprays since Dove discontinued their leave-in spray.  This one is almost perfect with a wonderful fragrance and non-oily consistency.  It works better at detangling that the others I&#x27;ve tried.  I hope they do not discontinue this one.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really tight curls and they can be hard to manage. I have been using this spray along with the knot genie hairbrush and there are no tears anymore! A combination anyone with curly hair children should try.</li>
            <li> This detangler smells beautiful! It leaves my curls lovely- springy and defined! But it does not do the #1 thing I bought it to do- detangle. My daughter and I both have natural curly hair that knots up badly so I have to have a smoothing and detangling conditioner. So I have to keep looking to find one!</li>
            <li> This leaves your hair feeling incredibly soft when left to air dry.  I don&#x27;t have curly hair, but it works just as well on naturally straight hair.  It smells amazing too.  I would definitely repurchase this!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has loads of long hair and struggles to get the knots out after a shampoo, but Herbal Essence Totally Twisted Curl Silkening Detangler makes that easy, and also helps her hair have more body.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this detangler smells and most importantly the way it makes my hair feel!&lt;br /&gt;I like to put some in right out of the shower and also before I straighten my hair&lt;br /&gt;It seems to help keep my hair from feeling too dry</li>
            <li> Works well for the daughter&#x27;s hair when she wakes up and after a good night&#x27;s sleep. Don&#x27;t use anything else in the mornings....</li>
            <li> I have since used better detanglers for my curly hair than this one.  It has a pleasant scent, not overpowering, but my first choice is always the Marrakesh line now.</li>
            <li> I like it because it helps my curly hair from getting all matted and I can use it even though I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> Lite weight and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  Overall this product works great for every day use. I would highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> With long, thick, wavy hair, I am always looking for a good detangler.  This one is good.  Not perfect.  My personal standard of near perfection is the Pantene Pro V detangler, but this one definitely helps.  I use it in conjunction with my Tangle Teeze brush.  Smells better than Pantene, to be honest. Great scent.  This is my second favorite detangler so far.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable. Not super easy to detangle with it, but it does help tremendously. For the price, I say try it.</li>
            <li> It works and smells fantastic! Perfect for thick or fine curly hair. I highly recommend this product for detangling natural African American hair.</li>
            <li> Great buy, it&#x27;s very cheap. However, if your child has really super long, thick, curly hair, this does nothing. You might as well be using that crappy johnsons kids detangler. There is no difference in this than the cheaper hair detanglers. I was hoping it had something special in it to help with curls...nope. You&#x27;re just paying for the Herbal Essence name. I don&#x27;t even think the scent was that appealing.</li>
            <li> Love this product it helps my hair to softening and easy manageable. When this product out of store, I ordered immediately to AMAZON.COM and the next thing I know within couples days I got it! Wow! service is great! And I highly recommeded it to all my friends at work.</li>
            <li> I think it works good only used it twice. I know it smells so good and it does what it says it does. Doesnt make my hair greasy that I have yet noticed :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what this product is supposed to do. I gave it two stars because it smells good. It did nothing for my hair or my kids&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> Great at detangeling an great leave in conditioner without the sticky, heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have VERY frizzy hair and this smoothed out my curls nicely. I did not buy it to detangle so I dont know how well it does in that department.</li>
            <li> Can make my hair a little dirty looking prematurely, but I have naturally oily hair, so it&#x27;s no surprise. Not a miracle product, but it does what it says.</li>
            <li> It actually does help detangle my long, thick hair after washing. It also has a nice, floral scent.</li>
            <li> I have semi thick curly hair and this product doesnt help at all! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this after I wash my hair and towel dry it. My hair is thick and curly, and I won&#x27;t take a brush to my hair without a couple sprays. Smells great and works, but I find it drying.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again. Works great on all hair types. Tangles came right out of my naturally curly long hair</li>
            <li> Works ok, but smells like it is for a child. I&#x27;m not using it very much so I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling product, and it works great on my hair.  I have straight hair and a different brand product I was using doubled their price.  So I decided to try this out based on the reviews I read.  I put this on my straight hair after I wash it.  After 10 minutes my comb glides through my hair tangle free!  I will be ordering this again when I run out.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Totally Twisted Curl Silkening Detangler is my favorite leave-in conditioner to date. I spray it on damp hair before I comb it out (with a wide tooth comb) and the snags are easier to comb through and it helps to give my hair a smoother appearance once dry. I notice a distinct difference when I don&#x27;t use the detangler first. The light scent is also very nice and I get a lot of compliments for smelling good.&lt;br /&gt;Just keep in mind that this isn&#x27;t a miracle product and some tangles will still be difficult to comb through. Also, I wish the construction of the bottle allowed you to use all the product at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I use this as a lightweight conditioning spray when my hair is still wet, and a curl refresher for the next day. I have dry, fine (but a lot of it) curly hair. I&#x27;m very low maintenance with my hair but usually use a cream or gel after this and air dry. Smells good. Please keep this in stock!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my tender-headed daughter.  She cries when her hair is brushed--or at least she used to.  This spray does not leave her hair dirty or oily looking as some others have a tendency to do.  It has made such a difference in our morning routine :)</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for sometime now and really like them. I bought this with them in a bundle purchase. I have not tried the product yet, but it sounds good. My purchase was delivered very quickly and right to my door, which I love! I read the other reviews, some said it didn&#x27;t detangle very well but liked it as a leave in hair product and that it smelled great. That sounds good to me and worth trying it out! I have naturally curly hair and always use a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This year I grew my hair past my shoulders for the first time since high school. I forgot how much care long hair takes! I was searching for sometime to help with the head full of tangles I wake up to every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight hair, but this curl detangler spray is great. At first I was hesitant to put too much, but now I spritz away. It really helps me get through those tough tangles. I have always let my hair air dry, and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is smoother looking and has less of that &amp;#34;frazzled&amp;#34; look on the ends. It looks more like I&#x27;ve taken the time to blow-dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I noticed is if I spray the product near my bangs, my hair begins to look greasy by the end of the day (which isn&#x27;t normal), so I avoid that area when spraying.</li>
            <li> Recently, I used a hair product that (unknowingly) contained petroleum jelly in it. In order to get rid of the petroleum jelly, I was forced to use cornstarch, which DID remove the petroleum jelly but also RUINED my hair. Seriously, my hair was so bad it was if I had color stripped it or bleached it. Along with some natural shampoos and conditioners that I bought to help replace the natural oils that I lost when I used cornstarch on it, I bought a bottle of this. Not only is perfect for gently detangling my naturally long and curly hair after washing it, but the conditioner in this spray has had a MAJOR healing effect on my hair. It&#x27;s almost as effective as the coconut oil treatments that I do once a week. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my already heavy hair at all! It also smells great! I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Fast service, great product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is great for naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Smells good and my little one&#x27;s crazy curls were undone in a flash. Will last for a long time I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li> smells good and detangles better than kids spray.  My daughter refuses to cut her hair, so a good detangler is needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and had a problem with my shipment the seller sent me new product before mine went back to them and I love it. This is the best Silkening product out there. Leaves my hair clean feeling, smells amazing and no fly away like most products. I have long hair and need a detangler and this is my favorite now. It&#x27;s not just for curls my hair is wavy when wet and I blow dry. Truly amazing product and excellent customer service from this seller!!! Thank you.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> hey,&lt;br /&gt;this item works really well and really does a world of good to my hair i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This is a favorite product of mine.  I have curly hair, and sometimes it really just needs more moisture!  In the winter, when it is really dry around here, I have had a lot of luck with keeping my curls vibrant and bouncy by using this product.  I spray it in my damp, towel-dried hair.  It has a very pleasant scent, and does not weight down my curls at all.</li>
            <li> This detangler works great for us. My 10 year old daughter uses it on her naturally curly waist-length hair, we use it on our 2 year old&#x27;s wispy curls that get matted up from bed or his carseat, and I use it on my own hair when I want to tame some bedhead frizz and smooth out my hair. I love the smell, it doesn&#x27;t smell like a kid product to me, it&#x27;s a fresh and clean type fragrance--not fruity or floral. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like any residue is on it, either. When I bought it, it was only a few dollars and had Prime shipping. I&#x27;m waiting, hoping for that deal to come back before I buy it again from Amazon.</li>
            <li> love it! smells awesome! really detangles my hair ( my hair is not curly, its wavy but it does get tangled up)</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love detangler!!  This stuff is great.</li>
