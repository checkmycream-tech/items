            <li>it&#x27;s the best deal i can get for this pack of 24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one thing to take a note</li>
            <li>The best dental floss on the market.  </li>
            <li>This seller was great.</li>

            <li>good stuff, thinnest floss I&#x27;ve found that does the job</li>
            <li>When retail stores started carrying it more sporadically I started to get worried -- so I started ordering cases!  </li>
            <li>This is a great deal and with free shipping its a no brainer.</li>
            <li>recommend this product, but it must be used regularly to be effective.   </li>
            <li>Great floss at economical price.</li>
            <li>This will be a 10 yrs supplies :).  </li>
            <li>I bought more on another trip to Europe, but never saw it in any US retail store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product was great, it&#x27;s the round floss dispenser, very cute.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST EVER floss for tightly packed teeth.</li>
            <li>Overall was a great purcharse.</li>
            <li>The important thing is to floss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is important to then brush the teeth and rinse between the teeth to remove the film of bacteria that the flossing has dislodged.  </li>
            <li>It is the mechanical act of removing the bacterial flim that is the important part, not the flavoring or chemical additions to the floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the mechanical act of removing the bacterial flim that is the important part, not the flavoring or chemical additions to the floss.   </li>
            <li>There are so many options - choose the right one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find \\&quot;Oral-B Essential Floss\\&quot; listed here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Choose a floss that is comfortable to you and is the right thickness for your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have flossed daily for many years and tried many brands and types of floss</li>
            <li>There are many gimmicks the manufacturers use to sell their particular brand of floss.  </li>
            <li>As any dental health professional will attest to, flossing one&#x27;s teeth is just as important as brushing, and perhaps more so, for the bacteria that causes gum disease (and to a certain extent cavities) almost always starts between the teeth.</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li>Whatever the case, the most important point is to choose a floss variety you will use regularly.  </li>
            <li>The floss is just the right thickness</li>
            <li>I ran across some authentic ones at the local Walmart for 1.27/count and compared them to these.</li>
            <li>The fake brand works okay, but these should be at MOST $1/count as I&#x27;m sure they are not paying any royalties to Oral-B.</li>
            <li>I first encountered this floss on a visit to the UK.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping, exactly what I nedeed</li>
            <li>Some complain that they don&#x27;t have time to floss; well, if flossing is tied into another habit, such as watching TV, both can easily be done</li>
            <li>so it works very well.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very close together.  </li>
            <li>Waxed floss is no more effective than unwaxed at removing the bacterial film build-up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fine and flexible, and threads easily past my many fillings and misplaced teeth - much better than any other floss I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>, some incorporate fluoride into the strands of floss, and some make their floss more slippery for folks with tight contacts.  </li>
            <li>dental floss pretty much works the same.</li>
            <li>The lines are too thin, they can&#x27;t fit into the slots to clean the residuals there</li>
            <li>The floss itself is also just the kind I expected, it has hints of mints but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I not only paid more for this at 1.84/count, but noticed they are not authentic.</li>
            <li>I know it sounds strange, but incorporating flossing into another habit leads one into developing a new habit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my fave - strong yet thin.</li>

            <li> This is the only floss I can use because it&#x27;s strong but very thin</li>
            <li> Thin and strong enough for tight spaces between teeth -- anything else just shreds.</li>
            <li> Expected mint.  </li>
            <li> is that the package of the floss i received is not exactly as the one shown in the picture, which i have been used.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It seemed like a fake plastic string which i thought if i use it, it would be really harmful for my teeth</li>
            <li> i have used this floss for a few years and could not change to any other brand.</li>
            <li> The originals are made in Ireland and have the logo on the round box, but these fake ones I received don&#x27;t have the proper logo and they aren&#x27;t mint flavored.</li>
            <li> you care for your oral health, this product is not suitable at all</li>
            <li> hard to find in stores, this is what I like, been ordering this for years.</li>
            <li> and I have some delicate dental work.  </li>
            <li> Some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping the floss around the fingers, while others prefer thin flavored floss to waxed thick floss.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I returned this product&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very bad</li>

            <li> The floss is just the right thickness so it works very well.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST EVER floss for tightly packed teeth. But AMAZON - PLEASE provide a smaller quantity option. This would be a great ADD-ON item!!!</li>
            <li> i have used this floss for a few years and could not change to any other brand. it&#x27;s the best deal i can get for this pack of 24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one thing to take a note is that the package of the floss i received is not exactly as the one shown in the picture, which i have been used. but the floss itself is of no difference.</li>
            <li> I got the package of 24 items....  This will be a 10 yrs supplies :).  The product was great, it&#x27;s the round floss dispenser, very cute.  The floss itself is also just the kind I expected, it has hints of mints but not overwhelming.  Overall was a great purcharse.</li>
            <li> The best dental floss on the market.  It does not shread.  I have flossed daily for many years and tried many brands and types of floss and this is my favorite by far.  This seller was great.</li>
            <li> Thin and strong enough for tight spaces between teeth -- anything else just shreds.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss I can use because it&#x27;s strong but very thin and I have some delicate dental work.  When retail stores started carrying it more sporadically I started to get worried -- so I started ordering cases!  If I could guarantee a lifetime supply I would.  I use it 2-3x a day</li>
            <li> fast shipping, exactly what I nedeed</li>
            <li> Why buy floss every month for triple the price. This is a great deal and with free shipping its a no brainer. We will have floss for years!</li>
            <li> As any dental health professional will attest to, flossing one&#x27;s teeth is just as important as brushing, and perhaps more so, for the bacteria that causes gum disease (and to a certain extent cavities) almost always starts between the teeth. Daily flossing breaks up the film of harmful bacteria and allows it to be removed.  Therefore, as a dentist, I am always stressing the importance of daily flosing to my patients.  My advice is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Choose a floss that is comfortable to you and is the right thickness for your teeth.  Some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping the floss around the fingers, while others prefer thin flavored floss to waxed thick floss. There are so many options - choose the right one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Waxed floss is \\&quot;waxed\\&quot; to allow easier passage between the teeth.  Waxed floss is no more effective than unwaxed at removing the bacterial film build-up. The important thing is to floss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Floss once daily, preferably before brushing.  Flossing breaks up the film of bacteria between the teeth in areas a toothbrush cannot reach.  It is important to then brush the teeth and rinse between the teeth to remove the film of bacteria that the flossing has dislodged.  Without brushing or rinsing after flossing, the bacteria can reattach to the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Try to tie in flossing with another habit, such as watching the 10 PM news.  I know it sounds strange, but incorporating flossing into another habit leads one into developing a new habit.  Some complain that they don&#x27;t have time to floss; well, if flossing is tied into another habit, such as watching TV, both can easily be done concurrently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  There are many gimmicks the manufacturers use to sell their particular brand of floss.  Some flavor the floss, some incorporate fluoride into the strands of floss, and some make their floss more slippery for folks with tight contacts.  Whatever the case, the most important point is to choose a floss variety you will use regularly.  It is the mechanical act of removing the bacterial flim that is the important part, not the flavoring or chemical additions to the floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  If you want to keep your teeth for a life-time, develop the flossing habit.  As one wise sage said: \\&quot;If you ignore your teeth, they will eventually go away\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product, but it must be used regularly to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim \\&quot;Konedog\\&quot; Koenig, DDSoose a floss variety you will use regularly.

You need to find a type you like so you can stick to your daily regime. This stuff works for me.</li>
