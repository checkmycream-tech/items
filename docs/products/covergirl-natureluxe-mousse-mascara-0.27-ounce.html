    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was totally impressed.</li>
            <li>And one of the greatest characteristics is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all in the brush and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>anyways, very good mascara</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>Yuck, it&#x27;s not an attractive look.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not a lot to say but if you buy mascara (guy or girl), this is a great one.</li>
            <li>but this was great.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how great it works.  </li>
            <li>but the product itself isn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li>This is a great mascara, it goes on well, covers well.  </li>
            <li>It seems to lengthen my lashes substantially and gives them great volume.</li>
            <li>It is great for work or a night out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am happy that Covergirl (or the seller) opted to list all of the ingredients for this product.  </li>
            <li>and it helps them to curl I am happy.</li>
            <li>So I am happy.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that does not clump.  </li>
            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>This mascara is great.</li>
            <li>product is really great though.</li>
            <li>My wife tried this product for me and she looked very nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent mascara  Feels very light to wear  </li>
            <li>This mascara is amazing!</li>
            <li>But It does give me nice, beautiful fluttery eyelashes.</li>
            <li>My eyes look bright.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s good for people allergic to mascara (are there people allergic to mascara?)</li>
            <li>Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when doing that, but the brush seems to be fairly good at minimizing that.  </li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t try to thicken/lengthen, the lashes all stay fairly separate.  </li>
            <li>This mascara stays on fairly well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product iif</li>
            <li>Layering tended to make cakey lashes (not in a good way).  </li>
            <li>This is a good value.</li>
            <li>Looks good on lashes</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stick, it separates the lashes quite nicely, and does a great job coating them.  </li>
            <li>Great thing about this mascara is that it won&#x27;t smudge at all, and very easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>This mascara is one of the best I&#x27;ve found--and I&#x27;m pretty picky about my mascara!</li>
            <li>This mascara has a fine brush which is perfect for my very fine lashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Maybelline Mascara most of my life, but a friend recommended this product and I was happy to find it on the Vine list.  </li>
            <li>the Natureluxe Mousse Mascara goes on nicely, the brush is a good design, and there is no gluppiness.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of mascara but am often disapointed...not so with this product!  </li>
            <li>Love the consistency of this mascara!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Plus, I love the wand!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>This is the best mascara --  goes on smooth, no clumps, easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product as it has great coverage and stay on all day with out smudging.</li>
            <li>This Covergirl Natureluxe Mousse Mascara glides on nicely and stays on without smudging or running.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed with this mascara because it absolutely does NOT CLUMP.</li>
            <li>I own an eyelash comb, too, but for whatever reason it doesn&#x27;t help, this brush &amp; formula likes to stick together.</li>
            <li>nothing but thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the way this went on, stayed  on and washed off.</li>
            <li>I used to own the waterproof version.</li>
            <li>I got 0 clumps with this mascara and the formula has a nice honey sent to It.</li>
            <li>Even with that kind of staying power, it washes off very easily at the end of the day, and I have not yet had to break out the makeup remover for it.  </li>
            <li>Very natural and wonderful to use!</li>
            <li>Even without soap, it came off very easily, and my eyelashes didn&#x27;t sport that \\&quot;I wore mascara</li>
            <li>It just feels light and right and rather heavenly to have found something I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on and it looks great!</li>
            <li>I liked the feel of the brush and felt the mascara went on very smoothly</li>
            <li>I loved the smooth texture and</li>
            <li>Covergirl had the nice idea to try and make a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; mascara</li>
            <li>water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also impressed with the packaging a nice slim tube rather than the bulky flat tubes that seemed to be the latest marketing trend.</li>
            <li>and It goes on nice and easy.  </li>
            <li>The formula is super light and if you apply it from the roots up, helps achieve great length.</li>
            <li>It stays \\&quot;wet\\&quot; on my eyelashes for probably 15 minutes or more before I can safely let anything brush up against my lashes without leaving mascara marks.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE it -</li>
            <li>so I bought the mascara expecting to be happy, but I&#x27;m really not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one get one 50% off, and I&#x27;m like, okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a mascara to like, but this one I LOVE.  </li>
            <li>Already purchased 2 more since the freebee on Vine before the price raises up.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would ever love any mascara more than [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This mascara will make you feel especially pretty.</li>
            <li>I could tell that her lashes were longer, darker and more noticeable, but I didn&#x27;t see any clumps on her lashes or smudge marks on her skin.</li>
            <li>I can feel this on my lashes a bit more in comparison.  </li>
            <li>But for the price, this is the next best thing!</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Build on a coat or two more and you have all the length you need, and some volume.</li>
            <li>I would consider this more of a lengthening than a volumizing mascara.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love everything about this mousse mascara.</li>
            <li>I thought the applicator could have been designed better.  </li>
            <li>I look more polished, and my eyes are more emphasized, with this mascara...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed that a mascara this smooth and soft can come from a brand like covergirl.      </li>
            <li>I wish it would have something to grip it better.  </li>
            <li>but there is not an overwhelming body of evidence to give the data a \\&quot;robust\\&quot; score</li>
            <li>but there is not an overwhelming body of evidence to give the data a \\&quot;robust\\&quot; score</li>
            <li>but there is not an overwhelming body of evidence to give the data a \\&quot;robust\\&quot; score</li>
            <li>Have to put on too many layers for it to look like I have any on at all.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not exactly sure what it is about this stuff, but I love it.</li>
            <li>I think I like it better.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this mascara</li>
            <li>I love, love,.love this mascara.</li>
            <li>The color is very nice, it&#x27;s very black, and what I like best about it is how beautifully smooth it goes on.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for anybodies advice!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li>I is also very light weight and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It comes off easy, which could be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it, and does more for length than volume.</li>
            <li>It does not clump, like too many products, but separates and covers lashes easily.</li>
            <li>Of course, for an important outing I would choose something more serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mascara is awesome because it is not hard to wash off and it doesn&#x27;t damage your lashes as much as others.</li>
            <li>I have it in brown, which is light enough for my very fair complexion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It stays all day without running and removal is easy - either with soap and water as you wash your face or with a baby wipe.  </li>
            <li>and it washes off with water easily.</li>
            <li>clumpy&lt;br /&gt;Comes off easily with eye makeup remover</li>
            <li>This was easy to apply without any clumping.</li>
            <li>According to her, the mascara glides on easily without a lot of clumping.</li>
            <li>and yet it washed off easily with soap and</li>
            <li>Goes on easy- no clumping.  </li>
            <li>Easy off.  </li>
            <li>It washes off easily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>But for me I like that it removes easily.</li>
            <li>The fine-bristled brush separates each lash for easy coating with the product.  </li>
            <li>It washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li>Functional too, as the wand is easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wears well and cleans off easy.</li>
            <li>The brush is fabulous for grabbing every lash with its spiky bristles and flexible wand, and the formula is so light and smooth!</li>
            <li>Washes off easily.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that this mascara is all natural, but it smears very easily.</li>
            <li>So I like for them to stand out, but my hair &amp; lashes are naturally fine</li>
            <li>I was drawn to it by its \\&quot;clean &amp; green\\&quot; hype, but love it because it is light, lasting, non-smudge, cleans easily with soap and water, and looks great on.</li>
            <li>I love how this mascara really makes the eyes pop out! :)</li>
            <li>it looks and feels like your eye lashes are naturally huge.</li>
            <li>It will not clump and its easy to clean off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>Maybelline Great Lash - Big Mascara]].</li>
            <li>so if you are prone to crying or running about in the rain it might not be the best choice.</li>
            <li>The mousse formula goes on so smoothly and coats every lash.</li>
            <li>Feels light on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it have a review in the cheap trills session of Allure Magazine.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>hope this mascara is available for a very long time!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty picky, and this mascara is great!</li>
            <li>The color is nice, there is no weird smell to it, and the packaging is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>pretty sure this is a discontinued item.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara and it sadly is no longer sold in stores around me.</li>
            <li>I have VERY fine eyelashes, and I really need a mascara that will separate them all</li>
            <li>I also LOVE Sally Hansen&#x27;s Natural Beauty Inspired by Carmindy (from TLC&#x27;s What Not To Wear) mascara,I think that&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li>It has more natural ingredients than most mascaras, which I do like.</li>
            <li>Most natural mascara costs way more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the length I like, but with no clumping and quick dry time I will be happy with this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a nice mascara for anyone with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>and this gives me a natural color and nice fullness without the clumps.  </li>
            <li>but this is a good mascara for daily use.</li>
            <li>If you just want a light coating to darken your lashes, this is the right thing for you.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice, light mascara that doesn&#x27;t weight down your lashes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything to say about the &amp;#34;natural ingredients,&amp;#34; or lack thereof, but I love the way the mascara feels-- more comfortable than any other mascara I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>love how it&#x27;s not clumpy, and doesnt&#x27; dry too quickly, so there&#x27;s more time to &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; the look</li>
            <li>That aside, it looked pretty!  </li>
            <li>Light tears didn&#x27;t move it much.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if this mascara is made with some kind of magnetic material, because as soon as I put it on my lashes they all massed together into one big clump.</li>
            <li>I rarely have reactions to makeup, but it happened with this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Covergirl Natureluxe Mousse Mascara is for those who like a natural look--it goes on smooth but light.  </li>
            <li>I like mine to look more natural and not be clumpy.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not really looking for length, but volume is good and this mascara provides that.</li>
            <li>I know the in thing is to have very obvious makeup, but I would think that with the popularity of Downton Abbey, natural looking makeup would start becoming popular again.</li>
            <li>&quot; so I can get on with my makeup routine almost right away.    </li>
            <li>Also clumping isn&#x27;t even the right description to what this mascara did to my lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mousse formula which seemed to make it very whipped, smooth and clump free and though I tend to be a huge fan of the   Big brush wand</li>
            <li>Also, Honeybee Gardens, 100% Pure, Tarte, and Lavera are some great legitimately natural choices and everyones lashes and formula preferences are different.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the bottle is a regular size and easy to fit into a makeup purse.</li>
            <li>Another big plus is that the silicone brush applicator is actually a VERY good one - precise and gentle, I&#x27;ve used other silicone applicators that were terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may not be the most intense mascara ever, but it looks very natural and stays on well.</li>
            <li>It was nice, flexible, does not clump and it lasted all day long without smearing (even when eye-drops were used repeatedly.)</li>
            <li>The occasional pull at the lashes (feeling a loose one and pulling without remembering I was wearing mascara) showed that the mascara was very strongly attached against that kind of motion.  </li>
            <li>Once on and dry, I didn&#x27;t have problems with smearing and it looked nice without a lot of clumping.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely going to repurchase this for a perfect everyday look.</li>
            <li>The top part that the brush is attached to is very round and smooth, and I have trouble getting a good grip on it!  </li>
            <li>My usual brand is the Bare Escentuals Flawless Definition mascara, and I&#x27;d say this is the first drugstore mascara I have found that it&#x27;s a close contender.  </li>
            <li>(no clumps)with a nice true black color.  </li>
            <li>Came in New Condition and original packaging.</li>
            <li>yes - but it takes a bit of effort to make it really consistent all over&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend Gabriel Cosmetics mascara, and I prefer the ZuZu Luxe line mostly for the packaging and slightly different brush.</li>
            <li>I also know that the Cetearyl Alcohol in it can actually cause a dependency on the mascara, leading you to need more of it to achieve the look you want because it can weaken your lashes over time.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different mascaras since the 60&#x27;s and</li>
            <li>I personally like my lashes longer and coated more, as I like a heavier look with my eyeliner.</li>
            <li>A light natural looking mascara.</li>
            <li>It is definitely one of my favorite mascaras</li>
            <li>I was happily satisfied with the extra length plastic/rubber teeth on this wand.  </li>
            <li>Once on, it&#x27;s light as air, never heavy.</li>
            <li>But that minor detail wasn&#x27;t enough to detract a star from an otherwise great mascara.      </li>
            <li>Just because it has Water and Beeswax as the 1st and 2nd ingredients does not make this entirely safe or inert).  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara because my aesthetician who fills my eyelashes,Maya&#x27;s it is the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause problems with them.</li>
            <li>I have used this mascara since it first came out and is now no longer carried in the stores where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I tried this for a few days and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can actually make you look as though you have naturally long lashes which is very nice.</li>
            <li>I find it very useful for daily wear when you need your makeup to be quick.</li>
            <li>my eyelashes looked very natural and separated...and full of volume.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much time in the morning to spend on looking fabulous, but I&#x27;m always ready and willing to give a new product a try...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell (it&#x27;s a little strong in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not as fond of the applicator - easy to go on</li>
            <li>Not a bad try for a natural product</li>
            <li>The rubber brush makes it easy to separate the lashes and provide the extra length.</li>
            <li>The length of time it takes to dry on my eyelashes is way more than I</li>
            <li>Rich black pigment, builds without caking, cleans easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair skinned blonde with VERY long eye lashes.</li>
            <li>It gives volume and length but the best part is that it&#x27;s much easier to remove at the end of the day compared to other mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>and if I get a bit too much, just a swipe of the applicator brush again smooths it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very picky about the way my mascara applies.</li>
            <li>The mascara really makes your eyes pop.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It provides length and volume without too much work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very lightweight...</li>
            <li>One coat gives you very natural-looking, but luscious lashes.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t had a problem with it running at all.</li>
            <li>I actually really quite like this mascara.  </li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look longer and thicker than they really</li>
            <li>Most (nearly all) mascara&#x27;s make my eyes burn, itch, water, and get red.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gone back to any kind of makeup I can pick up in any store for several years, but this mascara will change that.  </li>
            <li>I bought this mascara a few days ago....and really liked how it went on my eyelashes....</li>

            <li>However, there are people who are acutely sensitive to these and other chemical ingredients and it is important to check up on these prior to application and make your own decision on what you want to do.</li>
            <li>: The brush is easy to use--it has many tiny bristles on it that make the mascara easier to put on without getting globs of black liquid sticking lashes</li>
            <li>This mascara goes on clean, doesn&#x27;t clump, and so far has not irritated my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I like it better than every other drugstore brand of mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>, my eyelashes are sooo long, love it, I even got a compliment on the length by a 26 year old</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I subtract one star for minimal smudging on humid days, but am very pleased with this product overall.  </li>
            <li>I give it only four stars because I do prefer my clinique mascara, which goes on a little more smoothly and feels weightless.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup all that frequently, but I&#x27;ve used enough to get a reasonable survey of the available range of mascaras over the years.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone looking to try something new!</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re lucky enough to find it don&#x27;t pass it up (I believe it was mainly marketed at CVS).</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that this particular mascara is not waterproof, it&#x27;s not lengthening, curling, or thickening mascara.  </li>
            <li>What i I love that the mascara pigment only gets on the brush and not on the whole brush (being the long thing thats attached to the mascara brush head).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I thought Covergirl would have a little more creativity than that.</li>
            <li>However, there are people who are acutely sensitive to these and other chemical ingredients and it is important to check up on these prior to application and make your own decision on what you want to do.ients will not affect everyone in the same way due to the unique biological makeup of each person (no pun intended).  </li>
            <li>and when I towel off my lashes are soft and supple and ready for reapplying for the day.  </li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t more companies actually make natural products instead of just trying to trick people and advertise their products as such.</li>
            <li>She wears mascara everyday and said that this will be her new mascara that she will buy more when this is gone.  </li>
            <li>I got it in black brown because I wanted something that would look more natural on low-makeup days.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how natural it is or whether it is truly any more natural than other kinds of mascara</li>
            <li>when I wore this, I noticed right away the big difference.</li>
            <li>I expected some goopy mess and each time I have used it there has not been clumping, so the formula is really good.</li>
            <li>This one is on the plus side of the middle of the pack, and pretty decent for its price point.  </li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s so natural, but I need something a little more hard-working.</li>
            <li>this one is nothing new to me.</li>
            <li>I have hard time finding any good mascaras and finally found it.</li>
            <li>: The liquid itself seems to dry quickly once applied.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I naturally have decent eyelashes</li>
            <li>but when I read the ingredients, I saw that this is very far from nature.</li>
            <li>This is a very lightweight mascara that you can barely feel when its on.  </li>
            <li>It lengthens better than other mascaras and when there&#x27;s a coupon, its only five bucks.  </li>
            <li>I went to review CoverGirl Naturelux Mousse Mascara, I first went to EWG.org Skin Deep database and found this product listed.  </li>
            <li>For the sake of brevity, I am listing only those things with a higher \\&quot;moderate\\&quot; score (5-4).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li>I like that natural look and this mascara gives it!</li>
            <li>I solved this fairly early on by painting the top of each cap black and brown, respectively, with nail polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich, black mascara.</li>
            <li>The brush is hard and the bristles too short to effectively cover and separate lashes.  </li>
            <li>I developed a very itchy red rash all around my eyes and under my eyes since using this product.  </li>
            <li>I assume Covergirl wanted the promote the natural ingredients in the product by giving the bottle a \\&quot;green\\&quot; look, but it ended up looking like something from the seventies instead of from this decade.</li>
            <li>I got excited when I saw it but read the ingredients and it has methylparaben... not cool.</li>
            <li>If you know you&#x27;re sensitive, you may want to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I trashed it early and replaced with Revlon.</li>
            <li>This mascara gives me volume and my lashes stay soft all day.  </li>
            <li>The mascara doesn&#x27;t flake, and resists smudging, though it isn&#x27;t completely smudge-proof on humid days.  </li>
            <li>I like natural products.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>that I can remove this mascara with water without having to rub some itchy make-up remover against my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>perhaps it is the natural ingredients?</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>Have used it for 2/3 years now and would recommend it to young and old alike.</li>
            <li>Yes, I use mascara on them because I want the wow factor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mascara that gives a natural look.</li>
            <li>Also, it didn&#x27;t dry very fast</li>
            <li>: The packaging is not very exciting or colorful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These ingredients will not affect everyone in the same way due to the unique biological makeup of each person (no pun intended).  </li>
            <li>will definitely be buying this product again and recommend this highly to everyone.</li>
            <li>I love the weight of this mascara, but it&#x27;s not a good product for me.</li>
            <li>I have worn it on at least a dozen different occasions for many hours</li>
            <li>it goes on thick enough, makes lashes look longer and the tube lasts longer than most.  </li>
            <li>It looks very natural, not like I am wearing makeup, which is the look I prefer (especially since I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day).  </li>
            <li>My lashes were extended and the dark black color gave me a smoky almost exotic eye.</li>
            <li>Covergirl has blended synthetic polymers with beeswax and this has made a very waxy, thin mascara that doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot to make nice thick lashes.</li>
            <li>I decided it was hard to live without, since most other mascaras give you length but not volume (ever though they advertise that they do).  </li>
            <li>I have slightly sensitive skin and had no irritation or itching related to using this mascara.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, this product is anything but natural (although the FDA has very low standards for the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; description so a lot of companies are allowed to get away with using this label incorrectly.  </li>
            <li>I love it and am not happy that they are no longer marketing it.</li>
            <li>EWG.org gave this product an overall rating of \\&quot;4\\&quot; on their toxicity scoring (moderate) from 1 being low hazard to 10 being high hazard.  </li>
            <li>Covergirl has made a very natural looking, average mascara with this new Natureluxe Mousse Mascara.</li>
            <li>It lengthens the lashes quite well (although not as well as one can expect with a more expensive and professional mascara from Lancome, Guerlain, or even Cargo.)</li>
            <li>Not the worst looking mascara I&#x27;ve used, but far from the best.</li>
            <li>This mascara goes on clean and has less chemicals that the other mascaras.  </li>
            <li>need to be able to walk away from the bathroom mirror at 8am, ready to face a day with kids of all ages, their parents, other teachers, board members, etc, and still look somewhat fresh - well, not totally bedraggled at least, with raccoon eyes or worse - when I get home after 8pm.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I was totally impressed.</li>
            <li> And one of the greatest characteristics is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all in the brush and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> anyways, very good mascara</li>
            <li> Good product!</li>
            <li> Yuck, it&#x27;s not an attractive look.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a lot to say but if you buy mascara (guy or girl), this is a great one.</li>
            <li> but this was great.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how great it works.  </li>
            <li> but the product itself isn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara, it goes on well, covers well.  </li>
            <li> It seems to lengthen my lashes substantially and gives them great volume.</li>
            <li> It is great for work or a night out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am happy that Covergirl (or the seller) opted to list all of the ingredients for this product.  </li>
            <li> and it helps them to curl I am happy.</li>
            <li> So I am happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that does not clump.  </li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great.</li>
            <li> product is really great though.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this product for me and she looked very nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent mascara  Feels very light to wear  </li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing!</li>
            <li> But It does give me nice, beautiful fluttery eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My eyes look bright.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s good for people allergic to mascara (are there people allergic to mascara?)</li>
            <li> Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when doing that, but the brush seems to be fairly good at minimizing that.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t try to thicken/lengthen, the lashes all stay fairly separate.  </li>
            <li> This mascara stays on fairly well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product iif</li>
            <li> Layering tended to make cakey lashes (not in a good way).  </li>
            <li> This is a good value.</li>
            <li> Looks good on lashes</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick, it separates the lashes quite nicely, and does a great job coating them.  </li>
            <li> Great thing about this mascara is that it won&#x27;t smudge at all, and very easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> This mascara is one of the best I&#x27;ve found--and I&#x27;m pretty picky about my mascara!</li>
            <li> This mascara has a fine brush which is perfect for my very fine lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline Mascara most of my life, but a friend recommended this product and I was happy to find it on the Vine list.  </li>
            <li> the Natureluxe Mousse Mascara goes on nicely, the brush is a good design, and there is no gluppiness.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of mascara but am often disapointed...not so with this product!  </li>
            <li> Love the consistency of this mascara!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Plus, I love the wand!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> This is the best mascara --  goes on smooth, no clumps, easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product as it has great coverage and stay on all day with out smudging.</li>
            <li> This Covergirl Natureluxe Mousse Mascara glides on nicely and stays on without smudging or running.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this mascara because it absolutely does NOT CLUMP.</li>
            <li> I own an eyelash comb, too, but for whatever reason it doesn&#x27;t help, this brush &amp; formula likes to stick together.</li>
            <li> nothing but thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the way this went on, stayed  on and washed off.</li>
            <li> I used to own the waterproof version.</li>
            <li> I got 0 clumps with this mascara and the formula has a nice honey sent to It.</li>
            <li> Even with that kind of staying power, it washes off very easily at the end of the day, and I have not yet had to break out the makeup remover for it.  </li>
            <li> Very natural and wonderful to use!</li>
            <li> Even without soap, it came off very easily, and my eyelashes didn&#x27;t sport that \\&quot;I wore mascara</li>
            <li> It just feels light and right and rather heavenly to have found something I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on and it looks great!</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of the brush and felt the mascara went on very smoothly</li>
            <li> I loved the smooth texture and</li>
            <li> Covergirl had the nice idea to try and make a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; mascara</li>
            <li> water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also impressed with the packaging a nice slim tube rather than the bulky flat tubes that seemed to be the latest marketing trend.</li>
            <li> and It goes on nice and easy.  </li>
            <li> The formula is super light and if you apply it from the roots up, helps achieve great length.</li>
            <li> It stays \\&quot;wet\\&quot; on my eyelashes for probably 15 minutes or more before I can safely let anything brush up against my lashes without leaving mascara marks.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE it -</li>
            <li> so I bought the mascara expecting to be happy, but I&#x27;m really not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one get one 50% off, and I&#x27;m like, okay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a mascara to like, but this one I LOVE.  </li>
            <li> Already purchased 2 more since the freebee on Vine before the price raises up.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would ever love any mascara more than [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This mascara will make you feel especially pretty.</li>
            <li> I could tell that her lashes were longer, darker and more noticeable, but I didn&#x27;t see any clumps on her lashes or smudge marks on her skin.</li>
            <li> I can feel this on my lashes a bit more in comparison.  </li>
            <li> But for the price, this is the next best thing!</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Build on a coat or two more and you have all the length you need, and some volume.</li>
            <li> I would consider this more of a lengthening than a volumizing mascara.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love everything about this mousse mascara.</li>
            <li> I thought the applicator could have been designed better.  </li>
            <li> I look more polished, and my eyes are more emphasized, with this mascara...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed that a mascara this smooth and soft can come from a brand like covergirl.      </li>
            <li> I wish it would have something to grip it better.  </li>
            <li> but there is not an overwhelming body of evidence to give the data a \\&quot;robust\\&quot; score</li>
            <li> but there is not an overwhelming body of evidence to give the data a \\&quot;robust\\&quot; score</li>
            <li> but there is not an overwhelming body of evidence to give the data a \\&quot;robust\\&quot; score</li>
            <li> Have to put on too many layers for it to look like I have any on at all.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not exactly sure what it is about this stuff, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I think I like it better.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this mascara</li>
            <li> I love, love,.love this mascara.</li>
            <li> The color is very nice, it&#x27;s very black, and what I like best about it is how beautifully smooth it goes on.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for anybodies advice!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> I is also very light weight and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> It comes off easy, which could be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it, and does more for length than volume.</li>
            <li> It does not clump, like too many products, but separates and covers lashes easily.</li>
            <li> Of course, for an important outing I would choose something more serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome because it is not hard to wash off and it doesn&#x27;t damage your lashes as much as others.</li>
            <li> I have it in brown, which is light enough for my very fair complexion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It stays all day without running and removal is easy - either with soap and water as you wash your face or with a baby wipe.  </li>
            <li> and it washes off with water easily.</li>
            <li> clumpy&lt;br /&gt;Comes off easily with eye makeup remover</li>
            <li> This was easy to apply without any clumping.</li>
            <li> According to her, the mascara glides on easily without a lot of clumping.</li>
            <li> and yet it washed off easily with soap and</li>
            <li> Goes on easy- no clumping.  </li>
            <li> Easy off.  </li>
            <li> It washes off easily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> But for me I like that it removes easily.</li>
            <li> The fine-bristled brush separates each lash for easy coating with the product.  </li>
            <li> It washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> Functional too, as the wand is easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wears well and cleans off easy.</li>
            <li> The brush is fabulous for grabbing every lash with its spiky bristles and flexible wand, and the formula is so light and smooth!</li>
            <li> Washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this mascara is all natural, but it smears very easily.</li>
            <li> So I like for them to stand out, but my hair &amp; lashes are naturally fine</li>
            <li> I was drawn to it by its \\&quot;clean &amp; green\\&quot; hype, but love it because it is light, lasting, non-smudge, cleans easily with soap and water, and looks great on.</li>
            <li> I love how this mascara really makes the eyes pop out! :)</li>
            <li> it looks and feels like your eye lashes are naturally huge.</li>
            <li> It will not clump and its easy to clean off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> Maybelline Great Lash - Big Mascara]].</li>
            <li> so if you are prone to crying or running about in the rain it might not be the best choice.</li>
            <li> The mousse formula goes on so smoothly and coats every lash.</li>
            <li> Feels light on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it have a review in the cheap trills session of Allure Magazine.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> hope this mascara is available for a very long time!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty picky, and this mascara is great!</li>
            <li> The color is nice, there is no weird smell to it, and the packaging is very pretty.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> pretty sure this is a discontinued item.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara and it sadly is no longer sold in stores around me.</li>
            <li> I have VERY fine eyelashes, and I really need a mascara that will separate them all</li>
            <li> I also LOVE Sally Hansen&#x27;s Natural Beauty Inspired by Carmindy (from TLC&#x27;s What Not To Wear) mascara,I think that&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li> It has more natural ingredients than most mascaras, which I do like.</li>
            <li> Most natural mascara costs way more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the length I like, but with no clumping and quick dry time I will be happy with this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a nice mascara for anyone with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> and this gives me a natural color and nice fullness without the clumps.  </li>
            <li> but this is a good mascara for daily use.</li>
            <li> If you just want a light coating to darken your lashes, this is the right thing for you.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice, light mascara that doesn&#x27;t weight down your lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to say about the &amp;#34;natural ingredients,&amp;#34; or lack thereof, but I love the way the mascara feels-- more comfortable than any other mascara I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> love how it&#x27;s not clumpy, and doesnt&#x27; dry too quickly, so there&#x27;s more time to &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; the look</li>
            <li> That aside, it looked pretty!  </li>
            <li> Light tears didn&#x27;t move it much.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if this mascara is made with some kind of magnetic material, because as soon as I put it on my lashes they all massed together into one big clump.</li>
            <li> I rarely have reactions to makeup, but it happened with this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Covergirl Natureluxe Mousse Mascara is for those who like a natural look--it goes on smooth but light.  </li>
            <li> I like mine to look more natural and not be clumpy.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really looking for length, but volume is good and this mascara provides that.</li>
            <li> I know the in thing is to have very obvious makeup, but I would think that with the popularity of Downton Abbey, natural looking makeup would start becoming popular again.</li>
            <li> &quot; so I can get on with my makeup routine almost right away.    </li>
            <li> Also clumping isn&#x27;t even the right description to what this mascara did to my lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mousse formula which seemed to make it very whipped, smooth and clump free and though I tend to be a huge fan of the   Big brush wand</li>
            <li> Also, Honeybee Gardens, 100% Pure, Tarte, and Lavera are some great legitimately natural choices and everyones lashes and formula preferences are different.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, the bottle is a regular size and easy to fit into a makeup purse.</li>
            <li> Another big plus is that the silicone brush applicator is actually a VERY good one - precise and gentle, I&#x27;ve used other silicone applicators that were terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may not be the most intense mascara ever, but it looks very natural and stays on well.</li>
            <li> It was nice, flexible, does not clump and it lasted all day long without smearing (even when eye-drops were used repeatedly.)</li>
            <li> The occasional pull at the lashes (feeling a loose one and pulling without remembering I was wearing mascara) showed that the mascara was very strongly attached against that kind of motion.  </li>
            <li> Once on and dry, I didn&#x27;t have problems with smearing and it looked nice without a lot of clumping.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely going to repurchase this for a perfect everyday look.</li>
            <li> The top part that the brush is attached to is very round and smooth, and I have trouble getting a good grip on it!  </li>
            <li> My usual brand is the Bare Escentuals Flawless Definition mascara, and I&#x27;d say this is the first drugstore mascara I have found that it&#x27;s a close contender.  </li>
            <li> (no clumps)with a nice true black color.  </li>
            <li> Came in New Condition and original packaging.</li>
            <li> yes - but it takes a bit of effort to make it really consistent all over&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend Gabriel Cosmetics mascara, and I prefer the ZuZu Luxe line mostly for the packaging and slightly different brush.</li>
            <li> I also know that the Cetearyl Alcohol in it can actually cause a dependency on the mascara, leading you to need more of it to achieve the look you want because it can weaken your lashes over time.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different mascaras since the 60&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> I personally like my lashes longer and coated more, as I like a heavier look with my eyeliner.</li>
            <li> A light natural looking mascara.</li>
            <li> It is definitely one of my favorite mascaras</li>
            <li> I was happily satisfied with the extra length plastic/rubber teeth on this wand.  </li>
            <li> Once on, it&#x27;s light as air, never heavy.</li>
            <li> But that minor detail wasn&#x27;t enough to detract a star from an otherwise great mascara.      </li>
            <li> Just because it has Water and Beeswax as the 1st and 2nd ingredients does not make this entirely safe or inert).  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara because my aesthetician who fills my eyelashes,Maya&#x27;s it is the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause problems with them.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara since it first came out and is now no longer carried in the stores where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I tried this for a few days and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can actually make you look as though you have naturally long lashes which is very nice.</li>
            <li> I find it very useful for daily wear when you need your makeup to be quick.</li>
            <li> my eyelashes looked very natural and separated...and full of volume.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much time in the morning to spend on looking fabulous, but I&#x27;m always ready and willing to give a new product a try...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell (it&#x27;s a little strong in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not as fond of the applicator - easy to go on</li>
            <li> Not a bad try for a natural product</li>
            <li> The rubber brush makes it easy to separate the lashes and provide the extra length.</li>
            <li> The length of time it takes to dry on my eyelashes is way more than I</li>
            <li> Rich black pigment, builds without caking, cleans easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned blonde with VERY long eye lashes.</li>
            <li> It gives volume and length but the best part is that it&#x27;s much easier to remove at the end of the day compared to other mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> and if I get a bit too much, just a swipe of the applicator brush again smooths it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very picky about the way my mascara applies.</li>
            <li> The mascara really makes your eyes pop.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It provides length and volume without too much work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very lightweight...</li>
            <li> One coat gives you very natural-looking, but luscious lashes.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t had a problem with it running at all.</li>
            <li> I actually really quite like this mascara.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look longer and thicker than they really</li>
            <li> Most (nearly all) mascara&#x27;s make my eyes burn, itch, water, and get red.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gone back to any kind of makeup I can pick up in any store for several years, but this mascara will change that.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mascara a few days ago....and really liked how it went on my eyelashes....</li>

            <li> : The brush is easy to use--it has many tiny bristles on it that make the mascara easier to put on without getting globs of black liquid sticking lashes</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on clean, doesn&#x27;t clump, and so far has not irritated my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I like it better than every other drugstore brand of mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> , my eyelashes are sooo long, love it, I even got a compliment on the length by a 26 year old</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I subtract one star for minimal smudging on humid days, but am very pleased with this product overall.  </li>
            <li> I give it only four stars because I do prefer my clinique mascara, which goes on a little more smoothly and feels weightless.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup all that frequently, but I&#x27;ve used enough to get a reasonable survey of the available range of mascaras over the years.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone looking to try something new!</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re lucky enough to find it don&#x27;t pass it up (I believe it was mainly marketed at CVS).</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this particular mascara is not waterproof, it&#x27;s not lengthening, curling, or thickening mascara.  </li>
            <li> What i I love that the mascara pigment only gets on the brush and not on the whole brush (being the long thing thats attached to the mascara brush head).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I thought Covergirl would have a little more creativity than that.</li>
            <li> However, there are people who are acutely sensitive to these and other chemical ingredients and it is important to check up on these prior to application and make your own decision on what you want to do.ients will not affect everyone in the same way due to the unique biological makeup of each person (no pun intended).  </li>
            <li> and when I towel off my lashes are soft and supple and ready for reapplying for the day.  </li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t more companies actually make natural products instead of just trying to trick people and advertise their products as such.</li>
            <li> She wears mascara everyday and said that this will be her new mascara that she will buy more when this is gone.  </li>
            <li> I got it in black brown because I wanted something that would look more natural on low-makeup days.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how natural it is or whether it is truly any more natural than other kinds of mascara</li>
            <li> when I wore this, I noticed right away the big difference.</li>
            <li> I expected some goopy mess and each time I have used it there has not been clumping, so the formula is really good.</li>
            <li> This one is on the plus side of the middle of the pack, and pretty decent for its price point.  </li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s so natural, but I need something a little more hard-working.</li>
            <li> this one is nothing new to me.</li>
            <li> I have hard time finding any good mascaras and finally found it.</li>
            <li> : The liquid itself seems to dry quickly once applied.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I naturally have decent eyelashes</li>
            <li> but when I read the ingredients, I saw that this is very far from nature.</li>
            <li> This is a very lightweight mascara that you can barely feel when its on.  </li>
            <li> It lengthens better than other mascaras and when there&#x27;s a coupon, its only five bucks.  </li>
            <li> I went to review CoverGirl Naturelux Mousse Mascara, I first went to EWG.org Skin Deep database and found this product listed.  </li>
            <li> For the sake of brevity, I am listing only those things with a higher \\&quot;moderate\\&quot; score (5-4).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li> I like that natural look and this mascara gives it!</li>
            <li> I solved this fairly early on by painting the top of each cap black and brown, respectively, with nail polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rich, black mascara.</li>
            <li> The brush is hard and the bristles too short to effectively cover and separate lashes.  </li>
            <li> I developed a very itchy red rash all around my eyes and under my eyes since using this product.  </li>
            <li> I assume Covergirl wanted the promote the natural ingredients in the product by giving the bottle a \\&quot;green\\&quot; look, but it ended up looking like something from the seventies instead of from this decade.</li>
            <li> I got excited when I saw it but read the ingredients and it has methylparaben... not cool.</li>
            <li> If you know you&#x27;re sensitive, you may want to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I trashed it early and replaced with Revlon.</li>
            <li> This mascara gives me volume and my lashes stay soft all day.  </li>
            <li> The mascara doesn&#x27;t flake, and resists smudging, though it isn&#x27;t completely smudge-proof on humid days.  </li>
            <li> I like natural products.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> that I can remove this mascara with water without having to rub some itchy make-up remover against my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> perhaps it is the natural ingredients?</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> Have used it for 2/3 years now and would recommend it to young and old alike.</li>
            <li> Yes, I use mascara on them because I want the wow factor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mascara that gives a natural look.</li>
            <li> Also, it didn&#x27;t dry very fast</li>
            <li> : The packaging is not very exciting or colorful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These ingredients will not affect everyone in the same way due to the unique biological makeup of each person (no pun intended).  </li>
            <li> will definitely be buying this product again and recommend this highly to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love the weight of this mascara, but it&#x27;s not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> I have worn it on at least a dozen different occasions for many hours</li>
            <li> it goes on thick enough, makes lashes look longer and the tube lasts longer than most.  </li>
            <li> It looks very natural, not like I am wearing makeup, which is the look I prefer (especially since I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day).  </li>
            <li> My lashes were extended and the dark black color gave me a smoky almost exotic eye.</li>
            <li> Covergirl has blended synthetic polymers with beeswax and this has made a very waxy, thin mascara that doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot to make nice thick lashes.</li>
            <li> I decided it was hard to live without, since most other mascaras give you length but not volume (ever though they advertise that they do).  </li>
            <li> I have slightly sensitive skin and had no irritation or itching related to using this mascara.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, this product is anything but natural (although the FDA has very low standards for the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; description so a lot of companies are allowed to get away with using this label incorrectly.  </li>
            <li> I love it and am not happy that they are no longer marketing it.</li>
            <li> EWG.org gave this product an overall rating of \\&quot;4\\&quot; on their toxicity scoring (moderate) from 1 being low hazard to 10 being high hazard.  </li>
            <li> Covergirl has made a very natural looking, average mascara with this new Natureluxe Mousse Mascara.</li>
            <li> It lengthens the lashes quite well (although not as well as one can expect with a more expensive and professional mascara from Lancome, Guerlain, or even Cargo.)</li>
            <li> Not the worst looking mascara I&#x27;ve used, but far from the best.</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on clean and has less chemicals that the other mascaras.  </li>
            <li> need to be able to walk away from the bathroom mirror at 8am, ready to face a day with kids of all ages, their parents, other teachers, board members, etc, and still look somewhat fresh - well, not totally bedraggled at least, with raccoon eyes or worse - when I get home after 8pm.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it a lot, since it&#x27;s also available in the drugstore, for a lot less money than the Armani and MAC stuff I usually try, but it left big blobs on my eyelashes</li>
            <li> The first time, I tried it on a day when I was really tired and kept unconsciously rubbing my eyes, and got some flaking/dust, but that was a pretty extreme test.  </li>
            <li> I usually use brownish black, and got the very black version to review, but really liked it.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the applicator brush that causes this, but I HATE it.</li>
            <li> I personally know that when I use a product with any alcohol in it my skin gets red, dry, and flaky after I stop using it</li>
            <li> This mascara is for someone who wants to look very natural with just a thin coat on your lashes.</li>
            <li> For reference, I naturally have pale-colored, short-to-average length lashes of average thickness.    </li>
            <li> I like it okay for having less harsh chemicals in this mascara compared to other conventional one, but being switched from Maybelline&#x27;s Falsies Volum</li>
            <li> Due to the thin wax, you don&#x27;t get clumps and it also removes easily.</li>
            <li> I will just stick to my old dependable Revlon mascara which always gives me long, black lashes.</li>
            <li> So I apply this mascara, and it basically looks like I have 5 super thick strands of black hair coming out of my eyelid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to overstate how much I like this mascara.</li>
            <li> It was very sticky and it was hard to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of those mascaras, and any of you ladies who are also blessed with the long lashes will get this</li>
            <li> Does anyone out there know how long an unopened mascara lasts?  </li>
            <li> She reported that her lashes felt natural, not sticky and stiff.</li>
            <li> My other brand of mascara (which is NOT waterproof either) takes only a minute or two to \\&quot;set\\&quot; or \\&quot;dry\\</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara the other day since I couldn&#x27;t find the one I regularly buy.</li>
            <li> I am going to make it my winter mascara to deal with the minor smudging!</li>
            <li> I usually use Almay mascara because my eyes are really sensitive.</li>
            <li> Granted they don&#x27;t usually &#x27;claim&#x27; to be natural</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with mascaras in the past has been the spread of wet liquid onto my upper eyelid once I open my eye, but that didn&#x27;t happen with this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to look like I don&#x27;t have any makeup on, wearing just spf, mascara, and a little lip gloss daily.  </li>
            <li> kinda bad with smudging, but gets better with use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate, too, because I honestly think I&#x27;d really like this formula if the applicator wasn&#x27;t so bad at spreading my lashes apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With mascara commonly used daily, why would this be the 5th ingredient if it is a potential irritant?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I tend to rub my eyes a lot, and I expected the mascara to spread with the rubbing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot in terms of lengthening my lashes, because the mascara is fairly thin, but I am used to mascara</li>
            <li> If you cry or get your eyes wet, yes, you should expect to look like a raccoon.</li>
            <li> The formula is bit wet</li>
            <li> Just by my very slight allergies (with careful tissue dabbing) and going about my daily life I ended up looking like a raccoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I like the brand, but this product is certainly not for me.</li>
            <li> I later bought it in Very Black.</li>
            <li> Other similar mascaras give me a few clumpy lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues with eye irritation, the black is black, and it&#x27;s a standard size/shape tube.  </li>
            <li> It lengthens well but doesn&#x27;t Do much in the volumizing department, so like I said before, this mascara is not for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not old or anything, only in my late 20s, but I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple times because it&#x27;ll just slide out from your fingers.)  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want your lashes weighted down, but be careful you don&#x27;t get your face wet.</li>
            <li> As long as it makes my lashes are a little darker</li>
            <li> It even coats the bottom lashes which other mascaras don&#x27;t do as well.  </li>
            <li> This mascara takes longer to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; on than any other mascara I have owned.    </li>
            <li> And the price is quite comparable to other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Darkens my lashes without trying to add extreme bulk or length</li>
            <li> I have never had any problems with any other Covergirl mascaras...or any other Covergirl cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> For purposes of experimentation, I tried layering a few coats and found that the strength of this product lies in a single coat.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time trying to purchase this product in local stores but found they were out so had to order it online.</li>
            <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t claim to be waterproof, like some mascaras do when they obviously aren&#x27;t.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you look up or down immediately after applying, you have streaks.  </li>
            <li> Typically, ladies usually prefer a line of thick, lush lashes across their eye lids - not 5 huge lashes.</li>
            <li> or I look like I have even less.</li>
            <li> annoyance I had was that I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the tubes of black and brown mascaras without opening them.</li>
            <li> but this is the closest I&#x27;ve ever seen a mascara come, and it&#x27;s half the price.  </li>
            <li> The mousse formula makes it so your lashes don&#x27;t feel all hard and crackly after they dry.</li>
            <li> for the product itself, it was thin and required numerous coats to get just average coverage.  </li>
            <li> Buy if you want dark lashes!</li>
            <li> I guess they put it in a green tube to appear organic.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand looking in the mirror and seeing all my lashes clumped into just a few lines.</li>
            <li> I also began to have trouble with some clumping all over the brush after a couple of months</li>
            <li> I tried to repeat the process few times to see if it achieves the length and volume that Maybelline&#x27;s provided, but couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The mascara is waxy thin and takes a while to build up on your lashes with the tiny comb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too much trouble getting to that point.</li>
            <li> my lashes felt so heavy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> My lashes also feel soft--not at all stiff like some mascaras leave them.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you a dramatic look so if you want giant lashes, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> mascara I usually use is covergirl</li>
            <li> I have tried several expensive mascaras since Cover Girl discontinued this one.  </li>
            <li> usually mascara causes my eyes to itch and water late in the day, however this mascara never once irritated my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to achieve the length provided me using this one.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really hard to.</li>
            <li> The wax makes the mascara thin and this thinness, coupled with the small brush, makes for very little volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this mascara seems to irritate my eyes a tad, but it is not so bad I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily.    </li>
            <li> I had a very hard time to take off Maybelline&#x27;s mascara for that matter, even I used eye make-up remover.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s almost like it disapates into thin air</li>
            <li> The mascara is thin and does not do anything for volume or length of eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so exhausted</li>
            <li> The parabens (Methylparaben, Ethylparaben)are by far the worst.</li>
            <li> the mousse formula gave the mascara an expensive feel without the expensive price.</li>
            <li> Sad to say, it immediately smudges.</li>
            <li> So weird.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mascara while it was on clearance, and I&#x27;m so sad that it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product but I am going through the cosmetics sold on Amazon randomly to check the accuracy of the claims and transparency of listing all ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed with the product in anyway, doesn&#x27;t have nothing</li>
            <li> It runs like crazy.</li>
            <li> I was getting desperate.  </li>
            <li> Too bad this product has been discontinued by Covergirl.  </li>
            <li> but this is just bad.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s discontinued :(...</li>
            <li> I hate it when I can \\&quot;feel\\&quot; the mascara on my eyelashes,</li>
            <li> I hate clumps and looking like I&#x27;m trying to be 20 when I&#x27;m almost 40.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that Covergirl has discontinued their Natureluxe line.  </li>
            <li> Looked awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Too bad this product has been discontinued by Covergirl.  I love it and am not happy that they are no longer marketing it.</li>
            <li> I have found my mascara!  This mascara has a fine brush which is perfect for my very fine lashes.  It even coats the bottom lashes which other mascaras don&#x27;t do as well.  It doesn&#x27;t clump going on and if I get a bit too much, just a swipe of the applicator brush again smooths it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stays all day without running and removal is easy - either with soap and water as you wash your face or with a baby wipe.  I will definitely stay with this mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara takes longer to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; on than any other mascara I have owned.    It stays \\&quot;wet\\&quot; on my eyelashes for probably 15 minutes or more before I can safely let anything brush up against my lashes without leaving mascara marks. This is a problem.  My other brand of mascara (which is NOT waterproof either) takes only a minute or two to \\&quot;set\\&quot; or \\&quot;dry\\&quot; so I can get on with my makeup routine almost right away.    For some reason, this mascara seems to irritate my eyes a tad, but it is not so bad I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily.    Otherwise, it works the way you expect mascara to work- brushes on, darkens lashes, brush helps separate lashes during application- and it washes off with water easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rich, black mascara. I guess they put it in a green tube to appear organic. And that says it all.</li>
            <li> pretty sure this is a discontinued item.  kinda bad with smudging, but gets better with use</li>
            <li> I usually use Almay mascara because my eyes are really sensitive. Most (nearly all) mascara&#x27;s make my eyes burn, itch, water, and get red. This one didn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to put on overall&lt;br /&gt;Nice color&lt;br /&gt;Not clumpy&lt;br /&gt;Comes off easily with eye makeup remover&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Smell (it&#x27;s a little strong in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not as fond of the applicator - easy to go on yes - but it takes a bit of effort to make it really consistent all over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a nice mascara for anyone with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I tried this for a few days and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;BRUSH: The brush is easy to use--it has many tiny bristles on it that make the mascara easier to put on without getting globs of black liquid sticking lashes together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIQUID: The liquid itself seems to dry quickly once applied. My biggest problem with mascaras in the past has been the spread of wet liquid onto my upper eyelid once I open my eye, but that didn&#x27;t happen with this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RUBBING: I tend to rub my eyes a lot, and I expected the mascara to spread with the rubbing. Again, that didn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WASHING: Both my daughter and I washed it off at night in seconds. Even without soap, it came off very easily, and my eyelashes didn&#x27;t sport that \\&quot;I wore mascara last night\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING: The packaging is not very exciting or colorful. I assume Covergirl wanted the promote the natural ingredients in the product by giving the bottle a \\&quot;green\\&quot; look, but it ended up looking like something from the seventies instead of from this decade. I thought Covergirl would have a little more creativity than that. Nevertheless, the bottle is a regular size and easy to fit into a makeup purse.</li>
            <li> This Covergirl Natureluxe Mousse Mascara glides on nicely and stays on without smudging or running. My lashes were extended and the dark black color gave me a smoky almost exotic eye. This was easy to apply without any clumping. I loved the smooth texture and the mousse formula gave the mascara an expensive feel without the expensive price. The rubber brush makes it easy to separate the lashes and provide the extra length. I would recommend this mascara and will definitely purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of mascara but am often disapointed...not so with this product!  I liked the feel of the brush and felt the mascara went on very smoothly (no clumps)with a nice true black color.  I hate it when I can \\&quot;feel\\&quot; the mascara on my eyelashes, but with this, it seemed weightless.  It seemed to do well with humid weather and didn&#x27;t flake off or get that smudgy look under the eyes.  I even slept with it on, forgetting to take it off, and it was still set in place in the morning.  This is my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this mascara because it absolutely does NOT CLUMP. I&#x27;m serious. I expected some goopy mess and each time I have used it there has not been clumping, so the formula is really good. I also have a problem sometimes with the mascara getting on my eyelid, and this one didn&#x27;t do that either. I usually use brownish black, and got the very black version to review, but really liked it. I may switch. I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned blonde with VERY long eye lashes. So I like for them to stand out, but my hair &amp; lashes are naturally fine so I&#x27;m very picky about the way my mascara applies. I recently started using the Covergirl Nature Luxe foundation and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it - so I bought the mascara expecting to be happy, but I&#x27;m really not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those mascaras, and any of you ladies who are also blessed with the long lashes will get this, that clumps all your lashes together. So I apply this mascara, and it basically looks like I have 5 super thick strands of black hair coming out of my eyelid. Typically, ladies usually prefer a line of thick, lush lashes across their eye lids - not 5 huge lashes. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the mascara formula, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the applicator brush that causes this, but I HATE it. I can&#x27;t stand looking in the mirror and seeing all my lashes clumped into just a few lines. I own an eyelash comb, too, but for whatever reason it doesn&#x27;t help, this brush &amp; formula likes to stick together. Yuck, it&#x27;s not an attractive look. It&#x27;s unfortunate, too, because I honestly think I&#x27;d really like this formula if the applicator wasn&#x27;t so bad at spreading my lashes apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip this stuff, go with another brand. (Though I still adore the Nature Luxe foundation!)</li>
            <li> Before I start, I should say that I am a guy and don&#x27;t wear mascara.  However, my associate does wear mascara (not a guy) and she loves it. According to her, the mascara glides on easily without a lot of clumping. The mascara really makes your eyes pop.  Another associate (without prompting) took a look and complimented her on the &#x27;look.&#x27;      She wears mascara everyday and said that this will be her new mascara that she will buy more when this is gone.  There&#x27;s not a lot to say but if you buy mascara (guy or girl), this is a great one.</li>
            <li> A bit leery since I never used a mousse mascara before but this was great. It was nice, flexible, does not clump and it lasted all day long without smearing (even when eye-drops were used repeatedly.) and yet it washed off easily with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also impressed with the packaging a nice slim tube rather than the bulky flat tubes that seemed to be the latest marketing trend. Another big plus is that the silicone brush applicator is actually a VERY good one - precise and gentle, I&#x27;ve used other silicone applicators that were terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this product again and recommend this highly to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love the weight of this mascara, but it&#x27;s not a good product for me. I don&#x27;t have much time in the morning to spend on looking fabulous, but I&#x27;m always ready and willing to give a new product a try...the Natureluxe Mousse Mascara goes on nicely, the brush is a good design, and there is no gluppiness. Sad to say, it immediately smudges. The length of time it takes to dry on my eyelashes is way more than I have.&lt;br /&gt;I need to be able to walk away from the bathroom mirror at 8am, ready to face a day with kids of all ages, their parents, other teachers, board members, etc, and still look somewhat fresh - well, not totally bedraggled at least, with raccoon eyes or worse - when I get home after 8pm.</li>
            <li> I have VERY fine eyelashes, and I really need a mascara that will separate them all or I look like I have even less. I wonder if this mascara is made with some kind of magnetic material, because as soon as I put it on my lashes they all massed together into one big clump. Looked awful. But I tried it out for the day anyway. It runs like crazy. Just by my very slight allergies (with careful tissue dabbing) and going about my daily life I ended up looking like a raccoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara I usually use is covergirl so I like the brand, but this product is certainly not for me. Maybe it&#x27;s good for people allergic to mascara (are there people allergic to mascara?) because it&#x27;s so natural, but I need something a little more hard-working.</li>
            <li> For 20 years I&#x27;ve been wearing makeup on and off.  Never once have I found an un-clumpy mascara.  Even when the marketing says it&#x27;s for lengthening, rather than thickening, they always clump for me.  Maybe this is a fault of my application, but still.  And this Cover Girl is no exception.  I wanted to like it a lot, since it&#x27;s also available in the drugstore, for a lot less money than the Armani and MAC stuff I usually try, but it left big blobs on my eyelashes and I had to wash it off before going out.  If you need the volumizing/clumping aspect, go for it, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> So I brought this at Walgreens, the woman said it&#x27;s buy one get one 50% off, and I&#x27;m like, okay.  I could not believe how great it works.  Never flakes, my eyelashes are sooo long, love it, I even got a compliment on the length by a 26 year old and I&#x27;m 49!  It never runs off your face in the shower, it&#x27;s almost like it disapates into thin air and when I towel off my lashes are soft and supple and ready for reapplying for the day.  I nothing but thrilled with this product.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a mascara to like, but this one I LOVE.  Goes on easy- no clumping.  Easy off.  Will continue to buy this brand again and again!</li>
            <li> I got excited when I saw it but read the ingredients and it has methylparaben... not cool. Why can&#x27;t more companies actually make natural products instead of just trying to trick people and advertise their products as such. Granted they don&#x27;t usually &#x27;claim&#x27; to be natural but they name it &#x27;Natureluxe&#x27; or &#x27;Naturals&#x27; or &#x27;Organics&#x27;, it&#x27;s deceptive and really annoying!!! I recommend Gabriel Cosmetics mascara, and I prefer the ZuZu Luxe line mostly for the packaging and slightly different brush. Also, Honeybee Gardens, 100% Pure, Tarte, and Lavera are some great legitimately natural choices and everyones lashes and formula preferences are different. I also LOVE Sally Hansen&#x27;s Natural Beauty Inspired by Carmindy (from TLC&#x27;s What Not To Wear) mascara,I think that&#x27;s my favorite but it&#x27;s discontinued :(... if you&#x27;re lucky enough to find it don&#x27;t pass it up (I believe it was mainly marketed at CVS).</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim at the grocery store from a glossy advertising kiosk.  I am very disappointed.  The mascara is thin and does not do anything for volume or length of eyelashes.  In addition to this, it also takes time to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; on your lashes after application.  So if you look up or down immediately after applying, you have streaks.  It does not wear well throughout the day and I notice chips under my eyes from it flaking off.  I have discontinued using it and will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I rarely have reactions to makeup, but it happened with this mascara.  If you know you&#x27;re sensitive, you may want to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, it was thin and required numerous coats to get just average coverage.  The brush is hard and the bristles too short to effectively cover and separate lashes.  Not the worst looking mascara I&#x27;ve used, but far from the best.</li>
            <li> I was drawn by the name Naturelux but when I read the ingredients, I saw that this is very far from nature. The parabens (Methylparaben, Ethylparaben)are by far the worst. You can do the research and find that parabens have been linked to cancers, allergic reactions, and altering hormone levels. I also know that the Cetearyl Alcohol in it can actually cause a dependency on the mascara, leading you to need more of it to achieve the look you want because it can weaken your lashes over time. I personally know that when I use a product with any alcohol in it my skin gets red, dry, and flaky after I stop using it and my lashes get breakage from mascaras with it in it. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here the ingredients are for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Beeswax, Cetearyl Alcohol, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Shellac, Ceteareth-20, Glycerin, Tapioca Starch, Alcohol Denat., Lecithin, Ethylparaben, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Ammonium Hydroxide, Sodium Gluconate, Iron Oxides. May Contain: Titanium Dioxide.</li>
            <li> Covergirl had the nice idea to try and make a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; mascara but the product itself isn&#x27;t all that great. The wax makes the mascara thin and this thinness, coupled with the small brush, makes for very little volume. It comes off easy, which could be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it, and does more for length than volume. I also began to have trouble with some clumping all over the brush after a couple of months so I trashed it early and replaced with Revlon. Not a bad try for a natural product but I was unimpressed.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara, it goes on well, covers well.  I really like it.  Doesn&#x27;t clump. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a very lightweight mascara that you can barely feel when its on.  It will not clump and its easy to clean off with soap and water.  It lengthens better than other mascaras and when there&#x27;s a coupon, its only five bucks.  Already purchased 2 more since the freebee on Vine before the price raises up.</li>
            <li> This mascara is one of the best I&#x27;ve found--and I&#x27;m pretty picky about my mascara! It goes on without clumping and definitely makes my lashes look longer. (It doesn&#x27;t make them look thicker, though, which is why it only gets 4 stars.) I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t flake off or leave marks under my eyes. My lashes also feel soft--not at all stiff like some mascaras leave them. It washes off easily at the end of the day. And the price is quite comparable to other mascaras. Overall, it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this mascara is all natural, but it smears very easily. It doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot in terms of lengthening my lashes, because the mascara is fairly thin, but I am used to mascara that is water proof, so when I wore this, I noticed right away the big difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara the other day since I couldn&#x27;t find the one I regularly buy. I use a eyelash curler to curl my lashes before applying the mascara.  This mascara actually straightened my lashes! I think they were actually straighter than they were before I curled them. So weird.  I have never had a mascara do that before.  Anyway, it did not work for me!</li>
            <li> I like it okay for having less harsh chemicals in this mascara compared to other conventional one, but being switched from Maybelline&#x27;s Falsies Volum, it&#x27;s hard to achieve the length provided me using this one. I tried to repeat the process few times to see if it achieves the length and volume that Maybelline&#x27;s provided, but couldn&#x27;t. Great thing about this mascara is that it won&#x27;t smudge at all, and very easy to wash off. I had a very hard time to take off Maybelline&#x27;s mascara for that matter, even I used eye make-up remover.</li>
            <li> I have tried several expensive mascaras since Cover Girl discontinued this one.  I decided it was hard to live without, since most other mascaras give you length but not volume (ever though they advertise that they do).  This mascara gives me volume and my lashes stay soft all day.  I hope Cover Girl will bring this one back.  In the meantime I have just ordered some from Amazon since my local stores do not stock it anymore.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would ever love any mascara more than [[ASIN:B002H5G1OK Maybelline Great Lash - Big Mascara]]. However once I applied this mascara I was totally impressed. It seems to lengthen my lashes substantially and gives them great volume. This is however not a waterproof mascara so if you are prone to crying or running about in the rain it might not be the best choice. But for me I like that it removes easily. This mascara will make you feel especially pretty. Yes put this on and blink! Those are YOUR lashes. Believe it or not. I think you will notice the improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> My wife tried this product for me and she looked very nice. I could tell that her lashes were longer, darker and more noticeable, but I didn&#x27;t see any clumps on her lashes or smudge marks on her skin. She reported that her lashes felt natural, not sticky and stiff. She washed it off with soap and water and there was no residue. Good product! She says she&#x27;s going to make it part of her makeup kit.</li>
            <li> Covergirl has made a very natural looking, average mascara with this new Natureluxe Mousse Mascara. I have tried many different mascaras since the 60&#x27;s and this one is nothing new to me. Covergirl has blended synthetic polymers with beeswax and this has made a very waxy, thin mascara that doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot to make nice thick lashes. The mascara is waxy thin and takes a while to build up on your lashes with the tiny comb. Due to the thin wax, you don&#x27;t get clumps and it also removes easily. This mascara is for someone who wants to look very natural with just a thin coat on your lashes. I personally like my lashes longer and coated more, as I like a heavier look with my eyeliner. I will just stick to my old dependable Revlon mascara which always gives me long, black lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup all that frequently, but I&#x27;ve used enough to get a reasonable survey of the available range of mascaras over the years.  This one is on the plus side of the middle of the pack, and pretty decent for its price point.  For reference, I naturally have pale-colored, short-to-average length lashes of average thickness.    Thickening/Lengthening: It takes a number of strokes, but I can get some moderate thickening and lengthening with this mascara.  There&#x27;s some effect of clumping lashes together (but not actual clumpy mascara) when doing that, but the brush seems to be fairly good at minimizing that.  If I don&#x27;t try to thicken/lengthen, the lashes all stay fairly separate.  I can get better thickening/lengthening with an expensive mascara, but this is 1/2 to 1/3 the price of the ones I&#x27;m thinking of.    Durability: This mascara stays on fairly well.  The first time, I tried it on a day when I was really tired and kept unconsciously rubbing my eyes, and got some flaking/dust, but that was a pretty extreme test.  Since then I haven&#x27;t had that problem.  Light tears didn&#x27;t move it much.  The occasional pull at the lashes (feeling a loose one and pulling without remembering I was wearing mascara) showed that the mascara was very strongly attached against that kind of motion.  Even with that kind of staying power, it washes off very easily at the end of the day, and I have not yet had to break out the makeup remover for it.  I definitely appreciate that aspect.    I&#x27;ve had no issues with eye irritation, the black is black, and it&#x27;s a standard size/shape tube.  I have occasionally poked my eyeball with the brush, but I that&#x27;s just me getting used to the shorter and stiffer rubbery bristles on the brush (I&#x27;m still used to old-school fibrous bristles).  In all, I&#x27;d probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on clean and has less chemicals that the other mascaras.  Because the company reduced number of chemicals, my eyes do not turn blood shot red.   My eyes look bright.It doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, light mascara that doesn&#x27;t weight down your lashes. It has more natural ingredients than most mascaras, which I do like. There is one thing to keep in mind while wearing it: IT IS NOT WATERPROOF. If you cry or get your eyes wet, yes, you should expect to look like a raccoon. At least it doesn&#x27;t claim to be waterproof, like some mascaras do when they obviously aren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product iif you don&#x27;t want your lashes weighted down, but be careful you don&#x27;t get your face wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline Mascara most of my life, but a friend recommended this product and I was happy to find it on the Vine list.  I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now and I&#x27;m a convert.  The fine-bristled brush separates each lash for easy coating with the product.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments for my lashes since I began using Covergirl Natureluxe Mousse Mascara.  It washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> Covergirl Natureluxe Mousse Mascara is for those who like a natural look--it goes on smooth but light.  I like it for those reasons.  For purposes of experimentation, I tried layering a few coats and found that the strength of this product lies in a single coat.  Layering tended to make cakey lashes (not in a good way).  The mascara doesn&#x27;t flake, and resists smudging, though it isn&#x27;t completely smudge-proof on humid days.  I have slightly sensitive skin and had no irritation or itching related to using this mascara.  The color is nice, there is no weird smell to it, and the packaging is very pretty.  Functional too, as the wand is easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I subtract one star for minimal smudging on humid days, but am very pleased with this product overall.  I am going to make it my winter mascara to deal with the minor smudging!</li>
            <li> A light natural looking mascara. Darkens my lashes without trying to add extreme bulk or length</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara --  goes on smooth, no clumps, easy to remove. I can&#x27;t understand why they have discontinued it?????</li>
            <li> If you just want a light coating to darken your lashes, this is the right thing for you.  I like to look like I don&#x27;t have any makeup on, wearing just spf, mascara, and a little lip gloss daily.  This mascara goes on clean, doesn&#x27;t clump, and so far has not irritated my sensitive skin.  I give it only four stars because I do prefer my clinique mascara, which goes on a little more smoothly and feels weightless.  I can feel this on my lashes a bit more in comparison.  But for the price, this is the next best thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing mascara for 25 years and I got my mom hooked on it.  Your lashes are soft...not brittle crusties after drying.  The key for me in mousse.  Maybelline makes a mouse mascara now that I&#x27;m going to try, but I&#x27;m gonna load up here.  I hate clumps and looking like I&#x27;m trying to be 20 when I&#x27;m almost 40.  SOOOO bummed this is discontinued!!!  Does anyone out there know how long an unopened mascara lasts?  I don&#x27;t want to buy 10  or so and have them &amp;#34;go bad&amp;#34;?  Thanks for anybodies advice!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara and it sadly is no longer sold in stores around me. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like clumpy mascara and this gives me a natural color and nice fullness without the clumps.  I also have sensitivity to alot of products and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  Wears well and cleans off easy.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite mascara. It provides length and volume without too much work. It&#x27;s also very lightweight... it looks and feels like your eye lashes are naturally huge. Bring this one back CoverGirl!!</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara while it was on clearance, and I&#x27;m so sad that it&#x27;s discontinued. I got it in black brown because I wanted something that would look more natural on low-makeup days. This mascara is amazing! The mousse formula goes on so smoothly and coats every lash. One coat gives you very natural-looking, but luscious lashes. Build on a coat or two more and you have all the length you need, and some volume. I would consider this more of a lengthening than a volumizing mascara. The brush is fabulous for grabbing every lash with its spiky bristles and flexible wand, and the formula is so light and smooth! I later bought it in Very Black. It is definitely one of my favorite mascaras EVER! I need to stock up before it&#x27;s gone forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One annoyance I had was that I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the tubes of black and brown mascaras without opening them. I solved this fairly early on by painting the top of each cap black and brown, respectively, with nail polish.</li>
            <li> I love it and I think that I have enough to last a life time:) I am so sorry that it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my eyes. Feels light on my eyelashes. Is build-able. Washes off easily. I didn&#x27;t even need to use makeup remover to get it off. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product as it has great coverage and stay on all day with out smudging. I is also very light weight and easy to remove. It is great for work or a night out.</li>
            <li> Love the consistency of this mascara! I love everything about this mousse mascara. Very natural and wonderful to use! Love it!</li>
            <li> I like natural products. Most natural mascara costs way more. This is a good value.</li>
            <li> it goes on thick enough, makes lashes look longer and the tube lasts longer than most.  I had a hard time trying to purchase this product in local stores but found they were out so had to order it online.</li>
            <li> I had hopes for this product, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I thought the applicator could have been designed better.  It tended to hold a lot product, especially at the end.  I always ended up with a big glob at the corner of my eye, even when I tried to wipe it off before applying.  Also, it didn&#x27;t dry very fast so when I blinked I had it on both my upper and lower eyelids, and my eyelashes are short!  Once on and dry, I didn&#x27;t have problems with smearing and it looked nice without a lot of clumping.  It&#x27;s just too much trouble getting to that point.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way this went on, stayed  on and washed off. (I don&#x27;t use eye make-up remover, I use purity made simply). I&#x27;m assuming some of the ease of that has to do with the addition of the beeswax.  It&#x27;s a mousse formula which seemed to make it very whipped, smooth and clump free and though I tend to be a huge fan of the   Big brush wand I was happily satisfied with the extra length plastic/rubber teeth on this wand.  Another plus was the cap on the mascara bottle itself, assuring total freshness when you purchase the product  That aside, it looked pretty!  I really haven&#x27;t had a problem with it running at all. It just feels light and right and rather heavenly to have found something I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on and it looks great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for a couple of weeks now and I have to say that I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. It lengthens the lashes quite well (although not as well as one can expect with a more expensive and professional mascara from Lancome, Guerlain, or even Cargo.) The mascara is relatively clump-free, as well. I find it very useful for daily wear when you need your makeup to be quick. Of course, for an important outing I would choose something more serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers complain that it isn&#x27;t waterproof. For me, that&#x27;s actually a plus. I like it that I can remove this mascara with water without having to rub some itchy make-up remover against my sensitive eyes. I don&#x27;t walk in the rain or cry in my mascara, so I don&#x27;t see why I would need for it to be waterproof. I have worn it on at least a dozen different occasions for many hours and it never smudged even a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how natural it is or whether it is truly any more natural than other kinds of mascara but this is a good mascara for daily use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to overstate how much I like this mascara. I was drawn to it by its \\&quot;clean &amp; green\\&quot; hype, but love it because it is light, lasting, non-smudge, cleans easily with soap and water, and looks great on. It does not clump, like too many products, but separates and covers lashes easily. Once on, it&#x27;s light as air, never heavy. I&#x27;ve had some emotional situations while wearing the mascara, and still it did not smudge. I&#x27;ve been so exhausted I fell asleep without washing it off, and in the morning, no smudging. Terrific product!</li>
            <li> I wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued this formula. It may not be the most intense mascara ever, but it looks very natural and stays on well. Plus, I love the wand!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that Covergirl has discontinued their Natureluxe line.  I don&#x27;t have anything to say about the &amp;#34;natural ingredients,&amp;#34; or lack thereof, but I love the way the mascara feels-- more comfortable than any other mascara I have ever tried.  I have it in brown, which is light enough for my very fair complexion.  It looks very natural, not like I am wearing makeup, which is the look I prefer (especially since I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day).  I look more polished, and my eyes are more emphasized, with this mascara... without looking like I am wearing mascara.  I don&#x27;t know what I will use once I have used up what I have and it is all sold out here.  I wish Covergirl would consider bringing it back.  I know the in thing is to have very obvious makeup, but I would think that with the popularity of Downton Abbey, natural looking makeup would start becoming popular again.</li>
            <li> Excellent mascara  Feels very light to wear  Does not bleed even when you rinse your face  Looks good on lashes</li>
            <li> I actually really quite like this mascara.  In fact, I like it better than every other drugstore brand of mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  Keep in mind that this particular mascara is not waterproof, it&#x27;s not lengthening, curling, or thickening mascara.  (Why people are mentioning these kinds of benefits or lack of them in their review is beyond me - if you want waterproof mascara, BUY A WATERPROOF MASCARA!)      The color is very nice, it&#x27;s very black, and what I like best about it is how beautifully smooth it goes on.  It doesn&#x27;t stick, it separates the lashes quite nicely, and does a great job coating them.  My usual brand is the Bare Escentuals Flawless Definition mascara, and I&#x27;d say this is the first drugstore mascara I have found that it&#x27;s a close contender.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t beat BE (I haven&#x27;t found anything that will) but this is the closest I&#x27;ve ever seen a mascara come, and it&#x27;s half the price.  I haven&#x27;t gone back to any kind of makeup I can pick up in any store for several years, but this mascara will change that.  I&#x27;m very impressed that a mascara this smooth and soft can come from a brand like covergirl.      There was one thing I didn&#x27;t like about it, and that was the tube.  The top part that the brush is attached to is very round and smooth, and I have trouble getting a good grip on it!  (I&#x27;m not old or anything, only in my late 20s, but I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple times because it&#x27;ll just slide out from your fingers.)  I wish it would have something to grip it better.  But that minor detail wasn&#x27;t enough to detract a star from an otherwise great mascara.      Overall, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara a few days ago....and really liked how it went on my eyelashes....my eyelashes looked very natural and separated...and full of volume.  However....I developed a very itchy red rash all around my eyes and under my eyes since using this product.  I have never had any problems with any other Covergirl mascaras...or any other Covergirl cosmetics.  I won&#x27;t be using Natureluxe.  Hopefully my itchy red rash will go away soon!</li>
            <li> Rich black pigment, builds without caking, cleans easily. And one of the greatest characteristics is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product but I am going through the cosmetics sold on Amazon randomly to check the accuracy of the claims and transparency of listing all ingredients.  I believe everyone needs to know what they are putting on and in their bodies, especially the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to review CoverGirl Naturelux Mousse Mascara, I first went to EWG.org Skin Deep database and found this product listed.  I am using the \\&quot;Black\\&quot; color in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that Covergirl (or the seller) opted to list all of the ingredients for this product.  Several products I have reviewed either did not disclose or were deceptive in describing their products contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this product is anything but natural (although the FDA has very low standards for the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; description so a lot of companies are allowed to get away with using this label incorrectly.  Just because it has Water and Beeswax as the 1st and 2nd ingredients does not make this entirely safe or inert).  EWG.org gave this product an overall rating of \\&quot;4\\&quot; on their toxicity scoring (moderate) from 1 being low hazard to 10 being high hazard.  The data on each ingredient is listed with their potential for health hazards and side effects.  Here are some of the concerns with this product.  For the sake of brevity, I am listing only those things with a higher \\&quot;moderate\\&quot; score (5-4).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High concerns:  Multiple additive exposure sources, contamination concerns, irritation (skin, eyes, lungs).  Occupational hazards (in the manufacturing of the product) and persistence and bioaccumulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benzyl alcohol (5) - Potential for allergies/immunotoxicity, organ system toxicity (non-reproductive), Occupational hazards and use restrictions.

It lists this as an irritant for the skin and eyes.  So why would CoverGirl use this as their 3rd ingredient on mascara?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then checked \\&quot;Shellac\\&quot;.  The MSDS sheet lists the following:  \\&quot;Potential chronic health effects- hazardous in case of skin contact (irritant), of eye contact (irritant).\\&quot;  With mascara commonly used daily, why would this be the 5th ingredient if it is a potential irritant?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These ingredients will not affect everyone in the same way due to the unique biological makeup of each person (no pun intended).  However, there are people who are acutely sensitive to these and other chemical ingredients and it is important to check up on these prior to application and make your own decision on what you want to do.ients will not affect everyone in the same way due to the unique biological makeup of each person (no pun intended).

            <li> usually mascara causes my eyes to itch and water late in the day, however this mascara never once irritated my eyes at all. perhaps it is the natural ingredients? anyways, very good mascara and i am upset that they stopped selling it in walgreens/target!!</li>
            <li> Have to put on too many layers for it to look like I have any on at all. Time consuming and product wasting.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it have a review in the cheap trills session of Allure Magazine. I am not impressed with the product in anyway, doesn&#x27;t have nothing WOW</li>
            <li> Have used it for 2/3 years now and would recommend it to young and old alike.</li>
            <li> The formula is super light and if you apply it from the roots up, helps achieve great length. This mascara is awesome because it is not hard to wash off and it doesn&#x27;t damage your lashes as much as others. I recommend this to anyone looking to try something new!</li>
            <li> I am not too picky when it comes to my mascara. As long as it makes my lashes are a little darker and it helps them to curl I am happy. I like mine to look more natural and not be clumpy. This definitely accomplishes that. So I am happy.</li>
            <li> I could NOT find this in any store so I thought I would try Amazon.  And if course they had it! I love this mascara because my aesthetician who fills my eyelashes,Maya&#x27;s it is the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause problems with them. Yes, I use mascara on them because I want the wow factor.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have hard time finding any good mascaras and finally found it. I Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It makes my lashes look longer and thicker than they really are.&lt;br /&gt;I love how it&#x27;s not clumpy, and doesnt&#x27; dry too quickly, so there&#x27;s more time to &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; the look I want.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this mascara is available for a very long time!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty picky, and this mascara is great!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that does not clump.  Goes on smooth.  And does not flake off.  Key for a contact wearer like myself!</li>
            <li> I like that natural look and this mascara gives it! I love how this mascara really makes the eyes pop out! :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. It gives volume and length but the best part is that it&#x27;s much easier to remove at the end of the day compared to other mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I was getting desperate.  Other similar mascaras give me a few clumpy lashes.  This did not.  I don&#x27;t get the length I like, but with no clumping and quick dry time I will be happy with this.  Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara since it first came out and is now no longer carried in the stores where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not exactly sure what it is about this stuff, but I love it. Thankfully I naturally have decent eyelashes so I&#x27;m not really looking for length, but volume is good and this mascara provides that. It&#x27;s all in the brush and this one is the best. Corner lashes can be brushed easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to stockpile this!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This mascara is great. It&#x27;s not goopy and doesnt clump your lashes together. It can actually make you look as though you have naturally long lashes which is very nice. This is my second bottle, and I hope they never stop making it because it&#x27;s the only one I ever want to buy.</li>
            <li> It took me 11 days to get this product. ELEVEN DAYS. Supposedly shipped &amp;#34;priority&amp;#34; USPS. Horrible experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is really great though. The mousse formula makes it so your lashes don&#x27;t feel all hard and crackly after they dry. I used to own the waterproof version. I think I like it better.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this mascara but it&#x27;s really hard to. It was very sticky and it was hard to apply. It claims it&#x27;s suppose to feel lightweight but my lashes felt so heavy. It almost felt like putting tar on my lashes. Also clumping isn&#x27;t even the right description to what this mascara did to my lashes. I&#x27;ve had mascaras that clumped my lashes but this is just bad. I would not suggest it.</li>
            <li> I love, love,.love this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t give you a dramatic look so if you want giant lashes, this is not for you. But It does give me nice, beautiful fluttery eyelashes. It&#x27;s a mascara that gives a natural look. It lengthens well but doesn&#x27;t Do much in the volumizing department, so like I said before, this mascara is not for a dramatic look. The formula is bit wet and It goes on nice and easy.  I got 0 clumps with this mascara and the formula has a nice honey sent to It. I am definitely going to repurchase this for a perfect everyday look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a lash lint all in one mascara. It makes my lashes look thicker. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. Came in New Condition and original packaging. What i I love that the mascara pigment only gets on the brush and not on the whole brush (being the long thing thats attached to the mascara brush head). Buy if you want dark lashes!</li>
