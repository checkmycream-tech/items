            <li>But besides the tangles I love this wig!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I got it exactly one week after I ordered it which i was very happy about.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t damaged in the slightest and everything was nice and neatly packed in when I opened up the packaging.</li>
            <li>It also came with a wig cap which was a really nice gesture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My new wig is great!</li>
            <li>I keep the ponytails braided when she’s not wearing it to keep from tangling, which can happen very easily.</li>
            <li>The color is a good mix and the texture is super silky.</li>
            <li>The wig has a beautiful color and it&#x27;s veeery soft, also, it has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Otherwise okay.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this wig.</li>
            <li>arrived just in time for my costume and the seller made sure of that.</li>
            <li>we love it</li>
            <li>The blue is really awesome.</li>
            <li>The weight is light, which I really liked.</li>
            <li>my favorite Miku wig (I&#x27;ve owned 6).</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t see any of the clip from the top when wearing.</li>
            <li>Oh and to top it all off it</li>
            <li>, it tangles it 2 times more</li>
            <li>It was an okay buy, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but if you can take better care of it than myself i would recommend it.</li>
            <li>This item has gotten five out of five stars from me because of these factors. :)</li>
            <li>and when the pigtails are clipped to almost the top it is almost to my knees.</li>
            <li>your favorite rock star day\\&quot; and so I got this wig.</li>
            <li>Once combed they can become frizzy at the ends, a good solution to defeat this is to go over the frizzy sections with a straightener, but make sure it is not too hot.</li>
            <li>Great color, very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>the wig is just amazing and worth it</li>
            <li>but I was able to smooth out the piggies.</li>
            <li>The top part off the wig is fantastic and didnt tangle at all, but the ponytails do require a bit of work..</li>
            <li>The pigtails are super long, as many others have suggested, when not in use, it is best to keep them braided as they will not tangle.</li>
            <li>The best part is the front is long when you get it, so you can trim the front down to fit your face perfectly.</li>
            <li>Tangles easily at the ends.</li>
            <li>I suggest braiding the pony tails while not in use because they could tangle easily.</li>
            <li>The pigtails were packaged well and clip on easy.</li>
            <li>It gets easily tangled so it can easily be ruined.</li>
            <li>I thought they were really great and fun, and they came in the bag really neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wig is really awesome and holy cow</li>
            <li>It puts together easily with the included wig clips for the pony tails.  </li>
            <li>However, the downside to the length is that it seems to tangle easily.</li>
            <li>Detangles easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t tangle very easily but when it does you can just brush right through it with your fingers.</li>
            <li>The wig came really quickly!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of The Vocaloids and am wanting to reignite my passion for cosplay.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the quality and it seems as though it will last for a while.  </li>
            <li>the clips are really secure</li>
            <li>Overall a great wig.</li>
            <li>We order this for the cosplayer of the family and even ordered a second one just because of how great the wig</li>
            <li>I ordered this wig on December 29th and it came on January 2nd, so it had great shipping time.</li>
            <li>The wig I got before this, which was for Len Kagamine, barely fit me.</li>
            <li>The wig is so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>The wig itself is good by itself, it fits well enough and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s moving on my head like most of my wigs feel like.</li>
            <li>Such vibrant color, a perfect wig for a Miku Hatsune cosplay.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing wig and I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>I am positive that the careful packaging and handling is the reason this wig arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>The bob is also rather long considering, but still great.  </li>
            <li>Easily worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>The color is amazing and it&#x27;s shinny and so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a super cheap wig that would come all tangled and be frizzy.</li>
            <li>You ust need the right detangler!</li>
            <li>Blue]]The wig is great, but as stated in previous reviews, the pigtails are easily tangled.</li>
            <li>my teen loves it.quality is good</li>
            <li>Its a perfect shade of blue and is easily brush-able (although, you should always still be careful).</li>
            <li>I find it the perfect mixture of blue and green in the wig,which is very important when it comes to her wig</li>
            <li>though a charming wig at first, it does tangle very easily, i know this review is late, but i just wanted to point out that this wig does tangle easily.  </li>
            <li>(though part of it became entangled when I was pulling it out, but I managed to get it untangled fairly easily just by gently running my fingers through it repeatedly.  </li>
            <li>The blue is very pretty, mine was more of a green, so if you are a cosplayer, it&#x27;s best to buy this wig first so that you can get the right shade of fabric.</li>
            <li>I ordered this wig for my daughter and it came a lot earlier than we expected, which was great!</li>
            <li>The tangles areNO fun.</li>
            <li>And hours of spare time, but it all comes down to amazing quality!</li>
            <li>Besides that the other 2 pieces are good.</li>
            <li>I did and it came right on the time they said it would.</li>
            <li>My only inconvenience was that the pigtails get tangled very easily, so start brushing from the bottom and put them into braids when not in use.</li>
            <li>The color is spot on and it&#x27;s a very high quality wig!</li>
            <li>Turns out it is so simple and looks stunning with or without the pigtails.</li>
            <li>thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Ok so I ordered this back in October hoping it would come for Halloween</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying anything online and my first time cosplaying</li>
            <li>Pretty color and design.</li>
            <li>sure you braid the pigtails to keep them from tangling further.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s long enough and has great quality to it.</li>
            <li>This would be the first wig for us</li>
            <li>I would recommend this wig to anyone willing to buy it if they need it for a Hatsune Miku cosplay.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly like in the picture.</li>
            <li>;) so it  gets tangled easily if your not careful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll prob buy a second one to do a different hair style for her in the future because it&#x27;s just too perfect and the price is pretty good for such a long wig.</li>
            <li>They attract static and because of how long they are they get caught on things and just tangle.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>long as you braid the ponytails when you&#x27;re not wearing them and make sure that you brush them every 5 minutes when you are, you should have no problem with this wig.</li>
            <li>i use it so much, and it was for my first cosplay!&lt;br /&gt;(Note</li>
            <li>It is pretty much like the description says.  </li>
            <li>the first one got really tangled but was fixable....</li>
            <li>For me the length the was good (just past my knees).</li>
            <li>The pigtails stick on with ease (the ends are giant hairclips that clip on to the bob and are easily adjusted).  </li>
            <li>The pony tails are separate from the wig and attach with large claw clips and seem durable.  </li>
            <li>it was a smart choice.</li>
            <li>The colour is exactly the same as the picture, so I was really surprised the most about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for having what we needed to really bring this caricature to life, for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Will go very well with my costume.  </li>
            <li>it is my real hair.</li>
            <li>, they came really fast.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this so much looks like real hair</li>
            <li>We found that using a hair pick instead of a brush is much easier to get the tangles out.  </li>
            <li>I sewed her costume, and with this wig, it really brought her caricature to life.  </li>
            <li>The wig arrived much faster than listed.</li>
            <li>I am very exited to wear this to Tsubasacon in October.</li>
            <li>For 25 bucks or so, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much.</li>
            <li>And SO MUCH</li>
            <li>We braided the long ponytails to keep them for tangling, added black bows, it really looked great.  </li>
            <li>The long ponytails do tangle easily, so braid them while not in use.  </li>
            <li>like many people say, &amp;#34;oh it wont tangle if you braid it&amp;#34; well it ruins it</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what we expected, and yes, according to previous reviews, with the hair being so long it tended to tangle very easily; however, braiding fixed the situation nicely.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft, very high quality.</li>
            <li>Came on time and is in decent condition too.  </li>
            <li>The ponytails are seperate and clip into the main wig</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>in all, I highly recommend this wig for any Miku cosplayers.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>great wig, however, it is difficult to brush and maintain.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and the blue Ia so pretty!</li>
            <li>Once every thing is like new make</li>
            <li>was very surprised by the quality considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;I\\&quot;m</li>
            <li>came in close to two weeks early!</li>
            <li>but I solved it by running it under hot water to get it back and shape.</li>
            <li>Front not awkward, verry long and can tangle if being used while getting rowdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Got it two weeks early!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They do get messy really easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s REALLY long, and was much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>And I do mean easily!</li>
            <li>have to say, it was pretty tangled when I took it out since it is so long</li>
            <li>and this is by far</li>
            <li>I got in a very timely fashion which is a double plus!</li>
            <li>This wig is so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty long- about to my knees</li>
            <li>But the base is perfect.</li>
            <li>They do seem to tangle quite easily, but that&#x27;s to be expected for a long wig like this.</li>
            <li>I just got into cosplay modeling and Miku was a highly requested character (yes, I actually listen to Vocaloids too).</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B007SJ3BWA ROLECOS Womens Hatsune Miku Ponytail Wig Long Straight Cosplay Hair Wigs</li>
            <li>and it got really tangled, but all long wigs do.</li>
            <li>It is soft and has the shade of blue from the picture.</li>
            <li>It was completely intact and contained the bob, two pigtails and even a hair net (wig cap)!  </li>
            <li>After wearing it for one whole day the pug tales got extremely tangled.</li>
            <li>The longer pieces tangle very easy and are difficult to get out.</li>
            <li>DO  NOT brush it with a real brush, It ruins the wig.</li>

            <li> I thought they were really great and fun, and they came in the bag really neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wig is really awesome and holy cow</li>
            <li> It puts together easily with the included wig clips for the pony tails.  </li>
            <li> However, the downside to the length is that it seems to tangle easily.</li>
            <li> Detangles easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tangle very easily but when it does you can just brush right through it with your fingers.</li>
            <li> The wig came really quickly!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of The Vocaloids and am wanting to reignite my passion for cosplay.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the quality and it seems as though it will last for a while.  </li>
            <li> the clips are really secure</li>
            <li> Overall a great wig.</li>
            <li> We order this for the cosplayer of the family and even ordered a second one just because of how great the wig</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig on December 29th and it came on January 2nd, so it had great shipping time.</li>
            <li> The wig I got before this, which was for Len Kagamine, barely fit me.</li>
            <li> The wig is so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is good by itself, it fits well enough and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s moving on my head like most of my wigs feel like.</li>
            <li> Such vibrant color, a perfect wig for a Miku Hatsune cosplay.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing wig and I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am positive that the careful packaging and handling is the reason this wig arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> The bob is also rather long considering, but still great.  </li>
            <li> Easily worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited.</li>
            <li> The color is amazing and it&#x27;s shinny and so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a super cheap wig that would come all tangled and be frizzy.</li>
            <li> You ust need the right detangler!</li>
            <li> Blue]]The wig is great, but as stated in previous reviews, the pigtails are easily tangled.</li>
            <li> my teen loves it.quality is good</li>
            <li> Its a perfect shade of blue and is easily brush-able (although, you should always still be careful).</li>
            <li> I find it the perfect mixture of blue and green in the wig,which is very important when it comes to her wig</li>
            <li> though a charming wig at first, it does tangle very easily, i know this review is late, but i just wanted to point out that this wig does tangle easily.  </li>
            <li> (though part of it became entangled when I was pulling it out, but I managed to get it untangled fairly easily just by gently running my fingers through it repeatedly.  </li>
            <li> The blue is very pretty, mine was more of a green, so if you are a cosplayer, it&#x27;s best to buy this wig first so that you can get the right shade of fabric.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for my daughter and it came a lot earlier than we expected, which was great!</li>
            <li> The tangles areNO fun.</li>
            <li> And hours of spare time, but it all comes down to amazing quality!</li>
            <li> Besides that the other 2 pieces are good.</li>
            <li> I did and it came right on the time they said it would.</li>
            <li> My only inconvenience was that the pigtails get tangled very easily, so start brushing from the bottom and put them into braids when not in use.</li>
            <li> The color is spot on and it&#x27;s a very high quality wig!</li>
            <li> Turns out it is so simple and looks stunning with or without the pigtails.</li>
            <li> thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Ok so I ordered this back in October hoping it would come for Halloween</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying anything online and my first time cosplaying</li>
            <li> Pretty color and design.</li>
            <li> sure you braid the pigtails to keep them from tangling further.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s long enough and has great quality to it.</li>
            <li> This would be the first wig for us</li>
            <li> I would recommend this wig to anyone willing to buy it if they need it for a Hatsune Miku cosplay.</li>
            <li> The color is exactly like in the picture.</li>
            <li> ;) so it  gets tangled easily if your not careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll prob buy a second one to do a different hair style for her in the future because it&#x27;s just too perfect and the price is pretty good for such a long wig.</li>
            <li> They attract static and because of how long they are they get caught on things and just tangle.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> long as you braid the ponytails when you&#x27;re not wearing them and make sure that you brush them every 5 minutes when you are, you should have no problem with this wig.</li>
            <li> i use it so much, and it was for my first cosplay!&lt;br /&gt;(Note</li>
            <li> It is pretty much like the description says.  </li>
            <li> the first one got really tangled but was fixable....</li>
            <li> For me the length the was good (just past my knees).</li>
            <li> The pigtails stick on with ease (the ends are giant hairclips that clip on to the bob and are easily adjusted).  </li>
            <li> The pony tails are separate from the wig and attach with large claw clips and seem durable.  </li>
            <li> it was a smart choice.</li>
            <li> The colour is exactly the same as the picture, so I was really surprised the most about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for having what we needed to really bring this caricature to life, for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Will go very well with my costume.  </li>
            <li> it is my real hair.</li>
            <li> , they came really fast.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this so much looks like real hair</li>
            <li> We found that using a hair pick instead of a brush is much easier to get the tangles out.  </li>
            <li> I sewed her costume, and with this wig, it really brought her caricature to life.  </li>
            <li> The wig arrived much faster than listed.</li>
            <li> I am very exited to wear this to Tsubasacon in October.</li>
            <li> For 25 bucks or so, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much.</li>
            <li> And SO MUCH</li>
            <li> We braided the long ponytails to keep them for tangling, added black bows, it really looked great.  </li>
            <li> The long ponytails do tangle easily, so braid them while not in use.  </li>
            <li> like many people say, &amp;#34;oh it wont tangle if you braid it&amp;#34; well it ruins it</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what we expected, and yes, according to previous reviews, with the hair being so long it tended to tangle very easily; however, braiding fixed the situation nicely.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft, very high quality.</li>
            <li> Came on time and is in decent condition too.  </li>
            <li> The ponytails are seperate and clip into the main wig</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> in all, I highly recommend this wig for any Miku cosplayers.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> great wig, however, it is difficult to brush and maintain.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft and the blue Ia so pretty!</li>
            <li> Once every thing is like new make</li>
            <li> was very surprised by the quality considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;I\\&quot;m</li>
            <li> came in close to two weeks early!</li>
            <li> but I solved it by running it under hot water to get it back and shape.</li>
            <li> Front not awkward, verry long and can tangle if being used while getting rowdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Got it two weeks early!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They do get messy really easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s REALLY long, and was much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> And I do mean easily!</li>
            <li> have to say, it was pretty tangled when I took it out since it is so long</li>
            <li> and this is by far</li>
            <li> I got in a very timely fashion which is a double plus!</li>
            <li> This wig is so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty long- about to my knees</li>
            <li> But the base is perfect.</li>
            <li> They do seem to tangle quite easily, but that&#x27;s to be expected for a long wig like this.</li>
            <li> I just got into cosplay modeling and Miku was a highly requested character (yes, I actually listen to Vocaloids too).</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B007SJ3BWA ROLECOS Womens Hatsune Miku Ponytail Wig Long Straight Cosplay Hair Wigs</li>
            <li> and it got really tangled, but all long wigs do.</li>
            <li> It is soft and has the shade of blue from the picture.</li>
            <li> It was completely intact and contained the bob, two pigtails and even a hair net (wig cap)!  </li>
            <li> After wearing it for one whole day the pug tales got extremely tangled.</li>
            <li> The longer pieces tangle very easy and are difficult to get out.</li>
            <li> DO  NOT brush it with a real brush, It ruins the wig.</li>
            <li> This was nothing less than a synthetic high dollar wig, I would recommend all day long.</li>
            <li> It is really long, too.  </li>
            <li> , obviously it&#x27;s long (almost to my knees</li>
            <li> Any wig this long would.</li>
            <li> The wig is really long but can be cut if needed.</li>
            <li> For me, they aren&#x27;t too heavy but one pigtail has an odd knot in it like a ripped stocking that I have been battling but at least the hair doesn&#x27;t rip out easily.</li>
            <li> The only thing was that one of the ponytails was thicker than the other one and the bangs were a little short, but it&#x27;s not big deal.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so long!</li>
            <li> However, the bob slowly would pull back and show the wig cap if you&#x27;re not careful enough and the pigtails tangle and friz</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a single father with all girls</li>
            <li> A big mess.</li>
            <li> But I kept running my fingers through it all the same so that we could keep the mess at a minimum.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest using a brush because brushes and combs to pull some hair out (but not much).</li>
            <li> I ordered satin PJs and it seems to be helping some with the tangling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not very used to them yet either, but I&#x27;ve only had them for a few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it is hard for me to work with female oriented items.</li>
            <li> The wig&#x27;s pony tails clip on and go down to my knees</li>
            <li> At 5&#x27;9 the pigtails go down to her knees and the wig even fits her head.</li>
            <li> Used this for my Miku cosplay for Dragon-Con down in Georgia.</li>
            <li> We received this wig a month and a half after ordering, hoping it would come around Christmas, but came a couple of weeks after.  </li>
            <li> But from what I&#x27;ve seen at cons, this is typical of these wigs.</li>
            <li> By the end of the weekend, it was a frazzled mess.</li>
            <li> You do this a little bit and you&#x27;ve got a fried mess that can&#x27;t be flattened or straightened out.</li>
            <li> so I was a little nervous.</li>
            <li> They even get messy from rubbing on your clothes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and the pigtails were down past my knees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4 and the pigtails go a little past my knees how i wanted it too.</li>
            <li> The front of the wig is not weird or awkward at all!</li>
            <li> When I got it the bangs were to my chin as usual.</li>
            <li> The base fits well and is really thick, so you definitely don&#x27;t see any net through it.</li>
            <li> so it takes at least a month so order ahead of time before you need it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how the base wig holds up after a shoot, but so far wearing it out people thing</li>
            <li> I suggest to get some detangler spray and a wide toothed comb and start working from the ends to the base of the pig tails.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much cutting, though.</li>
            <li> if not, it may end up worse than when you started!!)</li>
            <li> For me it was just about impossible to avoid this.</li>
            <li> Of course there is a base wig and there are two clip on pigtails.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Tangles easily at the ends. A big mess. Otherwise okay.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it came about 5 or six days after. Its a perfect shade of blue and is easily brush-able (although, you should always still be careful). The wig&#x27;s pony tails clip on and go down to my knees (im about 5 feet tall). I suggest braiding the pony tails while not in use because they could tangle easily. Great buy. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Got here before the date they said it would arrive. Great color, very silky and smooth. I love it.</li>
            <li> my teen loves it.quality is good</li>
            <li> I love this wig. It comes with a wig cap net. The color is pretty and was perfect for my hatsune cosplay. For me the length the was good (just past my knees). I&#x27;m about 5&#x27;1.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived just in time for my costume and the seller made sure of that.After wearing it for one whole day the pug tales got extremely tangled. For me it was just about impossible to avoid this. They attract static and because of how long they are they get caught on things and just tangle.&lt;br /&gt;But the wig is just amazing and worth it</li>
            <li> It is soft and has the shade of blue from the picture. My only inconvenience was that the pigtails get tangled very easily, so start brushing from the bottom and put them into braids when not in use.</li>
            <li> Came on time and is in decent condition too.  I&#x27;d recommend it for future wig replacements and will be buying another once I need it.</li>
            <li> I ordered my wig on the 18th of September and worried that it would not come in time for Halloween as the estimated shipping was from the 15th of Oct. to the 31st.  However, it came on the 3rd of Oct.!  Great shipping time!  It was completely intact and contained the bob, two pigtails and even a hair net (wig cap)!  It is really long, too.  Goes just below my knees (I&#x27;m 5ft).  The bob is also rather long considering, but still great.  The wig was not tangled when I got it (though part of it became entangled when I was pulling it out, but I managed to get it untangled fairly easily just by gently running my fingers through it repeatedly.  The pigtails stick on with ease (the ends are giant hairclips that clip on to the bob and are easily adjusted).  Good quality wig, too.  Will go very well with my costume.  Easily worth it!</li>
            <li> I find it the perfect mixture of blue and green in the wig,which is very important when it comes to her wig</li>
            <li> I just got into cosplay modeling and Miku was a highly requested character (yes, I actually listen to Vocaloids too). I was nervous about ordering it because I have never owned a wig with pig tail attachments. Turns out it is so simple and looks stunning with or without the pigtails. I can&#x27;t say how the base wig holds up after a shoot, but so far wearing it out people thing it is my real hair. The pigtails were packaged well and clip on easy. For me, they aren&#x27;t too heavy but one pigtail has an odd knot in it like a ripped stocking that I have been battling but at least the hair doesn&#x27;t rip out easily. I just keep them braided when not in use now. Over all, if you know how to handle a wig this is a great wig and the color is beautiful. It was also delivered on time which is always a plus!</li>
            <li> ITS amazing! we love it, We will buy another style soon!! now Hatsune Miku is at home!! thank you so much!</li>
            <li> The wig itself is good by itself, it fits well enough and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s moving on my head like most of my wigs feel like. The best parts are the ponytails though. They&#x27;re very soft, very high quality. They do seem to tangle quite easily, but that&#x27;s to be expected for a long wig like this. The colour is exactly the same as the picture, so I was really surprised the most about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So long as you braid the ponytails when you&#x27;re not wearing them and make sure that you brush them every 5 minutes when you are, you should have no problem with this wig.</li>
            <li> great wig, however, it is difficult to brush and maintain.  It gets easily tangled so it can easily be ruined.</li>
            <li> Daughter purchased this for cosplay costume.  The material is like a stretchy synthetic material.  When you brush it out it stretches and then it springs back into a curl.  You do this a little bit and you&#x27;ve got a fried mess that can&#x27;t be flattened or straightened out.</li>
            <li> I thought they were really great and fun, and they came in the bag really neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do get messy really easy. They even get messy from rubbing on your clothes&lt;br /&gt;so I ordered satin PJs and it seems to be helping some with the tangling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not very used to them yet either, but I&#x27;ve only had them for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, they came really fast. The blue is really awesome.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this so much looks like real hair</li>
            <li> I love this wig!! i use it so much, and it was for my first cosplay!&lt;br /&gt;(Note of advice. when detangling, ALWAYS use detangling hairspray and a comb. if not, it may end up worse than when you started!!)</li>
            <li> Ok so I ordered this back in October hoping it would come for Halloween but it didn&#x27;t... This was my first time buying anything online and my first time cosplaying so I was a little nervous. I had just a had birthday pass so I used my birthday money to buy this since I&#x27;m practically known as Miku in my school and a friend and I were gonna do this thing for the school talent show as Miku and Luka.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, it was pretty tangled when I took it out since it is so long but I was able to smooth out the piggies. The pigtails are clips, too. The weight is light, which I really liked. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and the pigtails were down past my knees. The color is also spot on Miku&#x27;s color! However, the bob slowly would pull back and show the wig cap if you&#x27;re not careful enough and the pigtails tangle and friz so easily.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend this wig for any Miku cosplayers.</li>
            <li> I bought this for Halloween and I will definitely be using for AX this year. The blue is very pretty, mine was more of a green, so if you are a cosplayer, it&#x27;s best to buy this wig first so that you can get the right shade of fabric. The top part off the wig is fantastic and didnt tangle at all, but the ponytails do require a bit of work.. The weight is nice and the shipping time was great! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for my daughter and it came a lot earlier than we expected, which was great! It’s perfect and my daughter just loves it! I am positive that the careful packaging and handling is the reason this wig arrived in excellent condition. I keep the ponytails braided when she’s not wearing it to keep from tangling, which can happen very easily. It’s great for the price! I recommend this wig.</li>
            <li> This came in the mail in 4 days. I was so excited. Very good quality. But the only problem is the tangles. DO  NOT brush it with a real brush, It ruins the wig. But besides the tangles I love this wig!</li>
            <li> This made my neice very happy. Beautiful color, no tangles, great price. The ponytails are seperate and clip into the main wig so it looks great and is comfy to wear. Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and long and beautiful. Awesome quality, would buy again.</li>
            <li> We received this wig a month and a half after ordering, hoping it would come around Christmas, but came a couple of weeks after.  It is pretty much like the description says.  I was happy with the quality and it seems as though it will last for a while.  The long ponytails do tangle easily, so braid them while not in use.  We found that using a hair pick instead of a brush is much easier to get the tangles out.  The hair net works well under the wig.  The pony tails are separate from the wig and attach with large claw clips and seem durable.  Affordable, yet quality; would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cosplaying for close to a decade and this is by far my favorite Miku wig (I&#x27;ve owned 6). The color is a good mix and the texture is super silky. The base fits well and is really thick, so you definitely don&#x27;t see any net through it. the clips are really secure and you don&#x27;t see any of the clip from the top when wearing. Overall a great wig. The best part is the front is long when you get it, so you can trim the front down to fit your face perfectly. Oh and to top it all off it came in close to two weeks early!</li>
            <li> One of the side hair clips was tangeled but I solved it by running it under hot water to get it back and shape. Besides that the other 2 pieces are good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig for my daughter. She was Miku Hatsune for Halloween. I sewed her costume, and with this wig, it really brought her caricature to life.  We braided the long ponytails to keep them for tangling, added black bows, it really looked great.  Thanks for having what we needed to really bring this caricature to life, for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My new wig is great! It&#x27;s really soft and the blue Ia so pretty! But I would recommend styling it yourself. The only problem is that it tangles a bit but use silicone lubricant spray for that.</li>
            <li> Front not awkward, verry long and can tangle if being used while getting rowdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this wig, it fits great, very good quality, obviously it&#x27;s long (almost to my knees I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34;) so it  gets tangled easily if your not careful. Overall I would definitely recommend this wig if its your style. The front of the wig is not weird or awkward at all!</li>
            <li> This wig is awesome.  Great quality.  Love it!</li>
            <li> though a charming wig at first, it does tangle very easily, i know this review is late, but i just wanted to point out that this wig does tangle easily.  DO NOT BRAID IT! like many people say, &amp;#34;oh it wont tangle if you braid it&amp;#34; well it ruins it, it tangles it 2 times more then it would have been without braiding it. I ended up throwing the pigtails away. But the base is perfect. It was an okay buy, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but if you can take better care of it than myself i would recommend it. I hope this helped.</li>
            <li> The wig arrived much faster than listed. Pretty color and design. The longer pieces tangle very easy and are difficult to get out. I&#x27;m a single father with all girls so it is hard for me to work with female oriented items. The tangles areNO fun.</li>
            <li> Hair tangles! Any wig this long would. I suggest to get some detangler spray and a wide toothed comb and start working from the ends to the base of the pig tails. Once combed they can become frizzy at the ends, a good solution to defeat this is to go over the frizzy sections with a straightener, but make sure it is not too hot. Once every thing is like new make sure you braid the pigtails to keep them from tangling further. Hope this helps! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B007SJ3BWA ROLECOS Womens Hatsune Miku Ponytail Wig Long Straight Cosplay Hair Wigs Blue]]The wig is great, but as stated in previous reviews, the pigtails are easily tangled. And I do mean easily! But from what I&#x27;ve seen at cons, this is typical of these wigs. By the end of the weekend, it was a frazzled mess. But I kept running my fingers through it all the same so that we could keep the mess at a minimum.</li>
            <li> Not only is the color spot on to Hatsune Miku&#x27;s hair but it&#x27;s long enough and has great quality to it. I&#x27;ll prob buy a second one to do a different hair style for her in the future because it&#x27;s just too perfect and the price is pretty good for such a long wig. Keep in mind this is coming from china so it takes at least a month so order ahead of time before you need it. I did and it came right on the time they said it would.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of The Vocaloids and am wanting to reignite my passion for cosplay. As a request from a wonderful friend, I chose to be Hatsune Miku. I was reluctant at first to purchase a wig, but I trust Amazon and have not had issues in the past so I decided to take my chances... and it paid off well! The wig is just as beautiful in the photo as it is on arrival.I got in a very timely fashion which is a double plus! Such weight! Such vibrant color, a perfect wig for a Miku Hatsune cosplay. I cannot wait to dress up as this vocaloid and surprise my friend! The pigtails are super long, as many others have suggested, when not in use, it is best to keep them braided as they will not tangle. I hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> The wig came really quickly! It had NO tangles when it arrived! It&#x27;s REALLY long, and was much better than I expected. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it at a con! Great buy!!</li>
            <li> We order this for the cosplayer of the family and even ordered a second one just because of how great the wig was(And the first one got really tangled but was fixable....Still fixing). At 5&#x27;9 the pigtails go down to her knees and the wig even fits her head. It gets tangled so I would suggest keeping them in braids and having ties around them when in use to prevent that. The color is amazing and it&#x27;s shinny and so smooth and soft. This would be the first wig for us it was a smart choice.</li>
            <li> Used this for my Miku cosplay for Dragon-Con down in Georgia.I wore it once before and it got really tangled, but all long wigs do. You ust need the right detangler! And hours of spare time, but it all comes down to amazing quality!</li>
            <li> Shipping was great. The wig has a beautiful color and it&#x27;s veeery soft, also, it has a nice smell. The only thing was that one of the ponytails was thicker than the other one and the bangs were a little short, but it&#x27;s not big deal. The wig is really awesome and holy cow it&#x27;s so long!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this wig to anyone willing to buy it if they need it for a Hatsune Miku cosplay. I got mine well before the estimated delivery date and it came in perfect condition. It wasn&#x27;t damaged in the slightest and everything was nice and neatly packed in when I opened up the packaging. This item has gotten five out of five stars from me because of these factors. :)</li>
            <li> My daugther has gotten several uses from this wig.  It puts together easily with the included wig clips for the pony tails.  My only issue with it, is that it sheds a lot.  I find the strands everywhere in the house and in the car.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig on December 29th and it came on January 2nd, so it had great shipping time. When I tried on the wig, I was ecstatic! This wig is so incredibly soft. It&#x27;s also pretty long- about to my knees and I&#x27;m fairly tall. However, the downside to the length is that it seems to tangle easily. If you braid your wig after use, it definitely helps to prevent tangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot wait to wear this to an upcoming convention!</li>
            <li> This is a great wig. It is the third cosplay wig I got. I got it exactly one week after I ordered it which i was very happy about. The color is exactly like in the picture. Of course there is a base wig and there are two clip on pigtails. It doesn&#x27;t tangle very easily but when it does you can just brush right through it with your fingers. I don&#x27;t suggest using a brush because brushes and combs to pull some hair out (but not much). I am five feet tall and when the pigtails are clipped to almost the top it is almost to my knees. The base wig fits me great and I have a big head which is sometimes a problem. The wig I got before this, which was for Len Kagamine, barely fit me. When I got it the bangs were to my chin as usual. It doesn&#x27;t take much cutting, though. I am very exited to wear this to Tsubasacon in October. My cosplay group and I are doing Vocaloid Matryoshka (we are all going to wear hoodies). This is an amazing wig and I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I couldnt believe the quality on this, A+! This was nothing less than a synthetic high dollar wig, I would recommend all day long. I was very impressed!!</li>
            <li> Although the shipping date stated 3-4 weeks, we received the package in only one week.  The product was exactly what we expected, and yes, according to previous reviews, with the hair being so long it tended to tangle very easily; however, braiding fixed the situation nicely.  Along with the costume, my daughter cannot wait to wear this outfit out in Shibuya next week!</li>
            <li> The color is spot on and it&#x27;s a very high quality wig! I ordered this two weeks ago and it was supposed to get here in about a month total. Got it two weeks early! It also came with a wig cap which was a really nice gesture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality&lt;br /&gt;Great color&lt;br /&gt;Great shipping time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely buying my wigs from here again!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a super cheap wig that would come all tangled and be frizzy. For 25 bucks or so, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much. But wow!&lt;br /&gt;The color is beautiful. It came packaged great and when I opened it, there weren&#x27;t any tangles. Fits on perfectly. Detangles easily. And SO MUCH HAIR!&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised by the quality considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;I\\&quot;m working as a drama director for Christian Youth Theater camp this summer and every day has a theme (i.e. team spirit day, beach day, etc...) One of the days is \\&quot;dress like your favorite rock star day\\&quot; and so I got this wig. Hopefully it&#x27;ll last through five weeks of camp!</li>
            <li> Excellent wig for dressing up as Hatsune Miku. My granddaughter loved it. The wig is really long but can be cut if needed.</li>
            <li> Just ordered my wig last week and already received it. The wig is so smooth and silky. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4 and the pigtails go a little past my knees how i wanted it too. I would definatley recommend this wig for any fan of miku.</li>
            <li> This is a very good wig and the ponytails stay on great :D</li>
