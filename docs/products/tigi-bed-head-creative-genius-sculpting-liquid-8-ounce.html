            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product that I&#x27;ve purchased from beauticians with great success for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this product; but delivery packaging was awful!!&lt;br /&gt;It was wrapped in a plastic bag and the top was loose.&lt;br /&gt;Thus</li>
            <li>&gt; love it when wearing my hair in a pony</li>

            <li>Have used this product for many years I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t satisfied with this gel try a wax and a spray, I like to use the Toni and guy &amp;#34;stick</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite hair product.  </li>
            <li>Very sticky, but great hold.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it helps me create any style I want to sport</li>
            <li>Love this TIGI Sculpting GEL....used it for years and this size bottle lasts forever....</li>
            <li>I love this gel.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s not sticky  </li>
            <li>hard(ish) drying gel that works great on shorter hair and looks very natural after it drys and you comb through.</li>
            <li>and I think this is the a great thing for us that prefer that natural look.</li>
            <li>Sent very quickly.</li>
            <li>This product was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The design of the bottle allowed  easy application</li>
            <li>Holds strong all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit sticky at first, but dries nicely.  </li>
            <li>I like the product, works well for holding fine curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is nice for getting a somewhat strong hold, depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li>Cool design but not user friendly!</li>
            <li>Thank you for having it available for me.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use on short hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great for short hair, which is what he has.  </li>
            <li>Have used it for years, but no longer available</li>
            <li>The first time I purchased it at Ulta, but when I returned for more learned they no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li>By far the best of the various hair products I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li>The price was so good compared to what I pay in the store, but if that much of it is spilled, I&#x27;m not saving much.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever used on my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It is my  favorite product for straight hair with no body.</li>
            <li>But overall, good product.</li>
            <li>Have tried many other products and this is definitely the best for me.  </li>
            <li>You have to fit a tab exactly in the slot.  </li>
            <li>Best for someone with fairly short hair who wants to sculpt it and style it in different ways.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re someone who has short hair and wants to experiment with styling their hair in different ways, this gel just might be your best friend.</li>
            <li>I have also used it years ago when I, too, had short hair, and I also liked it.  </li>
            <li>It has the right hold for me</li>
            <li>It was a great deal at two for 20-something bucks, not really sure since it was over a year ago.  </li>
            <li>The tip comes all the way off, and isn&#x27;t super easy to put back on.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and could not find in in any of my local stores.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It shapes my hair and makes it look better than it actually is.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different hair gels.  </li>
            <li>This was my second time buying TIGI Creative Genius.  </li>
            <li>Currently ive got my head shaved on the sides with a #1 clipper and then the top of my head is about 2-2.5 inches.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered and needed.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery !</li>
            <li>Light weight and soft.  </li>
            <li>Just love what this product for my short hair style.</li>
            <li>One bottle usually lasts me about 6 months since I only use a quarter-sized portion, and I was so glad to find a good deal here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and loved the fact that this never felt sticky and only needed as small amount .  </li>
            <li>Just enough stiffness and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>The only gel that keeps my fine</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I like to use on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you need a little extra body&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>and it really makes it shine.  </li>
            <li>Holds very well</li>
            <li>It holds very well</li>
            <li>Really thickens well.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s very miner.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>It will make your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; if you use too much though.  </li>
            <li>I sound old, but am just so young inside</li>
            <li>Really holds your style &amp; easy to blow dry my hair with it.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s exactly the same product I used to be able to get locally.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and it doesn&#x27;t leave flaking or residue like some of the other gels!</li>
            <li>If you want a gel type hold or even just a little extra body, this is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>was excited to find it on Amazon and will continue to order it as long as I can.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is not how the product is normally made.</li>
            <li>this packaging is REALLY not user friendly.  </li>
            <li>new bottle.  </li>
            <li>I think the product was very old.  </li>
            <li>My gel was delivered the first of August and the small cap on top was taped solidly in place.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s fragrance free, a little goes a long way, and it contains little gold flecks that give hair a special glow.</li>
            <li>bifocals - imagine trying to get that little thing back in the hole on the top without glasses on - ahhh not happening.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, nor too light.</li>
            <li>It holds, looks natural (if you want it to) and doesn&#x27;t flake or gum.</li>
            <li>I keep my hair rather short and don&#x27;t spend much time on it, a dab of this stuff, pluck, tug, separate and I&#x27;ve got a fashion statement.</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff for many years as a little goes a long way and will hold all day.  </li>
            <li>The bottle from Amazon however was so stiff, that when I used it the first time it exploded with just a gentle squeeze.  </li>
            <li>It goes on wet and dries quickly to keep my short spiky hair in place.  </li>
            <li>For traveling I use another small travel container with a wide screw on top.  </li>
            <li>Love this for thin hair been using it 5 or 6 years and couldn&#x27;t find it ordered it Thursday or Friday and got it on Monday</li>
            <li>I live in a climate that&#x27;s dry in summer and moist in winter, and 98 percent of the days are good-hair days because of this product.</li>
            <li>I have short hair with a little natural curl, it&#x27;s also fine with little body.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was about 1/4 down as that much had leaked into the baggie it was put in.</li>
            <li>One downside: be aware that this gel has tiny little sparkly particulates, almost like glitter, in it.</li>
            <li>I like the product, a little stiffer if you use too much....</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s great if you need a little extra body&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> and it really makes it shine.  </li>
            <li> Holds very well</li>
            <li> It holds very well</li>
            <li> Really thickens well.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s very miner.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> It will make your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; if you use too much though.  </li>
            <li> I sound old, but am just so young inside</li>
            <li> Really holds your style &amp; easy to blow dry my hair with it.</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s exactly the same product I used to be able to get locally.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it doesn&#x27;t leave flaking or residue like some of the other gels!</li>
            <li> If you want a gel type hold or even just a little extra body, this is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> was excited to find it on Amazon and will continue to order it as long as I can.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is not how the product is normally made.</li>
            <li> this packaging is REALLY not user friendly.  </li>
            <li> new bottle.  </li>
            <li> I think the product was very old.  </li>
            <li> My gel was delivered the first of August and the small cap on top was taped solidly in place.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s fragrance free, a little goes a long way, and it contains little gold flecks that give hair a special glow.</li>
            <li> bifocals - imagine trying to get that little thing back in the hole on the top without glasses on - ahhh not happening.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, nor too light.</li>
            <li> It holds, looks natural (if you want it to) and doesn&#x27;t flake or gum.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair rather short and don&#x27;t spend much time on it, a dab of this stuff, pluck, tug, separate and I&#x27;ve got a fashion statement.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for many years as a little goes a long way and will hold all day.  </li>
            <li> The bottle from Amazon however was so stiff, that when I used it the first time it exploded with just a gentle squeeze.  </li>
            <li> It goes on wet and dries quickly to keep my short spiky hair in place.  </li>
            <li> For traveling I use another small travel container with a wide screw on top.  </li>
            <li> Love this for thin hair been using it 5 or 6 years and couldn&#x27;t find it ordered it Thursday or Friday and got it on Monday</li>
            <li> I live in a climate that&#x27;s dry in summer and moist in winter, and 98 percent of the days are good-hair days because of this product.</li>
            <li> I have short hair with a little natural curl, it&#x27;s also fine with little body.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was about 1/4 down as that much had leaked into the baggie it was put in.</li>
            <li> One downside: be aware that this gel has tiny little sparkly particulates, almost like glitter, in it.</li>
            <li> I like the product, a little stiffer if you use too much....</li>
            <li> I really like the Creative Genius, but was so disappointed with the way it was packaged.</li>
            <li> The bottle is rather stiff, and with the first bottle I had to store it upside down to use the last couple of ounces.  </li>
            <li> Style lasts all day, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stiff but very natural, brings out the curl too.</li>
            <li> Holds firm without sacrificing natural look.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with long hair though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a long time.</li>
            <li> but my hair remains soft; not sticky, stiff or glued-down.  </li>
            <li> This gel is not too stiff nor is it so soft it doesn&#x27;t hold.  </li>
            <li> Works well to blow dry curly hair with the product in.</li>
            <li> If you want a softer look, just brush it after it&#x27;s dry and your hair will stay in place until you wash it.</li>
            <li> Decent hold, but not super firm or hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With dark brown hair some products&lt;br /&gt;dry and leave white flakes, this one doesnt.  </li>
            <li> I use a tiny, dime size or less, amount in my dry hair and brush.  </li>
            <li> So much less expensive and just as easy to order than go to a store.</li>
            <li> Getting harder to find hope it&#x27;s not being discontinued</li>
            <li> But I do recommend trying a few different things.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this product, and it has been increasingly harder and harder to find, even at beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way and it does give your hair a lift.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way (use about a dime-size dollop)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a &#x27;gel&#x27; consistency maybe just a little bit creamier, and gives my long wavy hair some definition without being crispy.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products like this</li>
            <li> I love the product itself, but was disappointed in the ones I received.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry and then just put a little dab of this product on my finger  tips and work it thru my hair shaping the style I want to achieve.  </li>
            <li> your hair, Although I would recommend that you apply and then let your hair dry a little before&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about using it for medium to long hair, though.  </li>
            <li> It appeared to be watered down and was lumpy in consistency.  </li>
            <li> Plus, when you get down to the end and want to set it upside down, you can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I keep a glass on my counter and set it in there upside down.  </li>
            <li> I do agree though with one reviewer who noted that the strange shape of the bottle makes it impossible to stand on end, which  makes it harder to get the last bit out of the bottle as it nears empty.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is its hard to squeeze from the bottle</li>
            <li> It smooths the frizz out.&lt;br /&gt;The product is heavy, like a gel.</li>
            <li> But the bottle I purchased fr Amazon leaves my hair limp.  </li>
            <li> (read limp) hair in a style.</li>
            <li> When the gel is in your hair it doesn&#x27;t matter, but it does mean that it will rub off on other things.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m afraid to praise it too highly</li>
            <li> Little do they know!    </li>
            <li> Not really sure it does anything except spill all over everything else when you try and travel with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use no more from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I will order this again.</li>
            <li> I was not able to find it any longer in the retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> This product gets hard to squeeze a bit past the midpoint.  </li>
            <li> Got it for the volume, but it makes my hair dull and sticky.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time, but hard to get</li>
            <li> This product is gift to humanity, or at least to those that have the hair that will take it well.  </li>
            <li> If I purchase again will put immediately into a secondary container.</li>
            <li> Has been using it for years, and no matter how hard I have tried, can&#x27;t get him to try anything else!  </li>
            <li> Dumb.  </li>

            <li> thin it with water</li>
            <li> It is either outdated, diluted or counterfit, I fear.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product and could not find in in any of my local stores.  Thank you for having it available for me.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way and it does give your hair a lift.</li>
            <li> Not really sure it does anything except spill all over everything else when you try and travel with it. Definitely not trying this product again.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted. Have used it before. Sent very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product; but delivery packaging was awful!!&lt;br /&gt;It was wrapped in a plastic bag and the top was loose.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, the product had oozed out all over the bag.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping aside, the product is awesome.&lt;br /&gt; love it when wearing my hair in a pony tail.&lt;br /&gt; It smooths the frizz out.&lt;br /&gt;The product is heavy, like a gel.</li>
            <li> Makes hair styling a breeze and why this product is not produced anymore is beyond my comprehension.My beautician has used this on my hair for years and I have purchased before to keep my hair looking good.  I have used other products like this but they do not do my hair style the justice Bed Head does.  Hope the manufacturer will reconsider bringing back the product to the public to purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Holds firm without sacrificing natural look.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have \\&quot;silver\\&quot; hair and it really makes it shine.  I know, I know - I sound old, but am just so young inside and I think this is the a great thing for us that prefer that natural look.</li>
            <li> The product received was poor quality.  I have used this product for years and when I recieved this one, the consistency was off.  It appeared to be watered down and was lumpy in consistency.  This is not how the product is normally made.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser couldn&#x27;t get this so I ordered on line. I am sooo happy!!</li>
            <li> This product is gift to humanity, or at least to those that have the hair that will take it well.  I love it.  It makes my hair the easiest to maintain, out of all the hair products I&#x27;ve tried.  It shapes my hair and makes it look better than it actually is.  People think I have curly hair.  Little do they know!    This product gets hard to squeeze a bit past the midpoint.  Just either be patient or stick something (bobby pin?) in the opening.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Getting harder to find hope it&#x27;s not being discontinued</li>
            <li> Best hair product for my hair. Always get compliments.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever used on my thick, wavy hair. I&#x27;m sorry to learn that TIGI has discontinued making it. In fact, I&#x27;m afraid to praise it too highly or you might buy it all before I can stockpile a lifetime supply! Some of its attributes: It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s fragrance free, a little goes a long way, and it contains little gold flecks that give hair a special glow. I live in a climate that&#x27;s dry in summer and moist in winter, and 98 percent of the days are good-hair days because of this product.</li>
            <li> By far the best of the various hair products I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  Holds very well but my hair remains soft; not sticky, stiff or glued-down.  My hair is thinning and this product gives it fullness and body.  A little goes a long way (use about a dime-size dollop) so the bottle lasts and lasts. I do agree though with one reviewer who noted that the strange shape of the bottle makes it impossible to stand on end, which  makes it harder to get the last bit out of the bottle as it nears empty.  Will definitely continue to buy and use this product.</li>
            <li> Love this for thin hair been using it 5 or 6 years and couldn&#x27;t find it ordered it Thursday or Friday and got it on Monday love it works great will use company again one happy customer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product that I&#x27;ve purchased from beauticians with great success for many years. But the bottle I purchased fr Amazon leaves my hair limp.  It is either outdated, diluted or counterfit, I fear.  I&#x27;ll use no more from the bottle.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use on short hair. It&#x27;s not too heavy, nor too light. Works just perfect for styling.</li>
            <li> Just buy some Elmers glue as it does the same thing !&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is AWFUL unless you wear a mohawk or spikeed hair, then it&#x27;s perfect !</li>
            <li> I like the product, a little stiffer if you use too much.... now that lid thing has to go.  I wear bifocals - imagine trying to get that little thing back in the hole on the top without glasses on - ahhh not happening.  I like the product, works well for holding fine curly/wavy hair.  But that lid has to go for me to buy again.. Cool design but not user friendly!</li>
            <li> I think the product was very old.  It was liquidy and not the regular consistency as a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; new bottle.  It was a great deal at two for 20-something bucks, not really sure since it was over a year ago.  I love the product itself, but was disappointed in the ones I received.  Had to discard them.</li>
            <li> I really like the Creative Genius, but was so disappointed with the way it was packaged. The cover had come off and it had leaked into the bag. The bottle was about 1/4 down as that much had leaked into the baggie it was put in. Not sure I will order this again. The price was so good compared to what I pay in the store, but if that much of it is spilled, I&#x27;m not saving much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different hair gels.  This one is the best for holding my short hair in place.  My gel was delivered the first of August and the small cap on top was taped solidly in place.  For traveling I use another small travel container with a wide screw on top.  No leaking or spilling!</li>
            <li> This was my second time buying TIGI Creative Genius.  The first time I purchased it at Ulta, but when I returned for more learned they no longer carry it.  Was pleased to find it on Amazon.  The bottle is rather stiff, and with the first bottle I had to store it upside down to use the last couple of ounces.  The bottle from Amazon however was so stiff, that when I used it the first time it exploded with just a gentle squeeze.  I gathered what product I could from the sink, counter, mirror and myself, put the rest into a jar and now scoop it out with my finger.  Aside from that, I do like the product itself.  It&#x27;s a &#x27;gel&#x27; consistency maybe just a little bit creamier, and gives my long wavy hair some definition without being crispy.  If I purchase again will put immediately into a secondary container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and am disappointed that it has been discontinued.  Hope Bed Head comes up with something similar!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years. It is my  favorite product for straight hair with no body. Nice scent.</li>
            <li> The only gel that keeps my fine (read limp) hair in a style.</li>
            <li> Excellent product love the fullness it gives hair</li>
            <li> These bottles often crack, but I have been hooked on Bed Head for over a decade. Great smell. No grease. Best styling get out there. Holds strong all day.</li>
            <li> Works great for styling.  I began purchasing it from Amazon when my local retailer stopped carrying it.  After three bottles purchased from Amazon, Iâ€™ve had no difficulties.  Itâ€™s exactly the same product I used to be able to get locally.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use.  I have fine hair and loved the fact that this never felt sticky and only needed as small amount .  The design of the bottle allowed  easy application and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product. Have been using it since it showed up sometime in the 1990s. It holds, looks natural (if you want it to) and doesn&#x27;t flake or gum. If you want a gel type hold or even just a little extra body, this is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> This is a hard(ish) drying gel that works great on shorter hair and looks very natural after it drys and you comb through.</li>
            <li> I love this product i have been using this product for years. This is the only thing that works on my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it&#x27;s fabulous. One bottle usually lasts me about 6 months since I only use a quarter-sized portion, and I was so glad to find a good deal here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am a man with thin hair.  I have used this stuff for many years as a little goes a long way and will hold all day.  I use a tiny, dime size or less, amount in my dry hair and brush.  Works every time.</li>
            <li> The store I always buy this at does not carry it anymore.  So happy I looked on line, it is so much cheaper and will tell all my friends.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It was what they said</li>
            <li> The bottles were cracked in a couple of places. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it doesn&#x27;t leave flaking or residue like some of the other gels!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on my curly/way fine hair.  It&#x27;s a bit sticky at first, but dries nicely.  Works well to blow dry curly hair with the product in.</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that works with my hair.  Excellent for scrunching without the crunch. Holds the curl and reduces frizz. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I like keeping my hair short and experimenting with different styles. Currently ive got my head shaved on the sides with a #1 clipper and then the top of my head is about 2-2.5 inches. I either use a wax and spray or this product. This product is nice for getting a somewhat strong hold, depending on how much you use. One downside: be aware that this gel has tiny little sparkly particulates, almost like glitter, in it. When the gel is in your hair it doesn&#x27;t matter, but it does mean that it will rub off on other things. I used to have a pillow case that was covered with it. But overall, good product. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with long hair though. Best for someone with fairly short hair who wants to sculpt it and style it in different ways. If you&#x27;re someone who has short hair and wants to experiment with styling their hair in different ways, this gel just might be your best friend. But I do recommend trying a few different things. If you aren&#x27;t satisfied with this gel try a wax and a spray, I like to use the Toni and guy &amp;#34;stick it up gum&amp;#34; and the bed head &amp;#34;hard head&amp;#34; spray.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite hair product.  Has been using it for years, and no matter how hard I have tried, can&#x27;t get him to try anything else!  I think it&#x27;s great for short hair, which is what he has.  I have also used it years ago when I, too, had short hair, and I also liked it.  I&#x27;m not sure about using it for medium to long hair, though.  Just my opinion.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for my baby fine hair!!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product, I will use nothing else</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I like to use on my fine hair.  The stores where I bought it stopped carrying it so I thought it had been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to find it on Amazon and will continue to order it as long as I can.</li>
            <li> This gel is not too stiff nor is it so soft it doesn&#x27;t hold.  It holds very well and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like a wooden board.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair rather short and don&#x27;t spend much time on it, a dab of this stuff, pluck, tug, separate and I&#x27;ve got a fashion statement. If you want a softer look, just brush it after it&#x27;s dry and your hair will stay in place until you wash it. Fab stuff!</li>
            <li> I have short hair and wear it spiked.  This product works great for me.  Just enough stiffness and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Very sticky, but great hold.</li>
            <li> Product is just what I wanted.  Decent hold, but not super firm or hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this packaging is REALLY not user friendly.  The tip comes all the way off, and isn&#x27;t super easy to put back on.  You have to fit a tab exactly in the slot.  Dumb.  Plus, when you get down to the end and want to set it upside down, you can&#x27;t.  I keep a glass on my counter and set it in there upside down.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get this again if they don&#x27;t change the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love it. Exactly what I ordered and needed. Rave review!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for15 tears or more. And have never found a product that works as well as this one.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is a great thickener.  I use it with a smoothing product on top.  Really thickens well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Used for years. Fast delivery !</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  I have short hair with a little natural curl, it&#x27;s also fine with little body.  I blow dry and then just put a little dab of this product on my finger  tips and work it thru my hair shaping the style I want to achieve.  It&#x27;s not sticky when it dries, adds shine and body.  Love it.  My only complaint is its hard to squeeze from the bottle but that&#x27;s very miner.  Have tried many other products and this is definitely the best for me.  With dark brown hair some products&lt;br /&gt;dry and leave white flakes, this one doesnt.  Style lasts all day, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stiff but very natural, brings out the curl too.</li>
            <li> Not a fan.  Got it for the volume, but it makes my hair dull and sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it helps me create any style I want to sport and it does not flake.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time.  Great product.  Do not know why they quit making it.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this product, and it has been increasingly harder and harder to find, even at beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this TIGI Sculpting GEL....used it for years and this size bottle lasts forever....thin it with water and it lasts even longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a long time. It has the right hold for me and I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Light weight and soft.  One&#x27;s hair stays true without the feel of heavier products and it has a pleasant fragrence.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about 2 years. When I ran out of it I was not able to find it any longer in the retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;Was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time, but hard to get</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find the TIGI Bed Head Sculpting Lotion on amazon.com!  It goes on wet and dries quickly to keep my short spiky hair in place.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I love this gel. Smells good, not like chemicals! Really holds your style &amp; easy to blow dry my hair with it. Not sticky like some gels can be.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and never though to buy it on line. So much less expensive and just as easy to order than go to a store.</li>
            <li> tried many gels for my hair and this has a great hold on my hair to allow me to sculpt it but doesn&#x27;t feel like glue in my hair. :)</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years, it became difficult to find in stores and amazon helped me find my product. Just love what this product for my short hair style. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Have used it for years, but no longer available ):</li>
            <li> Best gel for my natural curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s not sticky  it holds all day smells great!</li>
            <li> I have used this product  for several years.  It&#x27;s great if you need a little extra body&lt;br /&gt;for your hair, Although I would recommend that you apply and then let your hair dry a little before&lt;br /&gt;you style if you are wanting extra hold.  Great product and great price</li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy hair.  This sculpting liquid calms the frizz and defines the curls.  It will make your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; if you use too much though.  Great product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is the best styling gel ever!!!</li>
