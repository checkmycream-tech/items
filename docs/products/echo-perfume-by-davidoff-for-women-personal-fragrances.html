            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the Echo I&#x27;ve bought in the past</li>
            <li> My daughter is crazy about this perfume, its the only one she uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this Eau De Parfum for my wife, but it seems to be a fake product.</li>

            <li> I discovered the fragarance a few years ago and have been using it since. If you like subtle, feminine, but not necesarily rosy and flowery scents, you should definitely give this one a try. And for me, the fact that no one else I know of has it, is only a plus!</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife, really loved it</li>

            <li> Maybe the heat changed the scent... Doesn&#x27;t smell like the Echo I&#x27;ve bought in the past</li>
            <li> This was not my typical perfume I normally get. It smells clean,crisp, and wintery. This is my first time trying Echo by Davidoff. I have Coolwater by Davidoff and it is absolutely breathtaking. Overall I do like Echo this is not for little girls. The only thing I do not like is that it does not last a long time. I would like for my perfume to last at least until I am about to get off of work. I would say roughly around 5-6 hours is how long it last. I still like it.</li>
            <li> &#x27;m not sure it was the original. since no smell</li>
            <li> My fav perfume of all time!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this perfume and was disappointed to find out it was being discontinued. I was so happy to find it here and for such a great price! Very feminine, even though it doesn&#x27;t last too long, but still a great but</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! I&#x27;ve been getting it for years. Classic scent thats feminine and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago and was in love with it at first sniff.  Definitely a good summer fragrance.  Glad I rebought it now.</li>
