    <ol>
            <li> Works very well. Hair grows a lot&lt;br /&gt;and is stronger. Dandruff is minimal</li>
            <li> I love this product. Have been using it for a long time</li>
            <li> Saw a difference shortly after second application! If this keeps up, will have to buy much more!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent for damage hair (especially spots on scalp), if you have spots use each day for 7 days and you will see the different.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the drops for one month and i have a inch of growth so that wonderful. I love this product i will let you know in a month how it will continue to grow my hair. Thanks Rosa</li>
            <li> I have experienced some growth with it but I have to tak me hair down to see.</li>
            <li> I bought tricogen on February 4th...today is February 21st. Yesterday before a family funeral my 16 year old granddaughter renarked how full my hair looked...I had noticeable thinning on the top, and back...yes a little over two weeks...big difference. I use twice a day. A co-worker gave me the vials...I bought some vials...and this bottle. This stuff works! In 3 months will review again.still using over a year later, my hair is down my back...you must use at least 3 times a week for best results...my husband now uses it...and it is working. ..it&#x27;s  expensive...but my growth is amazing...no more thinning hair...and I have finally started perming hair again...it was just too thick for natural...</li>
            <li> Really helped with my dandruff</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and works, but the itching is hard to deal with. I realize if you only use it once every other day it doesn&#x27;t make your scalp itch. Other than that great product. You will see growth in about 1.5 months.</li>
            <li> sorry to tell you, but it is the second time that I order this product and it is expired a year ago. I think you have to be more carefully, because personally I like the product but I won&#x27;t order from you, and the champoo  it was expire five years ago. I could say that it was not a good experience with the Farmavita tricogen lotion for hair growth 100ml</li>
            <li> Got my product ontime. Love this hair growth drops the work real goid on my hair have thinning hair at crown</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hair is thicker than it has ever been.  Love the thickness but hoping for length also.  Ordered my second bottle today.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s a fine products....</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t very pleasant, but goes away. It feels nice when massaged onto a clean scalp, and really helps to prevent dry flakes or dandruff. It could be my imagination, but after using the product for 3 weeks now, I feel like I can see growth! Will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is not at all attractive BUT, this is what I need to keep my hair luxurious and happy.  I have used this product for a few years and I never want to be without it. So happy it&#x27;s on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product really works!!! My hair is in better condition and it is finally growing again.  My hair growth had stopped but I have seen great results in just one month! Reordering for sure.</li>
            <li> Learned of this product from a young woman that ahs long glowing hair , I tried it and this stuff works.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it for another week...it came in earlier and I saw some changes as soon as I started using it. my hair is thicker than its ever been before. My hairdresser was amazed at my growth too. Definitely should get a back up bottle!</li>
            <li> Never saw any results</li>
            <li> This product really helps with my hair breakage.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my wife. She hasn&#x27;t complained so I guess it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair was thinning in the back. My hairdresser started using this product and my hair is thickening up.</li>
            <li> so far so good. i&#x27;ve started using it after giving birth to my baby-boy in Feb 2015. i started to experience massive hair loss in June so was extremely worried abt it then browsed the internet and read good reviews abt the product. wanted to give it a try and am now using it for 2 weeks. i got to say that hair loss has significantly decreased. i&#x27;m not yet sure abt hair growing back BUT I REALLY HOPE THEY WILL! giving it 4 stars yet bcs i just started seeing the progress. will leave another comment after i see more results in month or so.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my hair within two weeks, and where it was thinning it has thicken back up. Tricogen has a strong scent, however it doesn&#x27;t bother me, I&#x27;m just elated that it works so fast. I would totally recommend this product to anyone who has weak, stress, or bald spots.</li>
            <li> You should see my husband&#x27;s before and after results.</li>
            <li> I lost quite a bit of weight and unfortunately a ponytail&#x27;s worth of hair. Very depressed until my wisecracking elderly neighbor told me about this stuff. I have been using this for the past 2 months &amp; WOW !  It smells like you put every seasoning known to man in your oven &amp; turned it on 350 degrees for an hour.....but who cares if it works ???  There were small bald patches on the sides of my temples that I have had  for years &amp; a small spot on my crown......all covered with hair now.  There are small hairs coming in all over my scalp. Would the hair have come back on it&#x27;s own ???? Who knows but the sides and the spot on my crown have been like that for years and they are now covered with hair !!!!</li>
