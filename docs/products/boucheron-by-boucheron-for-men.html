            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more of this any time.</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>this is for someone who appreciates something sophisticated.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s better than people say.</li>
            <li>Boucheron, though, is a clean, sophisticated scent.</li>
            <li>Dont waste your money it looks like a real good deal but its not</li>
            <li>when I first sprayed Bucheron on my wrist, it stayed more than 10 hours.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li>They do have an after shave lotion that I use right after shaving.  </li>
            <li>that didn&#x27;t detract from my positive report on Boucheron!</li>
            <li>still kind of unknown</li>
            <li>There is something very special about this Boucheron which makes it instantly recognizable in any crowd or open space.</li>
            <li>I really like the men&#x27;s eau de toilette.</li>
            <li>Very practical.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and find it nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>The fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong or last as long as the Bucheron I buy at a department store.</li>
            <li>I agree with some of the reviews that it doesn&#x27;t last too long, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It came faster than the estimated delivery timeframe, and smell was everything that I expected. I agree with some of the reviews that it doesn&#x27;t last too long, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the price. It&#x27;s about $80 or more in Macy&#x27;s. I take this any day!! I would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> my friend loves this.</li>
            <li> Men&#x27;s colognes often fall into one of two categories: musky or fruity. Neither of these appeal to me. Boucheron, though, is a clean, sophisticated scent.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is wonderful, love the smell and it last most of the day and evening!</li>
            <li> when I first sprayed Bucheron on my wrist, it stayed more than 10 hours. That was convincing ! I bought it same day from amazon. The product I got, either aproaching out of date or something I don&#x27;t know. Even after 6-8 sprays, it&#x27;s just gone after couple hours ! At least for this cologne, I must say: I am disappointed ! I am not using it, kept it as a showpiece in my cologne library.</li>
            <li> I just bought another bottle for my husband because he ran out and nothing he has ever had compairs!!!  Just a little on is chest goes a long way.  At night I can still smell it and it drives me crazy!!</li>
            <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong or last as long as the Bucheron I buy at a department store.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Best fragrance I have ever used. Not overpowering, but it lasts all day. I get more comments on how nice this fragrance is from people I have known for years, or some that I have just met.</li>
            <li> sorry i dont hate it , but not even close to any fragance its just a bottle of alcohol !</li>
            <li> Great smell; best prices I;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and value</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and it&#x27;s much cheaper than in any store or department store! I love it and my girlfriend goes crazy for it!</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite! I love the smell and I also have Boucheron for women. I would buy this again when my husband runs out!</li>
            <li> Excellent product I live the fragrance</li>
            <li> Knock off. This is not Boucheron.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. This is my fourth time buying it. I am very satisfied boht for the product which is authentic and the price.</li>
            <li> Awesome perfume for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for men for many years and I get lots of kisses on my neck. I have been using this perfume for many years and get many compliments.</li>
            <li> Boucheron Boucheron - the name says it all. This is for the man who has it all. Beautiful timeless classic.</li>
            <li> Great smelling colonge.  Delivery was definitely on time for a last minute gift for the family.</li>
            <li> This is really an amazingly attractive scent that lasts and lasts. There is something very special about this Boucheron which makes it instantly recognizable in any crowd or open space. Absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li> delicious duration of 6 to 7 hours good projection and fixing a special smell classic</li>
            <li> I purchased as a gift for my cousin who loves this! Great knowing his fragrance, makes it so easy to order!  Best price at Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy more of this any time.</li>
            <li> its pure alcohol after 5 sprays , theres no more cologne scent. Dont waste your money it looks like a real good deal but its not</li>
            <li> I have been using the toilette for years....I love it..my wife tells me \\&quot;that&#x27;s your fragrance...\\&quot;  I used the after shave balm also; but disappointingly that product has been discontinued.  They do have an after shave lotion that I use right after shaving.  I have a bottle of the parfum...totally different fragrance..don&#x27;t like it...the toilette is a great fragrance...not something that you will notice on a lot of people.....still kind of unknown I believe......as a \\&quot;boomer\\&quot; I am not interested in the GQ nonsense....this is for someone who appreciates something sophisticated.  I use it every day and find it nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> I really like the men&#x27;s eau de toilette. Smells great. Completely masculine scent but refined and subtle&lt;br /&gt;Ladies like the way I smell with it on.&lt;br /&gt;Frank Zappa lyric added to add more characters below:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Honey let me rub some rancid Budweiser into my beard right now and show you how a young girl like you might be thrilled and over whelmed by me&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that didn&#x27;t detract from my positive report on Boucheron!</li>
            <li> The Signature scent for men with olfactory sophistication.&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone will even notice the presence of Boucheron.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re stacking it up and have plenty to spare buy the Eau de Parfum,&lt;br /&gt;it has longer legs and requires no maintenance.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Very practical. Not think it was so good, it&#x27;s better than people say. It&#x27;s worth buying.I indicated to several people.</li>
