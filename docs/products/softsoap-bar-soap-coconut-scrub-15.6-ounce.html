            <li>Perfect!  </li>
            <li>This does NOT smell girly and is a perfect compliment to his deodorant.</li>
            <li>and it was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>happy with seller and price.</li>
            <li>Sounds great, doesn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li>Also, the smell wasn&#x27;t as great as you would hope from something that was supposed to smell like coconut.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I got it for a good price</li>
            <li>Bought this bar soap hoping it was a good exfoliant</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>and it is nice, but</li>
            <li>My favorite soap ever.</li>
            <li>I love this bar soap..just used it.</li>
            <li>love this soap, discontinued couldn&#x27;t find it except online</li>
            <li>will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, the texture, everything.  </li>
            <li>I love the cocnut scrub.</li>
            <li>Okay, but no coconut smell.  </li>
            <li>but Mostly this one.  </li>
            <li>I really love everything about this soap.</li>
            <li>I could have bought coconut lime or coconut bamboo or coconut vanilla and plenty more</li>
            <li>This bar caused itchiness, sensitivity, left a residue, didn&#x27;t smell that great (coconut, I don&#x27;t know about the others), and might have caused more dryness.</li>
            <li>Quick Take:&lt;br /&gt;An exfoliating coconut soap!</li>
            <li>but since I have found a couple of smells that are ok-it is nice to occasionally have a nice soap.</li>
            <li>I was actually really excited to try this since I like their body washes, so I bought a pack in Target when we were on vacation.</li>
            <li>The soap smells great the scent last and the soap lathers really well.</li>
            <li>After using it, I also felt like it left some kind of soap residue on my skin and my legs were much ashier than when I was using the Dove soap (smells better too).</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>So worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>so I can buy it right from my computer.  </li>
            <li>Well, I was just so happy to find a reasonable priced coconut soap, so I was really dissapointed to use it and find there was absolutely no coconut scent to it at all.</li>
            <li>Smells good but didn&#x27;t leave my skin soft like my regular body wash.</li>
            <li>It lathers up really well, smells nice, but is very drying, and the exfoliant grains are barely noticeble.  </li>
            <li>Once he stopped using it, the rash went away and was fine on our old Dove soap.</li>
            <li>I must really like it, for I would have never dreamed I would be searching for soap online!  </li>
            <li>POSITIVELY NAUSEATINGLY FLORAL.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am starting my last package and was very pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Very foamy</li>
            <li>The scent is gentle and not over powering.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>Here I buy straight up coconut</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to my old favorite, Dove bar soap.</li>
            <li>Recently came across this soap at a local store and thought ok i will give it a try at a Dollar a bar.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin...especially my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap - hard to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>This one is the clear winner.  </li>
            <li>I plan to stock more just because im afraid that it will no longer be available in the store i get it at</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know which flower-maybe hibiscus but clearly a floral scent.</li>
            <li>BUT CLEARLY IF U SMELL A COCONUT AND SMELL THIS</li>
            <li>This is yet another product that claims coconut scent and is nothing near coconut.</li>
            <li>This is the first soap in a very long time that I can use without severe itching.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>

            <li> well, in places that you don&#x27;t want to be sensitive or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Try it for a few days and lookout for any changes in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few days, I am itching and scratching so much that I can hardly stand it.  </li>
            <li> I am highly allergic to scents except a very small few</li>
            <li> Seems just like any other soap.  </li>
            <li> All the typical men&#x27;s soaps clash with his deodorant, and other soaps that didn&#x27;t clash</li>
            <li> I now have my closet stocked with this soap and and a few others just to have a change of pace</li>
            <li> Sorry Softsoap, definitely a fan of your body washes and foaming hand soap but not this bar product.</li>
            <li> usually that means not coconut.</li>
            <li> and I usually get unscented everything</li>
            <li> I am surprised at the bad reviews, however, a person can be allergic to anything at anytime.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do hardly anything, except make my skin itch, and itch, AND itch!  </li>
            <li> Have been unable to find this in any stores after I bought it one time</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has been discontinued by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> In the stores it too expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my boyfriend used it for the weekend and was experiencing a lot of itchiness and rash (almost hive-like).</li>
            <li> I am so sick and tired of companies naming items in a misleading way.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite soap ever. The scent and texture are perfect. I wish I knew that Softsoap would continue to produce this item.</li>
            <li> I love this soap - hard to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with seller and price.</li>
            <li> I love this bar soap..just used it. Very foamy and I recommend you try it. Never knew that Softsoap made bar soap before. The scent is gentle and not over powering.</li>
            <li> Have been unable to find this in any stores after I bought it one time and I loved it.  Leave it to Amazon to have it so I can buy it right from my computer.  It&#x27;s moisturizing and has a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected. I really like this soap. Unfortunately, it has been discontinued by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Smells good but didn&#x27;t leave my skin soft like my regular body wash. I guess that&#x27;s all bar soap though?</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> love this soap, discontinued couldn&#x27;t find it except online</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap. In the stores it too expensive I got it for a good price will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Cannot find these in stores any longer.</li>
            <li> Bought this bar soap hoping it was a good exfoliant but it didn&#x27;t do hardly anything, except make my skin itch, and itch, AND itch!  It lathers up really well, smells nice, but is very drying, and the exfoliant grains are barely noticeble.  Would not buy this soap again.  I&#x27;ll go back to my old favorite, Dove bar soap.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for this soap everywhere.  I must really like it, for I would have never dreamed I would be searching for soap online!  Love the scent, the texture, everything.  Hope Softsoap isn&#x27;t planning to discontinue it.  Also, they have it in a body wash and it is nice, but I would like to have the bar also.</li>
            <li> Because of my perfume sensitivity my husband switched to Axe Excite deodorant, but he likes bar soaps and Axe doesn&#x27;t make them. All the typical men&#x27;s soaps clash with his deodorant, and other soaps that didn&#x27;t clash smelled girly. This does NOT smell girly and is a perfect compliment to his deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin...especially my legs and underarms.  I have used several soaps claiming to be non-drying, moisturizing, etc.  After a few days, I am itching and scratching so much that I can hardly stand it.  This is the first soap in a very long time that I can use without severe itching.  I love it!  I actually found it on clearance in a dollar store and bought 3 packages.  I am starting my last package and was very pleased to find it on Amazon.  I am surprised at the bad reviews, however, a person can be allergic to anything at anytime.  I am just grateful to have found this soap.</li>
            <li> Well, I was just so happy to find a reasonable priced coconut soap, so I was really dissapointed to use it and find there was absolutely no coconut scent to it at all. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Love it!! I love the cocnut scrub.</li>
            <li> Quick Take:&lt;br /&gt;An exfoliating coconut soap! Sounds great, doesn&#x27;t it? I was actually really excited to try this since I like their body washes, so I bought a pack in Target when we were on vacation. Unfortunately, my boyfriend used it for the weekend and was experiencing a lot of itchiness and rash (almost hive-like). Once he stopped using it, the rash went away and was fine on our old Dove soap. Even more unfortunately though, is that I wanted to try to use up the soap since he seemed sensitive/allergic to it, but after a while, I started getting some sensitivity/itchiness... well, in places that you don&#x27;t want to be sensitive or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Try it for a few days and lookout for any changes in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;Probably would rate this a 1 out of 5, only because I don&#x27;t run across a lot of products that can cause adverse effects. Also, the smell wasn&#x27;t as great as you would hope from something that was supposed to smell like coconut. After using it, I also felt like it left some kind of soap residue on my skin and my legs were much ashier than when I was using the Dove soap (smells better too). Sorry Softsoap, definitely a fan of your body washes and foaming hand soap but not this bar product. Back to the drawing board?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I prefer Dove bar soap over this one. This bar caused itchiness, sensitivity, left a residue, didn&#x27;t smell that great (coconut, I don&#x27;t know about the others), and might have caused more dryness. Maybe it&#x27;s just me and the boyfriend&#x27;s asian skin, but this one just didn&#x27;t work out for us.</li>
            <li> Okay, but no coconut smell.  Seems just like any other soap.  Don&#x27;t know what I expected, but I purchased a different bar (more expensive)  and it was wonderful.  Going back to it.</li>
            <li> Recently came across this soap at a local store and thought ok i will give it a try at a Dollar a bar.  Well i have to say I buy different soaps all the time and have over 25 different soaps in my closet at all times as i like to switch it up and find soaps that I like.  This one is the clear winner.  I now have my closet stocked with this soap and and a few others just to have a change of pace but Mostly this one.  The soap smells great the scent last and the soap lathers really well. I really love everything about this soap. It does not leave your skin feeling oily at all.  So worth the purchase. I plan to stock more just because im afraid that it will no longer be available in the store i get it at and then i will be lost without it.</li>
            <li> No coming coconut soap why tanks</li>
            <li> I am so sick and tired of companies naming items in a misleading way. This is yet another product that claims coconut scent and is nothing near coconut. I don&#x27;t know which flower-maybe hibiscus but clearly a floral scent. I could have bought coconut lime or coconut bamboo or coconut vanilla and plenty more but but i learned my lesson-  usually that means not coconut. Here I buy straight up coconut and it is not not not coconut. I am highly allergic to scents except a very small few and I usually get unscented everything but since I have found a couple of smells that are ok-it is nice to occasionally have a nice soap. BUT CLEARLY IF U SMELL A COCONUT AND SMELL THIS THERE IS NO RESEMBLANCE WHATSOEVER. POSITIVELY NAUSEATINGLY FLORAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL NEVER TRUST SS AGAIN.</li>
