            <li>but I&#x27;ve found it to be of much more use for multiple things.</li>
            <li>Nothing else works like pure zinc oxide PASTE.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to get what you expected and pay a reasonable price, very unexpected these days.  </li>

            <li>At one time the PASTE was available in 1# jars or smaller tubes.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking to just using this product to make homemade sunscreen</li>
            <li>After doing research on Zinc Oxide I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s used for dandruff, I&#x27;ve added just a teaspoon to my regular shampoo and have found myself flake free.</li>
            <li>I used it, along with other ingredients to make my own natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Mixed in well and doesn&#x27;t turn my face white, so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>The next time I used it, I stayed outside more than an hour and still did not get burned.</li>
            <li>Thanks Natural essentials</li>
            <li>Still new to DIY beauty products, but this works well in the sun block I made.</li>
            <li>Only the ointment is available commercially.</li>
            <li>and I tried it the first time and was outside for an hour without burning.</li>
            <li>Made my money back several times with this product...when I run out I will definitely be purchasing more...</li>
            <li>I mixed this in with some pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional soap and lotion maker and needed Zinc Oxide for acne cream and sun block.</li>
            <li>So far it has worked.  </li>
            <li>However,  when I received my unopened package of zinc oxide, the bag was less than half filled!!</li>

            <li> Not sure yet if this leaves your skin white though.</li>

            <li> I really like this Zinc Oxide.  It is less expensive than others on the market and works great.  I used it to make homemade sunscreen.  The sunscreen rubs in very well and seems to last a long time.  I also used the homemade sunscreen on my toddler and after entire days outdoors there were no burns.</li>
            <li> Mixes well with any oil or cream that you like.  Soothing on the skin.  Very good price and quality.  One pound will last me for a very long time (probably several years).</li>
            <li> Lifetime supply!  Great ingredient for DIY deodorant and baby bottom cream.</li>

            <li> Excellent product, excellent price. I am a professional soap and lotion maker and needed Zinc Oxide for acne cream and sun block. Took a chance on the low price and I am 100% satisfied. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Bought for homemade sunscreen, worked perfectly. No odor or gross feeling left after application. The bag was bigger than expected too.</li>
            <li> so far I just love this product. I use it for a variety of things.  I even thicken up my acrylic paints and oils before I use them on canvas.  I also use this to mix with olive oil, almond oil, lavender oil, Rose hip oil,  etc  you can mix it with the oils such as peppermint oil , rose hip, olive oils and make a nice deoderant  if  you are allergic to the store bought ones like I am.</li>
            <li> This zinc oxide was perfect for my needs.  I purchased it to make diaper rash cream and sunscreen.  It has worked just as it should for both.  I also appreciated that the seller answered my questions in a timely manner and shipped this quickly.</li>
            <li> It is delivered just as pictured.  Product looks great.  It was exactly what I needed for making sun screen at home.</li>
            <li> This is great product! Seller shipped in a timely fashion and the product was everything it was advertised to be. I make my own cosmetics-so the purity of the product is everything to me. The product is so good--it&#x27;s a dream to work with--and I will definitely do business with this seller again! Completely satisfied---can&#x27;t recommend this seller highly enough!</li>
            <li> This is just perfect for making natural sunscreens. It works perfectly and it was such a great price.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for the sunblock I made</li>
            <li> outstanding product we make our own sunsceen for our lepord appalooza</li>
            <li> My wife says she  loves the texture of this product: super dust.  It stays on the skin beautifully&lt;br /&gt;after priming the face with facial cream.  It was delivery promptly.  Will buy again, as she has&lt;br /&gt;been giving samples to her friends.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it in my homemade skin products. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ordered zinc oxide so I am not an authority on it, but I found this to be helpful in making my own sunscreen.  This seems to be of a good quality and I have been happy with it.</li>
            <li> Came fast and now I can make my own vegan sunscreen wherever I go. Just mix it into some coco butter or lotion and you got instant sunscreen.</li>
            <li> the product is what it says it is. l use it for mixing paint and as a sunblock ingredient; works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make sunscreen. It was a success.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it to make her own sunscreen.</li>
            <li> No instructions on how to use it.  Asked several times and the website that is suppose to help is terrible.</li>
            <li> Great product and good price</li>
            <li> I have only used this once in a natural sunscreen and it works great. Good price for product. Thanks Natural essentials</li>
            <li> Wish it came with directions on how to dissolve properly. It said to go to the website and when I did, I found no answers. That&#x27;s why it gets 4 instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Works great for sunscreen, as described.</li>
            <li> The zinc oxide package is exactly what I ordered.  I will use it to compound zinc oxide PASTE. I wish I could find a place that sells zinc oxide PASTE.  Lifeguards use it to protect their noses from the sun.  At one time the PASTE was available in 1# jars or smaller tubes.  It is off the market now.  Only the ointment is available commercially. Nothing else works like pure zinc oxide PASTE.  Now I will have to make my own out of the powder. Note: Do not be fooled by commercial products that say things like, &amp;#34;Dr. Jones&#x27; Butt Paste.&amp;#34;  These products are not paste; they are just ointments.  Ointments do not work as protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I could not get this item locally without a prescription.  I&#x27;m using it to make sunscreen.  So far it has worked.  A pound is more than I needed but I will share it.</li>
            <li> This is a lot of zinc! I&#x27;m going to have my own sunscreen and dandruff shampoo for years. The product was as describes, it came quickly, and it was a good price. What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> Very good, organic consistency! I love it for my homemade sunscreen also for my face cream to make it spf. Awesome stuff! Super fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> perfect in our homemade sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I am happy with how it mixed into my lotions and rubbed into my skin, the website that the package has on it was not helpful, I couldn&#x27;t even find zinc oxide on it.</li>
            <li> Fine quality. Works well. Will purchase again in the future from this seller.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if this leaves your skin white though.</li>
            <li> I was really looking to just using this product to make homemade sunscreen but I&#x27;ve found it to be of much more use for multiple things. After doing research on Zinc Oxide I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s used for dandruff, I&#x27;ve added just a teaspoon to my regular shampoo and have found myself flake free. When mixed with other oils and waxes or lotion of your choice, it blocks the sun from burning your skin. It is easy to work with, and the bag reseal with a zip lock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and amount with all its benefits.. I&#x27;m really more than satisfied! I&#x27;m so glad I came across this!</li>
