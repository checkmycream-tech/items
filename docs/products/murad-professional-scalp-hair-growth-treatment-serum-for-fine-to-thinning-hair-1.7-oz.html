            <li>I started using this because I love Murad skin care and figured it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>I lost a lot of hair after bariatric surgery (you could easily see my scalp all over my head), but it&#x27;s improved tremendously with these products.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and it has gotten worse over the years. My hairdresser suggested the Murad hair loss line and it worked on the thin area on the back of my head! Where you once saw my scalp you can no longer see. I only gave it 4 stars because you have to use it every day and it hasn&#x27;t seemed to help the front of my head. I wasn&#x27;t using it on this area every day so that could be why.I&#x27;m trying it again and following the instructions.</li>
            <li> It took about a year, but I now have much fuller hair after using the shampoo, conditioner, and scalp treatment. I lost a lot of hair after bariatric surgery (you could easily see my scalp all over my head), but it&#x27;s improved tremendously with these products. My hair stylist is very happy with the change and so am I. The only reaction I had was that if I spilled a little bit on my skin, I got a little redness that lasted for about 5-10 minutes and then disappeared. I&#x27;m sorry that the first person who wrote the first review that those terrible symptoms. I hope you&#x27;re doing better. This product works for me, but you have to be patient. A year seems like a long time. But for me, it was well worth it to have nice thick hair again.</li>
            <li> this product does wonders on  hair it grows fortifies hair but it causes serious side effects like headaches, dizziness and fatigue. i stoppec it and switched to nisim</li>
            <li> I used this for about two and a half months and I think I could tell a little bit of difference in my hair thinkness.  Maybe if I gave it more time I would see better results but I am afraid I am an instant gradification kinda gal, I like to see quick results.  I would have giving it more time but I did not like the smell and it left my hair looking oily and limp.  I am going to try a few different products and depending on my results with those I may order this again and give it more time.</li>
            <li> This product sopped hair loss almost immediately.  It smells great.  The only thing I didn´t like, but I can´t say if it was the product or just coincidence, is that my hair color faded almost immediately too.  I use permanent but water based hair color (no ammonium, no peroxide). But aside from that, great results in the very first week.</li>
            <li> I guess this works.  Many  beauticians tell me I am wasting my money, while others recommend.</li>
            <li> The Murad Serum has assisted in the re-growth of my hair.  The Serum was recommended by my hairdresser&lt;br /&gt;to be used daily since I swim daily.  Every weight loss process causes hair loss but fortunately, with the help&lt;br /&gt;of the serum, healthy hair is replaced.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work for me, but it might for you...hopefully.  There are various reasons for thinning hair so best to find what works for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my aunt who has had thinning hair for over 20 years now. She noticed fuller and stronger hair within the first week of use, if you could believe that! Everyone around her has been commenting on her improved hair too! She&#x27;s been using it for a couple of months now and not even every day like it says on the bottle but only a few times a week and the effect seems to be strong anyway. I know she has tried many other treatments and nothing seems to have helped much, let alone produce results that everyone can notice. I have now bought her 5 bottles of the stuff so she can continue a maintenance treatment of once-a-week applications. Now my uncle who has had male pattern baldness for the last 30 years wants to give it a try as well. I will report on how that goes in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;I even bought a bottle for myself even though I don&#x27;t have thinning hair, just to see what all the rave was about. And it does seem to add body to my hair when applied to the roots as directed. I know it&#x27;s not supposed to be a styling product at all but it seems to be having this effect on me. I do not blow dry or style my hair so it&#x27;s nice to get fuller AND healthier hair at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say give it a try. You&#x27;ve got nothing to lose. Except hair loss. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> great serum...esp for fine hair!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve tried some of the most &amp;#34;guaranteed&amp;#34; hair growth products on the market. None of it works. Take biotin and fish oil and take care of the hair you have. Topical ointments don&#x27;t work. We need to put good things IN our bodies to promote hair growth and hair care.</li>
            <li> Like this. Helps hair come back but it doesn&#x27;t come back as strong as before but it covers my balding areas around my face.</li>
            <li> My scalp has improved a lot.  It is a continuing process.&lt;br /&gt;It goes very quickly and bottle is small.</li>
            <li> Murad, really thinken my thining hear line due to braids and weaves.  It was over a period of 3-9 months that I used Murad before I saw a true difference in my hair however, it is worth it and it works.</li>
            <li> I have used it for many years. I had to tie my hair tightly every other day due to work requirements, and my hair was dropping alarmingly fast. I relied on it to help me minimise the drops. I stopped for a few year after I quit. Recently I gave birth, and hormonal changes screw up my hair mass again. After like a few days of application, there is significant drop in the loss of hair. After a bottle, I stopped and didn&#x27;t needed it again.</li>
            <li> This product really does grow and thicken your hair.  I have thick course hair but because of braids being to tight my hair was thining. However, Murad product had brought back my hair to its natural thick state.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by it.:-)</li>
            <li> First of let me be clear here Murad will not grow hair in spots where there&#x27;s no hair but it will save yor thinning hair to the point it may not fall off entirely and make an ugly bald spot on your head. It does just that. If you want to save a patch that&#x27;s thinning then this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> I have had thyroid issues in the past year and the most visible symptom was hair loss.  I started using this because I love Murad skin care and figured it was worth a shot.  I use it in the morning after I shower and after the first bottle is almost gone, I can say that I do see new growth along the hairline.  The price is much more reasonable than most other hair serums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for a while and product quality seems consistent in addition to the consistent results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used for a while and product quality seems consistent in addition to the consistent results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used for a while and product quality seems consistent in addition to the consistent results.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, husband swears by it.</li>
            <li> murad is one of the best skincare lines so why wouldn,t they do great hair? they do. this is an exceptional product,for scalp and hair</li>
