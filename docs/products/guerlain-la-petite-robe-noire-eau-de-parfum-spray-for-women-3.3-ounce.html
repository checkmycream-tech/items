            <li>I do not detect the other notes, which would make this composition more interesting.</li>
            <li>The perfume I received doesn&#x27;t appear to be authentic - not only has the packaging been tampered with, with unique identification cut out of it, it doesn&#x27;t smell right either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lasting power and sillage on me are much better than most, but that is to be expected from the house of Guerlain :)</li>

            <li>It transformed my mother into a glamorous person and was always the first sign that my parents would be going out for the evening.  </li>
            <li>Because of this I loved and ordered it only to find the one I bought did not have same potency.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this subtle sexy scent.</li>
            <li>I had smelled this scent at a duty free overseas and sprayed some on myself before leaving the duty free to smell it later , 24 hours later still on me!</li>

            <li>I bought this product from P. Trading LLC and it did not arrive in the original box but in a white, pen written box.</li>
            <li>Bought it in the store the first time, the price is completely comparable to getting it online.</li>
            <li>I was originally looking for the smaller size of this fragrance because of the price, but after finding the larger size for just a little more, went for it!  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very fruity and soft.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad scent and nice for winter, but at this price point you can get perfumes that truly rock your world, and sadly this one doesn&#x27;t quite qualify.</li>

            <li>I am a fan of &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; fragrances and this fragrance has notes of black cherry, black rose, patchouli, and black tea.</li>
            <li>For a while it&#x27;s almost a powdery cherry, which I absolutely LOVE, but then it finally fully dries down to  simple cherries with small floral hints.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this scent, very summery!</li>
            <li> Fabulous! I get so many compliments on this subtle sexy scent.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic. It comes off floral then bam the cherries hit. For a while it&#x27;s almost a powdery cherry, which I absolutely LOVE, but then it finally fully dries down to  simple cherries with small floral hints. It&#x27;s fantastic. I could see how it might remind someone of artificial grapes but even then it&#x27;s still so good. Going to be a regular for me. BUT. I would not buy this here. Get it from fragrance.net. It&#x27;s the same price and their stuff is ALWAYS authentic.</li>
            <li> Got the name of this perfume from a French couple in a hotel in Chicago.  Went on-line and bought it for my wife.  She instantly loved it and she still gets comments.  Got me lots of &amp;#34;good husband&amp;#34; points - never hurts.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves this and my daughters and friends have their eyes on it. It&#x27;ll be shared, sigh.  Beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> The perfume I received doesn&#x27;t appear to be authentic - not only has the packaging been tampered with, with unique identification cut out of it, it doesn&#x27;t smell right either. I have used this perfume before and have another bottle and this one does not correspond to the design in many ways - the bottle shape, the details on the writing. I am very disappointed, especially as this review was previously deleted despite my photo evidence. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Too sweet, dont like it</li>
            <li> It a perfekt Parfum and super Preise.</li>
            <li> The scent wears off after 5 minutes! I had smelled this scent at a duty free overseas and sprayed some on myself before leaving the duty free to smell it later , 24 hours later still on me! Because of this I loved and ordered it only to find the one I bought did not have same potency. Disappointed:(</li>
            <li> I bought this product from P. Trading LLC and it did not arrive in the original box but in a white, pen written box. This was supposed to be a gift and since I must admit I bought it in the nick of time I had to give the person something else because I was not going to give a perfume that looked as if I had stolen it from the store.&lt;br /&gt;I paid around 60usd for it but I assumed the low price was due to Black Friday deals and not to the product being a tester or something alike. If thr seller had advertised that, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; service</li>
            <li> Really lovely,fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;Only giving it 4 stars as I feel like it looses it fragrance after a little while of wearing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume. Bought it in the store the first time, the price is completely comparable to getting it online. This is the one perfume that ALWAYS gets my boyfriends attention. Hiiiiiighly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is real stuff (I was nervous as the price per ounce is so much cheaper). It&#x27;s a heady mix of black cherry... Incense... A smoky scent almost.. Well that&#x27;s what it reminds me of most; check fragrantica for the real description ;) It&#x27;s lasting power and sillage on me are much better than most, but that is to be expected from the house of Guerlain :)</li>
            <li> I went to a very formal party and noticed a beautiful fragrance on a friend who attended. I asked her what she was wearing and she told me La Petite Robe Noire. It took me some time to find it but I found Amazon carried it so I immediately purchased it. I am not able to identify each individual note as some of the other reviewers...but I can identify the cherry. It smells strongly like cherry syrup. It was wonderful on my friend but not on me. It must have something to do with our individual body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Omg, Love, Love this parfum,, nothing is better than this big bottle of Guerlain, it&#x27;s such a beautiful bottle. It&#x27;s completely worth the price, I will be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I was originally looking for the smaller size of this fragrance because of the price, but after finding the larger size for just a little more, went for it!  Shipped pretty quick also!</li>
            <li> I love La Petite Robe Noire perfume - it is just fabulous.  I love to wear it alone, or layer it with the scented lotion for added impact.  What a great scent.  Very fruity and soft.  It just makes me feel warm and wonderful all over.</li>
            <li> Sophisticated, sweet, and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this as a birthday present for my girlfriend and love the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;It starts off with sort of a bitter opening, but mellows down to a very floral and sweet scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This perfume is worth the money. I am a fan of &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; fragrances and this fragrance has notes of black cherry, black rose, patchouli, and black tea. It&#x27;s very unique and long-lasting. The bottle is absolutely beautiful as well. Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but in this case you definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> My wife received a sample of La Petite Robe Noire and abolutely loves it. She was disappointed there wasn&#x27;t more in the packet. Guess I know what she&#x27;s getting for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and no problems.</li>
            <li> The scent of Guerlin&#x27;s Shalimar harkens back to my childhood.  It transformed my mother into a glamorous person and was always the first sign that my parents would be going out for the evening.  It was exotic, strong and deliberate.  I love  that Guerlin is producing modern fragrances and La Petite Robe Noire stands out in the same way.  Loved it even more when my doorman told me I was the best smelling tenant in our building.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth assessment, was rejected by the ruthless three times before. Cause I don&#x27;t want to say too much, you can see for yourself, the following pictures is that I got the perfume Because I bought the perfume is fake，I don&#x27;t know why I did not upload photos, it makes me very disappointed</li>
            <li> This is very much a dark cherry syrup scent, with almost a medicinal quality.Think Nyquil. I do not detect the other notes, which would make this composition more interesting. Not a bad scent and nice for winter, but at this price point you can get perfumes that truly rock your world, and sadly this one doesn&#x27;t quite qualify. Guerlain has dropped the ball a bit on this one. I would give 3.5 stars if possible, but alas I had to downgrade a notch for lack of originality.</li>
            <li> T z Nat wat I expected. T doesn&#x27;t last long n t z Nat dat strong. Though delivery was fast but Nat happy with the product..</li>
            <li> Fake fake fake!!Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT, AND DELIVERY BEFORE I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I wear nothing else.</li>
            <li> I must admit that the scent is really fantastic, but the annoying thing is that it doesn&#x27;t last more than half an hour. I didn&#x27;t expect that from Guerlain...</li>
            <li> Every gal should have a little black dress. My wife loves this perfume. Happy wife, happy life :)&lt;br /&gt;Best price in my search and shipped as promised. Shipper appears to be responsible. Thank you for that.</li>
