            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this polish couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere this is good for doing designs on nails making it look like stars snow ect</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>

            <li>This is a nice iridescent glitter that covers well, even in one coat.</li>
            <li>It glides on very easily</li>
            <li>Looks good alone or over another color, It does chip easily though but putting on a top coat helps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>But Snowglobe is okay too.</li>
            <li>I love to put it as a top coat to add sparkles on my nails.</li>
            <li>Was looking for more of a silver/glitter for Christmas nails...</li>
            <li>Snow globe is a great name for this glitter polish because it is very reminisent of snow.  </li>
            <li>more sequin-y than glittery, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>still cute if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li>I just absolutely love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>It is not one of those glitter polishes where you have to put three costs or more costs to get the sparkle.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>but I love China Glaze</li>
            <li>Perfect for doing cheetah print or even regular nail designs.</li>
            <li>requires too many coats.</li>

            <li>I love the China Glaze products. :)</li>

            <li>I love nail polishes and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>I love how the glitter&lt;</li>
            <li>More gold when I was expecting a silvery shine but still a very pretty color!</li>
            <li>This color has more silver than I originally thought.</li>
            <li>It is chock full of iridescent rainbow shifting glitters of many sizes.</li>
            <li>and it looked super cute with the color I had underneath.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a pure white, sparkly, holographic glaze, good for any color polish-this is it!!</li>
            <li>so light</li>
            <li>color is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Comparable to OPI and Orly, this brand is great for long wear because it doesn&#x27;t chip easily or stain the nails.</li>
            <li>This looks great over the top of any other polish, it adds a dash of sparkle to any day.</li>
            <li>When I got it, I was not disappointed with trusting my intuition.</li>
            <li>That may be something to consider if you&#x27;re looking for what I believe is the original version.</li>
            <li>Looks great over white and black but would be nice over any color or on its own.</li>
            <li>I use it as a top coat on different colors for a nice shimmer.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this polish will be just as good as any other from them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must have for special occasions.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t stay on my nails very long--it needs more lacquer.  </li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t need more then a coat.</li>
            <li>By far the best used as a top coat over white or a light blue.</li>
            <li>Super glittery</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>It catches the light so prettily.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Snow Globe!!</li>
            <li>First coat and your are covered!</li>
            <li>I like to change my polish about once every five days, so this definitely helps me keep things interesting!</li>
            <li>This bottle makes me smile each time i look at it.</li>
            <li>and I definitely would purchase this kind of nail polish again</li>
            <li>Behind the glitter it leaves your nails looking glossy and beautiful!</li>
            <li>but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>I love the different sized glitters in it, and it looks really cool over any nail polish you already own, or even by itself.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li>After I received it, I tried it right away.</li>
            <li>I layer this over light polishes in the wintertime, it looks like new fallen snow glistening in the moonlight.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a winter theme, i think it&#x27;s perfect for Easter  and all of spring too, because the colors are light shades of pink, yellow, blue...</li>
            <li>This really does look like a snowglobe!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li>It is a pretty polish though.</li>
            <li>I bought this and its sooo pretty</li>
            <li>If you use more than one coat you&#x27;ll definitely get a lot of sparkles.</li>
            <li>This polish is sooo pretty.  </li>
            <li>This is such a stunning glitter topper.</li>
            <li>Soo pretty.</li>
            <li>Kind of like other glitter nail polishes out there.</li>
            <li>I love china glaze nail polish in general, and this color looks really cute by itself or layered on other colors.</li>
            <li>It is very sparkly and pretty in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice over a dark color on just one nail or on the tips.</li>
            <li>It is filled with all different sizes of pretty glitter.</li>
            <li>FOR THE PRICE PAID, I am extremely satisfied even with the delivery (it was packed in bubble wrap which got a little loose, but it&#x27;s all shipped ground, so, safe to say, no fancy packaging but quick delivery).</li>
            <li>I really wanted Fairy Dust.</li>
            <li>if you really want to sparkle.</li>
            <li>BUT be ready with the acetone.</li>
            <li>Very east to apply and very sparkly.</li>
            <li>This really is like a snow globe on your nail.</li>
            <li>And it does take much acetone to remove.</li>
            <li>It really does look like a snowglobe on my nails.</li>
            <li>Not enough glitters in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better to use plain gliiters with top coat than this one&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ordered two different nail polishes and they are each unique.</li>
            <li>China Glaze is super durable too, doesn&#x27;t chip despite my constant hand and dish washing.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this polish.</li>
            <li>I have gel polish on my nails right now, but I&#x27;m going to use this next time.  </li>
            <li>I see the seller has changed the picture to pure Snow White as the color really is.</li>
            <li>It has much more of a yellowish tint than I expected from various pictures I had looked at before purchasing.</li>
            <li>Goes on clear with circle glitter sparkles!  </li>
            <li>Some of the glitter is actually big enough to do individual glitter placement which I love doing with this polish.</li>
            <li>(It might become the first polish I actually run out of!)  </li>
            <li>It even looked nice over a sheer pink French tip style nail.  </li>
            <li>There are two versions of this out there - one that it full of only the rainbow glitter and one that is mostly full of rainbow shifting glitter and tiny tiny white specs.</li>
            <li>From the picture the polish looks to be like a silver with glitter, when received the item is a clear polish with a bunch of glitter.</li>
            <li>I have tried many glitter polishes at least 10 and Snow Globe and Techno are my favorites.  </li>
            <li>I loved it all and am obsessed with it.</li>
            <li>This item was as sparkly and fun as I expected!</li>
            <li>Also it looks amazing over other solid and dark nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Normally I reach for the solid colors or shimmers in terms of nail polish, but this glitter was too tempting to pass up.</li>
            <li>but it shines at its best over an opaque white base.</li>
            <li>It consists of a bunch of translucent and different sized chunks of glitter in a clear base that mainly reflect light with a golden glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty for the few hours that it lasts.</li>
            <li>Not too much, not too little.  </li>

            <li> Very east to apply and very sparkly.</li>
            <li> This really is like a snow globe on your nail.</li>
            <li> And it does take much acetone to remove.</li>
            <li> It really does look like a snowglobe on my nails.</li>
            <li> Not enough glitters in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better to use plain gliiters with top coat than this one&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered two different nail polishes and they are each unique.</li>
            <li> China Glaze is super durable too, doesn&#x27;t chip despite my constant hand and dish washing.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this polish.</li>
            <li> I have gel polish on my nails right now, but I&#x27;m going to use this next time.  </li>
            <li> I see the seller has changed the picture to pure Snow White as the color really is.</li>
            <li> It has much more of a yellowish tint than I expected from various pictures I had looked at before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear with circle glitter sparkles!  </li>
            <li> Some of the glitter is actually big enough to do individual glitter placement which I love doing with this polish.</li>
            <li> (It might become the first polish I actually run out of!)  </li>
            <li> It even looked nice over a sheer pink French tip style nail.  </li>
            <li> There are two versions of this out there - one that it full of only the rainbow glitter and one that is mostly full of rainbow shifting glitter and tiny tiny white specs.</li>
            <li> From the picture the polish looks to be like a silver with glitter, when received the item is a clear polish with a bunch of glitter.</li>
            <li> I have tried many glitter polishes at least 10 and Snow Globe and Techno are my favorites.  </li>
            <li> I loved it all and am obsessed with it.</li>
            <li> This item was as sparkly and fun as I expected!</li>
            <li> Also it looks amazing over other solid and dark nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Normally I reach for the solid colors or shimmers in terms of nail polish, but this glitter was too tempting to pass up.</li>
            <li> but it shines at its best over an opaque white base.</li>
            <li> It consists of a bunch of translucent and different sized chunks of glitter in a clear base that mainly reflect light with a golden glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty for the few hours that it lasts.</li>
            <li> Not too much, not too little.  </li>
            <li> Small round and slightly bigger hex glitters that gives off a different colors as you turn in the light.</li>
            <li> Subtle and fun.</li>
            <li> I use this polish as a topcoat over my flat lacquers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing it during the winter over grey and blue because it reminds me of snowflakes.</li>
            <li> Beautiful polish - clear base with multi colored small glitter pieces.</li>
            <li> the sparkle is subtle enough that it&#x27;s fit for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Removal is rather annoying, but if you soak a cotton ball in nail polish remover and place it directly on your nail before tightly wrapping your whole finger in aluminium foil for five minutes, it should slide right off your nail!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent polish, but not spectacular.</li>
            <li> also has a kind of soft, milky film that slightly alters your base nail polish.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply compared to my other glitter polishes, which is thick and hard to distribute the glitter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how hard it is to get off, cause I&#x27;m wearing it right now,  </li>
            <li> When I purchased this I expected a peach tone polish as pictured in the display.</li>
            <li> but I put it on over pink polish from China Glaze</li>
            <li> (minus 1 star)    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to remove than a lot of other glitter polishes I have used.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to try it on over other colors!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , works just like all my other china glaze polishes do</li>
            <li> Use acetone on a cotton pad and press the saturated pad down on your nail for about 10 seconds to loosen the polish before rubbing it off.</li>
            <li> , you can wear this to dress up or just wear dressed down.</li>
            <li> I will be sad when they discontinue this particular brand/color/sparkle factor.</li>
            <li> Two coats creates a gunky mess though.</li>
            <li> There is the ablity to add just a little with one coat or a bunch with two coats.  </li>
            <li> I tried 2 coats and it was a little too \\&quot;much\\&quot; for me.</li>
            <li> Getting it off takes a little work</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is so heavy that it caused my manicure to chip and crack in about four days.</li>
            <li> This is not a magical solution but it should help and speed up the process.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have a chipping problem but after about 20 minutes at work and chucks were flaking off.</li>
            <li> I seriously adore it.</li>
            <li> , I know I would definitely put on a base coat if I wore it alone</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see anything wrong wearing this year round if you feel &#x27;glitzy&#x27;!!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve heard glitter is a pain to get off, but I think if you wear a base coat it should be a little easier to get it off.</li>
            <li> It chipped like crazy for me!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> beautiful on everything!</li>
            <li> Nice over a dark color on just one nail or on the tips.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this I expected a peach tone polish as pictured in the display. It must be the orange background paper that gives the polish this orange cast. I now have 2 of them as I already had this one at home. If you are looking for a pure white, sparkly, holographic glaze, good for any color polish-this is it!! It&#x27;s my favorite. I purchased this for the peach tone. I contacted the seller and hopefully they will change this picture and not mislead any one else.&lt;br /&gt; I hope this will be a helpful hint for you. Do like the professionals when removing nail polish. Use acetone on a cotton pad and press the saturated pad down on your nail for about 10 seconds to loosen the polish before rubbing it off. This is not a magical solution but it should help and speed up the process.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE It is now Sept 18,2012. I see the seller has changed the picture to pure Snow White as the color really is.</li>
            <li> It has much more of a yellowish tint than I expected from various pictures I had looked at before purchasing. Otherwise, really great! China Glaze almost never disappoints me.</li>
            <li> This really does look like a snowglobe! Beautiful polish - clear base with multi colored small glitter pieces. Looks great over white and black but would be nice over any color or on its own.</li>
            <li> This item was as sparkly and fun as I expected! Can&#x27;t wait to mix it up with some white nail-polish for the holidays.  Seller did an amazing job.  Placed the order on Tuesday and received the item by Thursday. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is absolutely beautiful. Looks like a snowglobe on your nails yet the sparkle is subtle enough that it&#x27;s fit for everyday wear. Good coverage and goes on nicely. China Glaze is super durable too, doesn&#x27;t chip despite my constant hand and dish washing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of good reviews. It&#x27;s a decent polish, but not spectacular. Kind of like other glitter nail polishes out there. I use the wet n wild because its cheaper. This one has bigger glitter in it.</li>
            <li> I ordered Fairy Dust and received Snowglobe... This is such a shame! I really wanted Fairy Dust. But Snowglobe is okay too.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t stay on my nails very long--it needs more lacquer.  If you&#x27;re looking for a finer glitter, this one isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> The nail polish was perfect! I loved it all and am obsessed with it. I love to put it as a top coat to add sparkles on my nails.</li>
            <li> From the picture the polish looks to be like a silver with glitter, when received the item is a clear polish with a bunch of glitter. Not what I was expecting. Was looking for more of a silver/glitter for Christmas nails...</li>
            <li> I 💜China Glaze!! I really like the Snow Globe!! It&#x27;s so pretty, you can wear this to dress up or just wear dressed down. I love how it will make any finger nail polish color look dazzling!! Very nice. I bought china Glaze Gold glitter for the holidays to put over red nail polish or I can wear Snow Globe on my red nails.. I&#x27;m not sure how hard it is to get off, cause I&#x27;m wearing it right now,  but I put it on over pink polish from China Glaze, I know I would definitely put on a base coat if I wore it alone, I&#x27;ve heard glitter is a pain to get off, but I think if you wear a base coat it should be a little easier to get it off.</li>
            <li> Not enough glitters in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better to use plain gliiters with top coat than this one&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the glitter itself in this bottle either</li>
            <li> Snow globe is a great name for this glitter polish because it is very reminisent of snow.  There is the ablity to add just a little with one coat or a bunch with two coats.  This looks great over the top of any other polish, it adds a dash of sparkle to any day.</li>
            <li> more sequin-y than glittery, in my opinion. still cute if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for. also has a kind of soft, milky film that slightly alters your base nail polish.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this polish. I didn&#x27;t like the amount of sparkle that one coat provided. Two coats creates a gunky mess though. It chipped like crazy for me! I don&#x27;t usually have a chipping problem but after about 20 minutes at work and chucks were flaking off.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the color is perfect. And it does actually look like a snowglobe! I seriously adore it.</li>
            <li> I just absolutely love this nail polish. It is not one of those glitter polishes where you have to put three costs or more costs to get the sparkle. First coat and your are covered! Love this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not tried this polish yet but I love China Glaze and I&#x27;m sure this polish will be just as good as any other from them. It is very sparkly and pretty in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swatches will be up soon on my bog at hannahsnails11.blogspot.com or on instagram @hannahsnails11</li>
            <li> I layer this over light polishes in the wintertime, it looks like new fallen snow glistening in the moonlight. It&#x27;s easier to remove than a lot of other glitter polishes I have used. Comparable to OPI and Orly, this brand is great for long wear because it doesn&#x27;t chip easily or stain the nails. I will be sad when they discontinue this particular brand/color/sparkle factor.</li>
            <li> Love it! I tried 2 coats and it was a little too \\&quot;much\\&quot; for me. I like it with just one. Subtle and fun. A must have for any nail polish collection!</li>
            <li> Perfect amount of sparkle! Just what i was looking for. Perfect for doing cheetah print or even regular nail designs.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Beautiful polish.</li>
            <li> not enough glitter.  requires too many coats.</li>
            <li> By far the best used as a top coat over white or a light blue. Gives that extra bling for Christmas nails.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the polish I was looking for, but pictures don&#x27;t always do color justice.  It is a pretty polish though.</li>
            <li> This bottle makes me smile each time i look at it. It has all  different sizes glitter and the color screams CONFETTI !     One coat is enough. You get the big pieces along with the smaller ones.  2 if you really want to sparkle. BUT be ready with the acetone. it&#x27;s a nightmare to take off! (minus 1 star)    Even though it&#x27;s a winter theme, i think it&#x27;s perfect for Easter  and all of spring too, because the colors are light shades of pink, yellow, blue...</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m a hoarder for nail polish I bought this and its sooo pretty and I definitely would purchase this kind of nail polish again luv luv luv it!!!</li>
            <li> My finger tips and toes are sparkly.  I feel lovely.  It looks very nice indeed.  Not too much, not too little.  Very good quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this polish couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere this is good for doing designs on nails making it look like stars snow ect the price was a steal</li>
            <li> Adds a touch of sparkle to any polish color</li>
            <li> Normally I reach for the solid colors or shimmers in terms of nail polish, but this glitter was too tempting to pass up. When I got it, I was not disappointed with trusting my intuition. It consists of a bunch of translucent and different sized chunks of glitter in a clear base that mainly reflect light with a golden glow. It&#x27;s amazing on it&#x27;s own but it shines at its best over an opaque white base. Also it looks amazing over other solid and dark nail polishes. Removal is rather annoying, but if you soak a cotton ball in nail polish remover and place it directly on your nail before tightly wrapping your whole finger in aluminium foil for five minutes, it should slide right off your nail!</li>
            <li> Beautiful,and gorgeous,and AWESOMENESS</li>
            <li> Super glittery and I love it. Goes great on top of all the colors I have tried!</li>
            <li> More gold when I was expecting a silvery shine but still a very pretty color! I use it as a top coat on different colors for a nice shimmer.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is beautiful and does look like the inside of a snow globe. Very east to apply and very sparkly.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. Looks good alone or over another color, It does chip easily though but putting on a top coat helps.</li>
            <li> This polish is beautiful.  It catches the light so prettily.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it by itself since it so light but it works well over just about any color.</li>
            <li> This color has more silver than I originally thought. However, still a beautiful color. I love the China Glaze products. :)</li>
            <li> If you use more than one coat you&#x27;ll definitely get a lot of sparkles. I used it as a top off coat and it looked super cute with the color I had underneath. If you like sparkles then you should get this nail polish!! You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This really is like a snow globe on your nail. I love it!</li>
            <li> I used this a top coat. I tried this over CG Innocence. It does make the color pop/stand out! Small round and slightly bigger hex glitters that gives off a different colors as you turn in the light. It does reminds me of the glistening snow globes.&lt;br /&gt; It was easy to apply compared to my other glitter polishes, which is thick and hard to distribute the glitter. I&#x27;ve used only one coat over, but suggest 1-2 coats if you&#x27;re wearing this alone.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try it on over other colors!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see anything wrong wearing this year round if you feel &#x27;glitzy&#x27;!!</li>
            <li> This polish is sooo pretty.  I have gel polish on my nails right now, but I&#x27;m going to use this next time.  I am tempted to put it on over my gel polish and I just may do that.</li>
            <li> I love the shimmer it gives to any color. Definite must have for any nail collection. Would buy it again</li>
            <li> I use this polish as a topcoat over my flat lacquers. It looks wonderful over just about every color since the glitters are luminescent. Unfortunately, it is so heavy that it caused my manicure to chip and crack in about four days. And it does take much acetone to remove. I like to change my polish about once every five days, so this definitely helps me keep things interesting!</li>
            <li> I HAD to have this polish when I came across it on line. After I received it, I tried it right away. It chipped by the end of the day. I&#x27;ve had it for awhile now and I&#x27;ve only used it about three times. It&#x27;s really pretty for the few hours that it lasts.</li>
            <li> I love this, I am so happy with this purchase.  I love it.  It glides on very easily and you really don&#x27;t need more then a coat. It sparkles so nicely and reminds me of winter in Mountain Washington, NH.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and I was so happy to find it so cheap on amazon, works just like all my other china glaze polishes do so now I know where to find them at a better price!</li>
            <li> Great nail polish!  Goes on clear with circle glitter sparkles!  Like a polka-dot rainbow!  Behind the glitter it leaves your nails looking glossy and beautiful! Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This is a nice iridescent glitter that covers well, even in one coat. It holds up well too. This is a must have for any nail polish arsenal.</li>
            <li> Love, loce, love!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The color is fantastic. FOR THE PRICE PAID, I am extremely satisfied even with the delivery (it was packed in bubble wrap which got a little loose, but it&#x27;s all shipped ground, so, safe to say, no fancy packaging but quick delivery). I ordered two different nail polishes and they are each unique.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a while. I love the different sized glitters in it, and it looks really cool over any nail polish you already own, or even by itself.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I have tried many glitter polishes at least 10 and Snow Globe and Techno are my favorites.  I brought 5 bottles of Snow Globe and 5 bottles of Techno. One Coat is all you need to get a magically affect on any polish you use.  Getting it off takes a little work but it is so worth it. I even brought this polish to give as gifts.  A lot of glitter polishes do go on without creating an inconsistent cover.  Techno and Snow Globe each glide on with an even distribution of glitter in one stroke. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it. I guarantee you will be happy with this purchase.  No nail polish collection should be without it.  It makes any polish look like you have pastel diamonds on your fingers and toes. The picture does not do this product any justice; it does not show the way the fools gold affect that he glitter has in person. It&#x27;s a must have for special occasions.</li>
            <li> This is such a stunning glitter topper. It is chock full of iridescent rainbow shifting glitters of many sizes. It really does look like a snowglobe on my nails. There are two versions of this out there - one that it full of only the rainbow glitter and one that is mostly full of rainbow shifting glitter and tiny tiny white specs. Thankfully the seller I bought from sold the one that was solid rainbow shifting glitter. That may be something to consider if you&#x27;re looking for what I believe is the original version. Great staying power, and the wonderful quality formula you would expect from China Glaze. Beautiful for the holidays and winter season.</li>
            <li> A gift for granddaughter, She loved it. Works god.</li>
            <li> It is filled with all different sizes of pretty glitter. Some of the glitter is actually big enough to do individual glitter placement which I love doing with this polish. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love nail polishes and this is one of my favorites.  I&#x27;ve used this over every color I have.  (It might become the first polish I actually run out of!)  It even looked nice over a sheer pink French tip style nail.  It&#x27;s a great buy because of how versatile it is.  I&#x27;m wearing it during the winter over grey and blue because it reminds me of snowflakes.</li>
            <li> Soo pretty. I love how the glitter&lt;br /&gt;is multi-colored and chunky and my daughter&lt;br /&gt;Loves it also. I will have to get another one.</li>
            <li> I love china glaze nail polish in general, and this color looks really cute by itself or layered on other colors. It seems to take on a different attitude depending on what it is paired with!</li>
