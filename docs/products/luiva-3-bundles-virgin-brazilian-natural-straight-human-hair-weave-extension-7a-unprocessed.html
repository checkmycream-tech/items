            <li> its very thin i expected more</li>
            <li> im convince this hair is not natural hair,worst hair ever</li>
            <li> They advertised that when you purchase this hair you get 300g of hair and when I recieved the hair it was very rough and after weighing it was only 175g DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR</li>
            <li> The hair in  the  picture looked thick and healthy the hair I received was very dry and thin</li>

            <li> A total waste of money!</li>
            <li> Hair is soft with very little shedding,however the bundles are a bit small.</li>
            <li> When I got the hair it didn&#x27;t look like the picture and was a little upset that it wasn&#x27;t like the picture.</li>
            <li> , sigh such an utter disappointment.</li>
            <li> I did not get the hair on the pic and the hair I got is thin n coarse</li>
            <li> Smh waste</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>

            <li> , I also immediately smelled the chemicals on it, the ends are cut like a straight edge, the hair is thin and these are not full bundles maybe 60-70g.. Horrible product, this is the most disappointing thing I have ever bought from amazon.</li>
            <li> They make it look like a big bundle  when its fake, will never order.</li>

            <li> The hair is soooooo thin .</li>
            <li> but the reason why I&#x27;m giving this product a two star rating is that I was taken aback by how thin each bundle was.</li>
            <li> But it deff sheds and the bundles are thin.</li>
            <li> Hair was extremely thin and showed to be processed.</li>
            <li> I was confused</li>

            <li> This hair is wonderful..! Great texture not thin as everyone says.</li>
            <li> Just got my hair on monday and the only thing so far i can honestly say about  it is that the hair texture is nice and it actually does come in its unprocessed natural state...but the reason why I&#x27;m giving this product a two star rating is that I was taken aback by how thin each bundle was. Its not double weft but  single, you would have to order another 3 bundle to give the illusion of having THREE bundles in your hair!!!, sigh such an utter disappointment.</li>
            <li> Best Hair I have ever bought! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the length, but it does not tangle or shed. I will be placing my order here soon, â€‹but I have been able to use this hair for 2 and 1/2 months so far.!!!</li>
            <li> The hair was silky and soft the feel it was also very good. The hair had no bad smell also which was a very good thing for me.. i definitely recommend this hair and i will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Seller is very nice &amp; understanding. I received my hair fast and it has a very nice texture. Soft and &amp; I absolutely love it! Great price too. Thanks#</li>
            <li> I colored it n it melted. Texture was nice however  Never get to wear it.</li>
            <li> Omg this weave is okay. But it deff sheds and the bundles are thin. I mean so thin its crazy. I would not reccommend this hair . Its stiff too. Smh waste</li>
            <li> The hair was not how they made it seam</li>
            <li> this hair is very is very thin  and shades a lot</li>
            <li> The quality hair is OK,  but bungle was really too small for the price, the three bungles together was just like one.</li>
            <li> the worse weave ever!</li>
            <li> the  hair is of pretty good quality  a little thin at the ends bundles are small</li>
            <li> This hair was the worst hair I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Ive had synthetic hair that was cheaper and better quality. Extremely thin, bad smell to it and one of the sizes was cut straight across the bottom to be the size they said it would be. All of then look the same size. Taking it right out of the packaging there was hair everywhere, not sure if it was shedding or what they have cut. Not a good choice at all. I didn&#x27;t even unravel any of it i knew i want even gonna attempt to put it in. A total waste of money!</li>
            <li> Nice quality of hair.. bundles are small, it arrived exactly on the estimated day.</li>
            <li> They advertised that when you purchase this hair you get 300g of hair and when I recieved the hair it was very rough and after weighing it was only 175g DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order. Sheds by the comb full. Very disappointed. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Horrible!  Hair was extremely thin and showed to be processed. Original was brown!</li>
            <li> the hair is awesome!! i have it in now. i will be buying more in a month or so. once again the hair is awesome</li>
            <li> Only took it out of the pack and already know this is not virgin hair at all. Very disappointed. Bundles extremely small as well. You&#x27;d get more out of beauty supply store hair for less. False advertising</li>
            <li> When I got the hair it didn&#x27;t look like the picture and was a little upset that it wasn&#x27;t like the picture. You all false avertised the hair.</li>
            <li> HAIR IS VERY THIN , SHEEDS FAST,  HORRIBLE QUALITY</li>
            <li> The Bundles Were Very Thing &amp; The Wefts Were Short , 3 Bundles Didn&#x27;t Look Full Enough &amp; in the picture is all 3 bundles together.</li>
            <li> This hair is terrible! It sheds, tangles, and is just awful! What a disappointment</li>
            <li> The Hair is great and the price was beyond reasonable. ... I love it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed . It&#x27;s very thin,can&#x27;t do half an head....</li>
            <li> Hair NICE .Not Tangly and good Quality... BUT the Quantity is not much, so It looks like I have to order more .  Also the ends need to be cut .</li>
            <li> I got the hair the today and as soon as I opened it I was confused I thought maybe the seller sent the wrong hair. The hair was shedding as soon as I pulled it from the bag (in the picture the top left side of the paper is the shedding that immediately happened), I also immediately smelled the chemicals on it, the ends are cut like a straight edge, the hair is thin and these are not full bundles maybe 60-70g.. Horrible product, this is the most disappointing thing I have ever bought from amazon. And even now that I have requested a refund and I have already sent the hair back the seller hasn&#x27;t even contacted me at all PLEASE DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Just processing of the hair getting ready to go back to school just took my hair out the pack and I went to bleach it and my end results wasn&#x27;t to well. All my hair shredded and broke off I am highly disappointed! Although it is two days past the day I need some more hair or my cash back it is HORRIBLE! It&#x27;s supposed to be 16 18 20 it all looks like 12</li>
            <li> The hair came on time but the bundles are really thin and I don&#x27;t think that this is really virgin brazilian hair cause I have purchased alot of hair and I know I will never buy this hair again</li>
            <li> It was not good quality hair, it got nappy In a week</li>
