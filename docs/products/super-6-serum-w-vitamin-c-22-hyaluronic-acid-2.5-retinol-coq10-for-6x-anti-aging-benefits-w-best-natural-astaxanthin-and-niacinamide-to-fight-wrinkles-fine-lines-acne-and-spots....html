            <li>I did get this for a review, but my opinion is 100% honest!</li>

            <li>I am just loving this product!  </li>

            <li>But I&#x27;m truly surprised by and very happy with the improvements I see from using Best Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>This is a great face serum with a lot more great ingredients than just the 6 featured on the front of the label.</li>
            <li>The color is a bright orange, but does not stay that color on the skin when applied.  </li>
            <li>The bright orange color lets you see where you are applying it</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good  organic serum, with results, try this one.</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel really good.</li>
            <li>i just loved this serum.</li>

            <li>Im looking forward to seeing good results from this serum</li>
            <li>I was reading a review of serums and this brand was mentioned as being superior.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is thicker and not runny, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>and it seems like it&#x27;s really good quality and well made,</li>
            <li>The consistency seems good, though I have never used serums before, so I have nothing to compare it with.  </li>
            <li>good but</li>
            <li>Love love love!!!!</li>
            <li>Both are super great!</li>
            <li>The bottom line:  this a an excellent product and a GREAT value if you have realistic expectations about what to expect from any beauty treatment.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>but I feel compelled to write this one because I truly am beyond satisfied with this product, the serum is great</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results ..</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the quality and texture.</li>
            <li>The scent alone is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I liked that even though it is a bright orange color, it didn&#x27;t stain or color my skin.  </li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t seen a difference, but that&#x27;s good, because with this 1 product I&#x27;m replacing 3</li>
            <li>I really love this serum!</li>
            <li>and also I do feel my skin is looking more youthful, which is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love Body Merry&#x27;s products!</li>

            <li>This antioxidant helps reduce inflammation, protects skin cells and is especially useful under sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Nice feel to my skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle came in its own box, sealed, not in bubble wrap as some others have stated.</li>
            <li>I purchased this during a promotional pricing period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li>RECEIVED THIS item in Exchange FOR MY UNBIASED HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li>I really liked this serum.  </li>
            <li>My skin is loving this serum.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with what it has done.</li>
            <li>liked that it didn&#x27;t sting when I applied it.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>but i just had to let everyone know that this is gentle to the skin and very effective!</li>
            <li>I mainly use Paula&#x27;s Choice products and am very happy with them but read the reviews on this product and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li>color of the serum is orange, love the smell not too strong and just great.</li>
            <li>This product was provided for review, thank you......s orange, love the smell not too strong and just great.</li>
            <li>MANY THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li>Loved this super 6 serum!</li>
            <li>I like that this product is suitable for men or women to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Body Merry packaging is so bright and cheerful.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best serum I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with product, now after three uses.</li>
            <li>Very happy so far.</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbed and skin feels great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great serum, it goes on super smooth but doesn&#x27;t make your face look oily!</li>
            <li>and I also use it with the body merry super c-22 moisturizer, and let me tell you it works!!</li>
            <li>Its a bright orange color that absorbs into your skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The serum is not greasy or slimy after it dries (very quickly) and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>so Body Merry Super Serum 6 is already superior in that regard that it has 22% Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free, for a review, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>it tightens your skin and makes it look more radiant.</li>
            <li>i love the way it dispenses.</li>
            <li>and he thinks it is by far the best retinol serum he has tried out of all the Body Merry serums available.</li>
            <li>I love that it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering odor!</li>
            <li>I love it as an addition to my routine that allows me to get vitamin c and retinol in one</li>
            <li>I love this product and I will continue using it.</li>
            <li>find my face smooth and silky in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Worthy to try!</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin is a lot softer, more hydrated, and looks brighter.</li>
            <li>This serum helps your skin soak up moisturizer way better.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE that this serum is made in the USA and is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>My skin feels brighter, more hydrated and firmer</li>
            <li>Nice light serum.</li>
            <li>In all, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>So many benefits.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice light serum for the face.</li>
            <li>For even more hydration a separate moisturizing cream can be used.</li>
            <li>I love combining a number of ingredients into one &amp;#34;Super&amp;#34; serum.</li>
            <li>This product combines 6 wonderful ingredients that are essential in skin care.</li>
            <li>So I decided to look into more conservative measures, like serums and moisturizers with beneficial ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, so I never write reviews</li>
            <li>so I was nervous to use it because it didn&#x27;t want it to over moisturize and cause more oil and clogged pores</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wait, just buy it and you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li>I love how it feels as it goes onto my skin.  </li>
            <li>This serum is one of my favorite ones to use.</li>
            <li>Will update more after the 4 wk recommended use period.</li>
            <li>It seemed to have made me breakout more...</li>
            <li>My skin looks more youthful, plumper, more even-toned and no need for primer before makeup.</li>
            <li>Overall, not too impressed.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for one week and my skin feels better every day.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my face</li>
            <li>It works really good for those laugh lines &amp; crows feet :)</li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>love that this company is cruelty-free and uses sustainable products.</li>
            <li>I like that this serum is for age defense, which, is what I need the most.</li>
            <li>Somehow I prefer the moisturizer because I think it is more brightening.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m still glad I got the serum too</li>
            <li>Love this serum.</li>
            <li>Healthy and makes me look better...</li>
            <li>I have found this to be as described and am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Three months later:  I am beautiful!!!  </li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>and instead my skin felt better and started looking better too.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li>and my face is brighter, smoother and has a healthy glow</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS...</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE.....</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is my favorite anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh and bright.</li>
            <li>just AWESOME... CLEARING MY FACE UPON REGULAR USE.</li>
            <li>I used different Vitamin C serum, this one is the best, I intend to reorder.</li>
            <li>If used with a potent spot treatment cream, it can boost more whitening power.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product to use in place of a moisturizer or as an extra.  </li>
            <li>The serum comes in an amber colored jar with a dropper top.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product to use in place of a moisturizer or as an extra.  </li>
            <li>The serum comes in an amber colored jar with a dropper top.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles now, but I think this may help to prevent it.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency because it&#x27;s not too watery.</li>
            <li>Another thing I love about this serum is that it also contains 2.5% retinol.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pleased that I can have both with one application.</li>
            <li>I love using this serum.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite face product and I have many.</li>
            <li>I also notice some brightening in my pigmentation :)</li>
            <li>I really love the way that this makes my skin feel and what it does for the appearance and texture.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it!</li>
            <li>I was pleased that it was sealed.</li>
            <li>did a lot of research before purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the price, results, and performance.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this on my own, I was not offered a discount or free product in order to review it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have been using Vitamin C Serum for several years along with Retinol, with excellent results.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I wait just a couple of minutes after applying the serum before I use the moisturizer, to make sure the serum does not get diluted.</li>
            <li>I tried to save $10 and not buy the C22 brand, but it is much better</li>
            <li>I was seriously considering another retailer that has excellent reviews and a great reputation, and they were offering a set of 2 products, a vitamin C serum and a moisturizer, also with vitamin C.</li>
            <li>It has kind of a unique smell, but not stinky.</li>
            <li>Body Merry creates several good good products &amp; the Super 6 Serum is a good product.</li>
            <li>Both had a great list of ingredients, but the price was still high.</li>
            <li>I love the carrot kind of smell and how quickly it absorbs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t make my very light skin orange.</li>
            <li>The serum is a bright orange color and when I first put it on, my skin is orange for about 2 seconds and then it absorbs and you can&#x27;t see any color, so don&#x27;t worry about that.</li>
            <li>I am loving Body Merry&#x27;s Age Defense Super 6 Serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this every night, I love how easy it soaks in, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Has a lovely scent and smoothes onto the skin easily.</li>
            <li>Skin tone is more even, fine lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li>It surely helps with my depigmentation and fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of products over the years and spent a lot of money, but I have found this one is the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.  </li>

            <li>The age defense super 6 serum came in a dropper bottle which made it very easy for application.  </li>

            <li>I especially notice this wonderful effect when I apply it after I first wake up in the morning!</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying this is the most customer friendly skin care company I have ever dealt with.  </li>
            <li>The dropper is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used great products for 35 years and it has paid off (I&#x27;m 60) and people are always asking me what I do because my skin does look 15 years younger than many.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and it absorbs quicly.</li>
            <li>It has strong orange color</li>
            <li>It however went on smoothly and was absorbed nicely into the skin without leaving a sticky feeling or residue.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>It helps brighten my skin, and it&#x27;s smoothing out my fine lines.</li>
            <li>The product plumps the skin and hides fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>- This is an antioxidant that can stimulate the production of collagen and minimizes fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br</li>

            <li>It &amp;#34;helps to diminish the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, but also leaves your skin plump, hydrated and nourished with an even and brighter looking complexion.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>

            <li>But, the smell wasn&#x27;t so fabulous.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it dissipated quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>It goes on easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>And so far their products have had an exceptional impression on me.</li>

            <li>It feels a bit greasy when it comes out of the bottle, but once you massage it onto your skin, it absorbs quickly, (very quickly, in my case, so I have to work quickly).</li>
            <li>After only a couple weeks of using this product I have seen remarkable results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that the higher percentage of vitamin C, the more face lifting performance.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve always used vitamin c on my face and this is the best by far, next to alina skin care&#x27;s serum.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel smooth and nice and absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li>While we don&#x27;t offer magic in a bottle, Body Merry&#x27;s Age Defense Super 6 Serum comes pretty close.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my aunt because I received a special discount from the seller to test it.</li>
            <li>For this reason alone, I would most certainly buy this again.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how wonderful my skin will look after a few weeks of consistent use.</li>
            <li>The serum has a bright orange tint, but I only use it at night so it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a bright orangey-red color) and the smell is different.</li>
            <li>I do like this company and their products, so expect only good results.</li>

            <li>The directions for the Super 6 Serum state to apply a moisturizer after using the Super 6 Serum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>It has an orange color and the scent is mild and almost reminds me of cucumbers.</li>
            <li>Age Defense Super</li>
            <li>Sarah emailed soon after and recommended the Super 6 Serum.  </li>
            <li>Age Defense Super 6 Serum provided by Body Merry.......</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Super 6 Serum for about a week</li>
            <li>This one is packed with vitamin C and so much more its really the most complete I have tried .</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>My skin is acne-prone yet also dry, and this is one of the first serums I have tried that I have actually liked, rather than just was okay with.</li>
            <li>I love this new product.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I find that it is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t have any lingering scent.  </li>
            <li>which is exactly what I was hoping to achieve!</li>
            <li>This dries very fast and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>This serum goes on first (after cleansing with mild cleanser and then mild toner to take off every trace of makeup).....</li>
            <li>My skin texture is really nice and smooth, and the few fine lines I had have been minimized.</li>
            <li>My skin texture is really nice and smooth, and the few fine lines I had have been minimized.</li>
            <li>it is great for all skin types and you see the difference after just few uses.</li>
            <li>The biggest thing I&#x27;ve noticed is how smooth my skin is, very noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>This product applies smoothly on my skin, it is not irritating</li>
            <li>I hope I will enjoy it as much as this product.</li>
            <li>The product remains fresh for 12 months after opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know, it sounds so attractive, but I am in my 40s and while I honestly do not have any wrinkles or crows feet, I really want the tone of my skin to be more even and improved.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will also help with my acne scars and smile lines.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks so fresh.</li>
            <li>Love the product so far.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t find it or you&#x27;re not 100% satisfied, Body Merry offers a 90 day MANUFACTURER GUARANTEE on all its products.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was working or if I was just having a clear skin month</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for less than 1 week and my face, neck, hands and arms look amazing!</li>
            <li>Super 6 Anti Aging Defense Serum was applied first on cleansed face.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs quick and dries fast so you have to work quickly to apply it.</li>
            <li>I have not notice staining of my skin due to the serum&#x27;s bright  orange color.  </li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t oily anymore, also it has really evened out my skin tone, I had some acne scarring that has faded significantly</li>
            <li>It catches your eye right away.</li>
            <li>did not notice a difference right away, however, this is one of those products that is meant to show a difference over time.</li>
            <li>Follow directions and always apply sunscreen lotion right after, before going outdoors.</li>
            <li>My wife ordered this because it had such great reviews and used it regularly with the Body Merry Super C22 Moisturizer which claims &amp;#34;Best</li>
            <li>Body Merry is truly a one of a kind company, they make EFFECTIVE products and are totally affordable, and work better than every other product I have used thus far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think my skin was very blotchy to begin with, but after using the serum,  I have really noticed how much  brighter and more</li>
            <li>The first day I used it with my dermaroller and was glad that the ingredients were mild enough to not burn or bother the tender skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>I was able to feel the results on my skin right away and after consistent use my skin looks so much brighter and feels incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Next, the products are vegan and cruelty free, which has always been important to me.</li>
            <li>Next, the products are vegan and cruelty free, which has always been important to me.</li>
            <li>I find that after using this for a few weeks my skin is more healthier and it is more hydrated.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I noticed my skin was looking less than good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll upgrade to 5 stars if I love it after a few weeks. :)</li>
            <li>shipped SUPER fast, like one day.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a real reduction in fine lines and a prevention of new wrinkles!</li>
            <li>It soaks right into the skin and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>First off this serum is not sticky.</li>
            <li>Follow with the Body Merry Super-C Moisturizer (my personal favorite)</li>
            <li>I only use it three days out of the week and my skin looks healthy and glowing.</li>
            <li>I have tried many vitamin C serums recently and I have to say I&#x27;m a fan of this one.</li>
            <li>Once applied your skin looks and feels so much healthier!</li>
            <li>HA in this serum helps to moisturize the skin and helps the skin actually retain more moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin remains soft and smooth and the skin tone has evened out.</li>
            <li>this serum helps to moisturize the skin and helps the skin actually retain more moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin remains soft and smooth and the skin tone has evened out.</li>
            <li>His eye area looks much softer and fresher now (and I started using his eye cream now, I like it!).</li>
            <li>Some of the amounts of the ingredients in the Body Merry serum were even slightly higher than the pricier serum, so I thought &amp;#34;what</li>
            <li>so I concentrated on those areas first.  </li>
            <li>I just love the instant soothing feel I get upon using it.</li>
            <li>I can also see my neck wrinkles starting to look better.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different vitamin C serums over the years and</li>
            <li>so I when I used this the first time I had no expectations.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several serums but I keep trying others, depending on costs and availability and this brand is top quality.</li>
            <li>Most of the Vitamin C serum I have tried only have 20%  Vitamin C  </li>
            <li>It takes me 5-6 drops to cover my face but it spreads pretty well.</li>
            <li>Definitely dries out the skin though, so be sure to use moisturizer after.</li>
            <li>The color threw me off at first</li>
            <li>Even after my skin has been washed and there&#x27;s no serum on the surface, it still feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this already on my second bottle.</li>
            <li>If only this product was packaged better I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>After the first week I noticed my skin looked clearer.</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin and gives it such a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking at beauty retailers with very expensive products that had reasonably good reviews, but I&#x27;m not made of money, so I wanted to choose wisely.</li>
            <li>BUT since this serum also has a lot of moisturizing ingredients its Ok for me to use and it did not dry me out as much as retinol alone would do .</li>
            <li>I was so EXCITED when my sensitive skin not only tolerated it but also felt better after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only been using this serum at night, but I love the results upon waking up!</li>
            <li>After a few uses, my skin began to look dewy and healthy, but it did not break me out (and even seemed to lighten some scarring and stuff), so I will most likely repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li>No bad reactions or anything so far.  </li>
            <li>combination of 6 active ingredients really left my skin looking great.</li>
            <li>combination of 6 active ingredients really left my skin looking great.</li>
            <li>I have very realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great around the eyes, especially if you have dark circles.</li>
            <li>The dry spots are much better almost gone.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive</li>
            <li>:) I don&#x27;t really care what it smells like as long as it works.</li>
            <li>the slight warm colored tint this serum leaves on the skin, topped by my moisturizer, works very well for me too.</li>
            <li>I am constantly trying new products because it seems like most of the stuff I try doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot to impress me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this later if I see any improvements on her fine lines.</li>
            <li>was a little surprised by the bright orange color, even tho</li>
            <li>Really, though, this stuff is fantastic and it is now part of my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>my husband uses it as much as i do and he loves it as well.</li>
            <li>They really hit the nail on the head with this one.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>really helps so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s orange, so you can really gauge how much you needier application.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin and soaks in very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin and soaks in very well.</li>
            <li>but we all know how mature skin needs exfoliation to renew cells and give the skin that fresh look......whats a gal to do.....</li>
            <li>It GENTLY exfoliates without drying out my complexion.</li>
            <li>AND, very affordable.......</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not irritating and it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.</li>

            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>I really like this product ..</li>
            <li>price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>It tucks in my face, moisturizes it, and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>It also holds in moisture very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T REALLY BELIEVE YOU NEED IT.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>The combination of these two very inexpensive products keeps the skin supple and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very absorbent and leaves no build up or oily residue on your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very absorbent and leaves no build up or oily residue on your skin.</li>
            <li>If you are a first time user of Vit C serums, just know it&#x27;s normal for your skin to get taunt.</li>
            <li>It turns out this product really does seem to work.  </li>
            <li>and i really notice the difference.</li>
            <li>I think my skin texture and appearance is very improved since I started using this.</li>
            <li>so I am very picky about the products</li>
            <li>sun spots are about 2 shades lighter after a months use and everybody at work also commented on how much my skin looks brighter!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the retinol combined with the hyluronic acid irritates my skin too much  </li>
            <li>Unless you have really oily skin you will probably still need a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t seen a difference, just saying...</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t seem to work very well for me in any of those areas.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting a lot of compliments on how good I look lately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 49-years old and now I want to try more of the same products!</li>
            <li>Okay, so I have tried no less than 10 different types of serums all varying in price</li>
            <li>Since I am not the first time facial serums user, I started to use the Super Serum &amp;#34;full time&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>The serum is very smooth going on and a few drops go a long way, so the bottle will last a good while.</li>
            <li>Also, since I don&#x27;t use foundation (it&#x27;s too hot and humid where I live to wear foundation)</li>
            <li>I love the Vitamin C combined with the Reitnol and other age fighting ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This particular brand is nice, premium quality, has 22% C, with 2.5% Retinol, and 20% Hyaluronic Acid, as well as other organic and natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to purchase it,  i saw results on my neck in the first few applications.</li>
            <li>Im Asian, with light complexion and have normal skin.</li>
            <li>The dropper top helps to keep the process mess free and from contamination by not having to actually touch the product.</li>
            <li>The dropper top helps to keep the process mess free and from contamination by not having to actually touch the product.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive and I have no problems with this serum.</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that it does not have the same delicious smell as the accompanying moisturizer (which smells like oranges and is heavenly).  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m really liking this!</li>
            <li>Less really is more with this.</li>
            <li>slight noticible difference - which is better than anything else I have tried.....</li>
            <li>I have added this to my daily moisturizing regiment and plan or many future repurchases.  </li>
            <li>I settled on the Super 6 Serum because not only did it contain the vitamin C</li>
            <li>This serum is a very complete serum so much</li>
            <li>But I am pleased with the temporary results, and will probably continue using it after this first bottle is empty, especially since it is rather inexpensive, and does give results, however temporary.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased this product &amp; have not used it long enough to leave a formal review, though, it does hydrate very well:)</li>
            <li>I will be reordering and highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a high end skincare junkie, so I know what I am talking about,  </li>
            <li>I will be putting this on under my high end</li>
            <li>The Body Merry products do seem high quality.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It helped make my skin soft and evened out my skin tone and even soothed a couple of large, inflamed areas of acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smoother, more even toned, and even a little tighter under my chin (</li>
            <li>The serum doesn&#x27;t do much in the forehead area, but it does tighten the skin under my eyes considerably.  </li>
            <li>really like that it is made of natural and organic ingredients and is made in the USA in an FDA registered and GMP compliant facility.</li>
            <li>I use the Body Merry Super-C moisturizer, and I have noticed that if the serum has not dried really well it can lather the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>although I haven&#x27;t used Super 6 Serum long enough to fairly judge its efficacy,  I  believe it is starting to lighten dark spots and refine the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>My take on this serum is that in the month I&#x27;ve been using it, I have noticed a texture improvement and fine lines seem minimized, and my complexion overall seems brighter, less &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34;, which is worth it just for those improvements.</li>

            <li>I have a few serums and this one is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old, fair skin, some broken capillaries, redhead.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to review this brand new product from Body Merry that is &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; loaded with ingredients highly touted to provide natural skin care to fight the aging skin process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a very complete serum.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have been struggling with breakouts since I was 11.</li>
            <li>she said it makes her fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Not heavy or greasy at all!  </li>
            <li>I put this serum on first and put the vitamin c moisturizer by body merry on 2nd, followed by my makeup.</li>
            <li>I like supporting companies that have the same types of values</li>
            <li>My face became luminous and soft after using this product!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft!  </li>
            <li>many other vitamin C serums on the market that have only 5-20% Vitamin C</li>
            <li>Normally serums are clear.</li>
            <li>Normally serums are clear.</li>
            <li>I would usually apply my retinol moisturizer on top of my vitamin C</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, my skin is soft, and the texture and tone of my skin is finally headed toward smooth and even.</li>
            <li>If 6 age-kicking ingredients weren&#x27;t enough, our super facial serum is also armed with powerful natural and organic ingredients like Organic Aloe, Witch Hazel, Wheat Germ Oil, Green Tea, Propolis and Organic Jojoba Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Start using Body Merry&#x27;s Super 6 Serum on your quest for everlasting youth.</li>
            <li>There is 22% vitamin C which is above the average amount found in most serums.  </li>
            <li>Body Merry&#x27;s Age Defense Super 6 Serum can still come to your skin&#x27;s rescue (minus the cape).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and so far no irritation!</li>
            <li>But there is no unpleasant odor; just not much scent at all.  </li>
            <li>Overall, my skin looks plumper, less wrinkled,  skin color more even</li>
            <li>I use it together with the moisturizer, so it&#x27;s hard to tell which does better job.</li>
            <li>As we age the natural HA is reduced.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product did not cause any problems at all.  </li>
            <li>All the Merry Products far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I am 51 and avoid the sun completely.  </li>
            <li>It gives an instant silky feel over my fave and feels very hydrating.</li>
            <li>A couple of almost dime sized,  noticeable sun spots on my cheeks have faded considerably.</li>
            <li>but so far, so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it makes my face feel smoth and young again</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old</li>
            <li>my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m closer to 70 than to 60 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>My face feels hydrated and soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>2.5% CoQ10 - Natural + Organic Anti-Aging -</li>
            <li>I really am trying to find a facial regime that works.  </li>
            <li>the natural, herbal type smells in the eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I sent an email asking for a recommendation based on my age (62) and the condition of my skin (old).  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but I do not notice any burning or skin irritation whatsoever from the retinol in this serum.</li>
            <li>but I already see a difference in my complexion and how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I have been using it around three weeks only, there is still much product in the bottle.</li>
            <li>The blemishes that were on my skin before are now almost completely healed.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive break-out prone skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>The serum glides on smoothly, and is not  too heavy.  </li>
            <li>Their customer service is completely unmatched.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product in early June and have used it every night since it came in.  </li>
            <li>It is a perfect base and my skin seems to like it.  </li>
            <li>Since it dries so fast I can put lotion and sunscreen on right away, saving me a little time.  </li>
            <li>My skin becomes so uneven and looks very worn out after working super long hours and lacking so much sleep.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, says to use 5-6 drops I usually need 8 to do face and neck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently been looking into correcting the sun damage on my face, mainly brown spots (lentigo), old acne marks and a tendency towards reddish blotchiness.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this serum especially for gals with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it without the dermaroller and have noticed that it does not sink in quite quickly in this application and remains sticky for about half an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As an older woman, I&#x27;m not expecting miracles, but the overall tone of my skin is improving by the week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell--honestly I think it smells a little like play-dough.</li>
            <li>Not really noticing any difference,I got it because of what the description said, I don&#x27;t have any peeling at all, I wanted the Retin A because it was a higher concentrate</li>
            <li>I tried LilyAna Naturals brand items first, and found absolutely no effect.  </li>
            <li>I used a few droppers full, but applied to my neck as well.  </li>
            <li>With our 6-in-1, age-fighting facial serum, you can combat unwanted fine lines and wrinkles while restoring uneven skin tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried something new and broke out the next day</li>
            <li>It penetrates fast and it is not making my skin dry.  </li>
            <li>I do use a little more than the instructions say, but that might be because my skin is a little more thirsty than others might be; still, a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>This product may very well be  at least as good, if not better, than much more expensive serums  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, using the recommended 4 drops barely spreads over the face, but that is the  maximum number of drops recommended.</li>
            <li>I initially looked into laser, then chemical peels, and while I may do a peel in the fall/winter when I&#x27;m not outside in the sun so much (I do wear sunscreen religiously nowadays)</li>
            <li>It will be longer term for any spot fading/reduction from the retinol and vitamin C ingredients to be apparent, but I will continue to use it just for the way my skin feels now.mell like a flower.</li>
            <li>It will be longer term for any spot fading/reduction from the retinol and vitamin C ingredients to be apparent, but I will continue to use it just for the way my skin feels now.</li>
            <li>I use this serum after using the dermaroller and it sinks in quite fast in this usage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 32 year old female with oily skin</li>
            <li>It sinks in and you&#x27;re ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li>SO, for my second attempt at a new facial care brand, I chose to try Body Merry products.  </li>
            <li>That is a plus for me because when followed (as directed) by eye cream and a moisturizer, other serums cause too much oiliness.  </li>
            <li>I am not super old to where I have a whole lot of deep wrinkles</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I have not had any redness or itching due to the natural and organic ingredients of this product.</li>
            <li>I am searching for a facial regimen that will help reduce the signs of aging (I am 39 and have not spent a lot of time in the sun).  </li>
            <li>Only a few drops are needed to cover face, with a few more drops for chin and neck area.</li>
            <li>He had dry spots near his eyes and wanted to stop using my eye cream up.</li>
            <li>I have not seen much improvement in my age spots or wrinkles yet but the company says results are typical in 6-8 weeks, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>You will not be disappointed - this is much more effective than the more expensive products I have tried in the past.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> But I&#x27;m truly surprised by and very happy with the improvements I see from using Best Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> This is a great face serum with a lot more great ingredients than just the 6 featured on the front of the label.</li>
            <li> The color is a bright orange, but does not stay that color on the skin when applied.  </li>
            <li> The bright orange color lets you see where you are applying it</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good  organic serum, with results, try this one.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel really good.</li>
            <li> i just loved this serum.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate it and I feel good about putting it on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im looking forward to seeing good results from this serum</li>
            <li> I was reading a review of serums and this brand was mentioned as being superior.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is thicker and not runny, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> and it seems like it&#x27;s really good quality and well made,</li>
            <li> The consistency seems good, though I have never used serums before, so I have nothing to compare it with.  </li>
            <li> good but</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!!</li>
            <li> Both are super great!</li>
            <li> The bottom line:  this a an excellent product and a GREAT value if you have realistic expectations about what to expect from any beauty treatment.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> but I feel compelled to write this one because I truly am beyond satisfied with this product, the serum is great</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results ..</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality and texture.</li>
            <li> The scent alone is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I liked that even though it is a bright orange color, it didn&#x27;t stain or color my skin.  </li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t seen a difference, but that&#x27;s good, because with this 1 product I&#x27;m replacing 3</li>
            <li> I really love this serum!</li>
            <li> and also I do feel my skin is looking more youthful, which is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love Body Merry&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> then I follow with the Body Merry Vitamin C moisturizer and my face has never looked better!  </li>
            <li> I love the consistency and how your skin receives the product!</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin C serum!</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing and nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already in love with it!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>

            <li> Nice feel to my skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle came in its own box, sealed, not in bubble wrap as some others have stated.</li>
            <li> I purchased this during a promotional pricing period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> RECEIVED THIS item in Exchange FOR MY UNBIASED HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I really liked this serum.  </li>
            <li> My skin is loving this serum.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled with what it has done.</li>
            <li> liked that it didn&#x27;t sting when I applied it.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> but i just had to let everyone know that this is gentle to the skin and very effective!</li>
            <li> I mainly use Paula&#x27;s Choice products and am very happy with them but read the reviews on this product and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li> color of the serum is orange, love the smell not too strong and just great.</li>
            <li> This product was provided for review, thank you......s orange, love the smell not too strong and just great.</li>
            <li> MANY THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Loved this super 6 serum!</li>
            <li> I like that this product is suitable for men or women to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Body Merry packaging is so bright and cheerful.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best serum I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with product, now after three uses.</li>
            <li> Very happy so far.</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbed and skin feels great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great serum, it goes on super smooth but doesn&#x27;t make your face look oily!</li>
            <li> and I also use it with the body merry super c-22 moisturizer, and let me tell you it works!!</li>
            <li> Its a bright orange color that absorbs into your skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The serum is not greasy or slimy after it dries (very quickly) and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> so Body Merry Super Serum 6 is already superior in that regard that it has 22% Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free, for a review, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> it tightens your skin and makes it look more radiant.</li>
            <li> i love the way it dispenses.</li>
            <li> and he thinks it is by far the best retinol serum he has tried out of all the Body Merry serums available.</li>
            <li> I love that it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering odor!</li>
            <li> I love it as an addition to my routine that allows me to get vitamin c and retinol in one</li>
            <li> I love this product and I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> find my face smooth and silky in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Worthy to try!</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin is a lot softer, more hydrated, and looks brighter.</li>
            <li> This serum helps your skin soak up moisturizer way better.</li>
            <li> I also LOVE that this serum is made in the USA and is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> My skin feels brighter, more hydrated and firmer</li>
            <li> Nice light serum.</li>
            <li> In all, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> So many benefits.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice light serum for the face.</li>
            <li> For even more hydration a separate moisturizing cream can be used.</li>
            <li> I love combining a number of ingredients into one &amp;#34;Super&amp;#34; serum.</li>
            <li> This product combines 6 wonderful ingredients that are essential in skin care.</li>
            <li> So I decided to look into more conservative measures, like serums and moisturizers with beneficial ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay, so I never write reviews</li>
            <li> so I was nervous to use it because it didn&#x27;t want it to over moisturize and cause more oil and clogged pores</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait, just buy it and you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li> I love how it feels as it goes onto my skin.  </li>
            <li> This serum is one of my favorite ones to use.</li>
            <li> Will update more after the 4 wk recommended use period.</li>
            <li> It seemed to have made me breakout more...</li>
            <li> My skin looks more youthful, plumper, more even-toned and no need for primer before makeup.</li>
            <li> Overall, not too impressed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for one week and my skin feels better every day.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my face</li>
            <li> It works really good for those laugh lines &amp; crows feet :)</li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> love that this company is cruelty-free and uses sustainable products.</li>
            <li> I like that this serum is for age defense, which, is what I need the most.</li>
            <li> Somehow I prefer the moisturizer because I think it is more brightening.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m still glad I got the serum too</li>
            <li> Love this serum.</li>
            <li> Healthy and makes me look better...</li>
            <li> I have found this to be as described and am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Three months later:  I am beautiful!!!  </li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> and instead my skin felt better and started looking better too.</li>
            <li> I love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> and my face is brighter, smoother and has a healthy glow</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS...</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE.....</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is my favorite anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling fresh and bright.</li>
            <li> just AWESOME... CLEARING MY FACE UPON REGULAR USE.</li>
            <li> I used different Vitamin C serum, this one is the best, I intend to reorder.</li>
            <li> If used with a potent spot treatment cream, it can boost more whitening power.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product to use in place of a moisturizer or as an extra.  </li>
            <li> The serum comes in an amber colored jar with a dropper top.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product to use in place of a moisturizer or as an extra.  </li>
            <li> The serum comes in an amber colored jar with a dropper top.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles now, but I think this may help to prevent it.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency because it&#x27;s not too watery.</li>
            <li> Another thing I love about this serum is that it also contains 2.5% retinol.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pleased that I can have both with one application.</li>
            <li> I love using this serum.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite face product and I have many.</li>
            <li> I also notice some brightening in my pigmentation :)</li>
            <li> I really love the way that this makes my skin feel and what it does for the appearance and texture.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> I was pleased that it was sealed.</li>
            <li> did a lot of research before purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the price, results, and performance.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this on my own, I was not offered a discount or free product in order to review it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have been using Vitamin C Serum for several years along with Retinol, with excellent results.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I wait just a couple of minutes after applying the serum before I use the moisturizer, to make sure the serum does not get diluted.</li>
            <li> I tried to save $10 and not buy the C22 brand, but it is much better</li>
            <li> I was seriously considering another retailer that has excellent reviews and a great reputation, and they were offering a set of 2 products, a vitamin C serum and a moisturizer, also with vitamin C.</li>
            <li> It has kind of a unique smell, but not stinky.</li>
            <li> Body Merry creates several good good products &amp; the Super 6 Serum is a good product.</li>
            <li> Both had a great list of ingredients, but the price was still high.</li>
            <li> I love the carrot kind of smell and how quickly it absorbs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t make my very light skin orange.</li>
            <li> The serum is a bright orange color and when I first put it on, my skin is orange for about 2 seconds and then it absorbs and you can&#x27;t see any color, so don&#x27;t worry about that.</li>
            <li> I am loving Body Merry&#x27;s Age Defense Super 6 Serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night, I love how easy it soaks in, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Has a lovely scent and smoothes onto the skin easily.</li>
            <li> Skin tone is more even, fine lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li> It surely helps with my depigmentation and fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products over the years and spent a lot of money, but I have found this one is the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.  </li>
            <li> I love how smoothly it applies to my skin.</li>
            <li> When I apply it and make sure that I follow the directions applications, my skin feels so smooth and</li>

            <li> I really like this product as it feels good under makeup and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> The age defense super 6 serum came in a dropper bottle which made it very easy for application.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, first time to use it, almost half the bottle, I have problem with aging spots, works good on the side of using hydroconin, my skin start peeling without showing.</li>
            <li> I got it super fast and LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> I especially notice this wonderful effect when I apply it after I first wake up in the morning!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying this is the most customer friendly skin care company I have ever dealt with.  </li>
            <li> The dropper is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used great products for 35 years and it has paid off (I&#x27;m 60) and people are always asking me what I do because my skin does look 15 years younger than many.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and it absorbs quicly.</li>
            <li> It has strong orange color</li>
            <li> It however went on smoothly and was absorbed nicely into the skin without leaving a sticky feeling or residue.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li> It helps brighten my skin, and it&#x27;s smoothing out my fine lines.</li>
            <li> The product plumps the skin and hides fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> - This is an antioxidant that can stimulate the production of collagen and minimizes fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This increases collagen production, plumps the skin which minimizes fine lines and wrinkles, it also brightens skin and helps to reduce irregular pigmentation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;helps to diminish the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, but also leaves your skin plump, hydrated and nourished with an even and brighter looking complexion.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fine lines diminish, skin tone evens out and my face looks and feels moisturized.</li>
            <li> I felt that the results were fine.</li>
            <li> This remedy I have found is super!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive and try this serum as I have other Body Merry products and have been extremely happy and satisfied with there products.  </li>
            <li> I really like that winning combination!</li>
            <li> I liked that it absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before giving this a try I was using a popular Korean vitamin C serum that was very effective at brightening my skin and fading out dark spots.  </li>

            <li> Makes skin feel smooth and nice and absorbs completely.  </li>

            <li> I purchased this for my aunt because I received a special discount from the seller to test it.</li>

            <li> it is great for all skin types and you see the difference after just few uses.</li>
            <li> The biggest thing I&#x27;ve noticed is how smooth my skin is, very noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> This product applies smoothly on my skin, it is not irritating</li>
            <li> I hope I will enjoy it as much as this product.</li>
            <li> The product remains fresh for 12 months after opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know, it sounds so attractive, but I am in my 40s and while I honestly do not have any wrinkles or crows feet, I really want the tone of my skin to be more even and improved.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will also help with my acne scars and smile lines.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks so fresh.</li>
            <li> Love the product so far.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t find it or you&#x27;re not 100% satisfied, Body Merry offers a 90 day MANUFACTURER GUARANTEE on all its products.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was working or if I was just having a clear skin month</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for less than 1 week and my face, neck, hands and arms look amazing!</li>
            <li> Super 6 Anti Aging Defense Serum was applied first on cleansed face.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs quick and dries fast so you have to work quickly to apply it.</li>
            <li> I have not notice staining of my skin due to the serum&#x27;s bright  orange color.  </li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t oily anymore, also it has really evened out my skin tone, I had some acne scarring that has faded significantly</li>
            <li> It catches your eye right away.</li>
            <li> did not notice a difference right away, however, this is one of those products that is meant to show a difference over time.</li>
            <li> Follow directions and always apply sunscreen lotion right after, before going outdoors.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this because it had such great reviews and used it regularly with the Body Merry Super C22 Moisturizer which claims &amp;#34;Best</li>
            <li> Body Merry is truly a one of a kind company, they make EFFECTIVE products and are totally affordable, and work better than every other product I have used thus far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my skin was very blotchy to begin with, but after using the serum,  I have really noticed how much  brighter and more</li>
            <li> The first day I used it with my dermaroller and was glad that the ingredients were mild enough to not burn or bother the tender skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was able to feel the results on my skin right away and after consistent use my skin looks so much brighter and feels incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Next, the products are vegan and cruelty free, which has always been important to me.</li>
            <li> Next, the products are vegan and cruelty free, which has always been important to me.</li>
            <li> I find that after using this for a few weeks my skin is more healthier and it is more hydrated.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I noticed my skin was looking less than good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll upgrade to 5 stars if I love it after a few weeks. :)</li>
            <li> shipped SUPER fast, like one day.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a real reduction in fine lines and a prevention of new wrinkles!</li>
            <li> It soaks right into the skin and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> First off this serum is not sticky.</li>
            <li> Follow with the Body Merry Super-C Moisturizer (my personal favorite)</li>
            <li> I only use it three days out of the week and my skin looks healthy and glowing.</li>
            <li> I have tried many vitamin C serums recently and I have to say I&#x27;m a fan of this one.</li>
            <li> Once applied your skin looks and feels so much healthier!</li>
            <li> HA in this serum helps to moisturize the skin and helps the skin actually retain more moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin remains soft and smooth and the skin tone has evened out.</li>
            <li> this serum helps to moisturize the skin and helps the skin actually retain more moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin remains soft and smooth and the skin tone has evened out.</li>
            <li> His eye area looks much softer and fresher now (and I started using his eye cream now, I like it!).</li>
            <li> Some of the amounts of the ingredients in the Body Merry serum were even slightly higher than the pricier serum, so I thought &amp;#34;what</li>
            <li> so I concentrated on those areas first.  </li>
            <li> I just love the instant soothing feel I get upon using it.</li>
            <li> I can also see my neck wrinkles starting to look better.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different vitamin C serums over the years and</li>
            <li> so I when I used this the first time I had no expectations.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several serums but I keep trying others, depending on costs and availability and this brand is top quality.</li>
            <li> Most of the Vitamin C serum I have tried only have 20%  Vitamin C  </li>
            <li> It takes me 5-6 drops to cover my face but it spreads pretty well.</li>
            <li> Definitely dries out the skin though, so be sure to use moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> The color threw me off at first</li>
            <li> Even after my skin has been washed and there&#x27;s no serum on the surface, it still feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this already on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> If only this product was packaged better I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> After the first week I noticed my skin looked clearer.</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin and gives it such a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking at beauty retailers with very expensive products that had reasonably good reviews, but I&#x27;m not made of money, so I wanted to choose wisely.</li>
            <li> BUT since this serum also has a lot of moisturizing ingredients its Ok for me to use and it did not dry me out as much as retinol alone would do .</li>
            <li> I was so EXCITED when my sensitive skin not only tolerated it but also felt better after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only been using this serum at night, but I love the results upon waking up!</li>
            <li> After a few uses, my skin began to look dewy and healthy, but it did not break me out (and even seemed to lighten some scarring and stuff), so I will most likely repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> No bad reactions or anything so far.  </li>
            <li> combination of 6 active ingredients really left my skin looking great.</li>
            <li> combination of 6 active ingredients really left my skin looking great.</li>
            <li> I have very realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great around the eyes, especially if you have dark circles.</li>
            <li> The dry spots are much better almost gone.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive</li>
            <li> :) I don&#x27;t really care what it smells like as long as it works.</li>
            <li> the slight warm colored tint this serum leaves on the skin, topped by my moisturizer, works very well for me too.</li>
            <li> I am constantly trying new products because it seems like most of the stuff I try doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot to impress me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this later if I see any improvements on her fine lines.</li>
            <li> was a little surprised by the bright orange color, even tho</li>
            <li> Really, though, this stuff is fantastic and it is now part of my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li> it really works.</li>
            <li> my husband uses it as much as i do and he loves it as well.</li>
            <li> They really hit the nail on the head with this one.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> really helps so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s orange, so you can really gauge how much you needier application.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin and soaks in very well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin and soaks in very well.</li>
            <li> but we all know how mature skin needs exfoliation to renew cells and give the skin that fresh look......whats a gal to do.....</li>
            <li> It GENTLY exfoliates without drying out my complexion.</li>
            <li> AND, very affordable.......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not irritating and it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> I really like this product ..</li>
            <li> price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> It tucks in my face, moisturizes it, and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> It also holds in moisture very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T REALLY BELIEVE YOU NEED IT.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> The combination of these two very inexpensive products keeps the skin supple and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very absorbent and leaves no build up or oily residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very absorbent and leaves no build up or oily residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> If you are a first time user of Vit C serums, just know it&#x27;s normal for your skin to get taunt.</li>
            <li> It turns out this product really does seem to work.  </li>
            <li> and i really notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I think my skin texture and appearance is very improved since I started using this.</li>
            <li> so I am very picky about the products</li>
            <li> sun spots are about 2 shades lighter after a months use and everybody at work also commented on how much my skin looks brighter!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the retinol combined with the hyluronic acid irritates my skin too much  </li>
            <li> Unless you have really oily skin you will probably still need a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen a difference, just saying...</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to work very well for me in any of those areas.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting a lot of compliments on how good I look lately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49-years old and now I want to try more of the same products!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have tried no less than 10 different types of serums all varying in price</li>
            <li> Since I am not the first time facial serums user, I started to use the Super Serum &amp;#34;full time&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> The serum is very smooth going on and a few drops go a long way, so the bottle will last a good while.</li>
            <li> Also, since I don&#x27;t use foundation (it&#x27;s too hot and humid where I live to wear foundation)</li>
            <li> I love the Vitamin C combined with the Reitnol and other age fighting ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This particular brand is nice, premium quality, has 22% C, with 2.5% Retinol, and 20% Hyaluronic Acid, as well as other organic and natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to purchase it,  i saw results on my neck in the first few applications.</li>
            <li> Im Asian, with light complexion and have normal skin.</li>
            <li> The dropper top helps to keep the process mess free and from contamination by not having to actually touch the product.</li>
            <li> The dropper top helps to keep the process mess free and from contamination by not having to actually touch the product.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and I have no problems with this serum.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it does not have the same delicious smell as the accompanying moisturizer (which smells like oranges and is heavenly).  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m really liking this!</li>
            <li> Less really is more with this.</li>
            <li> slight noticible difference - which is better than anything else I have tried.....</li>
            <li> I have added this to my daily moisturizing regiment and plan or many future repurchases.  </li>
            <li> I settled on the Super 6 Serum because not only did it contain the vitamin C</li>
            <li> This serum is a very complete serum so much</li>
            <li> But I am pleased with the temporary results, and will probably continue using it after this first bottle is empty, especially since it is rather inexpensive, and does give results, however temporary.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased this product &amp; have not used it long enough to leave a formal review, though, it does hydrate very well:)</li>
            <li> I will be reordering and highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a high end skincare junkie, so I know what I am talking about,  </li>
            <li> I will be putting this on under my high end</li>
            <li> The Body Merry products do seem high quality.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It helped make my skin soft and evened out my skin tone and even soothed a couple of large, inflamed areas of acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother, more even toned, and even a little tighter under my chin (</li>
            <li> The serum doesn&#x27;t do much in the forehead area, but it does tighten the skin under my eyes considerably.  </li>
            <li> really like that it is made of natural and organic ingredients and is made in the USA in an FDA registered and GMP compliant facility.</li>
            <li> I use the Body Merry Super-C moisturizer, and I have noticed that if the serum has not dried really well it can lather the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> although I haven&#x27;t used Super 6 Serum long enough to fairly judge its efficacy,  I  believe it is starting to lighten dark spots and refine the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> My take on this serum is that in the month I&#x27;ve been using it, I have noticed a texture improvement and fine lines seem minimized, and my complexion overall seems brighter, less &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34;, which is worth it just for those improvements.</li>

            <li> I am 60 years old, fair skin, some broken capillaries, redhead.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to review this brand new product from Body Merry that is &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; loaded with ingredients highly touted to provide natural skin care to fight the aging skin process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a very complete serum.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been struggling with breakouts since I was 11.</li>
            <li> she said it makes her fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Not heavy or greasy at all!  </li>
            <li> I put this serum on first and put the vitamin c moisturizer by body merry on 2nd, followed by my makeup.</li>
            <li> I like supporting companies that have the same types of values</li>
            <li> My face became luminous and soft after using this product!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft!  </li>
            <li> many other vitamin C serums on the market that have only 5-20% Vitamin C</li>
            <li> Normally serums are clear.</li>
            <li> Normally serums are clear.</li>
            <li> I would usually apply my retinol moisturizer on top of my vitamin C</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my skin is soft, and the texture and tone of my skin is finally headed toward smooth and even.</li>
            <li> If 6 age-kicking ingredients weren&#x27;t enough, our super facial serum is also armed with powerful natural and organic ingredients like Organic Aloe, Witch Hazel, Wheat Germ Oil, Green Tea, Propolis and Organic Jojoba Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Start using Body Merry&#x27;s Super 6 Serum on your quest for everlasting youth.</li>
            <li> There is 22% vitamin C which is above the average amount found in most serums.  </li>
            <li> Body Merry&#x27;s Age Defense Super 6 Serum can still come to your skin&#x27;s rescue (minus the cape).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and so far no irritation!</li>
            <li> But there is no unpleasant odor; just not much scent at all.  </li>
            <li> Overall, my skin looks plumper, less wrinkled,  skin color more even</li>
            <li> I use it together with the moisturizer, so it&#x27;s hard to tell which does better job.</li>
            <li> As we age the natural HA is reduced.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product did not cause any problems at all.  </li>
            <li> All the Merry Products far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I am 51 and avoid the sun completely.  </li>
            <li> It gives an instant silky feel over my fave and feels very hydrating.</li>
            <li> A couple of almost dime sized,  noticeable sun spots on my cheeks have faded considerably.</li>
            <li> but so far, so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it makes my face feel smoth and young again</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old</li>
            <li> my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m closer to 70 than to 60 yrs old.  </li>
            <li> My face feels hydrated and soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> 2.5% CoQ10 - Natural + Organic Anti-Aging -</li>
            <li> I really am trying to find a facial regime that works.  </li>
            <li> the natural, herbal type smells in the eye cream.  </li>
            <li> I sent an email asking for a recommendation based on my age (62) and the condition of my skin (old).  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but I do not notice any burning or skin irritation whatsoever from the retinol in this serum.</li>
            <li> but I already see a difference in my complexion and how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I have been using it around three weeks only, there is still much product in the bottle.</li>
            <li> The blemishes that were on my skin before are now almost completely healed.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive break-out prone skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> The serum glides on smoothly, and is not  too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Their customer service is completely unmatched.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in early June and have used it every night since it came in.  </li>
            <li> It is a perfect base and my skin seems to like it.  </li>
            <li> Since it dries so fast I can put lotion and sunscreen on right away, saving me a little time.  </li>
            <li> My skin becomes so uneven and looks very worn out after working super long hours and lacking so much sleep.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, says to use 5-6 drops I usually need 8 to do face and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been looking into correcting the sun damage on my face, mainly brown spots (lentigo), old acne marks and a tendency towards reddish blotchiness.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this serum especially for gals with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it without the dermaroller and have noticed that it does not sink in quite quickly in this application and remains sticky for about half an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As an older woman, I&#x27;m not expecting miracles, but the overall tone of my skin is improving by the week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell--honestly I think it smells a little like play-dough.</li>
            <li> Not really noticing any difference,I got it because of what the description said, I don&#x27;t have any peeling at all, I wanted the Retin A because it was a higher concentrate</li>
            <li> I tried LilyAna Naturals brand items first, and found absolutely no effect.  </li>
            <li> I used a few droppers full, but applied to my neck as well.  </li>
            <li> With our 6-in-1, age-fighting facial serum, you can combat unwanted fine lines and wrinkles while restoring uneven skin tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried something new and broke out the next day</li>
            <li> It penetrates fast and it is not making my skin dry.  </li>
            <li> I do use a little more than the instructions say, but that might be because my skin is a little more thirsty than others might be; still, a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> This product may very well be  at least as good, if not better, than much more expensive serums  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, using the recommended 4 drops barely spreads over the face, but that is the  maximum number of drops recommended.</li>
            <li> I initially looked into laser, then chemical peels, and while I may do a peel in the fall/winter when I&#x27;m not outside in the sun so much (I do wear sunscreen religiously nowadays)</li>
            <li> It will be longer term for any spot fading/reduction from the retinol and vitamin C ingredients to be apparent, but I will continue to use it just for the way my skin feels now.mell like a flower.</li>
            <li> It will be longer term for any spot fading/reduction from the retinol and vitamin C ingredients to be apparent, but I will continue to use it just for the way my skin feels now.</li>
            <li> I use this serum after using the dermaroller and it sinks in quite fast in this usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 32 year old female with oily skin</li>
            <li> It sinks in and you&#x27;re ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> SO, for my second attempt at a new facial care brand, I chose to try Body Merry products.  </li>
            <li> That is a plus for me because when followed (as directed) by eye cream and a moisturizer, other serums cause too much oiliness.  </li>
            <li> I am not super old to where I have a whole lot of deep wrinkles</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I have not had any redness or itching due to the natural and organic ingredients of this product.</li>
            <li> I am searching for a facial regimen that will help reduce the signs of aging (I am 39 and have not spent a lot of time in the sun).  </li>
            <li> Only a few drops are needed to cover face, with a few more drops for chin and neck area.</li>
            <li> He had dry spots near his eyes and wanted to stop using my eye cream up.</li>
            <li> I have not seen much improvement in my age spots or wrinkles yet but the company says results are typical in 6-8 weeks, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed - this is much more effective than the more expensive products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> A few tiny drops will do the job, and your skin will feel a little &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; at first, but once the product dries, your skin feels baby soft.  </li>
            <li> So I checked Body Merry out on Amazon, and found they had a vitamin C serum and a moisturizer that had almost the exact same ingredients as the other retailer&#x27;s products I was planning to buy, but at half the price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle:  a little skin brightening, some help fading dark spots, maybe a bit of softening for the fine lines I&#x27;m starting to get around my eyes or at least some help preventing new ones.  </li>
            <li> The 1 fl oz bottle with dropper will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Will have to check back after long term use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer the Pro-A myself but also haven&#x27;t given this one long enough to truly see the results.</li>
            <li> they last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It did sting a bit upon application and the delivery time from overseas was long, so I wanted to try something different.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight scent which is neither pleasant nor unpleasant.</li>
            <li> LET DRY BEFORE APPLYING NEXT PRODUCT..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not to be confused with a super hero,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to notice long term benefits, but I certainly like the ingredients, the ease with which it soaks into my skin, and the way it leaves my skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, all by using just a very small amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say if I have seen any results as of yet, but I will update the review after I use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> so I have always been very limited in using different products</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed the brown spots diminish, HOWEVER it can take up to 2 months to see these types of results, and I have not been using it that long.</li>

            <li> I just realized a few days ago that they&#x27;re nearly gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After longer use, I will update this review to reflect any noticeable affects from the long term use of these ingredients,</li>
            <li> old and  have been using the product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, although I&#x27;m 67, but I have slight sagging of the jowls and dark, hollow circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I literally have not gotten a new pimple in the past four days.</li>
            <li> The only other serum I&#x27;ve ever used was a sample of well-known brand  </li>
            <li> The consistency is different from other serums as it is liquid and not creamy.  </li>
            <li> It really is so different from any other serums I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Now, at 30 I am still struggling with breakouts and am also beginning to notice my pores are getting bigger and some other signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> That being said I could do without the retinol as it tends to really dry out my already dry skin</li>
            <li> (my skin is dry).  </li>
            <li> I saw no new pimples with use.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to cover your skin as this bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to cover your skin as this bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Meaning, I&#x27;d like the following basic results:  a smoothing of wrinkles around my eyes; less dark under-eye circles; and a lightening of age spots/color imperfections.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a slight reduction in the vertical lines between my eyebrows and the &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; at the corners of my eyes as well as an overall improvement in the texture of the my skin.  </li>
            <li> I sure do wish this Vitamin C came in a lot bigger of a bottle! :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO  ALONE ARE HALF OF THE PRICE I PAID FOR ONE OF PRIOR RODUCTS......</li>
            <li> I DO USE A SIDE OF EXTRA HYAlURONIC PLAIN SERUM OVER THIS AND LET DRY BEFORE CREAM..</li>
            <li> I did not have any adverse reactions to the serum, which was a concern as I can occasionally get a lot of redness or even little blister-like bumps from stronger products.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks now, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> There are even additional ingredients that benefit the skin such as green tea, glycerin and vitamin E.</li>
            <li> There are even additional ingredients that benefit the skin such as green tea, glycerin and vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days now</li>
            <li> And I have spent thousands through the years on products that were just &amp;</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful what I use.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong here so worth the price...</li>
            <li> Have only been using this a few days</li>
            <li> formula contains robust key ingredients like Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Retinol, Niacinamide, CoQ10 and Astaxanthin that combine forces to fight off a few years.&lt;br /&gt;Body</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m disappointed that this second line of products didn&#x27;t preform any better than the previous brand.  </li>
            <li> I can feel my skin tightening as I put on the serum, and it has really helped minimize some of the few wrinkles that have popped up in the past few years.</li>
            <li> Only takes a little to work!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> When applying, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will be buying again, as well looking at their other products.</li>
            <li> It has a floral fragrance that is not overpowering and would not interfere with other scents.</li>
            <li> Having worked for a dermatologist in the past, I also use Retin A religiously.  </li>
            <li> It also works well with other night and day creams</li>
            <li> If you buy any other serum you&#x27;re probably wasting your money.  </li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and knew that it what it was going to look like.</li>
            <li> An orange color  some other reviewers mentioned, does not bother me whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to other buyers looking to improve the efficiency of moisturizers they are using.</li>
            <li> I guess its because the product gets oxidized due to the dropper style bottle.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers posted this serum does look like strained carrots and smells like it as well.  </li>
            <li> I was after, it also contained other beneficial ingredients that I hoped would address other skin care concerns</li>
            <li> A few other ingredients mixed into this are organic aloe, witch hazel, wheat germ oil, green tea , propolis and organic jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> The active ingredients match, so let&#x27;s try it</li>
            <li> I have a few wrinkles that I accept, and my expectations of this or any serum were not high.</li>
            <li> Hoping some of my dark spots begin to fade.</li>
            <li> For Wrinkles, Lines, Age Spots, Dark Spots.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It helps diminish dark spots, sun spots and freckles on my face.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, the redness has been reduced by at least %50, and it has only been 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> The serum is a slightly thick, translucent orange colored liquid, and the color blends into my skin, so it&#x27;s not noticeable, but I still apply it only at night.</li>

            <li> My facial discolorations is slowly fading.</li>
            <li> Going to try other products by this company!</li>
            <li> If aging isn&#x27;t your concern quite yet, the serum also targets uneven skin tone and texture like discoloration, acne, sun damage, hyperpigmentation and other marks, dark spots and</li>
            <li> I was slightly taken aback by the orange color.  </li>
            <li> Spots and wrinkles are less visible.</li>
            <li> The serum itself comes in the typical eye dropper bottle.</li>
            <li> and  I see less pores.</li>
            <li> WARNING: this product does give skin a tightening feeling as it dries and leaves your face a slight orange hue.</li>
            <li> I had to write a review because this is not your typical serum.</li>
            <li> This serum has a slight orange tint</li>
            <li> This product seemed promising due to the reviews &amp; rating but already after one night my face broke out with cystic bumps all over my cheeks, horrible purchase &amp; waste of money.obviously is not for sensitive skin &amp; it shouldn&#x27;t advertise as such</li>
            <li> Hard to tell this soon if it will be beneficial in the long run,</li>
            <li> I can see my dark spots disappearing little by little.  </li>
            <li> but I did have dark circles under eyes and few dark spots that have already lightened to the point I don&#x27;t use concealer and people notice a difference !</li>
            <li> first thing I like is there is no added fragrance, I hate when facial products and cosmetics have fragrance.</li>
            <li> Now, after a few weeks, I have also noticed some of the lines on my face getting less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy at all unlike some of the other serums I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> This little bottle is working wonders I will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels a little tighter.</li>
            <li> ALL MY RESEARCH IS NOW IN A LITTLE JAR.  </li>
            <li> TAKES A little DOES ALOT...</li>
            <li> In order to show my skin imperfections that I&#x27;m hoping to improve (and the lack of any benefit from these Body Merry products), I had my husband take some close up photos of my face to share (not fun!).  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for 4 days and have had some people notice a little differance.</li>
            <li> Since I started to use the product I noted it faded a little</li>
            <li> I used to use several different products but with this I&#x27;m cutting out a couple of steps and the drying time in between those products.  </li>
            <li> This serum does not have a harsh smell, its made in the USA, and it is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> so you just get the amount you need without waste.</li>

            <li> Their products are very expensive, this serum is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for a week now but a few days ago I noticed itchy small somewhat reddish bumps all over my forehead.</li>
            <li> It smells a little bit like carrots, and frankly, is the color of them too, but it works!</li>
            <li> Other products that I have tried do essentially nothing, and the cost of them is at least comparable, if not more expensive.</li>
            <li> , these are expensive processes that can leave skin damaged if not done properly.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, I feel as if the lines are slowly diminishing.  </li>
            <li> All of the components work together to keep the skin exfoliating without excessive drying.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and already see a difference!</li>
            <li> With even the slightest base tan it blends right in and gives me a brighter sunkissed glow.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am loving Body Merry&#x27;s Age Defense Super 6 Serum.  I have a few serums and this one is my favorite by far. I got this product for free, for a review, but all opinions are my own. First off this serum is not sticky.It has a nice consisity and it dries really well. You use 2-4 drops for your face and neck and thats it. The 1 fl oz bottle with dropper will last a long time. I use it morning and night and I can tell a difference in the way my face feels. I am looking for a youthful glow on a 40+ woman. This serum does not have a harsh smell, its made in the USA, and it is not tested on animals. If you are looking for a good  organic serum, with results, try this one. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://bodymerry.com or www.bodymerry.com</li>
            <li> This serum is AMAZING!  Not only is the citrus smell heavenly, the packaging superb, but the product itself is terrific! A few tiny drops will do the job, and your skin will feel a little &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; at first, but once the product dries, your skin feels baby soft.  Follow with the Body Merry Super-C Moisturizer (my personal favorite) and you will be amazed!  I can&#x27;t wait to see how wonderful my skin will look after a few weeks of consistent use. I&#x27;m already seeing a huge improvement is the redness and ruddiness I was experiencing before I discovered these Body Merry products.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel really good. It was not oily at all. It goes in the skin really quickly. I did get this for a review, but my opinion is 100% honest!</li>
            <li> i just loved this serum. it really works. it tightens your skin and makes it look more radiant. i love the way it dispenses. so you just get the amount you need without waste. my husband uses it as much as i do and he loves it as well. it is great for all skin types and you see the difference after just few uses. great product. i would recommend it to everybody.&lt;br /&gt;i received a free sample to test and review.</li>
            <li> My husband has been trying this one and he thinks it is by far the best retinol serum he has tried out of all the Body Merry serums available. They really hit the nail on the head with this one. It is REALLY a super serum. It contains some of the most powerful anti-aging components out there. It is orange/red in color but doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy texture on your skin, You can feel the tightening as soon as it starts to absorb. Well done Body Merry!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my aunt because I received a special discount from the seller to test it. My aunt saw how great my mother&#x27;s skin was beginning to look using a vitamin C serum that she wanted to try one out as well. She used it and said she liked that she did not need to use a lot if it on her face, which was a plus for her. Her skin seems brighter with it. It hasn&#x27;t worked on her lines yet but the way it brightens her face she said it makes her fine lines less noticeable. Overall she says she likes it. I&#x27;ll update this later if I see any improvements on her fine lines.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I can feel my skin tightening as I put on the serum, and it has really helped minimize some of the few wrinkles that have popped up in the past few years. I love that it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering odor!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all with this product. I love it as an addition to my routine that allows me to get vitamin c and retinol in one step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great and spreads evenly. I saw no new pimples with use.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!! Makes my face smooth glow. Really works.</li>
            <li> This serum is designed for anti aging and skin brightening. I like that it is made in the US and FDA registered and not tested on animals. It is contains natural and organic ingredients; that is something important to me as I move towards a more organic lifestyle. I apply this serum prior to using my morning moisturizer. My face is smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> Works great on my face. I only use it three days out of the week and my skin looks healthy and glowing. I love this product and I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I use this product only at night. It has strong orange color but it doesn&#x27;t last on your face. You can feel it absorbed quick and stay smooth. I have dry skin so still it won&#x27;t make me fully hydrated feeling but work great with moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I find my face smooth and silky in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Worthy to try!</li>
            <li> I have tried many vitamin C serums recently and I have to say I&#x27;m a fan of this one. I like that it has 22% vitamin C in it as all the others I have tried only has 20%. It also includes 20% Hyaluronic Acid, retinol, Niacinamide, CoQ10 and Astaxanthin to fight the signs of aging. A few other ingredients mixed into this are organic aloe, witch hazel, wheat germ oil, green tea , propolis and organic jojoba oil. I noticed my skin is a lot softer, more hydrated, and looks brighter. Using this serum followed by a moisturizer really helps so much. This serum helps your skin soak up moisturizer way better. My skin is sensitive and I have not had any redness or itching due to the natural and organic ingredients of this product. I also LOVE that this serum is made in the USA and is not tested on animals. That is a huge thing to me. So far I am very happy with this serum and my face is happy too! *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> I have been using the Age Defense-Super 6 Serum for almost a month now and I am quite impressed! I have sensitive skin and so far no irritation! I apply the serum after cleansing and toning (toner) both AM &amp; PM followed by a moisturizer (w/SPF in the AM). My skin feels brighter, more hydrated and firmer which is exactly what I was hoping to achieve!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this product. Once applied your skin looks and feels so much healthier!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results. Nice light serum.</li>
            <li> This face serum has cleared up my face. I have noticed that my face is a lot smoother and clearer.</li>
            <li> I like this serum and this line of products. The serum has a bright orange tint, but I only use it at night so it doesn&#x27;t matter. It also fades after you rub it in. It has kind of a unique smell, but not stinky. It almost smells like salad dressing. :) I don&#x27;t really care what it smells like as long as it works. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks now, but I do like it. It&#x27;s hard to say if I have seen any results as of yet, but I will update the review after I use the whole bottle. After doing my research, I know it has all the key ingredients it should for an anti-aging serum. I use the Super C-22 Moisturizer after the Serum soaks in. Great customer service from the seller as well! :)</li>
            <li> It is the best serum that I have used. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum! It&#x27;s orange, so you can really gauge how much you needier application.  A little goes a long way.  It dries quickly and I use my moisturizer over it.  It helps brighten my skin, and it&#x27;s smoothing out my fine lines. I will be buying again, as well looking at their other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now.  I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, although I&#x27;m 67, but I have slight sagging of the jowls and dark, hollow circles under my eyes. I do have sort of pre-wrinkles between my eyebrows. The serum doesn&#x27;t do much in the forehead area, but it does tighten the skin under my eyes considerably.  The effect seems temporary, however, and although I&#x27;m supposed to notice a difference in six to eight weeks of use, I&#x27;m doubting there will be any miraculous change.  But I am pleased with the temporary results, and will probably continue using it after this first bottle is empty, especially since it is rather inexpensive, and does give results, however temporary.  I have had no side effects, such as stinging or redness.  In all, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the product.  Other products that I have tried do essentially nothing, and the cost of them is at least comparable, if not more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products over the years and spent a lot of money, but I have found this one is the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.  I am on my second bottle and plan on continuing to use this serum.  My face is smoother and feels fabulous, I use it twice a day, opnce in the morning under my SPF 30 moisturizer and make up and evening with my night time moisturizer.  I am 60 plus years and I&#x27;m getting a lot of compliments on how good I look lately.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing all-in-one product!  So many benefits.  The product applies nicely to your face, not greasy at all.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling fresh. After only a couple weeks of using this product I have seen remarkable results. I love the Vitamin C combined with the Reitnol and other age fighting ingredients.  It&#x27;s a great product and an amazing price!</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to review this brand new product from Body Merry that is &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; loaded with ingredients highly touted to provide natural skin care to fight the aging skin process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it is made of natural and organic ingredients and is made in the USA in an FDA registered and GMP compliant facility. It is great that it is not tested on animals, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Super 6 Anti Aging Defense Serum was applied first on cleansed face. In my opinion, using the recommended 4 drops barely spreads over the face, but that is the  maximum number of drops recommended. This serum is a reddish color in the bottle and after application, my face had a reddish tint. This discoloration did not last, though. The directions for the Super 6 Serum state to apply a moisturizer after using the Super 6 Serum.&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any fantastic improvements in my skin during this trial period, nor have I seen any problems. I like that this product is suitable for men or women to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that anyone who desires the best for their skin apply a good quality serum.  Body Merry creates several good good products &amp; the Super 6 Serum is a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice light serum for the face. It soaks right into the skin and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft. I really like this product as it feels good under makeup and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Not really noticing any difference,I got it because of what the description said, I don&#x27;t have any peeling at all, I wanted the Retin A because it was a higher concentrate but,I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> This product seemed promising due to the reviews &amp; rating but already after one night my face broke out with cystic bumps all over my cheeks, horrible purchase &amp; waste of money.obviously is not for sensitive skin &amp; it shouldn&#x27;t advertise as such</li>

Product comes in an amber glass bottle with eye dropper. It is made in the USA. It is not tested on animals. The product remains fresh for 12 months after opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product: The product is a reddish liquid. Only a few drops are needed to cover face, with a few more drops for chin and neck area. It goes on easily and absorbs quickly. It absorbs so well that it can be worn under sunscreen and makeup. The product plumps the skin and hides fine lines and wrinkles. It has a floral fragrance that is not overpowering and would not interfere with other scents. The product hydrates and moisturizes skin. For even more hydration a separate moisturizing cream can be used. With continued use the benefits of hydration, smoothing, soothing, and refining skin appearance and texture also continue. I love combining a number of ingredients into one &amp;#34;Super&amp;#34; serum. There is no need to apply multiple products to get the same effect. This product combines 6 wonderful ingredients that are essential in skin care. I will list and describe each one:&lt;br /&gt;22% Vitamin C - This is an antioxidant that can stimulate the production of collagen and minimizes fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;2.5% Retinol - This increases collagen production, plumps the skin which minimizes fine lines and wrinkles, it also brightens skin and helps to reduce irregular pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;20% Hyaluronic Acid - This is actually already produced by the body to lubricate joints and to hydrate skin. As we age the natural HA is reduced. HA in this serum helps to moisturize the skin and helps the skin actually retain more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;2.5% Niacinamide (B3) - This vitamin improves skin elasticity. It can reduce the inflammation of the skin reducing redness. Also, it has been found to increase the effectiveness of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;2.5% CoQ10 - This is an antioxidant that can neutralize free radicals that can cause damage to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;0.5% Astaxanthin - This antioxidant helps reduce inflammation, protects skin cells and is especially useful under sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;This combination of 6 active ingredients really left my skin looking great. There are even additional ingredients that benefit the skin such as green tea, glycerin and vitamin E. My skin remains soft and smooth and the skin tone has evened out. While your results may not be identical to mine, I do recommend this product as your &amp;#34;one-stop-shop&amp;#34; for skin care.n this serum helps to moisturize the skin and helps the skin actually retain more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;2.5% Niacinamide (B3) - This vitamin improves skin elasticity.

            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been looking into correcting the sun damage on my face, mainly brown spots (lentigo), old acne marks and a tendency towards reddish blotchiness. I know, it sounds so attractive, but I am in my 40s and while I honestly do not have any wrinkles or crows feet, I really want the tone of my skin to be more even and improved. I initially looked into laser, then chemical peels, and while I may do a peel in the fall/winter when I&#x27;m not outside in the sun so much (I do wear sunscreen religiously nowadays), these are expensive processes that can leave skin damaged if not done properly. So I decided to look into more conservative measures, like serums and moisturizers with beneficial ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking at beauty retailers with very expensive products that had reasonably good reviews, but I&#x27;m not made of money, so I wanted to choose wisely. I was seriously considering another retailer that has excellent reviews and a great reputation, and they were offering a set of 2 products, a vitamin C serum and a moisturizer, also with vitamin C. Both had a great list of ingredients, but the price was still high. Then my boyfriend mentioned buying an eye cream from Body Merry. He had dry spots near his eyes and wanted to stop using my eye cream up. His eye area looks much softer and fresher now (and I started using his eye cream now, I like it!). So I checked Body Merry out on Amazon, and found they had a vitamin C serum and a moisturizer that had almost the exact same ingredients as the other retailer&#x27;s products I was planning to buy, but at half the price. Some of the amounts of the ingredients in the Body Merry serum were even slightly higher than the pricier serum, so I thought &amp;#34;what do I have to lose?&amp;#34; The active ingredients match, so let&#x27;s try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I like is there is no added fragrance, I hate when facial products and cosmetics have fragrance. Nobody is smelling my face, I prefer to just use perfume if I want to smell like a flower. Next, the products are vegan and cruelty free, which has always been important to me. It doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin and soaks in very well. The serum is a slightly thick, translucent orange colored liquid, and the color blends into my skin, so it&#x27;s not noticeable, but I still apply it only at night. I started out with 3 times a week, as I hadn&#x27;t used any retinol products in a few years (used to use prescription retin-A for acne). I did not have any adverse reactions to the serum, which was a concern as I can occasionally get a lot of redness or even little blister-like bumps from stronger products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to bump up my usage to 5 times a week, as I&#x27;d like to see if it works any faster. My skin texture is really nice and smooth, and the few fine lines I had have been minimized. I haven&#x27;t noticed the brown spots diminish, HOWEVER it can take up to 2 months to see these types of results, and I have not been using it that long. On the plus side, I have not noticed an increase in my spots (though I do wear sunscreen), and 1 particular blotch does seem to be ever so slightly lighter. My take on this serum is that in the month I&#x27;ve been using it, I have noticed a texture improvement and fine lines seem minimized, and my complexion overall seems brighter, less &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34;, which is worth it just for those improvements. It will be longer term for any spot fading/reduction from the retinol and vitamin C ingredients to be apparent, but I will continue to use it just for the way my skin feels now.mell like a flower.

            <li> I was very excited to receive and try this serum as I have other Body Merry products and have been extremely happy and satisfied with there products.  The age defense super 6 serum came in a dropper bottle which made it very easy for application.  I was slightly taken aback by the orange color.  It however went on smoothly and was absorbed nicely into the skin without leaving a sticky feeling or residue.  I have sensitive skin and this product did not cause any problems at all.  I have fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead so I concentrated on those areas first.  After a few weeks of use, I feel as if the lines are slowly diminishing.  There is 22% vitamin C which is above the average amount found in most serums.  When applying, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my skin, especially my facial skin keeps flaking and looks awful.  Would not buy again!  Have been using for several weeks - looking for the end of flaking and improvement in sight.</li>
            <li> Nice feel to my skin. Hoping some of my dark spots begin to fade. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I use this serum after using the dermaroller and it sinks in quite fast in this usage. I&#x27;ve used it without the dermaroller and have noticed that it does not sink in quite quickly in this application and remains sticky for about half an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is orange color but it does not transfer to the skin, clothes or pillowcases.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I never write reviews but I feel compelled to write this one because I truly am beyond satisfied with this product, the serum is great and I also use it with the body merry super c-22 moisturizer, and let me tell you it works!! I&#x27;m a 32 year old female with oily skin so I was nervous to use it because it didn&#x27;t want it to over moisturize and cause more oil and clogged pores but it did the total opposite, it has balanced out my skin and it isn&#x27;t oily anymore, also it has really evened out my skin tone, I had some acne scarring that has faded significantly and also I do feel my skin is looking more youthful, which is amazing! I also use the body merry age defense eye cream at night because of my very bad dark circles that I&#x27;ve had my whole life and I can definitely tell a BIG difference with the under eye circles, so if anyone needs something for that I would definitely recommend it. Body Merry is truly a one of a kind company, they make EFFECTIVE products and are totally affordable, and work better than every other product I have used thus far. Don&#x27;t wait, just buy it and you won&#x27;t regret it :)&lt;br /&gt;  I have nothing on my face in the picture except the serum and super c-22 moisturizer.</li>
            <li> All the Merry Products far exceeded my expectations.  I am 51 and avoid the sun completely.  Having worked for a dermatologist in the past, I also use Retin A religiously.  Since using the Merry Products, my husband even said my skin looks younger.  After all my years of paying a fortune for Strivectin, never once did he tell me that.  I am now a forever customer.</li>
            <li> I am just loving this product!  I have been using it along with the moisturizer that is also from Body Merry.  What a luxurious serum!  I love how it feels as it goes onto my skin.  Not heavy or greasy at all!  My skin looks radiant. I love Body Merry&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> This serum is one of my favorite ones to use. It has an orange color and the scent is mild and almost reminds me of cucumbers. I take about 3-4 drops on my finger tips and rub it in all over my face. It gives an instant silky feel over my fave and feels very hydrating. This is one I do not want to push to the side and use all up. I just love the instant soothing feel I get upon using it. I think you will be happy with it too. I purchased this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen real, positive changes in my skin since using this serum. It&#x27;s smoother, more even toned, and even a little tighter under my chin (stupid under chin area!). And it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> Not greasy residue left over like some.&lt;br /&gt;odorless. Will have to check back after long term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free/ or a discounted price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product &amp; have not used it long enough to leave a formal review, though, it does hydrate very well:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days now but already I am beginning to see results. The first day I used it with my dermaroller and was glad that the ingredients were mild enough to not burn or bother the tender skin afterwards. It absorbed very quickly with no greasy residue. The orange color of the serum is awesome. With even the slightest base tan it blends right in and gives me a brighter sunkissed glow. Hopefully it will also help with my acne scars and smile lines.  Will update more after the 4 wk recommended use period. So far nothing but good things to say. Package arrived the next day even though it was 2 day shipping. The bottle came in its own box, sealed, not in bubble wrap as some others have stated.</li>
            <li> I like this serum but tried it as an alternative to the pro-A serum. I prefer the Pro-A myself but also haven&#x27;t given this one long enough to truly see the results. Think it all depends on your skin.</li>
            <li> It seemed to have made me breakout more...</li>
            <li> I am just adding this product to my daily routine, will assess it later.  I do like this company and their products, so expect only good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for well over a month, once per day in the AM, skipped a day here and there. I have a few wrinkles that I accept, and my expectations of this or any serum were not high. The only other serum I&#x27;ve ever used was a sample of well-known brand  I received with a department store cosmetics purchase. I had noticed no difference after a few weeks.  But I&#x27;m truly surprised by and very happy with the improvements I see from using Best Vitamin C Serum. A couple of almost dime sized,  noticeable sun spots on my cheeks have faded considerably. I just realized a few days ago that they&#x27;re nearly gone. That&#x27;s pretty amazing.  Overall, my skin looks plumper, less wrinkled,  skin color more even and it feels softer as well.  I just ordered another bottle - don&#x27;t want to run out of this. Also, since I don&#x27;t use foundation (it&#x27;s too hot and humid where I live to wear foundation) the slight warm colored tint this serum leaves on the skin, topped by my moisturizer, works very well for me too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month. I am 60 years old, fair skin, some broken capillaries, redhead. So......problems with thin, sensitive skin that cannot be exfoliated due to broken capillaries........but we all know how mature skin needs exfoliation to renew cells and give the skin that fresh look......whats a gal to do.....sigh.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well this serum solved my problem. It GENTLY exfoliates without drying out my complexion. My skin looks more youthful, plumper, more even-toned and no need for primer before makeup. I skipped a day and my makeup did not stay put or look very good that day. This serum goes on first (after cleansing with mild cleanser and then mild toner to take off every trace of makeup).....then I follow with the Body Merry Vitamin C moisturizer and my face has never looked better!  And I have spent thousands through the years on products that were just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Body Merry eye cream and their neck cream......both absolutely amazing also. I just began using their cellulite cream so cannot review it just yet, but so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not paid for this review nor have I received free product. I just want women to know that no matter what your age, these products can bring you renewed skin and a happy outlook when you put your best face forward......AND, very affordable.......they last a long time.  Peace!</li>
            <li> Ordered after reading reviews and looking for a product to help with aging and some sun spots. Overall, not too impressed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for one week and my skin feels better every day.</li>
            <li> I like the product. My facial discolorations is slowly fading. It&#x27;s easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t make my very light skin orange.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My skin is softer and clearer. Someone guessed my age as 10 years younger than I am.  That is awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my face it makes my face feel smoth and young again</li>
            <li> This is a great serum, it goes on super smooth but doesn&#x27;t make your face look oily! It&#x27;s not greasy at all unlike some of the other serums I&#x27;ve used in the past. It works really good for those laugh lines &amp; crows feet :) I especially love that it&#x27;s made in the USA and uses a lot of vitamin C in the formula.</li>
            <li> This serum is great I apply it to my face and neck. Less really is more with this. Its a bright orange color that absorbs into your skin fairly quickly. It&#x27;s not irritating and it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin. I find that after using this for a few weeks my skin is more healthier and it is more hydrated. I love how smoothly it applies to my skin. The smell is not overpowering and on the lite side which I enjoy. This little bottle is working wonders I will continue to use it.  I purchased this during a promotional pricing period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> Has a smell , but works ! Comes out red out of the bottle but it won&#x27;t stain your skin. I was happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Everything you would ever want in an anti-aging serum is in this bottle! Talk about packing a punch! I love this serum. It helped make my skin soft and evened out my skin tone and even soothed a couple of large, inflamed areas of acne. It absorbs well and is non-greasy. I put this serum on first and put the vitamin c moisturizer by body merry on 2nd, followed by my makeup. Everything goes on smoothly. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I combine it with a retinol moisturizer. I have been using them for less than 1 week and my face, neck, hands and arms look amazing! My skin tone is more even. Spots and wrinkles are less visible. My skin looks so fresh. I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> This serum is a very complete serum so much so you will not need others to do the same thing . This one is packed with vitamin C and so much more its really the most complete I have tried . That being said I could do without the retinol as it tends to really dry out my already dry skin BUT since this serum also has a lot of moisturizing ingredients its Ok for me to use and it did not dry me out as much as retinol alone would do . It also works well with other night and day creams I tried with it.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> The Body Merry packaging is so bright and cheerful. It catches your eye right away. The serum itself comes in the typical eye dropper bottle. I noticed that the serum has a yellowy color. The serum is very simple to use. You just put a few drops on your fingers and then dot it gently around your face.But, the smell wasn&#x27;t so fabulous. Fortunately, it dissipated quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this company is cruelty-free and uses sustainable products. They also offer a 90 day 100% money back guarantee. I like supporting companies that have the same types of values that I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Age Defense Super 6 Serum has six in the name because of it&#x27;s six ingredients that have known effects on the skin: 22% Vitamin C Serum for Face with 2.5% Retinol, 20% Hyaluronic Acid, 2.5% Niacinamide, 2.5% CoQ10 and 0.5% Astaxanthin. I like that this serum is for age defense, which, is what I need the most. It &amp;#34;helps to diminish the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, but also leaves your skin plump, hydrated and nourished with an even and brighter looking complexion.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice a difference right away, however, this is one of those products that is meant to show a difference over time. With the ingredients in it, such as Retinol, I look forward to looking younger each day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that the higher percentage of vitamin C, the more face lifting performance.  Also retinal is a chemical exfoliator that works to loosen cells beneath skin surface.  This product really works.  I push up around the brow area and it makes my eyes bigger.  Great product.  Try it for yourself.  I used to work in cosmetics in Clinque and Christian Dior.  Their products are very expensive, this serum is reasonably priced.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase because it works!</li>
            <li> Loved this super 6 serum! My laugh lines have seemed to lessen! Which I LOVED .. left my face feeling refreshed! I used it with another product of there&#x27;s and it has become a morning must for me! I recommend any of there products! Very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS item in Exchange FOR MY UNBIASED HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Like the way it feels.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. I use it together with the moisturizer, so it&#x27;s hard to tell which does better job. Somehow I prefer the moisturizer because I think it is more brightening. But I&#x27;m still glad I got the serum too</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 week and my sunspots have gotten darken. So disappointed and upset about the spots getting darker.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best serum I have ever used.  The results were noticeable after about 30 days (using as directed morning and night). I have seen a slight reduction in the vertical lines between my eyebrows and the &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; at the corners of my eyes as well as an overall improvement in the texture of the my skin.  Please note:  I have very realistic expectations.  I am 55 years old and I do not want or expect my skin to look like I am 40. The consistency is different from other serums as it is liquid and not creamy.  That is a plus for me because when followed (as directed) by eye cream and a moisturizer, other serums cause too much oiliness.  The bottom line:  this a an excellent product and a GREAT value if you have realistic expectations about what to expect from any beauty treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a month now.  The biggest thing I&#x27;ve noticed is how smooth my skin is, very noticeable difference.  I can also see my neck wrinkles starting to look better.  My sun spots aren&#x27;t getting worse, and usually in the middle of the summer, they get worse and worse by the day. I&#x27;m looking forward to what my skin will look like with extended use.  I do recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their skin tone and appearance of wrinkles and sun spots.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to purchase it,  i saw results on my neck in the first few applications. My skin feels a little tighter.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have tried no less than 10 different types of serums all varying in price and I love this product the best!. It goes on smooth and absorbs allowing you then to follow with your moisturizer. I love the consistency and how your skin receives the product! Going to try other products by this company!</li>
            <li> This is a great face serum with a lot more great ingredients than just the 6 featured on the front of the label.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. It is not oily and it makes my skin feel silky smooth. My skin really has never felt better.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the orange color.  Stains my fingers and nails</li>
            <li> I like it, it works, I see the result. After using once I ordered second one and I will.</li>
            <li> My skin is acne-prone yet also dry, and this is one of the first serums I have tried that I have actually liked, rather than just was okay with. After a few uses, my skin began to look dewy and healthy, but it did not break me out (and even seemed to lighten some scarring and stuff), so I will most likely repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> The application of Best Vitamin C Serum 22% (highest percentage of anti-aging Vitamin C agent) not only nourishes my face but gives my facial skin a radiant glow that makes me look more healthy.  I especially notice this wonderful effect when I apply it after I first wake up in the morning! It&#x27;s a noticeable difference.  Healthy and makes me look better...I really like that winning combination!</li>
            <li> This product is just how it was described to be. I received an email from the seller explaining all the uses and correct amounts and best times. I love the way it feels going on, the scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I have ordered. I am very pleased with the results .. fine lines diminish, skin tone evens out and my face looks and feels moisturized. After initially using it just once a day to see how my skin would react, I am now using it twice a day. I really like this product .. this is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; facial serum. For me, there is no need to try anything else. With the retinol, vitamin C and hyaluronic acid it is a very complete serum.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to use lots of harsh chemicals on my skin. I&#x27;ve checked the ingredients&lt;br /&gt;in this product and they are all valid ingredients. I like the way it feels and works&lt;br /&gt;on my sensitive skin. It does not irritate it and I feel good about putting it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable.  I&#x27;ve used more expensive products&lt;br /&gt;that don&#x27;t work and am picky about what I use. I am happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Disclosure: I was given a reduced price to try this product.</li>
            <li> I have found this to be as described and am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> I am convinced it is absolutely necessary to use vitamin C serum every day on face, neck and chest.  I have used many different vitamin C serums over the years and although I haven&#x27;t used Super 6 Serum long enough to fairly judge its efficacy,  I  believe it is starting to lighten dark spots and refine the texture of my skin.  All of the components work together to keep the skin exfoliating without excessive drying.  I have not notice staining of my skin due to the serum&#x27;s bright  orange color.  I&#x27;m using it twice per day added to a bit of Argan oil and have had  no problems at all.  This product may very well be  at least as good, if not better, than much more expensive serums  I&#x27;ve used.  I will be reordering and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three months later:  I am beautiful!!!  Well, maybe not me...but my skin is.  The compliments I&#x27;m getting prove it&#x27;s not my imagination and I&#x27;m closer to 70 than to 60 yrs old.  If you buy any other serum you&#x27;re probably wasting your money.  And I&#x27;m not even using the Argan oil anymore.  Dec 28,2015</li>
            <li> This is amazing! It&#x27;s a great effective product for a great price. You will not be disappointed - this is much more effective than the more expensive products I have tried in the past. Give it a try -it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this serum. My face feels hydrated and soft after I use it. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I really liked this serum.  I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful what I use.  There has been plenty of times I&#x27;ve tried something new and broke out the next day so I when I used this the first time I had no expectations.  I was so EXCITED when my sensitive skin not only tolerated it but also felt better after use.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation or rashes and instead my skin felt better and started looking better too.</li>
            <li> Best product for the money-I am 62 and tried them all!  I have seen a real reduction in fine lines and a prevention of new wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Makes my complexion glow!</li>
            <li> Love the product so far. As an older woman, I&#x27;m not expecting miracles, but the overall tone of my skin is improving by the week. Skin tone is more even, fine lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li> This remedy I have found is super! It tucks in my face, moisturizes it, and it&#x27;s gentle. Feels great on my skin! I&#x27;m 49-years old and now I want to try more of the same products! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I sure do wish this Vitamin C came in a lot bigger of a bottle! :( I love this vitamin C serum!</li>
            <li> My skin is loving this serum. I mainly use Paula&#x27;s Choice products and am very happy with them but read the reviews on this product and thought I would try it. My skin is pretty sensitive and I have no problems with this serum. I have some age spots and this is helping to lighten them. It also holds in moisture very well. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this again. No irratation at all and has improved the look of my skin at age 60!</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. It is very refreshing and nice on the skin. Im looking forward to seeing good results from this serum, Hopefully my skin will get brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> Great product! I love it and will buy again. My face became luminous and soft after using this product! Thank you.</li>
            <li> My serum arrived and I began using it immediately. I felt that the results were fine. Then I went on an overseas trip and left my serum at home for fear the bottle would break (it&#x27;s glass). That&#x27;s when I noticed my skin was looking less than good. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to use my serum again! Back home and my skin is amazing! I&#x27;ve been telling everyone I know that this is a must in their beauty routine. My discolorations have smoothed out, my fine lines disappeared, my hydration level is perfect! Buy it!</li>
            <li> Received thus product with a substantial discount for my review.  Didn&#x27;t need to use this for a while to rate it,  I am a high end skincare junkie, so I know what I am talking about,  Immediately I noticed a humectant affect when applied under my moisturizer,  For this reason alone, I would most certainly buy this again.  I will be putting this on under my high end products,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After longer use, I will update this review to reflect any noticeable affects from the long term use of these ingredients,</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong here so worth the price...Have only been using this a few days and my face is brighter, smoother and has a healthy glow</li>
            <li> This feels great on the skin and smells like oranges.  I put the Vitamin C moisturizer over it once the serum has soaked in. It makes your skin feel smooth and nourished.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and amazing customer service!!!!  This is now the only product I need... read my review for the cream after SERUM is used...it says it all.... BEST FRIEND FAMILY FOR THE FACE.. I EVEN PUT ON HANDS AND GREAT FOR AGE SPOTS.  I LOVE THIS... AND WILL HOPE THEY JUST KEEP UP THE SCIENCE... I WILL BUY IT ALL....SAVE A FORTUNE AND GET IT ALL IN ONE. THEN GET CREAM ALL IN ONE.  THOSE TO&lt;br /&gt;SO  ALONE ARE HALF OF THE PRICE I PAID FOR ONE OF PRIOR RODUCTS......DRINK WATER AND TAKE COLLAGEN ESTER C.. LIFE I MEAN FACIE NECK AND HAND CHANGING... ALL MY RESEARCH IS NOW IN A LITTLE JAR.  TAKES A little DOES ALOT... SMALL HELP TIP LEAVE FACE SLIGHTLY DAMP.  LET DRY BEFORE APPLYING NEXT PRODUCT..I DO USE A SIDE OF EXTRA HYAlURONIC PLAIN SERUM OVER THIS AND LET DRY BEFORE CREAM.. DON&#x27;T REALLY BELIEVE YOU NEED IT. THAT&#x27;S JUST ME FOR I AM 58 AND LOOK GREAT BECAUSE OF ALL THESE COMBINATIONS FOR YEARS. NOW I CAN AFFORD TWO EXTRA PLANE TICKETS A YEAR TO SEE MY. KID.....THANKS GUYS... FANTASTIC KNOWLEDGE....LOVE LOVE.....</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this because it had such great reviews and used it regularly with the Body Merry Super C22 Moisturizer which claims &amp;#34;Best Vitamin C Moisturizer - Face Cream - 22% Vitamin C, 20% Hyaluronic Acid, 2.5% Niacinamide, 2.5% CoQ10 - Natural + Organic Anti-Aging - For Wrinkles, Lines, Age Spots, Dark Spots.&amp;#34;  The combination is very nice.  The serum is not greasy or slimy after it dries (very quickly) and feels nice on the skin. There is no problem putting it on under makeup. The only complaint is that it does not have the same delicious smell as the accompanying moisturizer (which smells like oranges and is heavenly).  But there is no unpleasant odor; just not much scent at all.  The combination of these two very inexpensive products keeps the skin supple and moisturized.  The dropper is easy to use. The color is a bright orange, but does not stay that color on the skin when applied.  Overall, very nice products from Body Merry.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for 3 days and I&#x27;m already in love with it!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft!  Goes on easily, says to use 5-6 drops I usually need 8 to do face and neck. I have used this for over a month now. I got this at a reduced price for an unbiased opinion and I will probably buy again.</li>
            <li> I am searching for a facial regimen that will help reduce the signs of aging (I am 39 and have not spent a lot of time in the sun).  Meaning, I&#x27;d like the following basic results:  a smoothing of wrinkles around my eyes; less dark under-eye circles; and a lightening of age spots/color imperfections.  I tried LilyAna Naturals brand items first, and found absolutely no effect.  The company, however, does have VERY good customer service and their product quality was good.  Just no impact on my skin.  SO, for my second attempt at a new facial care brand, I chose to try Body Merry products.  I purchased this (1) Body Merry Vitamin C serum, (2) the Body Merry Retinol Surge Moisturizer and (3) the Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream.  I purchased all three, hoping that by not mixing different brands (i.e. moisturizer, eye cream and Vitamin C serum) they&#x27;re work well together.  Result?  Sad to say, again NO IMPACT.  My goal is NOT to try a million facial products and review them all.  I really am trying to find a facial regime that works.  So I&#x27;m disappointed that this second line of products didn&#x27;t preform any better than the previous brand.  The Body Merry products do seem high quality.  The packaging is nice.  And I do like the natural, herbal type smells in the eye cream.  But I&#x27;m not back to looking through a million amazon reviews, trying to find *something that actually works.*  In order to show my skin imperfections that I&#x27;m hoping to improve (and the lack of any benefit from these Body Merry products), I had my husband take some close up photos of my face to share (not fun!).  If you look at the photos, you&#x27;ll see I have brown discoloration spots all along my cheekbones, along the sides of my nose and on the skin above my lips.  I tried the Vitamin C product and the Retinol Surge Moisturizer for 3 weeks now, and there has been NO fading of any of the spots shown in the photos.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I can see my dark spots disappearing little by little.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This serum is awesome!  My skin looks amazing!  It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> This is probably the maximum anti-aging serum you can find. It contains Vitamin C,  Hyaluronic Acid, Retinol, Niacinamide, CoQ10 and Astaxanthin. All these ingredients play a great role in the anti-aging market. Vitamin C is my favorite anti-aging serum. It helps diminish dark spots, sun spots and freckles on my face. It&#x27;s light and non-greasy. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and bright. It&#x27;s great around the eyes, especially if you have dark circles. It also evens out the tone of my skin. I purchased this product on promo. This is the 2nd item I&#x27;ve tried form this brand&#x27;s product line. And so far their products have had an exceptional impression on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night, I love how easy it soaks in, not greasy at all. Will continue to use and hope to see some of the sun spots on my face start to fade. The dry spots are much better almost gone.</li>
            <li> Im Asian, with light complexion and have normal skin. 29 yo. As I am turning 30 in a few months I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but wanted to start preventing them. Been using this for a week now but a few days ago I noticed itchy small somewhat reddish bumps all over my forehead. Wish I could swap this out for a different product. Maybe the pro version? Has anyone tried the pro and then this one?</li>
            <li> just AWESOME... CLEARING MY FACE UPON REGULAR USE.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working, but I have made a lot of changes to my routine as well</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying this is the most customer friendly skin care company I have ever dealt with.  I was reading a review of serums and this brand was mentioned as being superior.  I sent an email asking for a recommendation based on my age (62) and the condition of my skin (old).  Sarah emailed soon after and recommended the Super 6 Serum.  It really is so different from any other serums I have tried.  The bright orange color lets you see where you are applying it and then it just disappears into your skin. The consistency is thicker and not runny, which is a good thing.  It is a perfect base and my skin seems to like it.  One of my daughter&#x27;s 20 something friends told her my skin looked amazing.  I use this in conjunction with the C-22 toner and moisturizer and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This product applies smoothly on my skin, it is not irritating and I can use it before my moisturizer. Very pleased with the quality and texture.</li>
            <li> was a little surprised by the bright orange color, even tho I read the other reviews and knew that it what it was going to look like. I&#x27;ve been using for a couple weeks now with the retinol moisturizer--my neck and face look great!!</li>
            <li> I used different Vitamin C serum, this one is the best, I intend to reorder. If used with a potent spot treatment cream, it can boost more whitening power. I am a Asian with speckles.</li>

The dropper top helps to keep the process mess free and from contamination by not having to actually touch the product. You only need a small amount to cover your skin as this bottle will last you a long time. I must admit that I was a bit hesitate when I saw the color orange. Normally serums are clear.

            <li> I feel it tightening my skin which is what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;I want to keep using it to see how it works out. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles now, but I think this may help to prevent it.</li>
            <li> Amazing serum! I was able to feel the results on my skin right away and after consistent use my skin looks so much brighter and feels incredibly soft. This serum will definitely be a staple product in my routine from now on.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only been using this serum at night, but I love the results upon waking up! My skin not only looks clearer, but it feels smoother as well, thus resulting in easier makeup application. I have sensitive skin, but I do not notice any burning or skin irritation whatsoever from the retinol in this serum. And although they say that the orange tint might cause your skin to turn orange, this has not happened to my face at all. I am definitely reordering this serum again, before I run out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used vitamin c on my face and this is the best by far, next to alina skin care&#x27;s serum. Both are super great!</li>
            <li> This serum has all of the qualities to help your skin look amazing. I&#x27;ve used several serums but I keep trying others, depending on costs and availability and this brand is top quality. If you are a first time user of Vit C serums, just know it&#x27;s normal for your skin to get taunt. Apply  moisturizer in areas that need it and remember this serum is helping your skin in ways you won&#x27;t see.  I&#x27;ve used great products for 35 years and it has paid off (I&#x27;m 60) and people are always asking me what I do because my skin does look 15 years younger than many. Great product!</li>
            <li> Most of the Vitamin C serum I have tried only have 20%  Vitamin C  so Body Merry Super Serum 6 is already superior in that regard that it has 22% Vitamin C. It has a slight scent which is neither pleasant nor unpleasant. I love the consistency because it&#x27;s not too watery. It is easy to apply and it absorbs quicly. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky, oily feeling. Another thing I love about this serum is that it also contains 2.5% retinol. I would usually apply my retinol moisturizer on top of my vitamin C so I&#x27;m pleased that I can have both with one application. Plus all of the additional skin-aging fighters that comes with this bottle like Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, and COQ10. It surely helps with my depigmentation and fine lines and wrinkles. Fight those nasty free radicals with this Vitamin C Serum. Got this bottle at a huge discount to try and review and I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks but I already see a difference in my complexion and how soft my skin feels. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Very good combination !!!!</li>
            <li> I love using this serum. It is my favorite.  It penetrates fast and it is not making my skin dry.  People noticed my face looks refreshed and  I see less pores. I already re-ordered 2 times. Thank you for the great product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy the face lotion from the same company. I hope I will enjoy it as much as this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face product and I have many. Best thing on the market.</li>
            <li> Arrived when seller stated. So far I&#x27;m very happy with product, now after three uses. My skinfeels great after use, would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to notice long term benefits, but I certainly like the ingredients, the ease with which it soaks into my skin, and the way it leaves my skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, all by using just a very small amount. I have added this to my daily moisturizing regiment and plan or many future repurchases.  MANY THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product about 2 weeks now, just at night, and I am seeing a definite difference in my skin tone. My cheeks and area between my brows have a tendency to be red (not rosacea or acne, just overall redness). Since using this product, the redness has been reduced by at least %50, and it has only been 2 weeks! My skin overall looks a lot more even and very healthy. I have not seen much improvement in my age spots or wrinkles yet but the company says results are typical in 6-8 weeks, so I can&#x27;t complain. But even if it does nothing else I am thrilled with what it has done. WARNING: this product does give skin a tightening feeling as it dries and leaves your face a slight orange hue. It takes me 5-6 drops to cover my face but it spreads pretty well. Definitely dries out the skin though, so be sure to use moisturizer after. I use the Body Merry Super-C moisturizer, and I have noticed that if the serum has not dried really well it can lather the moisturizer. Just an FYI</li>
            <li> Since I am not the first time facial serums user, I started to use the Super Serum &amp;#34;full time&amp;#34; . It did not give me any allergic reactions. It glides on very smoothly and is a very pleasant product to use. I am using it under several different moisturizers that I have on my cosmetic counter. An orange color  some other reviewers mentioned, does not bother me whatsoever. The product gives a very nice plumped feeling to the face.  I have been using it around three weeks only, there is still much product in the bottle. I like it and will continue to use it. Would recommend it to other buyers looking to improve the efficiency of moisturizers they are using. Also wanted to mention that the customer service is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I used to use several different products but with this I&#x27;m cutting out a couple of steps and the drying time in between those products.  This dries very fast and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.  I honestly haven&#x27;t seen a difference, but that&#x27;s good, because with this 1 product I&#x27;m replacing 3 and I&#x27;m not looking anymore hideous than before.  Since it dries so fast I can put lotion and sunscreen on right away, saving me a little time.  The list of ingredients and the amount is impressive and cost effective.  I especially like that there&#x27;s no silicone products.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m really liking this! I love the carrot kind of smell and how quickly it absorbs. I also notice some brightening in my pigmentation :)</li>
            <li> This is the best! It seems to help fade some of my sunspots/hyperpigmentation on my face. I also use it on the back of my hands. Love!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!!  It makes my face &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;!  Only takes a little to work!</li>
            <li> I had to write a review because this is not your typical serum. I feel like this is all about the C (which is why I bought it) and it seems like it&#x27;s really good quality and well made, but it&#x27;s not like the moisturizing serums you might be used to. It sinks in and you&#x27;re ready for moisturizer. -And their moisturizer is fab. Very happy so far. I&#x27;ll upgrade to 5 stars if I love it after a few weeks. :)</li>
            <li> I really love the way that this makes my skin feel and what it does for the appearance and texture. I have very sensitive skin and have been struggling with breakouts since I was 11. Now, at 30 I am still struggling with breakouts and am also beginning to notice my pores are getting bigger and some other signs of aging. I&#x27;ve been using this Super 6 Serum for about a week and I literally have not gotten a new pimple in the past four days. The blemishes that were on my skin before are now almost completely healed. My pores are smaller, my skin is soft, and the texture and tone of my skin is finally headed toward smooth and even. I do use a little more than the instructions say, but that might be because my skin is a little more thirsty than others might be; still, a little bit goes a very long way. The color threw me off at first (it&#x27;s a bright orangey-red color) and the smell is different. It&#x27;s not a bad smell--honestly I think it smells a little like play-dough. Really, though, this stuff is fantastic and it is now part of my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li> This is the best serum ever! Your skin will look beautiful and you will look youthful with continuous use. I never give reviews for anything but i just had to let everyone know that this is gentle to the skin and very effective! I love this product!!!!!.</li>
            <li> Good product! I enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks in conjunction with the vitamin C moisturizer. I like the consistency of the serum, it is light  and is not sticky. I have noticed an improvement in skin tone</li>
            <li> Excellent product, first time to use it, almost half the bottle, I have problem with aging spots, works good on the side of using hydroconin, my skin start peeling without showing. This serum hydrate the skin and give it a younger look, i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was working or if I was just having a clear skin month so I stopped using it for a week before picking it back up again. It turns out this product really does seem to work.  My biggest concerns were breakouts, wrinkles, and sun spots.  I had been using a prescription Retinol product to deal with these issues.  I have since substituted that product with this serum and have been extremely  happy.  I only use it at night under my moisturizer.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Nicely packaged, easy to use. Has a lovely scent and smoothes onto the skin easily. Quickly absorbed and skin feels great.  use this under a moisturizer and i really notice the difference. Even after my skin has been washed and there&#x27;s no serum on the surface, it still feels soft and smooth. I think my skin texture and appearance is very improved since I started using this. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already working after 2.5 weeks. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> shipped SUPER fast, like one day.  Not too watery, and not oily.  The consistency seems good, though I have never used serums before, so I have nothing to compare it with.  My face drank it up (my skin is dry).  I used a few droppers full, but applied to my neck as well.  No bad reactions or anything so far.  I&#x27;ll have to come back and add results after using it for a week.  I was pleased that it was sealed.</li>
            <li> The best best serum out there period.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference in my wrinkles but I&#x27;m still using it hoping!</li>
            <li> You can feel it working</li>
            <li> So glad I found this already on my second bottle. This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive break-out prone skin.  I hesitated on whether to even try this serum since it contains oil.  I have used it on and off over a couple of weeks and have not had problems.  Hard to tell this soon if it will be beneficial in the long run, but I&#x27;m happy with it for now.  Updated review:  I am very happy with this product.  I use it in the morning, as well as the evening.  I do not have a problem with staining from the orange color at all.  Makes skin feel smooth and nice and absorbs completely.  No problem with breakouts.</li>
            <li> It worked wonderful for a week but then it stopped working. I guess its because the product gets oxidized due to the dropper style bottle. If only this product was packaged better I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers posted this serum does look like strained carrots and smells like it as well.  Neither of which bothers me.  I find that it is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t have any lingering scent.  I like that the serum is heavier than water and has additional benificial ingredients.  I would recommend this to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;~Amy</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 4 days and have had some people notice a little differance. Can&#x27;t wait for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive so I am very picky about the products I use.&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research before purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the price, results, and performance.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does what it says and the price is great!</li>
            <li> Great product! With all three essential things  in one bottle, it is cheaper than buying each item individually. Follow directions and always apply sunscreen lotion right after, before going outdoors. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 4 weeks and my skin is definitely looking brighter!!  My skin is super sensitive so I have always been very limited in using different products but with this serum there are no break outs at all and it feels great on my skin.  So every morning after washing my face I apply about 5 drops of this serum, then I use my eye cream and spray my sunscreen and then I apply the powder foundation.  This serum has a slight orange tint but it does not show at all after the foundation.&lt;br /&gt;My sun spots are about 2 shades lighter after a months use and everybody at work also commented on how much my skin looks brighter!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this serum especially for gals with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> slight noticible difference - which is better than anything else I have tried.....so I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin silk!!</li>
            <li> good but the retinol combined with the hyluronic acid irritates my skin too much  :  (  . I well not buy it again, not for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this new product. It smells a little bit like carrots, and frankly, is the color of them too, but it works! I used to use just the retinol serum, but since this combo product came out, I thought I would give it a try. I have only been using it for about a week, once a day, at night and my face has brighter, fresher look and feel. It says on the instructions you only need three or four drops for your face and neck, but I found that to cover that amount of skin, I need six or seven. It feels a bit greasy when it comes out of the bottle, but once you massage it onto your skin, it absorbs quickly, (very quickly, in my case, so I have to work quickly). It does not leave your skin looking or feeling greasy. I absolutley love this product and for the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong. I purchased this on my own, I was not offered a discount or free product in order to review it. BTW, I have recommended this to my mom and all 8 of my sisters!</li>
            <li> We have just received the Vitamin C Serum.  The product came excellently protected, and sealed.  The serum glides on smoothly, and is not  too heavy.  We purchased the serum in a promotion for testing and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been using Vitamin C Serum for several years along with Retinol, with excellent results.  This particular brand is nice, premium quality, has 22% C, with 2.5% Retinol, and 20% Hyaluronic Acid, as well as other organic and natural ingredients.  This product is manufactured in a FDA registered facility in the USA.  The serum is very smooth going on and a few drops go a long way, so the bottle will last a good while.</li>
            <li> I have some pimple&#x27;s scar. Since I started to use the product I noted it faded a little</li>
            <li> I am 49 yrs. old and  have been using the product for a few weeks now and I love it. After the first week I noticed my skin looked clearer. I didn&#x27;t think my skin was very blotchy to begin with, but after using the serum,  I have really noticed how much  brighter and more even my skin tone looks! Now, after a few weeks, I have also noticed some of the lines on my face getting less noticeable.  I use the serum under my anti-aging moisturizer. The serum absorbs quick and dries fast so you have to work quickly to apply it. I dab a few dots all over my face and neck and then blend it in. Some people have said it turns your skin orange. The serum is a bright orange color and when I first put it on, my skin is orange for about 2 seconds and then it absorbs and you can&#x27;t see any color, so don&#x27;t worry about that. (I&#x27;m very fair skinned too). Unless you have really oily skin you will probably still need a moisturizer. I wait just a couple of minutes after applying the serum before I use the moisturizer, to make sure the serum does not get diluted. I am constantly trying new products because it seems like most of the stuff I try doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot to impress me. This serum is a keeper! I will continue to purchase this one, and the price is great, especially for the results you get.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen a difference, just saying...</li>
            <li> This is the best face moisture I&#x27;ve ever used. I actually see results from it immediately. My skin becomes so uneven and looks very worn out after working super long hours and lacking so much sleep. Every time I use this I see a difference within minutes. It evens out my skin and gives it such a healthy glow. The scent alone is very refreshing. I will definitely be placing another order. P.S. Their customer service is completely unmatched.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in early June and have used it every night since it came in.  I feel that two months is plenty of time to figure out whether a product is working for you.  For me, this one did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before giving this a try I was using a popular Korean vitamin C serum that was very effective at brightening my skin and fading out dark spots.  It did sting a bit upon application and the delivery time from overseas was long, so I wanted to try something different.  I settled on the Super 6 Serum because not only did it contain the vitamin C I was after, it also contained other beneficial ingredients that I hoped would address other skin care concerns I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked that it didn&#x27;t sting when I applied it.  I liked that even though it is a bright orange color, it didn&#x27;t stain or color my skin.  I liked that it didn&#x27;t break me out. I liked that it absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky.  What I didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle:  a little skin brightening, some help fading dark spots, maybe a bit of softening for the fine lines I&#x27;m starting to get around my eyes or at least some help preventing new ones.  This product didn&#x27;t seem to work very well for me in any of those areas.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this product at all. Have not noticed any improvement in my skin. I tried to save $10 and not buy the C22 brand, but it is much better I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my review. And so glad I did! I got it super fast and LOVE it!! I use it everyday and already see a difference! I am not super old to where I have a whole lot of deep wrinkles but I did have dark circles under eyes and few dark spots that have already lightened to the point I don&#x27;t use concealer and people notice a difference !</li>
