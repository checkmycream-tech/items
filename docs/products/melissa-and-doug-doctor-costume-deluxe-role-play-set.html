    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The coat is well made and fits perfect.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a great product!</li>
            <li>so for us, this is NOT an ideal toy.</li>
            <li>The doctor&#x27;s coat was surprisingly well made.  </li>
            <li>really good teaching tool and way to help curb kids fear of the doctor.</li>
            <li>Great item...even better than advertised.</li>
            <li>so it was very appropriate.  </li>
            <li>We are very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved the costume and immediately all the kids wanted to play with it too:)</li>
            <li>Great fun!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect present for a three/ four year old!&lt;br /&gt;Their moms love it because it is neat &amp; all gets tucked into the pockets.</li>
            <li>I trust Melissa &amp; Doug products to be of high quality and great price.</li>
            <li>Super cute play set!</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it would be alright, plus the reviews I read here were good.</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ll worth the price!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to take the batteries out, so he can have imaginitive and positive play with the concept of good health in mind.</li>
            <li>We love that the stethoscope makes a coughing sound and also the sound of a heart beating.</li>
            <li>Could easily be ordered online</li>
            <li>Easily washed and maintained, the coat has very useful pockets</li>
            <li>The tools are sturdy and perfect for little hands.   </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m certain we will be getting many more.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I purchased another for a friend&#x27;s granddaughter&#x27;s 3 year b&#x27;day.</li>
            <li>Why not just the sound of a rhythmic beating heart for children&#x27;s play!?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But other than that (which isn&#x27;t a huge detraction) this is a great toy that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this lab coat and toys.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely well made and so attractive that it just calls out for children to put it on and play with it.  </li>
            <li>I would have rathered the kind with the foam where they can actually hear something (like the Fisher Price one).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised out of Melissa &amp; Doug, being a more naturally-based company.</li>
            <li>This toy was a gift and it broke right away.</li>
            <li>The ear pieces are very large and don&#x27;t stay over his ears.  </li>
            <li>Such a cute outfit with all the necessary tools to be a good little doctor. :)</li>
            <li>My daughters (age 4 and 1) both love this kit, especially the shot.</li>
            <li>chose these because they weren&#x27;t all different colors, like most of the others seem to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>We all know how much kids like to play dress up!  </li>
            <li>He opened it and started playing with it this morning, and the stethoscope wouldn&#x27;t work at first.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old and 2 year old daughters have been playing with this for years and love it.</li>
            <li>It is fine, looks like new, and is  strong enough for a three year old to play with.</li>
            <li>There are so many better doctor sets out thier for the same price or less.</li>
            <li>The lab coat really seems to enhance the experience of pretend play.  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>When she opened it at her party, the other moms thought it was adorable and wanted to know where I got it.</li>
            <li>This is a sturdy set in nice simple colors - which is a major bonus since the doctor doesn&#x27;t use pink stethoscopes,or red otoscopes, or bright blue tweezers!!!  </li>
            <li>Highly suggest.</li>
            <li>We bought this for our 3.67 year old because she loves to watch a certain TV cartoon girl doctor who tends to her stuffed animals.  </li>
            <li>Overall, worth buying.</li>
            <li>Our 3 year old LOVES this set!</li>
            <li>this was the first birthday present she opened</li>
            <li>any case, this set is really nice and simple with the necessary parts for your little one to really feel like a pro.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We are a naturally-based holistic family that focuses on positive play, and that coughing does not sound like something very positive.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would have made it better is a little doctor&#x27;s bag to keep it all together (I ended up making one) and a blood-pressure cuff.</li>
            <li>I sent this to my 3 year old grandson who loves to play Dr.  </li>
            <li>My daughter sends me pictures frequently of him doctoring the dog and herself.  </li>
            <li>My mom bought this for our 3 year old granddaughter for Christmas, and our granddaughter loves it.  </li>
            <li>Hurry Hurry, we could not get the security threads off the items fast enough.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old son loves to play Dr with this set which Santa brought for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>My mom bought this set for Christmas for my three year old son.</li>
            <li>My three year old received this as a birthday gift</li>
            <li>and it can be really distracting when most Doctor kits are ridiculously colored!</li>
            <li>The stethoscope needed a little drop of super glue to hold it together.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I wish the batteries were a more general type.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product for my 6 yr old&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li>We also added a few ace bandages, some bandaids and an ice pack/hot pack for play fun.</li>
            <li>I know this sounds a bit young but our entire family is in the medical field</li>
            <li>Not the typical sound one imagines hearing from a stethoscope...unless one is seeing a respiratory therapist for some lung disease (which I think is not appropriate for young children.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been over a year, and the only issue I&#x27;ve had so far, is one the stethoscope earpieces coming loose.</li>
            <li>As a society, do we really think so little of our children&#x27;s ability to focus that everything they see must be a color explosion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> , she did take it off long enough to put on jammies but then had to put it back on.  </li>
            <li> My almost 3 yr old daughter can&#x27;t put it down and feels the need to give me a &amp;#34;check up&amp;#34; every day when I get home from work.</li>
            <li> We hoped this costume and medical accessories would allow our little girl to feel like she was &amp;#34;doctoring&amp;#34; her beloved stuffed pets as well and we weren&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I finally just put little glue in there and its fine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also it requires batteries to make an artificial heart beat sound.  </li>
            <li> the straps are too wide.</li>
            <li> Again, they have not let me down.</li>
            <li> and she could care less about the rest of the gifts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is the most disgusting and annoying coughing sound that comes from the red heart button on the the stethoscope.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing like the old-style toys that fuel the imagination of growing, little minds.</li>
            <li> So, my dad opened the battery panel and tinkered with it for a little while until he got it working.</li>
            <li> I will admit the coughing thing with the stethoscope is a little wierd, but all in all it is a well made product.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty</li>
            <li> Well-made, as is typical of Melissa and Doug&#x27;s products, except for the surgical mask, which doesn&#x27;t stay put behind the ears</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need a bulky, hard case to carry around the instruments - so it travels well.</li>
            <li> Little difficult to locate.</li>
            <li> The only item I was a bit disappointed in was the stethoscope.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what was wrong with it...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want my son thinking that being sickly is the norm...</li>
            <li> All the accessories were stiched into the garment with was a bit annoying  until I could find a razor blade.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a sturdy set in nice simple colors - which is a major bonus since the doctor doesn&#x27;t use pink stethoscopes,or red otoscopes, or bright blue tweezers!!!  Kids know the difference, (just like they don&#x27;t \\&quot;buy\\&quot; the bulky pretend primary-colored cell phones) and it can be really distracting when most Doctor kits are ridiculously colored! As a society, do we really think so little of our children&#x27;s ability to focus that everything they see must be a color explosion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, this set is really nice and simple with the necessary parts for your little one to really feel like a pro.  Easily washed and maintained, the coat has very useful pockets so you don&#x27;t need a bulky, hard case to carry around the instruments - so it travels well.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my 3 year old grandson who loves to play Dr.  He loves everything including the &#x27;white coat&#x27; and goggles. My daughter sends me pictures frequently of him doctoring the dog and herself.  Great fun!</li>
            <li> My daughters (age 4 and 1) both love this kit, especially the shot. The only thing that would have made it better is a little doctor&#x27;s bag to keep it all together (I ended up making one) and a blood-pressure cuff. We also added a few ace bandages, some bandaids and an ice pack/hot pack for play fun.</li>
            <li> Great item...even better than advertised. Quality material.  Heavy duty and we&#x27;ll worth the price!!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves the costume and plays with it daily.  The stethoscope needed a little drop of super glue to hold it together.  It is fine, looks like new, and is  strong enough for a three year old to play with.</li>
            <li> I got this set for my daughter when she was two, hoping to ease her fear of going to the doctor. She loves playing with them, and knows how each tool works. She still doesn&#x27;t like getting shots, and who does, but now she knows what to expect, and I think that helps.&lt;br /&gt;I chose these because they weren&#x27;t all different colors, like most of the others seem to be.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been over a year, and the only issue I&#x27;ve had so far, is one the stethoscope earpieces coming loose. I finally just put little glue in there and its fine.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product for my 6 yr old&#x27;s birthday. When she opened it at her party, the other moms thought it was adorable and wanted to know where I got it. My daughter loved the costume and immediately all the kids wanted to play with it too:) The coat is well made and fits perfect. The tools are sturdy and perfect for little hands.   I trust Melissa &amp; Doug products to be of high quality and great price. Again, they have not let me down.</li>
            <li> Well-made, as is typical of Melissa and Doug&#x27;s products, except for the surgical mask, which doesn&#x27;t stay put behind the ears b/c the straps are too wide. We love that the stethoscope makes a coughing sound and also the sound of a heart beating. Overall, worth buying.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this for our 3 year old granddaughter for Christmas, and our granddaughter loves it.  It is extremely well made and so attractive that it just calls out for children to put it on and play with it.  I liked it so much that I purchased another for a friend&#x27;s granddaughter&#x27;s 3 year b&#x27;day.</li>
            <li> Our 3 year old LOVES this set! Has played with it nonstop since receiving it as a gift for Christmas. My only complaint is that I wish the batteries were a more general type. Little difficult to locate. Could easily be ordered online I guess. Otherwise, a great product!</li>
            <li> Recommend Melissa &amp; Doug dress-up clothing over all others that I&#x27;ve seen.  This is well-made and durable!  Over time, I am likely to purchase all of the costumes this company makes.</li>
            <li> this was purchased for my grandaughter who was turning 2.  I know this sounds a bit young but our entire family is in the medical field so it was very appropriate.  When she opened it, all she could say was Hurry Hurry Hurry, we could not get the security threads off the items fast enough.  this was the first birthday present she opened and she could care less about the rest of the gifts.  She went to bed with the jacket on, she did take it off long enough to put on jammies but then had to put it back on.  Everyone in the family got a physical along with the dog and I&#x27;m certain we will be getting many more.  I cannot say enough good things about this lab coat and toys.  It was the hit of the party.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my three-year-old granddaughter who loves it!  She immediately went around diagnosing and curing all the ailments of her relatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing like the old-style toys that fuel the imagination of growing, little minds.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son loves to play Dr with this set which Santa brought for Christmas.  The lab coat really seems to enhance the experience of pretend play.  We all know how much kids like to play dress up!  The only item I was a bit disappointed in was the stethoscope.  The ear pieces are very large and don&#x27;t stay over his ears.  Also it requires batteries to make an artificial heart beat sound.  I would have rathered the kind with the foam where they can actually hear something (like the Fisher Price one).  But other than that (which isn&#x27;t a huge detraction) this is a great toy that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> There are so many better doctor sets out thier for the same price or less. This toy was a gift and it broke right away.</li>
            <li> I had no issues with the product,  it did however take over 30 days to finally recieve it. All the accessories were stiched into the garment with was a bit annoying  until I could find a razor blade.</li>
            <li> overpriced for what it is</li>
            <li> My 5 year old and 2 year old daughters have been playing with this for years and love it. Super cute play set! Highly suggest.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this set for Christmas for my three year old son. At first, I thought it would be alright, plus the reviews I read here were good. He opened it and started playing with it this morning, and the stethoscope wouldn&#x27;t work at first. So, my dad opened the battery panel and tinkered with it for a little while until he got it working. I don&#x27;t know what was wrong with it...probably defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is the most disgusting and annoying coughing sound that comes from the red heart button on the the stethoscope. It sounds like somebody is hacking to death, with a heatbeat in the background. Not the typical sound one imagines hearing from a stethoscope...unless one is seeing a respiratory therapist for some lung disease (which I think is not appropriate for young children.) Why not just the sound of a rhythmic beating heart for children&#x27;s play!?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are a naturally-based holistic family that focuses on positive play, and that coughing does not sound like something very positive. I don&#x27;t want my son thinking that being sickly is the norm...so for us, this is NOT an ideal toy. I&#x27;m surprised out of Melissa &amp; Doug, being a more naturally-based company. I&#x27;m going to take the batteries out, so he can have imaginitive and positive play with the concept of good health in mind.</li>
            <li> My three year old received this as a birthday gift and she absolutely loves it.  Now she can pretend to be Doc McStuffins or go around the house giving us shots and checking our ears.  Such a cute outfit with all the necessary tools to be a good little doctor. :)</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 3.67 year old because she loves to watch a certain TV cartoon girl doctor who tends to her stuffed animals.  We hoped this costume and medical accessories would allow our little girl to feel like she was &amp;#34;doctoring&amp;#34; her beloved stuffed pets as well and we weren&#x27;t disappointed.  The doctor&#x27;s coat was surprisingly well made.  We are very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect present for a three/ four year old!&lt;br /&gt;Their moms love it because it is neat &amp; all gets tucked into the pockets.</li>
            <li> I will admit the coughing thing with the stethoscope is a little wierd, but all in all it is a well made product. My almost 3 yr old daughter can&#x27;t put it down and feels the need to give me a &amp;#34;check up&amp;#34; every day when I get home from work. really good teaching tool and way to help curb kids fear of the doctor.</li>
