            <li>love</li>
            <li>I was able to return</li>
            <li>I also use another cream on top.</li>
            <li>The burnt sugar smell was a bit overwhelming for me.  </li>
            <li>it really maintain moisture and give me a soft hold and a awesome shine...</li>
            <li>The scent can be strong for some people though.</li>
            <li>so you can imagine how strong this is.</li>
            <li>Good for your natural hair!</li>
            <li>I got this a few months ago with the Hair Dew, thinking I&#x27;d gotten the perfect moisturizer and seal combo.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying Burnt sugar pomade, and I love it as a hair Ciller.</li>
            <li>It is great and versatile and it lasts a LONG TIME!</li>
            <li>The smell is great but be careful to not use allot it may bother others.</li>
            <li>Arrived just as promised, quickly and neatly packaged&lt;br /&gt;All natural/vegetarian - can&#x27;t beat that&lt;</li>
            <li>so this is super helpful.</li>
            <li>Smells great, too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li>I was distinctly underwhelmed by the combination</li>
            <li>but it is excellent on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>Smell was a concern at first, then you get use to it and like it.</li>
            <li>First of all i received this shipment on time.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully for my twist-outs and on my little ones little braids.</li>
            <li>It also holds and hangs in there very well.</li>
            <li>Felt very waxy.  </li>
            <li>and this really works well with my gel...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moisturizes effectively- used it on towel dried hair to seal in moisture with twists.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m using this Burnt Sugar Pomade with water and Giovanni Direct Leave In and the effect is really really</li>
            <li>The ends of my hair are in better condition and less prone to drying, this also works really well for smoothing my edges with a brush and smoothing my hair for buns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However,  I find this particular product and scent to be superior due to its scent, softness provided on dry ends,  aid in edge growth, and length retention.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product as a sealant, a twisting product (for twistouts and braid outs), a shine product, a smoothing product.</li>
            <li>I chose to use this Burnt Sugar pomade out of the blue and imagine my amazement when 3 days later my 4c natural hair was still soft, smooth and well sealed.</li>
            <li>I am a 3c/4a natural.</li>
            <li>It gets soft in my hand.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>I am all natural with 4b type and it loves my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it when doing the LOC method, and just general sealing and it keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I try to use only products that have natural ingredients so this is a must.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive but</li>

            <li> A lil bit like a dime size goes a long way  </li>
            <li> Also, my hair stays moisturized long.</li>
            <li> A little less than a dime sized amount is used for my whole head.</li>
            <li> Now that I know how to take care of my hair, I learned that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> the other oyin pomade berry scent...and Jane Carter&#x27;s nourish and shine each for over two years.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It retained the moisture and made my hair glisten without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot as it may weigh your hair down</li>
            <li> I found the smell of both together a little overpowering but decided to power on.</li>
            <li> I use this as a butter and put a little on each piece of hair I twist.</li>
            <li> This product goes along way by just using a little.</li>
            <li> I can use this product to help tame all my natural styles on my very thick hair!</li>
            <li> and I also use it to softly slick down my edges without a brush.</li>
            <li> and I relegated this to the back of my closet as a failed experiment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> by the way my hair is medium thick 4a/b/3c hair</li>
            <li> Please note I am a serious product junkie.</li>
            <li> A month ago, I randomly sprayed my hair with a little water and decided I didn&#x27;t want to use a hair moisturizer but just to seal the water in.</li>
            <li> Jesus permits ill</li>
            <li> The smell was horrible...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural 4b/b, and I tried this a few years ago and didn&#x27;t like it. I decided to try it again because I love the scent, and now I love it. Now that I know how to take care of my hair, I learned that a little goes a long way. I use it when doing the LOC method, and just general sealing and it keeps my hair soft and moisturized. The scent can be strong for some people though.</li>
            <li> Gave my hair great shine without oil build up on my scalp. No flaking or anything.  This will be my daily moisturizer from now on.</li>
            <li> My hair love this product.</li>
            <li> I am a 3c/4a natural. I purchased this product to seal over the oyin honey dew. I love it for that purpose and I also use it to softly slick down my edges without a brush. It does a superb job. A little less than a dime sized amount is used for my whole head. The smell reminds me of carnivals...that rich roasted cashew smell and st8 happiness. It shrouds me in that scent and intoxicates me. I&#x27;ve used this product...the other oyin pomade berry scent...and Jane Carter&#x27;s nourish and shine each for over two years. However,  I find this particular product and scent to be superior due to its scent, softness provided on dry ends,  aid in edge growth, and length retention. Try it ladies...why not? Please note I am a serious product junkie. Jesus permits ill try it all in search of the holy grail.</li>
            <li> Smell was a concern at first, then you get use to it and like it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! I love the smell. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to use pomade, but overall I do like this product.</li>
            <li> Scent reminds me of maple syrup. Gives my hair great shine. Kind of expensive but a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> My daughter smells like creme brulee when we put this lovely pomade in her hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived just as promised, quickly and neatly packaged&lt;br /&gt;All natural/vegetarian - can&#x27;t beat that&lt;br /&gt;Smells heavenly - can&#x27;t beat that especially when you&#x27;re getting asked constantly by people working in close proximity to you what you washed your hair with&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes effectively- used it on towel dried hair to seal in moisture with twists. It retained the moisture and made my hair glisten without weighing it down. This will be a staple for me, 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Smells great, too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> It gets soft in my hand. It smells like cookies. It also holds and hangs in there very well. It is great for those edges and for twists.</li>
            <li> First of all i received this shipment on time. A lil bit like a dime size goes a long way  depends on the density of ur hair per section inlove with this product, the scent is awesome, the burnt vanilla caramel scent smells like warm baked cookies or cake... I used it to seal my ends after twist out or just moisturising my hair with hair dew underneath it...it really maintain moisture and give me a soft hold and a awesome shine...I bought two 8oz in the burnt sugar scent and a 4 oz in the juices and berries scent which i havent received as yet..love it will continue purchasing it..by the way my hair is medium thick 4a/b/3c hair and i recommend this item, if you are not sure try their sample kit first i did and i am hooked!</li>
            <li> This smells soooooo good. I used it as the oil in the LOC method. I also sealed my ends with it. It melts in your hands when you rub your fingers together. I bought it to go with the whipped pudding (the cream in the LOC) they go hand in hand! Perfect combination</li>
            <li> I got this a few months ago with the Hair Dew, thinking I&#x27;d gotten the perfect moisturizer and seal combo. I found the smell of both together a little overpowering but decided to power on. I was distinctly underwhelmed by the combination and I relegated this to the back of my closet as a failed experiment. A month ago, I randomly sprayed my hair with a little water and decided I didn&#x27;t want to use a hair moisturizer but just to seal the water in. I chose to use this Burnt Sugar pomade out of the blue and imagine my amazement when 3 days later my 4c natural hair was still soft, smooth and well sealed. I&#x27;ve never been able to just use water and a sealant to moisturize my hair effectively before. The ends of my hair are in better condition and less prone to drying, this also works really well for smoothing my edges with a brush and smoothing my hair for buns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not writing a review for the Hair Dew yet because I&#x27;ve not yet figured out how to work with it. Even if it did moisturize my hair to my satisfaction, in combination with this Burnt Sugar pomade, the caramel smell is wayyyy too overpowering AND I like the smell of caramel so you can imagine how strong this is. Right now I&#x27;m using this Burnt Sugar Pomade with water and Giovanni Direct Leave In and the effect is really really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product as a sealant, a twisting product (for twistouts and braid outs), a shine product, a smoothing product. It is great and versatile and it lasts a LONG TIME!</li>
            <li> Smells good - love this product.  Good for your natural hair!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling pomade and makes my hair smell great!</li>
            <li> I can use this product to help tame all my natural styles on my very thick hair! It works wonderfully for my twist-outs and on my little ones little braids. I try to use only products that have natural ingredients so this is a must. You don&#x27;t need a lot as it may weigh your hair down but it is excellent on wet or dry hair. Also the smell is great, my boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> The smell was horrible... I wanted to like it, but the smell was too overpowering . I was able to return</li>
            <li> This is GREAT for the ends and edges of your hair and smells like coffee! 😋</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It&#x27;s apart of my holy grail. Jane carter nourish and shine lost its spot do to this product. I use this as a butter and put a little on each piece of hair I twist. I also use another cream on top. This product keeps my hair looking moisturizer and hydrated. Also, my hair stays moisturized long. I have natural hair so this is super helpful. Oh and the smell is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy for my hair.  Felt very waxy.  Didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying Burnt sugar pomade, and I love it as a hair Ciller. This product goes along way by just using a little. I am all natural with 4b type and it loves my hair. The smell is great but be careful to not use allot it may bother others. I would and will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product... i use it as a moisturizer after my cleansing... i am 1 year in locing... and this really works well with my gel... they mix well leaving a great feel to my locs after drying.</li>
            <li> Great! Use or on my son&#x27;s and my hair</li>
            <li> I was not head over hlls with this product</li>
            <li> The burnt sugar smell was a bit overwhelming for me.  I used it only once.</li>
