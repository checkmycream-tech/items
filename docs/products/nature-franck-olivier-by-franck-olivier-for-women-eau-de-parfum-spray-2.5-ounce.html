            <li> I love the smell and I received the package on time.</li>
            <li> Fast service. Good product.  Iv been using this cologne for 5yrs.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for over ten years now, from the times when I was still living in Europe. Thanks God I found it here, in the US, as it has always been my signature perfume.  I love the subtle floral and fresh scent, which goes very well with casual clothing as well as special occasion. I highly recommend it and the price on Amazon is awesome!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Wears off pretty fast. The perfume reminds me of Chanel Tendre - just lighter and more airy...&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite summer fragrance.  Lightly floral sweet but not over the top.  This is probably the best price to be found.</li>
            <li> she loves this perfume. its her favorite. the estimate on receiving it was at the earliest, the 25.. got it on the 20th, just in time for her birthday on the 21st! love Amazon.com!!</li>
            <li> cheap but smells perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought one bottle without knowledge of the aroma... After that purchase, I bought two more. It is my husband&#x27;s favorite fragrance that I wear. Beautiful fragrance, clean, floral, delicate.</li>
            <li> Literally the best perfume I have ever smelled. Will always be my first choice fragrance.</li>
            <li> One of my most favorite perfumes!! Love it</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Very pleased</li>
            <li> My daughter in law loves this. I gave her mine a long time ago because it just didnt smell as nice on me but on her its great. Perhaps its for younger women since she is 21</li>
            <li> Fragrance smells nice but the scent definitely doesnt last on clothes or body. Very disappointed by that.</li>
            <li> Love this floral smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> This Eau de Parfum spray gives me the worst headache. I&#x27;ve been sampling a lot of different fragrances lately but none have made me feel ill. Unfortunately it can&#x27;t be returned. Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I have been eying this perfume for quite some time. the bottle seemed really attractive. Since there was no review and I didn&#x27;t where to get a sample i was somewhat hesitant. Then I found other online reviews and I liked what I read. So I ordered and and it arrived before scheduled time. The fragrance is lovely, soft and alluring. The only problem is it is not exactly the kind I wear. I probably will pass it off to my cousin who loves this type of ethereal scent. It does remind one of nature, I must say.</li>
            <li> Love it. Very similar to Light Blue but lasts so much longer.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice but it only lasts at most 5 minutes. I have used Bamboo by Franck Olivier and never had that issue, so I decided to try Nature, wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again because it has absolutely no scent a couple minutes after you put it on. It&#x27;s a shame because it a beautiful bottle and a nice scent if it would last. Don&#x27;t wate your money</li>
            <li> it was really fast and on time!! I hope my sister will like it. it is a gift so i did not open the perfum, but it looks reall nice.</li>
