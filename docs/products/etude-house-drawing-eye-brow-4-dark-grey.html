            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s brownish and more brown than gray which makes it brownish bray..not as gray as I thought but thankfully not reddish either.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow pencil.</li>

            <li>The shape and coverage is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that etude house makes gray.</li>
            <li>love the angle of the pencil.</li>
            <li>Looks natural and works great.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I like it that it comes with 2 ends, one pencil one brush, and apply easily.</li>
            <li>it can be wiped off easily so i have to remember not to touch my brows.</li>
            <li>easy to draw.</li>
            <li>Fills in sparse areas pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>easy to apply and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The seller is really sweet to give me two free Etude House moisture samples to use.</li>
            <li>The brush is a bit too soft to blend the pencil out but otherwise, it&#x27;s a really nice eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>The quality is good and I would definitely</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely better to use following outline with a lighter shade of color (I use brown) for better application.</li>
            <li>But it was all worth it.</li>
            <li>and since I have very dark colored hair, it made my eyebrows very nice.</li>
            <li>You have to like a softer pencil, as this is nearly like a soft crayon in application, but the tapered wedge of the liner works perfectly, lasts all day, is actually grey!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I love that it is has a slightly angle to it making it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The shipping is pretty fast which beyond my expectation.</li>
            <li>Perfect color to match dark/ black hair without being too stark.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrow pen was wrapped very well without any damage.</li>
            <li>I really like this pencil.</li>
            <li>The color doesn&#x27;t stay for a whole day though.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t too dark (you&#x27;re supposed to lightly brush it against your eyebrows and it has an immediate effect!)</li>
            <li>I have black hair and the dark grey was perfect.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, its a little dark when you first apply it but the brush softens it right away.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product, but it was super easy to apply!</li>
            <li>The drawing looks natural, but I wait it arrive for bout a mouth</li>
            <li>Got it in 2 weeks, it was fast shipping even though it was international shipping which was pricey.</li>
            <li>I go over really sparse parts of my eyebrows several times to fill it in.</li>
            <li>The pen is working very well so far, and the color, dark grey, which fits my eyebrow color and defined my eyebrow shape very well.</li>
            <li>I use the grey for most of my brow and the dark grey for the outside edge.</li>
            <li>No hair grows there, but this product fills it in nicely without looking fake.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush on the other end to keep things from being too</li>
