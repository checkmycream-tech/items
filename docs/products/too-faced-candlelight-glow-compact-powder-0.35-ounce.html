            <li>The delivery was fast (it came in 3 days before the estimated date) and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>A must have feels so smooth on the skin</li>

            <li>It is perfect for a summer look to bring out your cheekbones or a little on your cupids bow, under eyebrow or tear duct!</li>
            <li>My new favorite highlighter!</li>
            <li>I originally had to have this just because of the packaging</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got this is the mail</li>
            <li>It has a sheen, gold but not crazy in your face look at me!</li>
            <li>Love the whole service .care and product .thanks</li>
            <li>The powder shows up very light when applied and creates a beautiful subtle highlight.  </li>
            <li>There are multiple uses for this highlighter, it&#x27;s a great brow light, amazing on the cupid&#x27;s bow, and fantastic to dab in the middle of any lipstick for an extra kick.</li>
            <li>and I adore this one - worth every penny</li>
            <li>Worth the price, as I have used it a lot</li>
            <li>I was really just excited for this product, and as soon as I received the package I grabbed the too faced box, &amp; hear a bunch of rattling I immediately  </li>
            <li>This is a great highlighter and also helps add almost a natural pink to your skin.....</li>
            <li>This is the first highlighter I have tried that truly does the job.</li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a powder highlighter and this was the first powder one I had bought.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore Too Faced products!</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>I also love the blush, nice and subtle with a glow!</li>
            <li>Ok well first of all i, bought this product along with a couple of other ones.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping by the seller.</li>
            <li>You can put it only sparingly for a more natural look or build it up to an intense highlighter glow.</li>
            <li>With the shades being so light, you have the option to keep it simple or add on until you get the desired effect.</li>
            <li>I have used it a lot and really like it.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much...</li>
            <li>I was looking for and was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It is not too much sparkle or glitter at all.</li>
            <li>It comes in a compact, so it&#x27;s really convenient to carry around.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used some highlighters/illuminators that are so shiny and heavy looking, rather than having a nice glow to your skin, it looks like your face is oily or sweaty.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, so was looking for something that woukd complememt my complexion, while also giving me a subtle glow...</li>
            <li>, one is a very light gold color and the other a light pink.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product based on reviews and the pricing.</li>
            <li>This one definitely does not fail you!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have a few highlighters, but haven&#x27;t found one that I really love until I found this one.</li>
            <li>This did not give me much of a glow and even the lighter highlighting powder barely showed up.</li>
            <li>The color is soft and feminine.</li>
            <li>Its a soft sheen that blends well with the skin.</li>
            <li>Soft, natural glow.</li>
            <li>I am a MUA and have gone through so many highlighters like Inglot&#x27;s highlighter(quite glittery for my liking), Stila&#x27;s liquid all over luminizer (hard to blend liquid), Coastal Scent&#x27;s contour/blush palette and so on!</li>
            <li>I have barely made a dent in it.</li>

            <li> My new favorite highlighter! You can put it only sparingly for a more natural look or build it up to an intense highlighter glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have a few highlighters, but haven&#x27;t found one that I really love until I found this one. I like that it has 2 sides, one is a very light gold color and the other a light pink. The powder shows up very light when applied and creates a beautiful subtle highlight.  With the shades being so light, you have the option to keep it simple or add on until you get the desired effect. That&#x27;s a big plus for me. I&#x27;ve used some highlighters/illuminators that are so shiny and heavy looking, rather than having a nice glow to your skin, it looks like your face is oily or sweaty. The delivery was fast (it came in 3 days before the estimated date) and was packaged nicely. I&#x27;m very happy I decided to purchase this. Too Faced, in my opinion has great products, and I will continue to purchase from the company.</li>

I was so excited when I got this is the mail and I LOVVVEEEE this product! I am a fan of Too Faced but now because of this product I am just all about them! It has a sheen, gold but not crazy in your face look at me! And its powder, as opposed to Stila&#x27;s liquid, you can&#x27;t see the mark, it blends with your powder! It is perfect for a summer look to bring out your cheekbones or a little on your cupids bow, under eyebrow or tear duct! I also love the blush, nice and subtle with a glow! I am so glad I found this product! You can use it in so many ways and I can&#x27;t stress it enough it doesn&#x27;t leave that mark/trace like liquids do! When I use it on clients and tell them about it, they do say it is pricey but it is a great size compact and the quality is amazing and has a mirror inside!! You will not be let down!! Remember, you get what you pay for!!</li>
            <li> The effect of this product is everything the name suggests.  Very light, very pretty, makes you feel good!</li>
            <li> Beautiful powder thanks</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Give an amazing flow without being shinny and even covers some imperfections. I wear this everyday and can&#x27;t imagine not having it. Lasts all day. Will be purchasing another once I finish it.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use this very lightly as an eyeshadow, but I mostly use it on my cheeks. It doesn&#x27;t make you overly pinkish if you don&#x27;t overdo it with the application. However, if you&#x27;re too heavy handed, you could look like you have a greasy shine in the middle of the day. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Works well and you can adjust the impact of the the product to your preference.</li>
            <li> Just the perfect under glow...Too Faced Candlelight doesn&#x27;t shout illuminator...Soft, natural glow.</li>
            <li> A must have feels so smooth on the skin</li>
            <li> love, lovel love it - I am a face powder junkie and I adore this one - worth every penny</li>
            <li> Love the whole service .care and product .thanks</li>
            <li> Ok well first of all i, bought this product along with a couple of other ones. I was really just excited for this product, and as soon as I received the package I grabbed the too faced box, &amp; hear a bunch of rattling I immediately  think oh great the highlighting powder broke,but it was the mirror. It wss all shattered and there was powder everywhere... I also got a elf eye shadow palette that included a mirror, all in the same package, and this was the only thing shattered.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a powder highlighter and this was the first powder one I had bought.  I have used it a lot and really like it.  It definitely gives a candlelight glow.  The off-white can be very bright, so a nice mix of both usually comes out great.  Worth the price, as I have used it a lot and you don&#x27;t need much... I have barely made a dent in it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product based on reviews and the pricing. I was disappointed. This did not give me much of a glow and even the lighter highlighting powder barely showed up. I returned the product and got  theBalm Mary-Lou Manizer instead which gave me that highlighter glow I was looking for and was much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great product for my fair skin.  I loved Candlelight, so figured I&#x27;d like this too.  It is not too much sparkle or glitter at all.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love this.. Just doesn&#x27;t really show up on my fair skin. If you&#x27;ve ever used their bronzer with the leopard print-sorry can&#x27;t remember the name-it gives you a total glow. Was hoping for that here but no such luck. I still love Too Faced products though! And the quality is great-just not my color I guess.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great packaging, awesome product. I use it everyday!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I brought this item for highlighting purposes, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It&#x27;s a little pricey though. There are multiple uses for this highlighter, it&#x27;s a great brow light, amazing on the cupid&#x27;s bow, and fantastic to dab in the middle of any lipstick for an extra kick.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best highlighter ever!!!!!! Looks so nice but not over done. Does not cake on your face. I could review this product forever. However I suggest you buy it instead!</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, so was looking for something that woukd complememt my complexion, while also giving me a subtle glow...this palette is perfect for me! The packaging is beautiful &amp; the pigment is great &amp; long lasting...I absolutely adore Too Faced products!</li>
            <li> Does the job without making me look like a geisha! Haha! It comes in a compact, so it&#x27;s really convenient to carry around. I also love that there is a lot of the product.</li>
