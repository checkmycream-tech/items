            <li>The product its ok,</li>
            <li>Although marketed for men, i like using this product to give my hair more definition and uplift .</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>Much better than wax or gel and holds all day.</li>
            <li>Even holds up to sweat better than &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; branded products.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the kind of product I need for my style of hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a variety of hair products and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using similar products for more than 15 years and this is the best product I ever tried.</li>
            <li>It is strong, but easy to model.</li>
            <li>It is durable, but easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Strong hold.  </li>
            <li>Despite the cliché, many of the best looking French people really do buy L&#x27;oreal products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works best after a shower with slightly damp</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;oreal 5 Clay Strong Hold Matt Clay works perfectly with my short, straight hair.</li>
            <li>From light hold to spikey.</li>
            <li>Far better than most clay hair care products that Ive tried.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it is the scent.</li>
            <li>It does not make your hair grease has a strong hold which is great especially for short hair.</li>
            <li>My husband isn&#x27;t a product guy and likes natural and manly and this is his favorite.</li>
            <li>It feels clean and light, blending into my hair seamlessly with no sticky residue or clumping while keeping your hair in place.</li>
            <li>nice dry look.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this L&#x27;Oreal Professional Homme Force 5 Clay Strong Hold would be nice and thick and like clay.</li>
            <li>your hair looks natural and it holds it in place!!!</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair and this clay is strong enough to hold medium to short lengths of hair.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s clay is fantastic for a dry look.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Humidity is high where I live</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not extremely waxy either, and does some interesting transformations if you just wet your hair and don&#x27;t wash or dry it at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product costs a little bit more than other similar clay products, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m trying to make my hair particularly spiky, it won&#x27;t hold all day, but I only have to run my hand back through my hair every once in a while to give it a boost.  </li>
            <li>My hair is short and I like a nice dry, thick clay to work through it when it&#x27;s dry to style it.</li>
            <li>Just a little dab on the end of my finger is enough to style my whole head.  </li>

            <li> you&#x27;re like me and need a versatile product for styling and flat ironing little portions of your hair, and one that will give you a decent wet hair look for after the gym on your way home, this clay -- &amp;#34;argile&amp;#34; in French -- might be for you.</li>
            <li> and you have to use quite a bit so it won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for that messy hairstyle or some extra volume then i definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite product ever was Sebastian Xtah Crude Clay which is no longer made.</li>
            <li> Holds hair in place without giving it that &#x27;wet&#x27; look!</li>
            <li> I use a fairly small amount (a fingertip), and work it into the roots of my (dry) hair to lift it as I want to.  </li>
            <li> takes a little getting used to: put some water on your hands before smearing them with clay, then run your fingers through your hair.  </li>
            <li> it maintains its hold without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> and then it sort of melts and accomplishes very little in my hair.</li>
            <li> It is thick until you put it on your fingers</li>
            <li> but I think its to expensive for the quantity</li>

            <li> Far better than most clay hair care products that Ive tried. Matte finish with no white flaky residue.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for fine, progressive styles. Holds without that \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; feel. Long lasting, not detrimental to health of the hair.</li>
            <li> The product its ok, but I think its to expensive for the quantity and it&#x27;s not that matt!</li>

If I&#x27;m trying to make my hair particularly spiky, it won&#x27;t hold all day, but I only have to run my hand back through my hair every once in a while to give it a boost.  The 1.7 ounce container lasted around four or five months for my short hair.</li>
            <li> Although marketed for men, i like using this product to give my hair more definition and uplift .</li>
            <li> My go-to when it comes to hair products. Does the perfect job of adding texture and hold to your hair without making it look oily.</li>

            <li> Smells great. Nice matte hold. My husband isn&#x27;t a product guy and likes natural and manly and this is his favorite. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere but here.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s 5 Clay Strong Hold Matt Clay! This product costs a little bit more than other similar clay products, but it is well worth it. If you are looking for that messy hairstyle or some extra volume then i definitely recommend this product. I have very straight hair and this clay is strong enough to hold medium to short lengths of hair. It also adds a brownish color to your hair.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the kind of product I need for my style of hair! Holds hair in place without giving it that &#x27;wet&#x27; look!</li>
            <li> very good hold. nice dry look. would order again.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this L&#x27;Oreal Professional Homme Force 5 Clay Strong Hold would be nice and thick and like clay. It is thick until you put it on your fingers and then it sort of melts and accomplishes very little in my hair. My hair is short and I like a nice dry, thick clay to work through it when it&#x27;s dry to style it. My favorite product ever was Sebastian Xtah Crude Clay which is no longer made. This is nothing like that. Also, I paid over $16 for a 1.7 oz. jar and you have to use quite a bit so it won&#x27;t last very long. The only good thing about it is the scent.</li>
            <li> There will always be room for improvement with beauty products. Especially as we all grow older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered this stuff while living in France. Despite the cliché, many of the best looking French people really do buy L&#x27;oreal products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great matt hold, and is not a gel. But it&#x27;s not extremely waxy either, and does some interesting transformations if you just wet your hair and don&#x27;t wash or dry it at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and need a versatile product for styling and flat ironing little portions of your hair, and one that will give you a decent wet hair look for after the gym on your way home, this clay -- &amp;#34;argile&amp;#34; in French -- might be for you.</li>
            <li> Really good product!!! your hair looks natural and it holds it in place!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff with strong hold. I&#x27;ve used a variety of hair products and this is my favorite.Humidity is high where I live and I like that it maintains its hold without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Strong hold.  takes a little getting used to: put some water on your hands before smearing them with clay, then run your fingers through your hair.  From light hold to spikey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big hair guy...however have always had to use moose or something to fix my hair.  A buddy told me about this clay and it works wonderfully.  You only have to use a small amount and it makes fixing your hair so much easier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using similar products for more than 15 years and this is the best product I ever tried. It is strong, but easy to model. It is durable, but easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I will only use this product on my hair. Its nothing to do w/ brand loyalty. this stuff is awesome</li>
