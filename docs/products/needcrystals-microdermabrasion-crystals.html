            <li>I can really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>i do the coconut oil maybe like 4x a week because realistically it&#x27;s too much to do every day.  </li>
            <li>your skin will feel so smooth after regular use.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this site to anyone looking to get a reasonable price on microdermabrasion crystals</li>

            <li>and I feel brand new skin again.</li>
            <li>also gave this as a gift to my parents; Good for old people to especially get rid of dead cells on their back</li>
            <li>the blemishes are gone, and my skin is clearly cleaner.</li>
            <li>Just as effective as expensive microdermabrasion.  </li>
            <li>I also used it for small red bumps on my arm and bottom and my arms and bottom are smooth as possible.</li>
            <li>Those little bumps from in-grown hair are gone and my arms, legs and backside are much smoother and softer.</li>

            <li> well exfoliating my skin without being harsh.</li>
            <li> I add a scant amount to my usually face wash</li>
            <li> I use a microfiber cloth with small amount of face cleanser</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I also mix with thin body lotions and body wash for all-over exfoliation.</li>

            <li> came in good time&lt;br /&gt;works well&lt;br /&gt;crystals were not a consistent size, some were a little larger &amp; scratchier than others. However it was low dust i dont want to be working with those fine particulates so that was a plus</li>
            <li> Very pleased I took a chance and purchased this product!  The fine crystals polish and buff facial and body skin to perfection.  I mix the crystals with facial cleanser and use circular motions on face and neck.  Just as effective as expensive microdermabrasion.  In the shower, I make a paste with water and add body oil to exfoliate from head to toe.  This product has made a truly noticeable difference in the look and feel of my skin.  Much more effective than the usual scrubs I have purchased in the past, and extremely economical too!</li>
            <li> This is great for exfoliation. I like to mix with kaolin or sulfur masks, massage in, then let the mask do its work. I also mix with thin body lotions and body wash for all-over exfoliation. Versatile, and you get a generous amount for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product. I mix it in the palm of my hand with facial soap, and its great. Washes off nicely and leaves my skin smooth as ever!</li>
            <li> Will continue to order this product it is amazing on the skin. Leaves skin smooth and vibrant I love this product.</li>
            <li> Great product for use on your whole body to rid yourself of dead skin cells.  I use it in the shower with my regular body cleanser and it has made a vast improvement in my arms, legs and  backside. Those little bumps from in-grown hair are gone and my arms, legs and backside are much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Super glad I purchased!</li>
            <li> Love this, your skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I love how it instantly smoothes my skin! I can tell it washes all the dead skin away. I mix it with baby soap and I feel brand new skin again. And the price for how much is there is worth it. I will definitely be buying more when and if I ever run out!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I mix with my facial cleanser and body wash. It does an incredible job at exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and will last for a very long time.  I used them once a week.  Work well exfoliating my skin without being harsh.</li>
            <li> added to soap makes a good skin cleanser</li>
            <li> Excellent product and value.  I add a scant amount to my usually face wash and it works as well as a facial scrub.  I use this technique a couple times a week and the long term effects are better than a salon dermabrasion treatment.</li>
            <li> i personally do not require these crystals to be any MORE abrasive.  I&#x27;ve been smearing coconut oil on my face, then dipping two oiled fingers into this massive jar.  my fingers get easily coated with the crystals and then i&#x27;m able to dab symmetrically in key places to distribute, after which circular movement esthetician inspired facial.  for me, this is working!  i&#x27;ve had relentless hormonal perioral problem skin that would leave colored blemishes that didn&#x27;t go away for a seemingly long time!  I can really tell the difference.  i do the coconut oil maybe like 4x a week because realistically it&#x27;s too much to do every day.  use the microdermabrasion crystals once a week.  My skin is almost porcelain like, which is like....not who i am!  usually i have trouble deciphering if a product is ACTUALLY doing something, but in this case, I have seen obvious improvement.  the blemishes are gone, and my skin is clearly cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  your skin will feel so smooth after regular use. Always use a good moisturizer after you use this. Spa would charge you 80 dollars for a microdermabrasion facial treatment.  This will last you over a year. I buy and share with friends. I use a microfiber cloth with small amount of face cleanser and my face is so smooth afterwards.. Also use on neck... love it, love it. love it.</li>
            <li> You can mix this with any ingredients you like as a home made scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Cheapest way, just body shampoo/soap with this. You&#x27;d be surprised to know how much dead skin cells you always had no matter how hard you always scrubbed!&lt;br /&gt;I also gave this as a gift to my parents; Good for old people to especially get rid of dead cells on their back effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;I use this for body and same brand smaller grit version for face.</li>
            <li> So I bought this to use in body scrub. For my taste this is not course enough. I&#x27;m going to try it on my face but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll like it. I&#x27;m going to have to figure out how to use all five pounds.</li>
            <li> I love finding a good deal - this product is exactly what i needed and much more economical than buying smaller quantities.  Enough to share and still should last forever!</li>
            <li> This item shipped very fast to me. I made a scrub with shea butter and the microdermabrasion crystals, my skin glows after srubbing my self. My strech marks have also decreased in apperance. I also used it for small red bumps on my arm and bottom and my arms and bottom are smooth as possible. I love this product, I will continue to use it and order more!! You will be pleased!!</li>
            <li> Great price on these microdermabrasion crystals. I would recommend this site to anyone looking to get a reasonable price on microdermabrasion crystals</li>
