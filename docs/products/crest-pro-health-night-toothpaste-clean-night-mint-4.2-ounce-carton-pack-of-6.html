    <ol>
            <li>I love this product and am devastated they have discontinued making it!!!</li>
            <li>LOVE this toothpaste!!!  </li>
            <li>I think this is a very good oral/mouth product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
            <li>Greatly hoping they change their minds....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that you can still find things on Amazon that are no longer in the stores for sale!</li>
            <li>Loved the way it cleans.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a great toothpaste with a great taste and seemingly a touch grittier than most, which polishes up your teeth nicely.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Brushing my teeth with Crest Oro Health Night was a really nice part of my routine.</li>
            <li>I looked forward to it honestly.</li>
            <li>Believe me - I have, but not any more - Thanks to this wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love my Crest Night Tooth Paste -  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find some still available at Amazon--and the expiration date was NOT a problem--plenty of time left to use up my order.</li>
            <li>If Crest couldn&#x27;t sell enough to make the shelf stockers happy</li>
            <li>I wish they would have made it available online.</li>
            <li>wake up with fresh clean taste in the morning.</li>
            <li>I used to have horrendous dragon breath in the morning but flossing and using Crest Night really makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>But worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Get a case, lasts for months.</li>
            <li>It was the best toothpaste and now I am using one of their competitors toothpastes because none of the other Crest products can do the same job as Pro-Health Night.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of grit like you would have after a cleaning at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>This Clean Night Mint is soft and leaves your mouth so fresh and clean -</li>
            <li>On the positive side, Amazon had a link to a reseller who was selling packs of five, so I&#x27;ll have enough of this for another year or two, provided my wife and son continue to use their own brands.</li>
            <li>It really helps make your morning breath fresher!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find Crest Night at my local stores, so I made a search on-line and was grateful to find it</li>
            <li>This product has done wonders for maintaining healthy teeth for the last years.  </li>
            <li>and of course they had several places where it was available!  </li>
            <li>This has been my favorite toothpaste for a long time; now it&#x27;s been discontinued by Crest.  </li>
            <li>ITT is the only formula that really makes my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li>teeth feel extra clean thanks to the gritty material in the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Even just as a limited time annual offering would have garnered loyal purchasers once people got word of it.</li>
            <li>You could really tell a difference in the morning compared to using a regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>THEIR SENSITIVE BRAND</li>
            <li>The night version has a slightly different flavor to others I have tried and I highly suggest it.  </li>
            <li>I started using Crest Pro-Health Night about two years ago, and my dental hygienist noticed an improvement in tartar control and general dental health.</li>
            <li>APPARENTLY</li>

            <li> APPARENTLY</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive mouth and do not like harsh mint flavors.  </li>
            <li> They discontinued it, which is too bad, since it was my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The product is what I expected.  </li>
            <li> There is not much to say here.  </li>
            <li> The taste was similar to &#x27;Pearl Drops&#x27; (not sure if that&#x27;s still being made).</li>
            <li> But apparently people considered a &amp;#34;Night&amp;#34; formulation to be something of a scam, and sales were poor.</li>
            <li> I also love it - and I am sad that they discontinued it!!!!</li>
            <li> (the night version at least).  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s just back to mindless brushing. :(</li>
            <li> I was even told by my hygenist that using this product at night actually kept the plaque and tartar from getting so bad and made it easier to get off the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have had trouble finding it in the States</li>
            <li> You would think a manufacturer would poll customers before just stopping a product production if there is nothing wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to see it going away.  </li>
            <li> Have used this for quite awhile but unable to find anywhere, so went to Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Bad Judgement</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED that Crest chose to discontinue it.  </li>
            <li> - you can wake up with horrible breath.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere anymore, and I fear it might be at the end of production.  But it&#x27;s a great toothpaste with a great taste and seemingly a touch grittier than most, which polishes up your teeth nicely.  The dentist has inquired what I&#x27;m doing differently because my plaque formation is down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring it back!  It&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
            <li> You would think a manufacturer would poll customers before just stopping a product production if there is nothing wrong with it.  These guys &amp;#34;thought&amp;#34; they were perceived as &amp;#34;scamming&amp;#34;?  I think they just reduced product production overall and this one &amp;#34;took the hit&amp;#34;.  Bad Judgement</li>
            <li> teeth feel extra clean thanks to the gritty material in the toothpaste. wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued but bought enough to get me through</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a number of years now and to my surprise, I can&#x27;t believe Crest has discontinued this product.  I used to have horrendous dragon breath in the morning but flossing and using Crest Night really makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. Probably why the don&#x27;t make it anymore! Just my luck...feels like I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Has anyone found a comparable replacement? I love this toothpaste! ITT is the only formula that really makes my mouth feel clean. The taste was similar to &#x27;Pearl Drops&#x27; (not sure if that&#x27;s still being made). If Crest couldn&#x27;t sell enough to make the shelf stockers happy (I&#x27;ll have to assume that&#x27;s why they discontinued it) I wish they would have made it available online. Even just as a limited time annual offering would have garnered loyal purchasers once people got word of it. I think the only reason it didn&#x27;t sell (again if that&#x27;s the reason for discontinuing) is people didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t just a gimmick. They should have done a mailing campaign with samples and online purchase information. Brushing my teeth with Crest Oro Health Night was a really nice part of my routine. I looked forward to it honestly. Now it&#x27;s just back to mindless brushing. :(</li>
            <li> I also love it - and I am sad that they discontinued it!!!! PLEASE COME BACK!</li>
            <li> The product is what I expected.  however I was somewhat upset at the expiration date on the product.  All tube of toothpaste were use befor november of 2012.  With just the wife and i that is not possible.  The product shipped needs to be longer than the 2 to 3 months.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that Crest stopped making this product.  It was the best toothpaste and now I am using one of their competitors toothpastes because none of the other Crest products can do the same job as Pro-Health Night.</li>
            <li> I love this product and am devastated they have discontinued making it!!! I was even told by my hygenist that using this product at night actually kept the plaque and tartar from getting so bad and made it easier to get off the teeth.  PLEASE BRING BACK THIS TOOTHPASTE!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t stores carry this one anymore? Have to get it online. But worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Get a case, lasts for months.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say here.  I bought this toothpaste years ago in Canada on a work trip where my luggage was lost.  Loved the way it cleans.  Just the right amount of grit like you would have after a cleaning at the dentist.  The night version has a slightly different flavor to others I have tried and I highly suggest it.  Unfortunately I have had trouble finding it in the States (the night version at least).  Amazon to the rescue!</li>
            <li> LOVE this toothpaste!!!  You could really tell a difference in the morning compared to using a regular toothpaste.  VERY DISAPPOINTED that Crest chose to discontinue it.  Greatly hoping they change their minds....</li>
            <li> Sorry to see it going away.  We&#x27;ve been using it for ages!  Hope something else comes about when we&#x27;ve used up this recent purchase.</li>
            <li> I love my Crest Night Tooth Paste -  It really helps make your morning breath fresher! I suffer with lactose intolerance issues stemming from Crohn&#x27;s Disease, with that - you can wake up with horrible breath. Believe me - I have, but not any more - Thanks to this wonderful product! I haven&#x27;t been able to find Crest Night at my local stores, so I made a search on-line and was grateful to find it - Thank you amazon.com!</li>
            <li> wake up with fresh clean taste in the morning. I Would buy it for ever if they keep making it.</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for maintaining healthy teeth for the last years.  Don&#x27;t think the product is manufactured any longer, so the only place to purchase on the internet.</li>
            <li> NEEDED A TOOTHPASTE THAT OFFERED SENSITIVITY VALUES.  CREST DISCONTINUED THEIR SENSITIVE BRAND APPARENTLY AND OF ALL THE PRO HEALTH PASTES, THE NIGHT FORMULA SEEMS TO HAVE THE PROPERTIES I NEED.  I USE TWICE A DAY - NOT ONLY AT NIGHT.</li>
            <li> Been using this product since it was introduced, it works as described. Hope that it stays in the market forever.</li>
            <li> I started using Crest Pro-Health Night about two years ago, and my dental hygienist noticed an improvement in tartar control and general dental health. I had been using a cinnamon toothpaste that I finally connected to recurring canker sores, and Pro-Health Night solved that as well. But apparently people considered a &amp;#34;Night&amp;#34; formulation to be something of a scam, and sales were poor. They discontinued it, which is too bad, since it was my favorite toothpaste. On the positive side, Amazon had a link to a reseller who was selling packs of five, so I&#x27;ll have enough of this for another year or two, provided my wife and son continue to use their own brands.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite toothpaste for a long time; now it&#x27;s been discontinued by Crest.  I was happy to find some still available at Amazon--and the expiration date was NOT a problem--plenty of time left to use up my order.</li>
            <li> Have used this for quite awhile but unable to find anywhere, so went to Amazon.com and of course they had several places where it was available!  I have a sensitive mouth and do not like harsh mint flavors.  This Clean Night Mint is soft and leaves your mouth so fresh and clean - no burning at all!</li>
            <li> I have searched all over every store that I could go to and could not find this product anywhere!  I happened to do a search on your site and actually found the tubes for sale!  It&#x27;s nice to know that you can still find things on Amazon that are no longer in the stores for sale!</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good oral/mouth product. I do recommend using Crest mouth wash that whitens the teeth.</li>
