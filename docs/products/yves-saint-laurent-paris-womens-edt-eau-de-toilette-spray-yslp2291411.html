            <li>I wore YSL Paris years ago and loved it then.  </li>
            <li>and i was more than happy to show my appreciation of her than buying her her favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>but I get many compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast service and follow up. ...</li>
            <li>the one I always receive the most compliments on when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>I love it anyway</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ll review it for her: LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really elegant scent and fits her well.</li>
            <li>This eau de toilette is more potent and long-lasting than any toilette I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have used Paris by YSL for many years now.</li>
            <li>and my wife was pleased on Christmas morning when she opened it.</li>
            <li>I love my nana.</li>
            <li>So many compliments.</li>
            <li>Paris is magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE,LOVE.</li>
            <li>This is one of my all-time favorite smells/cologne.</li>
            <li>Very nice product, reasonable price, and my wife loves it</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom and she just loved it so very much.</li>
            <li>My new purchase is of the eau de toilette, and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find this beautiful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a long time favorite.</li>
            <li>It can easily become your &#x27;signature&#x27; fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you want a beautiful rose/violet based floral this is definitely the one to get.</li>
            <li>, I guess I am fine with it</li>
            <li>Love the scent, sophisticated and romantic :)</li>
            <li>Paris is one of those perfumes that actually gets better and better as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li>I love perfume and am always trying new ones.  </li>
            <li>She used to only be able to get it on cruise ships, and now that I can get it for her this way, she doesn&#x27;t have to take a cruise to get it--sweet!</li>
            <li>The fragrance a fresh flowery scent that stays with you all day.  </li>
            <li>While the price is right, the fragrance is not.</li>
            <li>She told me this was her favorite perfume and that the only perfume she use to wear.  </li>
            <li>but always loved it in the past.</li>
            <li>I am very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Old favorite, got this back in 1983.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and you can definitely wear it all year long, but I do like it best for cooler months and evenings.  </li>
            <li>have always liked the subtle smell of Paris, but this is like it is severely watered down, or, in my opinion, some kind of knockoff with very inferior ingredients.</li>
            <li>Normally in the department stores, this perfume cost $60 to $70.  </li>
            <li>this product smelled old, possibly too much shelf life.</li>

            <li> was disappointed and wasted my money.</li>

            <li> A perfume I have been wearing for years...hard to find...but I get many compliments every time I wear it. Great price and fast service and follow up. ...</li>
            <li> Old favorite, got this back in 1983. Good to know that it&#x27;s still around. Love the scent, sophisticated and romantic :)</li>
            <li> This is a regular Christmas gift that I get for my mother every year. She adores this perfume, and is delighted with it. She used to only be able to get it on cruise ships, and now that I can get it for her this way, she doesn&#x27;t have to take a cruise to get it--sweet!</li>
            <li> just what I pay for fair price, item arrived on time, I guess I am fine with it</li>
            <li> I love perfume and am always trying new ones.  However, Paris is the one I always come back to and the one I always receive the most compliments on when I wear it.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and you can definitely wear it all year long, but I do like it best for cooler months and evenings.  Paris is one of those perfumes that actually gets better and better as the day goes on.  It can easily become your &#x27;signature&#x27; fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;I have never rec&#x27;d this item or a credit (refund)&lt;br /&gt;for this item. I have called customer service&lt;br /&gt;several times &amp; keep getting the run around.&lt;br /&gt;No resolution has transpired for this purchase.</li>
            <li> I broght this perfume for my wife.  She told me this was her favorite perfume and that the only perfume she use to wear.  I found this on Amazon and the price for this perfume was excellent.  Normally in the department stores, this perfume cost $60 to $70.  The fragrance a fresh flowery scent that stays with you all day.  I will definitely by this product again but only from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the smell is not the same as before, even though I like it, but does not last long enough. I love it anyway</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom since she has always loved this scent. So, I&#x27;ll review it for her: LOVE IT. It&#x27;s a really elegant scent and fits her well.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, reasonable price, and my wife loves it so what else is there to say?</li>
            <li> I wore YSL Paris years ago and loved it then.  My new purchase is of the eau de toilette, and it&#x27;s great.  This eau de toilette is more potent and long-lasting than any toilette I&#x27;ve ever used.  If you want a beautiful rose/violet based floral this is definitely the one to get.</li>
            <li> this product smelled old, possibly too much shelf life. but always loved it in the past. was disappointed and wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have used Paris by YSL for many years now. When my local Nordstrom&#x27;s stopped stocking it, I decided to try Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The box I received was in cellophane with a sticker, and looked in every way like the regular packaging. The product inside, however, although it smells faintly of Paris, lasts about as long as it takes to spray it on.&lt;br /&gt;I have always liked the subtle smell of Paris, but this is like it is severely watered down, or, in my opinion, some kind of knockoff with very inferior ingredients. I do not recommend this at all, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My girl Lisa loves it, awesome smell.</li>
            <li> I was so happy just to be able to get it again! It is no longer sold at Macy&#x27;s  Love the smell!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she just loved it so very much. It has a very delicate scent.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this beautiful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a long time favorite.</li>
            <li> My go-to scent, whether I&#x27;m going to work, out with friends, or running errands. Its not overpowering, yet hours later you will notice it on your pulse points.</li>
            <li> This is just what it is represented to be.  It smells very good and my wife was pleased on Christmas morning when she opened it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my nana who has always helped me out. Im 27 and she still sends me money. So i heard through the grape vine she loves this perfume and i was more than happy to show my appreciation of her than buying her her favorite perfume. 82 and still going. I love my nana.</li>
            <li> Gave this fragrance as a gift to the person who introduced me to it.</li>
            <li> My signature, can&#x27;t be without scent. So many compliments. Thank you Yves St Laurent. Paris is magic in a bottle. LOVE, LOVE,LOVE.</li>
            <li> I have been using Paris for 35 yr. While the price is right, the fragrance is not. There is a difference in the fragrance, either it&#x27;s been on the shelf too long, not sure. Just know when I use my other bottle( just got a little left) that the fragrance is off. :(</li>
            <li> This is one of my all-time favorite smells/cologne.</li>
