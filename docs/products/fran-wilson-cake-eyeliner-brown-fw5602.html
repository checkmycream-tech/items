            <li>I was very happy to find this as a replacement.  </li>

            <li>A good product.</li>
            <li>Much superior to gels, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner, I&#x27;d used Maybelline cake liner but it was discontinued and this is a great replacement for the Maybelline, now that I think about it</li>

            <li>I love it and recommend it to friends!</li>
            <li>this is ALL you need ... acts like a shadow ... then moisten the brush / it&#x27;ll darken up for an eyeliner ... and folks will make lovely compliments!</li>
            <li>liner has excellent staying power; I put it on early in the morning and it doesn&#x27;t flake or rub off---</li>
            <li>Gives me a great line that doesn&#x27;t come off when I do hot yoga.  </li>
            <li>, I like this Fran Wilson liner even more.  </li>
            <li>I love the control of cake eyeliner, you can make it darker or softer, depending on your look you are creating.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It may be waterproof but it sure isn&#x27;t oil proof.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I have more control when applying it.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>the women in my household swear by this product and love it when I can find it for them.  </li>
            <li>They love the way it applies and stays on</li>
            <li>Cake eyeliner has been one of my favorite eye products since I discovered it in my youth.  </li>
            <li>but perhaps it would work better when used with one of those mixing mediums or a transformer liquid.</li>
            <li>I love it and have tried other products, but this is the best.  </li>
            <li>I use this cake eyeliner every day and love the smooth application.  </li>
            <li>does not move around, and comes off easily with a makeup remover cloth.</li>
            <li>I can easily control the width and add to it or diminish as the circumstances of the day dictate.  </li>
            <li>It could easily be applied in a thicker-looking line.</li>
            <li>excellent product with a superior brush--easy to use andnon irritating</li>
            <li>I use it for a smokey eye look or a light eyeliner during the day.</li>
            <li>The price was fantastic.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner lasts all day, goes on easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It is true that it doesn&#x27;t come off, but it does sort of smear during the day and a lot of it  ended up under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used a cake eyeliner way back when, via Mary Kay, and I haven&#x27;t been especially happy with any other type of eyeliner product since then.  </li>
            <li>Wow, it goes on not looking like a ring around my eyes, but a nice muted soft shawdow...</li>
            <li>It goes on with a bit of water and an eyeliner brush and gave complete coverage and an easy line across my eyelid.  </li>
            <li>Although I have used this product for probably a year with no issues... just being cautious and replacing at an appropriate time to eliminate any possible bacteria issues.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase this again, as it tends to run and that is exactly what I was not looking for.  </li>
            <li>It does not flake, which is positive.  </li>
            <li>If you use the proper brush it is easily applied.</li>
            <li>The brown color isn&#x27;t really brown - it has a very unnatural grey-ish chalky look.</li>
            <li>The trick is how much water you use, a little makes a darker color, more water mutes the harshness.  </li>
            <li>I let it dry, then soften the line by lightly running a Q-tip over it.</li>
            <li>I only apply eyeliner and mascara to my upper lid, not liking how I look with the more darker, heavier lashed and lined look.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s just enough to enhance my eyes without it being glaringly obvious that I&#x27;m wearing it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>you are trying to decide between brown and black, I went for the brown shade only because I have light hair.  </li>
            <li>The brush is tiny and easy applying the liner with my small sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I also use this as a brown eye shadow by gently sweeping my powder brush over it dry, before wetting my liner brush.  </li>
            <li>My first purchase was this product in black.</li>
            <li>not dark enough and did not stay on</li>
            <li>So much easier to use than other eyeliners!  </li>
            <li>so much I also bought one in black.  </li>
            <li>If my hair was light brown or darker, or you are blonde but want a heavy night-time look, get the black.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This cake liner lasts at least 10 hours if I moisten the applicator brush first.  </li>
            <li> It does come with a small, very skinny brush.  </li>
            <li> It is long lasting</li>
            <li> Terrific product..wish I had found it long ago..</li>
            <li> I am an older woman and decided that the black was a bit dark for me, so I ordered brown this time around.</li>
            <li> I was SO THRILLED to find a cake eyeliner, but after using this one for a few days, it turned out to be a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than the very expensive eyeliner I am replacing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One container will last you for a few years, you get a lot for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I throw out just due to age,.  </li>
            <li> forget about all other eye products . . .</li>
            <li> I tried liquid that I purchased at a local store, but could taste the eyeliner when a small amount ended up in my eye.</li>
            <li> I wish I could get it in another color other than black.</li>
            <li> And the brush for the liquid eyeliner is too wide for the narrow line I want to create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get it wet and swipe it across the cake eyeliner a few times.  </li>
            <li> Please continue to carry Brown and Black eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I do have a little bit of smearing</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so pencil liners tend to smear and disappear after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I had problems with this eyeliner as it got goopy when wet with a brush, and was difficult to apply evenly due to thick consistency..</li>
            <li> I use a thin brush.  </li>
            <li> You can make a subtle line or a very dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Cake eyeliner is very hard to find in stores!  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find cakeliner in stores.  </li>
            <li> but it is almost impossible to find at the store anymore.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Online is the only place to find the things that used to be in the stores. This eyeliner lasts all day, goes on easily and dries quickly. I love it and recommend it to friends!</li>
            <li> This was my third or fourth order of this product.  I love it and have tried other products, but this is the best.  It is long lasting and I throw out just due to age,.  Although I have used this product for probably a year with no issues... just being cautious and replacing at an appropriate time to eliminate any possible bacteria issues.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. If you use the proper brush it is easily applied. It does not flake, which is positive.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> not dark enough and did not stay on</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, I&#x27;d used Maybelline cake liner but it was discontinued and this is a great replacement for the Maybelline, now that I think about it, I like this Fran Wilson liner even more.  I also use this as a brown eye shadow by gently sweeping my powder brush over it dry, before wetting my liner brush.  Speaking of the liner brush, I don&#x27;t care for the tiny one that comes with this, I use my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This liner has excellent staying power; I put it on early in the morning and it doesn&#x27;t flake or rub off---it&#x27;s on until I take it off at night when I wash my face before going to bed.  There is no need for a separate liner sealer with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One container will last you for a few years, you get a lot for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to decide between brown and black, I went for the brown shade only because I have light hair.  It&#x27;s a medium brown liner.  If my hair was light brown or darker, or you are blonde but want a heavy night-time look, get the black.</li>
            <li> I have used cake eyeliner for years... a few that I liked quit making the products, not really happy finding what I wanted till I tried this product! Wow, it goes on not looking like a ring around my eyes, but a nice muted soft shawdow... it stays put... does not move around, and comes off easily with a makeup remover cloth. In short, this product delivers! I love the control of cake eyeliner, you can make it darker or softer, depending on your look you are creating. It is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years. It is great in staying power, and versatility. You can make a subtle line or a very dramatic look. It does not peel or flake. It may take some practice to get proficient with applying eyeliner with a brush, but it cleans up with a q-tip if you need to soften, adjust or \\&quot;erase\\&quot;. Love it.</li>
            <li> I had problems with this eyeliner as it got goopy when wet with a brush, and was difficult to apply evenly due to thick consistency..</li>
            <li> excellent product with a superior brush--easy to use andnon irritating</li>
            <li> I have used cake eyeliner for many years and was impressed with the Fran Wilson product.  It goes on with a bit of water and an eyeliner brush and gave complete coverage and an easy line across my eyelid.  I like it so much I also bought one in black.  The trick is how much water you use, a little makes a darker color, more water mutes the harshness.  A good product.</li>
            <li> Terrific product..wish I had found it long ago.. I like it better than the very expensive eyeliner I am replacing.</li>
            <li> It may be waterproof but it sure isn&#x27;t oil proof.  I tend to have oily eyelids.  It ended up under my eyes</li>
            <li> I use this cake eyeliner every day and love the smooth application.  I can easily control the width and add to it or diminish as the circumstances of the day dictate.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so pencil liners tend to smear and disappear after a few hours.  This cake liner lasts at least 10 hours if I moisten the applicator brush first.  I let it dry, then soften the line by lightly running a Q-tip over it.</li>
            <li> When Clinique stopped production of their cake eyeliner I was very happy to find this as a replacement.  I do have a little bit of smearing but overall I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used a cake eyeliner way back when, via Mary Kay, and I haven&#x27;t been especially happy with any other type of eyeliner product since then.  I&#x27;ve found the grease pencil/crayon type often skip, so I have to go over it over and over again - often making the line thicker in one place than another.  And the brush for the liquid eyeliner is too wide for the narrow line I want to create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was really happy to come across this product.  It does come with a small, very skinny brush.  I like the width of the bristle but a somewhat longer handle would make it easier to apply.  But then again, the size of the brush is perfect for in your purse.  At home, use a longer brush.  I feel like I have more control when applying it.  I only apply eyeliner and mascara to my upper lid, not liking how I look with the more darker, heavier lashed and lined look.  The eyeliner stays where you put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a somewhat grayish brown and I love that it&#x27;s just enough to enhance my eyes without it being glaringly obvious that I&#x27;m wearing it.  It could easily be applied in a thicker-looking line.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use than other eyeliners!  As you add water to this, you can control the consistency of the eyeliner.  Cake eyeliner is very hard to find in stores!  Will reorder when I run out!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  The brush is tiny and easy applying the liner with my small sensitive eyes. If I had to reapply, it would probably be in the evening for freshening up.  I wish I could get it in another color other than black.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for smokey eye effect. if you are looking for a more darker look, this isnt very good for that. I use it for a smokey eye look or a light eyeliner during the day.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this again, as it tends to run and that is exactly what I was not looking for.  I did not care for it.</li>
            <li> forget about all other eye products . . . this is ALL you need ... acts like a shadow ... then moisten the brush / it&#x27;ll darken up for an eyeliner ... and folks will make lovely compliments!</li>
            <li> the women in my household swear by this product and love it when I can find it for them.  They love the way it applies and stays on</li>
            <li> I have a friend who looked all over for this type of product and could not find it anywhere.  I came to Amazon, and here it is.  It is even larger sized than my friend uses.  She was very happy to receive this product.  Prior to my order, she was just doing without.  The price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I use a thin brush.  Get it wet and swipe it across the cake eyeliner a few times.  Gives me a great line that doesn&#x27;t come off when I do hot yoga.  Much superior to gels, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with this product.  It is difficult to find cakeliner in stores.  Cake eyeliner has been one of my favorite eye products since I discovered it in my youth.  Please continue to carry Brown and Black eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I was SO THRILLED to find a cake eyeliner, but after using this one for a few days, it turned out to be a disappointment.  The brown color isn&#x27;t really brown - it has a very unnatural grey-ish chalky look. It is true that it doesn&#x27;t come off, but it does sort of smear during the day and a lot of it  ended up under my eyes.  I used water to apply it....but perhaps it would work better when used with one of those mixing mediums or a transformer liquid.</li>
            <li> I like to use cake eyeliner but it is almost impossible to find at the store anymore. I tried liquid that I purchased at a local store, but could taste the eyeliner when a small amount ended up in my eye. I prefer to stay away from chemicals all together, but if they are present I don&#x27;t want to taste them. My first purchase was this product in black. I ended up purchasing a longer brush for application and was very pleased with the results. I am an older woman and decided that the black was a bit dark for me, so I ordered brown this time around. I have been very pleased and will order it again.</li>
