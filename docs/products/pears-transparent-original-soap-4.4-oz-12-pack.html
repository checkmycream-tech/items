            <li>Wonderfully moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The wonderful fragrance is gone, replaced by an antiseptic smell.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, speedy service</li>
            <li>Pears soap is wonderful for its smoothness, mildness, not removing skin oils, and not leaving any oily feel.</li>

            <li>The ad has a beautiful woman in a footed tub reaching over for a bar of Pears soap from a huge stacked display by the tub.  </li>
            <li>I love Pears soap!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind to your skin</li>
            <li>company had the best price and they were fast.</li>
            <li>It is no longer the wonderful, natural product we all knew and loved.    </li>
            <li>It will remind me that there used to be a soap that smelled divine, lathered nicely, and didn&#x27;t make my skin itch like an attack of fire ants.</li>
            <li>The absolute best soap for all skin types.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to use a product that has been around since 1807.  </li>
            <li>He is allergic to most soaps and is delighted with Pears.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;v always liked &amp;#34;see-through&amp;#34; soaps.</li>
            <li>Washs clean amd rinses off great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality bar that lasts a while, but the best part is the smell.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite soap...not too scented and gentle, and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li>The real original formula box has 2 soap bars on it and states it is Hypo-allergenic and non-comedogenic.</li>
            <li>That wonderful squeeky clean feel after you shower is worth the change.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have switched to another wonderful soap, an old timer manufactured in Spain.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this very good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still one of the best and most affordable soaps around for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The original Pears soap had a wonderful, clean feeling and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is better now.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this soap - have purchases it 3 times already</li>
            <li>We have used it for years and love this soap.</li>
            <li>It was the most satisfactory soap I&#x27;d ever used.  </li>
            <li>I love this hand soap</li>
            <li>Most drugstore chains do not carry it.</li>
            <li>I love Pears soap-go</li>
            <li>glad I found it on the internet....</li>
            <li>I have used it for more than 40 years, since I was a baby.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find in store anymore like all products that I love.</li>
            <li>I love the look and have always been pleased with whatever I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li>We love this soap.</li>
            <li>None better.</li>
            <li>No wonder it&#x27;s sold mostly in dollar stores.  </li>
            <li>This is always a favorite of ours.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Yes, the aroma has changed (not for the better</li>
            <li>and it is appropriate for everyone in the family.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love my case of Pears Soap.  </li>
            <li>Great to get this many bars at such a good price.</li>
            <li>I just opened on of my latest batch of Pear&#x27;s Soap</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than Neutrogena and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;My favorite soap.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my face</li>
            <li>and I believe it gives me a more youthful feel and look.  </li>
            <li>Over a year ago I ordered this soap because it was recommended for those who have allergic reactions to many soaps.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel nice and clean plus the fragrance is also enjoyable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very excited about using it again.  </li>
            <li>I loved this soap when I first used it 25 years ago ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;October 2013, and still we wait for the return of the ORIGINAL!</li>
            <li>I like this soap a lot - mild, pleasant, works well, and looks cool (transparent/translucent) - and this was a good price on a fairly large quantity.</li>
            <li>If anyone finds a source for the great OLD Pears soap, please post it on here!</li>
            <li>I love collecting beautiful, expensive soap from the best shops around the world.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to discover it in the 99 cent stores, but it was not that cheap - a dollar a bar.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Works great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much, in fact, that I went searching for it.</li>
            <li>I love Pears Transparent Original Soap, don&#x27;t need to use bath oil with this soap</li>
            <li>Very mild, yet cleanses and deodorizes the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can get it in bulk from Amazon--much more economical.</li>
            <li>What more can this wretched company do to destroy this wonderful soap?</li>
            <li>Also the packaging came smelling so strongly of mothballs</li>
            <li>Until I find a more natural product that smells as good, though, I plan to keep using this.</li>
            <li>As good as Nutrogena without the high price.</li>
            <li>a 100+year old successful formula is beyond me, but whatever.  </li>
            <li>This is the way soap should be: translucent, free of perfumes and dyes and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>The twelve bars from Amazon arrive in perfect condition, and will last you about twelve weeks, even if you are an avid user, as I am.  </li>
            <li>But I was very happy to be able to recreate the experience of using a mild, gentle, soap that was actually quite long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Light fragrance, not flowery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pears soap is free from animal products, which is important to those of us who are vegetarian or vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>original formula for 200 years had 8 ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The description of this Pears soap is deliberatley misleading, as it uses the word \\&quot;original\\&quot; which makes you believe it is the original 9 component formula of Pears soap.</li>
            <li>92512311.&lt;br /&gt;To ask them if the original Pears soap is back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But once you get used to the new scent, or if you weren&#x27;t familiar with the old scent in the first place, this is excellent glycerine soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great and does wonders for my normally dry skin.</li>
            <li>, I fear--it smells a bit &amp;#34;medicine-y&amp;#34; now, although that abates some with use) but otherwise, it&#x27;s the same old Pears and my skin is very happy.  </li>
            <li>I will keep this bit of wonderful smelling and pleasing-to-look-at memorabilia for as long as I live, probably.</li>
            <li>I have special ordered this product because I like the way it cleanses without drying my skin and its hit or miss in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Purchased originally in England for my son as he swears that it helps his mild acneso</li>
            <li>This soap is now and has been a favorite - cleans well and lasts much longer than softer bar soaps.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking forward to experiencing that clean, fresh fragrance again.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>am now asking you to please bring back the \\&quot;original\\&quot; pears transparent soap.&lt;br /&gt;The soap with the beautiful aroma that is darker than the new one and lasts for 28 showers!&lt;br</li>
            <li>quality control was destroyed by the new owners, who didn&#x27;t take the time to invest the  money, investment, or love involved in keeping this soap what it was and retaining their loyal customers.  </li>
            <li>So strange that folks say it &amp;#34;used to be&amp;#34; a fine soap with a nice odor.  </li>
            <li>I used to live in England and became a fan of Pears soap, love the smell and the feel.</li>
            <li>Also strange that the best soap I&#x27;ve ever found was the WHITE PEARS - oval in all directions and stamped with the Queen&#x27;s Royal stamp on both the soap and the box.  </li>
            <li>It has such a lovely scent and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite a nasty-smelling formulation, reminiscent of some kind of insecticide or industrial cleaning product.</li>
            <li>worth it for the deal.</li>
            <li>pay $4.00 a bar at my local health food co-op for a soap that is kind to my skin.</li>
            <li>Bought for my son&#x27;s bathroom - recently he had a skin irritation, so I thought that a good bar soap will be better for his daily needs.</li>
            <li>They are not Pears Original Soap, and certainly don&#x27;t smell like it.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel soft and clean!</li>
            <li>Truthfully, the soap smells a little bit like medicine, but it is attractive and I needed several bars to re-enact the ad.  </li>
            <li>It also lasts a great deal longer than other transparent soaps such as Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that in the old days, decades ago, Pears made in England was an even better product, with a nicer perfume.</li>
            <li>Such a shame for a great 220-year-old brand, which Unilever has totally ruined.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite soap for bathing, but I can&#x27;t always find it in the drugstores, so I rely on being able to buy a few bars at a time.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>As we move towards more natural products, I was very disheartened to see Pears begin including a ton of chemicals (preservatives, detergents, stabilizers, etc) beginning in 2009.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and mild and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Very good for people with dry skin, or for people who want to avoid dry skin.</li>
            <li>If you have a particular sensitivity or allergy to one of the components of this soap, your point is well taken, but this will not be true for everyone.</li>
            <li>I first tried Pears in 1973, when I lived in the UK.</li>
            <li>; I find many people similarly terrified of the substances of vaccines, and they shouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li>My Father has used this soap for years and many reviews on here comment on the change of fragrance and formulation but for me it smells the same as it did as when I was a kid.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered from Amazon rather than going to a retail outlet.</li>
            <li>Fast, inexpensive, delivered to my house...can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the original, have never tried any of the other fragrances.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would gladly pay twice the price to get the authentic product back on the market, there are so few really good bar soaps left.</li>
            <li>Many of the glycerine soaps in my local health-food store are $5 or so per bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Used this soap since I was a boy, really like it !</li>
            <li>The bottom line is-shop the Dollar Store first.</li>
            <li>Obviously I have been pleased.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s just my personal history of this Pears Soap, but I do love it and give a bar as a gift on occasions.</li>
            <li>for those of you who don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s because the original Pear&#x27;s soap is a 200-year old brand that used to be made in ENGLAND</li>
            <li>Original ingredients: Sodium Palmitate, Natural Rosin, Glycerine, Water, Sodium Cocoate, Rosemary Extract, Thyme Extract, Pears Fragrance Essence.    </li>
            <li>Pears may have changed the soap formula, but it has the same gentle and refreshing lather and cleaning power.</li>
            <li>It takes me back to my childhood ,this is a hard soap that lasts longer and has a very pleasant aroma, does not get mushy.</li>
            <li>Its clean and clear and gives the right amount of suds in our soft water.  </li>
            <li>Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;i used this bar once &amp; had to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li>But when I moved to Seattle in 1981, it wasn&#x27;t available locally, life intervened, and I gave up looking for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was absolutely nothing in the description telling me the formula had changed and Pears now contains a plethora of chemicals as well as perfume.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I used to use the original Pear&#x27;s soap for years but this one is quite different...</li>
            <li>This is the Indian version of Pears which is supposed to be closer to the original Pears than the British version.</li>
            <li>It now aggravates my eczema where the original Pears actually relieved it.</li>
            <li>Pears is unique because it&#x27;s so radically simple.</li>
            <li>As for the soap itself I would only use it to clean my face</li>
            <li>I believe that there is a certain amount of deceit on the part of the new Indian ownership of the company in listing the product as &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but found it gentle, and I adore the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>Still my favorite soap even if the ingredients have changed and the scent has changed a little.  </li>
            <li>i really like the soap-however I found the exact same soap at the Dollar</li>
            <li>I have used this soap for a few years and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth spending a bit extra to have the availability, quantity, and quality you want.  </li>
            <li>We have used this mild unscented soap for decades and keep going back to it as scented soaps create problems for our sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>opened the package, only to be set back with the strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this probably means that Amazon also no longer has the old formula, unless a savvy and honest seller specifically says that they have the original product.</li>
            <li>I found Pears soap in New York City in 1979, when I moved there from Geneva, Switzerland.  </li>
            <li>The new formula has a bit of a medicinal smell.</li>
            <li>New ingredients: Sorbitol, Aqua, Sodium Palmate/stearate, Sodium Palmkernelate, Sodium Rosinate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, PEG-4, Alcohol, Glycerin, Perfume, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Meta Bisulfite, Etidronic acid, Tetra Sodium EDTA, BHT, Cl 12490,</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, I&#x27;ll continue to ignore this newly formulated, foul-smelling Pears, the one that burns like turpentine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful bar soap that lasts and doesn&#x27;t just become a sloppy mess in the soap dish.</li>
            <li>I was disppointed when i received the order after having checked other AmericaRx products elsewhere on Amazon which show the original formula as part of their description.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Speedy delivery, too!</li>
            <li>Do not waste time and money on buying this, which is the new formula with added chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see that Amazon sells a dozen bars for considerably less than my local discount stores.</li>
            <li>In addition, is only recently that full disclosure of the constituents of such products was mandated, so perhaps Pears has not changed as much as you think it has.</li>
            <li>It certainly was not the soap that I had been using for the last 40 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to buy it, as it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin prone to dryness and the winter itchies, but it&#x27;s still disappointing that they&#x27;ve added more chemicals/ingredients to it in the last few years.  </li>
            <li>WOW..</li>
            <li>That was the old formulation, of course.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the old one, but this seems like that tar-smelling one that everyone complains about.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>However, I have been unable to buy my beloved Pears Soap for a couple of years now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been increasingly difficult to find it in stores, though, and to find it at a good price.  </li>
            <li>and apparently theres a new formula that everyone hates.</li>
            <li>That motivated me to open a new box, which revealed the new plastic/cellophane wrapping.  </li>
            <li>one of the famous features of this soap is that the sliver of old soap fits neatly into the hollow on a new bar, so that you don&#x27;t waste any of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did notice the packaging changes, but I didn&#x27;t realize the extent of the disaster until I got home, compared a new box with an old, and saw the strange new ingredient list.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find it in stores, but ordering it by the dozen bars on the internet is easy and practical.</li>
            <li>Gentle fragrance from the moment you open the inner wrap.</li>
            <li>I cannot really use a lot of other soaps, sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reminiscent of old England.</li>
            <li>My grandmother died recently, and during the process of dispersing and donating her things, we came across an old travel soap keeper.</li>
            <li>If you are used to the old Pears soap this will be a giant dissappointment.</li>
            <li>Because the words &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; were on the packaging and in the description, I was fooled into believing I was buying the original soap, or AT LEAST the improved &amp;#34;revised&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it was quite common, relatively inexpensive, and it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the smell isn&#x27;t the same as the old English soap</li>
            <li>For many hears I have had an old Pears Soap advertisement page out of the Harper&#x27;s Weekly magazine from the late 1800s.&lt;br /&gt;It was framed and in my bathroom for years with a bar of Pears soap in a small dish beside it.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Wonderfully moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The wonderful fragrance is gone, replaced by an antiseptic smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, speedy service</li>
            <li> Pears soap is wonderful for its smoothness, mildness, not removing skin oils, and not leaving any oily feel.</li>
            <li> Of all soaps I have ever used, this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> This is the best soap in the world.</li>
            <li> Great price also!</li>
            <li> The best soap there is!!</li>
            <li> Soap is Awesome and the delivery time was superior!</li>
            <li> Excellent shipping, great product, would buy again.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why this once great brand has been ruined...</li>
            <li> Great soap at a great price....have used it for years but seems to have disappeared in brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> Great soap.</li>
            <li> Any substitute suggestions are welcome.</li>
            <li> Is a joy to use, lathers well.  </li>
            <li> This soap is great for all skin types, for an all-over wash, just hands, or even for your face.  </li>
            <li> Great as face soap, great in the shower.</li>
            <li> and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> it was nice to find it in bulk at a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this soap.</li>
            <li> Always loved this soap.  </li>
            <li> Good soap we have been buying Pears for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> This soap does a really good job.  </li>
            <li> This soap feels good, gets to the oil on my face and gets the job</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I ordered, and I am happy I got it at this great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this soap for more than forty years!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the value.</li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> The ad has a beautiful woman in a footed tub reaching over for a bar of Pears soap from a huge stacked display by the tub.  </li>
            <li> I love Pears soap!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind to your skin</li>
            <li> company had the best price and they were fast.</li>
            <li> It is no longer the wonderful, natural product we all knew and loved.    </li>
            <li> It will remind me that there used to be a soap that smelled divine, lathered nicely, and didn&#x27;t make my skin itch like an attack of fire ants.</li>
            <li> The absolute best soap for all skin types.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to use a product that has been around since 1807.  </li>
            <li> He is allergic to most soaps and is delighted with Pears.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;v always liked &amp;#34;see-through&amp;#34; soaps.</li>
            <li> Washs clean amd rinses off great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high quality bar that lasts a while, but the best part is the smell.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap...not too scented and gentle, and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> The real original formula box has 2 soap bars on it and states it is Hypo-allergenic and non-comedogenic.</li>
            <li> That wonderful squeeky clean feel after you shower is worth the change.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have switched to another wonderful soap, an old timer manufactured in Spain.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this very good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still one of the best and most affordable soaps around for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The original Pears soap had a wonderful, clean feeling and fresh smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is better now.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap - have purchases it 3 times already</li>
            <li> We have used it for years and love this soap.</li>
            <li> It was the most satisfactory soap I&#x27;d ever used.  </li>
            <li> I love this hand soap</li>
            <li> Most drugstore chains do not carry it.</li>
            <li> I love Pears soap-go</li>
            <li> glad I found it on the internet....</li>
            <li> I have used it for more than 40 years, since I was a baby.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in store anymore like all products that I love.</li>
            <li> I love the look and have always been pleased with whatever I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> We love this soap.</li>
            <li> None better.</li>
            <li> No wonder it&#x27;s sold mostly in dollar stores.  </li>
            <li> This is always a favorite of ours.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Yes, the aroma has changed (not for the better</li>
            <li> and it is appropriate for everyone in the family.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love my case of Pears Soap.  </li>
            <li> Great to get this many bars at such a good price.</li>
            <li> I just opened on of my latest batch of Pear&#x27;s Soap</li>
            <li> Love this soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than Neutrogena and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My favorite soap.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my face</li>
            <li> and I believe it gives me a more youthful feel and look.  </li>
            <li> Over a year ago I ordered this soap because it was recommended for those who have allergic reactions to many soaps.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel nice and clean plus the fragrance is also enjoyable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very excited about using it again.  </li>
            <li> I loved this soap when I first used it 25 years ago ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;October 2013, and still we wait for the return of the ORIGINAL!</li>
            <li> I like this soap a lot - mild, pleasant, works well, and looks cool (transparent/translucent) - and this was a good price on a fairly large quantity.</li>
            <li> If anyone finds a source for the great OLD Pears soap, please post it on here!</li>
            <li> I love collecting beautiful, expensive soap from the best shops around the world.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to discover it in the 99 cent stores, but it was not that cheap - a dollar a bar.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Works great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much, in fact, that I went searching for it.</li>
            <li> I love Pears Transparent Original Soap, don&#x27;t need to use bath oil with this soap</li>
            <li> Very mild, yet cleanses and deodorizes the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can get it in bulk from Amazon--much more economical.</li>
            <li> What more can this wretched company do to destroy this wonderful soap?</li>
            <li> Also the packaging came smelling so strongly of mothballs</li>
            <li> Until I find a more natural product that smells as good, though, I plan to keep using this.</li>
            <li> As good as Nutrogena without the high price.</li>
            <li> a 100+year old successful formula is beyond me, but whatever.  </li>
            <li> This is the way soap should be: translucent, free of perfumes and dyes and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> The twelve bars from Amazon arrive in perfect condition, and will last you about twelve weeks, even if you are an avid user, as I am.  </li>
            <li> But I was very happy to be able to recreate the experience of using a mild, gentle, soap that was actually quite long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Light fragrance, not flowery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pears soap is free from animal products, which is important to those of us who are vegetarian or vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> original formula for 200 years had 8 ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The description of this Pears soap is deliberatley misleading, as it uses the word \\&quot;original\\&quot; which makes you believe it is the original 9 component formula of Pears soap.</li>
            <li> 92512311.&lt;br /&gt;To ask them if the original Pears soap is back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But once you get used to the new scent, or if you weren&#x27;t familiar with the old scent in the first place, this is excellent glycerine soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells great and does wonders for my normally dry skin.</li>
            <li> , I fear--it smells a bit &amp;#34;medicine-y&amp;#34; now, although that abates some with use) but otherwise, it&#x27;s the same old Pears and my skin is very happy.  </li>
            <li> I will keep this bit of wonderful smelling and pleasing-to-look-at memorabilia for as long as I live, probably.</li>
            <li> I have special ordered this product because I like the way it cleanses without drying my skin and its hit or miss in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Purchased originally in England for my son as he swears that it helps his mild acneso</li>
            <li> This soap is now and has been a favorite - cleans well and lasts much longer than softer bar soaps.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking forward to experiencing that clean, fresh fragrance again.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> am now asking you to please bring back the \\&quot;original\\&quot; pears transparent soap.&lt;br /&gt;The soap with the beautiful aroma that is darker than the new one and lasts for 28 showers!&lt;br</li>
            <li> quality control was destroyed by the new owners, who didn&#x27;t take the time to invest the  money, investment, or love involved in keeping this soap what it was and retaining their loyal customers.  </li>
            <li> So strange that folks say it &amp;#34;used to be&amp;#34; a fine soap with a nice odor.  </li>
            <li> I used to live in England and became a fan of Pears soap, love the smell and the feel.</li>
            <li> Also strange that the best soap I&#x27;ve ever found was the WHITE PEARS - oval in all directions and stamped with the Queen&#x27;s Royal stamp on both the soap and the box.  </li>
            <li> It has such a lovely scent and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a nasty-smelling formulation, reminiscent of some kind of insecticide or industrial cleaning product.</li>
            <li> worth it for the deal.</li>
            <li> pay $4.00 a bar at my local health food co-op for a soap that is kind to my skin.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son&#x27;s bathroom - recently he had a skin irritation, so I thought that a good bar soap will be better for his daily needs.</li>
            <li> They are not Pears Original Soap, and certainly don&#x27;t smell like it.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel soft and clean!</li>
            <li> Truthfully, the soap smells a little bit like medicine, but it is attractive and I needed several bars to re-enact the ad.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts a great deal longer than other transparent soaps such as Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that in the old days, decades ago, Pears made in England was an even better product, with a nicer perfume.</li>
            <li> Such a shame for a great 220-year-old brand, which Unilever has totally ruined.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap for bathing, but I can&#x27;t always find it in the drugstores, so I rely on being able to buy a few bars at a time.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> As we move towards more natural products, I was very disheartened to see Pears begin including a ton of chemicals (preservatives, detergents, stabilizers, etc) beginning in 2009.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and mild and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Very good for people with dry skin, or for people who want to avoid dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you have a particular sensitivity or allergy to one of the components of this soap, your point is well taken, but this will not be true for everyone.</li>
            <li> I first tried Pears in 1973, when I lived in the UK.</li>
            <li> ; I find many people similarly terrified of the substances of vaccines, and they shouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> My Father has used this soap for years and many reviews on here comment on the change of fragrance and formulation but for me it smells the same as it did as when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered from Amazon rather than going to a retail outlet.</li>
            <li> Fast, inexpensive, delivered to my house...can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the original, have never tried any of the other fragrances.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would gladly pay twice the price to get the authentic product back on the market, there are so few really good bar soaps left.</li>
            <li> Many of the glycerine soaps in my local health-food store are $5 or so per bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Used this soap since I was a boy, really like it !</li>
            <li> The bottom line is-shop the Dollar Store first.</li>
            <li> Obviously I have been pleased.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just my personal history of this Pears Soap, but I do love it and give a bar as a gift on occasions.</li>
            <li> for those of you who don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s because the original Pear&#x27;s soap is a 200-year old brand that used to be made in ENGLAND</li>
            <li> Original ingredients: Sodium Palmitate, Natural Rosin, Glycerine, Water, Sodium Cocoate, Rosemary Extract, Thyme Extract, Pears Fragrance Essence.    </li>
            <li> Pears may have changed the soap formula, but it has the same gentle and refreshing lather and cleaning power.</li>
            <li> It takes me back to my childhood ,this is a hard soap that lasts longer and has a very pleasant aroma, does not get mushy.</li>
            <li> Its clean and clear and gives the right amount of suds in our soft water.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;i used this bar once &amp; had to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> But when I moved to Seattle in 1981, it wasn&#x27;t available locally, life intervened, and I gave up looking for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was absolutely nothing in the description telling me the formula had changed and Pears now contains a plethora of chemicals as well as perfume.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I used to use the original Pear&#x27;s soap for years but this one is quite different...</li>
            <li> This is the Indian version of Pears which is supposed to be closer to the original Pears than the British version.</li>
            <li> It now aggravates my eczema where the original Pears actually relieved it.</li>
            <li> Pears is unique because it&#x27;s so radically simple.</li>
            <li> As for the soap itself I would only use it to clean my face</li>
            <li> I believe that there is a certain amount of deceit on the part of the new Indian ownership of the company in listing the product as &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, but found it gentle, and I adore the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Still my favorite soap even if the ingredients have changed and the scent has changed a little.  </li>
            <li> i really like the soap-however I found the exact same soap at the Dollar</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for a few years and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth spending a bit extra to have the availability, quantity, and quality you want.  </li>
            <li> We have used this mild unscented soap for decades and keep going back to it as scented soaps create problems for our sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> opened the package, only to be set back with the strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this probably means that Amazon also no longer has the old formula, unless a savvy and honest seller specifically says that they have the original product.</li>
            <li> I found Pears soap in New York City in 1979, when I moved there from Geneva, Switzerland.  </li>
            <li> The new formula has a bit of a medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> New ingredients: Sorbitol, Aqua, Sodium Palmate/stearate, Sodium Palmkernelate, Sodium Rosinate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, PEG-4, Alcohol, Glycerin, Perfume, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Meta Bisulfite, Etidronic acid, Tetra Sodium EDTA, BHT, Cl 12490,</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I&#x27;ll continue to ignore this newly formulated, foul-smelling Pears, the one that burns like turpentine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful bar soap that lasts and doesn&#x27;t just become a sloppy mess in the soap dish.</li>
            <li> I was disppointed when i received the order after having checked other AmericaRx products elsewhere on Amazon which show the original formula as part of their description.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Speedy delivery, too!</li>
            <li> Do not waste time and money on buying this, which is the new formula with added chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see that Amazon sells a dozen bars for considerably less than my local discount stores.</li>
            <li> In addition, is only recently that full disclosure of the constituents of such products was mandated, so perhaps Pears has not changed as much as you think it has.</li>
            <li> It certainly was not the soap that I had been using for the last 40 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to buy it, as it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin prone to dryness and the winter itchies, but it&#x27;s still disappointing that they&#x27;ve added more chemicals/ingredients to it in the last few years.  </li>
            <li> WOW..</li>
            <li> That was the old formulation, of course.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the old one, but this seems like that tar-smelling one that everyone complains about.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> However, I have been unable to buy my beloved Pears Soap for a couple of years now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been increasingly difficult to find it in stores, though, and to find it at a good price.  </li>
            <li> and apparently theres a new formula that everyone hates.</li>
            <li> That motivated me to open a new box, which revealed the new plastic/cellophane wrapping.  </li>
            <li> one of the famous features of this soap is that the sliver of old soap fits neatly into the hollow on a new bar, so that you don&#x27;t waste any of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice the packaging changes, but I didn&#x27;t realize the extent of the disaster until I got home, compared a new box with an old, and saw the strange new ingredient list.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find it in stores, but ordering it by the dozen bars on the internet is easy and practical.</li>
            <li> Gentle fragrance from the moment you open the inner wrap.</li>
            <li> I cannot really use a lot of other soaps, sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reminiscent of old England.</li>
            <li> My grandmother died recently, and during the process of dispersing and donating her things, we came across an old travel soap keeper.</li>
            <li> If you are used to the old Pears soap this will be a giant dissappointment.</li>
            <li> Because the words &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; were on the packaging and in the description, I was fooled into believing I was buying the original soap, or AT LEAST the improved &amp;#34;revised&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it was quite common, relatively inexpensive, and it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the smell isn&#x27;t the same as the old English soap</li>
            <li> For many hears I have had an old Pears Soap advertisement page out of the Harper&#x27;s Weekly magazine from the late 1800s.&lt;br /&gt;It was framed and in my bathroom for years with a bar of Pears soap in a small dish beside it.  </li>
            <li> The original English soap was dried slowly, which naturally produced the big dimple on each side of the soap bar.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that the bar doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The bar doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> Any ex-pat Brit who loved it from home will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got onto Pears a long time ago</li>
            <li> The price is a little more than you would pay at a discount store, but sometimes those stores are out of stock, have only a few bars, or have bars that are broken.  </li>
            <li> This new soap is made in India under English license - don&#x27;t know what they mean by this</li>
            <li> only wish they were a little bigger</li>
            <li> Now it has 24!&lt;br /&gt;it is not delightfully mild smelling or long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I love the liquid hand soap too, but it is very difficult to find in the US (unless you wish to pay a premium for it).</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews, both pro and con, and was concerned about the change in formula and the different smell this created.  </li>
            <li> Keep as dry as possible after use to avoid waste.</li>
            <li> When I was in Minnesota, I preferred it over other soaps to protect my skin from getting dry.</li>
            <li> Came as expected and no package damage.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have since reordered twice and given a few bars away to family members with similar problems.</li>
            <li> Thank you, as expected.</li>
            <li> I DID indeed notice the new smell but it isn&#x27;t as bad as you&#x27;re led on to believe, it is slighty reminiscent of the old one but only a little bit.  </li>
            <li> If there is a negative it would be that the bar does not seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> We won&#x27;t use any other soap again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for 40+ years and never use any other at home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s long-lasting soap compared to other glycerine soaps that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t go mushy, like other glycerine soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you try Pears, I doubt you will want any other soap.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s made in India by a different (cheaper) manufacturing process, with a too-strong, not very pleasant, inferior perfume.</li>
            <li> I had gotten used to the new (and horrible) formula which is wrapped in cellophane inside the box, and which lasts half as long as the original soap, but I now find that the bars are 3.5 oz.</li>
            <li> I like this because it&#x27;s less expensive and lasts much longer than the other glycerin soap I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t use it in summer times as it will make me dark.</li>
            <li> and you can buy this In dollar stores for a lot less.  </li>
            <li> This was an odd move, given that this is (I believe) the longest-running product in the world, and given that people don&#x27;t like change.</li>
            <li> Why they&#x27;d mess with</li>
            <li> I read the negative reviews -- but also read that the company had been forced to change its loathsome new recipe due to customer complaint.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the reformulated Pears.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used Pears for a few years &amp; was looking forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;Unilever, for shame.</li>
            <li> but it is obvious that they changed the whole ingredient list and are now making something horrible under that &#x27;English license.</li>
            <li> Why it is not available in the USA or even on the internet, I can&#x27;t imagine.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day, everyday, and have for years.  </li>
            <li> You will receive 20% less product than you paid for!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice any of the negative things expressed by other commentators.</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;m stuck with the extra crap they&#x27;ve added to the new (Indian) formula.</li>
            <li> I am a health professional with an additional background in the hard sciences, and I must say that there is needless controversy over the &amp;#34;chemicals.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Not very nice at all!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slightly less than a year ago (late September 2009)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this soap for over 20 years and can&#x27;t believe the awful changes that unilever has made to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the product was unchanged for 200 years but now required the addition of these items?</li>
            <li> I usually buy Pears in Dollar Tree.</li>
            <li> left it in the bathroom for a while, thinking that will read on line about this soap - because of the smell I thought that I bought something wrong, something industrial, maybe for laundry...</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way.  </li>
            <li> I had not read the reviews of this product before purchasing it, and frankly, I can&#x27;t understand the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> People are needlessly afraid of &amp;#34;chemicals&amp;#34; that are present in virtually all retail toiletries.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pears, I am no longer a customer and unhappy with the bars I have left over and cannot use.</li>
            <li> To me the aroma is pleasantly subtle and not over powering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as disappointed as some other reviewers because this brand of glycerin soap still beats the heavily scented creamy soaps.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;ve added a bunch of unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li> It used to be made at home, using lard and lye (sodium hydroxide), an extremely caustic substance.</li>
            <li> I opened it and was greeted by the horrible new odor!</li>
            <li> The new formula is terrible.</li>
            <li> As a faithful PEARS user for over 50 years I can state emphatically the new formula is HORRIBLE!!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying the horrific \\&quot;New</li>
            <li> Needless to say I won&#x27;t be buying it again</li>
            <li> Over the years, in the USA, it has proved difficult to find.</li>
            <li> and I had to leave the boxes outside for a day after removing and disposing of the nasty smelling plastic.</li>
            <li> I was wrong, but I decided to keep the 12 bars anyway.</li>
            <li> Now the dimple is artificial, shaped in a mold.</li>
            <li> Pears is now virtually impossible to find in a US store, so I&#x27;ve been ordering it for years.  </li>
            <li> It is seriously pesticide smelling and horrible.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, if I take them out of their cellophane bags well before I want to use them, they won&#x27;t smell so bad.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so bad I had to air out the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I bet Unilever uses the wrapper to disguise the disgusting smell.</li>
            <li> Now the soap has a horrible industrial tar smell and melts away to nothing just sitting in the soap dish.</li>
            <li> A disgusting \\&quot;update\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Opened the box - terrible smell!!!</li>
            <li> Believe the horrible reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whatever I bought, it was horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The scent is better now.  I agree that for a while, they were producing bars that smelled like bug spray.  Now it smells a bit minty.</li>
            <li> I used to use the original Pear&#x27;s soap for years but this one is quite different... for those of you who don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s because the original Pear&#x27;s soap is a 200-year old brand that used to be made in ENGLAND but about 4 years ago the owners ( I don&#x27;t know which company it was ) sold it to a conglomerate in INDIA and that&#x27;s why this once great brand has been ruined... quality control was destroyed by the new owners, who didn&#x27;t take the time to invest the  money, investment, or love involved in keeping this soap what it was and retaining their loyal customers.  I DID indeed notice the new smell but it isn&#x27;t as bad as you&#x27;re led on to believe, it is slighty reminiscent of the old one but only a little bit.  As for the soap itself I would only use it to clean my face but I notice this formulation doesn&#x27;t do the job well and my skin is drier when I use it.  Needless to say I won&#x27;t be buying it again and Pear&#x27;s is another casualty in the ongoing war worldwide known as globalization.</li>
            <li> Reminiscent of old England. Gentle fragrance from the moment you open the inner wrap. Wonderfully moisturizing. Keep as dry as possible after use to avoid waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this soap for over 20 years and can&#x27;t believe the awful changes that unilever has made to it. The wonderful fragrance is gone, replaced by an antiseptic smell. The bar doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long. And they&#x27;ve added a bunch of unnecessary ingredients. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the reformulated Pears. Frankly, it doesn&#x27;t even deserve the name.</li>
            <li> original formula for 200 years had 8 ingredients.  Now it has 24!&lt;br /&gt;it is not delightfully mild smelling or long lasting.  I urge you to research this product before buying.  I learned the hard way.  It is not what you have fond memories of.  Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;i used this bar once &amp; had to get rid of it.  I hadn&#x27;t used Pears for a few years &amp; was looking forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;Unilever, for shame.</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews, both pro and con, and was concerned about the change in formula and the different smell this created.  However, I have been unable to buy my beloved Pears Soap for a couple of years now and I missed it dearly.  With reservation, I bought the 12 pack and I&#x27;m glad I did.  Yes, the smell isn&#x27;t the same as the old English soap but it does the job.  That wonderful squeeky clean feel after you shower is worth the change.  It&#x27;s kind to your skin and that&#x27;s what matters.  To those of you who are undecided, I&#x27;d say go ahead and try it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap - have purchases it 3 times already and when I run out I will do so again!!  Can&#x27;t get it anywhere else!!!</li>
            <li> The description of this Pears soap is deliberatley misleading, as it uses the word \\&quot;original\\&quot; which makes you believe it is the original 9 component formula of Pears soap. It is  not....and you can buy this In dollar stores for a lot less.  I was disppointed when i received the order after having checked other AmericaRx products elsewhere on Amazon which show the original formula as part of their description.  That led me to belive I was buying the same product, which it is not.  Do not waste time and money on buying this, which is the new formula with added chemical ingredients.The real original formula box has 2 soap bars on it and states it is Hypo-allergenic and non-comedogenic.</li>
            <li> We have used it for years and love this soap.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, speedy service</li>
            <li> Slightly less than a year ago (late September 2009) I was getting low on Pears, but couldn&#x27;t find it at my local Denver, Colorado, USA, area stores, so I bought a 12-bar carton from Amazon. Now I only have 4 bars left, and so today I bought some bars at a local Dollar Tree store. I did notice the packaging changes, but I didn&#x27;t realize the extent of the disaster until I got home, compared a new box with an old, and saw the strange new ingredient list. That motivated me to open a new box, which revealed the new plastic/cellophane wrapping.  I opened it and was greeted by the horrible new odor! It&#x27;s quite a nasty-smelling formulation, reminiscent of some kind of insecticide or industrial cleaning product. I bet Unilever uses the wrapper to disguise the disgusting smell. I immediately returned the bars. Unfortunately, this probably means that Amazon also no longer has the old formula, unless a savvy and honest seller specifically says that they have the original product. Such a shame for a great 220-year-old brand, which Unilever has totally ruined. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying the horrific \\&quot;New Pears\\&quot; formula.</li>
            <li> I found Pears soap in New York City in 1979, when I moved there from Geneva, Switzerland.  It was the most satisfactory soap I&#x27;d ever used.  But when I moved to Seattle in 1981, it wasn&#x27;t available locally, life intervened, and I gave up looking for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have lived in Mexico for the last 17 years.  One day, I was tooling around Amazon looking at books, and discovered Pears soap!  I immediately ordered it and I&#x27;m very excited about using it again.  My sister in Texas is holding it for me, along with some books.  We will pick it up in a week when we drive up to visit and I&#x27;m looking forward to experiencing that clean, fresh fragrance again.</li>
            <li> I love this hand soap</li>
            <li> Great soap at a great price....have used it for years but seems to have disappeared in brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> I first tried Pears in 1973, when I lived in the UK. I have very sensitive skin, but found it gentle, and I adore the fragrance. Over the years, in the USA, it has proved difficult to find. Most drugstore chains do not carry it. I was pleased to discover it in the 99 cent stores, but it was not that cheap - a dollar a bar. But I was very happy to be able to recreate the experience of using a mild, gentle, soap that was actually quite long-lasting. I was pleased to see that Amazon sells a dozen bars for considerably less than my local discount stores. I had not read the reviews of this product before purchasing it, and frankly, I can&#x27;t understand the negative reviews. There are no soaps that are &amp;#34;all natural.&amp;#34; Does anyone here know how soap is made? It used to be made at home, using lard and lye (sodium hydroxide), an extremely caustic substance. People are needlessly afraid of &amp;#34;chemicals&amp;#34; that are present in virtually all retail toiletries. I am a health professional with an additional background in the hard sciences, and I must say that there is needless controversy over the &amp;#34;chemicals.&amp;#34; I find many people similarly terrified of the substances of vaccines, and they shouldn&#x27;t be. If you have a particular sensitivity or allergy to one of the components of this soap, your point is well taken, but this will not be true for everyone. If that were so, the product would never have made it to market. In addition, is only recently that full disclosure of the constituents of such products was mandated, so perhaps Pears has not changed as much as you think it has.</li>
            <li> Pears may have changed the soap formula, but it has the same gentle and refreshing lather and cleaning power. The new formula has a bit of a medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap for bathing, but I can&#x27;t always find it in the drugstores, so I rely on being able to buy a few bars at a time.&lt;br /&gt;This company had the best price and they were fast.</li>
            <li> We love it! It&#x27;s the only thing we use. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> worth it for the deal.</li>
            <li> I love Pears soap-go glad I found it on the internet....</li>
            <li> The original Pears soap had a wonderful, clean feeling and fresh smell. I have used it for more than 40 years, since I was a baby. This soap came from England. Now the soap has a horrible industrial tar smell and melts away to nothing just sitting in the soap dish. This new soap is made in India under English license - don&#x27;t know what they mean by this but it is obvious that they changed the whole ingredient list and are now making something horrible under that &#x27;English license.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have switched to another wonderful soap, an old timer manufactured in Spain. Will cry if they change that one too. I cannot really use a lot of other soaps, sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pears, I am no longer a customer and unhappy with the bars I have left over and cannot use.</li>
            <li> Pears is now virtually impossible to find in a US store, so I&#x27;ve been ordering it for years.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy it, as it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin prone to dryness and the winter itchies, but it&#x27;s still disappointing that they&#x27;ve added more chemicals/ingredients to it in the last few years.  Why they&#x27;d mess with a 100+year old successful formula is beyond me, but whatever.  It&#x27;s still one of the best and most affordable soaps around for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love Pears Transparent Original Soap, don&#x27;t need to use bath oil with this soap and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> Purchased originally in England for my son as he swears that it helps his mild acneso it was nice to find it in bulk at a great price on Amazon. My Father has used this soap for years and many reviews on here comment on the change of fragrance and formulation but for me it smells the same as it did as when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> I have special ordered this product because I like the way it cleanses without drying my skin and its hit or miss in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish they were a little bigger but I am stocked up well with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the value.</li>
            <li> Great soap. As good as Nutrogena without the high price. Can&#x27;t find in store anymore like all products that I love.</li>
            <li> Pears soap is wonderful for its smoothness, mildness, not removing skin oils, and not leaving any oily feel. It also lasts a great deal longer than other transparent soaps such as Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that in the old days, decades ago, Pears made in England was an even better product, with a nicer perfume. Now it&#x27;s made in India by a different (cheaper) manufacturing process, with a too-strong, not very pleasant, inferior perfume. The original English soap was dried slowly, which naturally produced the big dimple on each side of the soap bar. Now the dimple is artificial, shaped in a mold.</li>
            <li> Very good for people with dry skin, or for people who want to avoid dry skin. This is the first time I ordered from Amazon rather than going to a retail outlet.</li>
            <li> Of all soaps I have ever used, this one is the best.  I sometimes feel itchy after a shower (dermatologists have a name for this), but with Pears this is minimized.  Only problem is that the bar doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> For many hears I have had an old Pears Soap advertisement page out of the Harper&#x27;s Weekly magazine from the late 1800s.&lt;br /&gt;It was framed and in my bathroom for years with a bar of Pears soap in a small dish beside it.  I moved into a house with a massive bathroom and had the advertisement enlarged to hang over the tub.  The ad has a beautiful woman in a footed tub reaching over for a bar of Pears soap from a huge stacked display by the tub.  Truthfully, the soap smells a little bit like medicine, but it is attractive and I needed several bars to re-enact the ad.  I love the look and have always been pleased with whatever I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> These bars are of the sams qualith they had been when I was a child. I will keep buying them.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap in the world. It reminds me of growing up in South Africa where only my richer neighbors used it.</li>
            <li> Bought pear soap because it was reccomended to us.  WOW.. We won&#x27;t use any other soap again. Washs clean amd rinses off great.</li>
            <li> Still my favorite soap even if the ingredients have changed and the scent has changed a little.  I&#x27;m not as disappointed as some other reviewers because this brand of glycerin soap still beats the heavily scented creamy soaps.</li>
            <li> These seem to be a Pears soap knock off. They are not Pears Original Soap, and certainly don&#x27;t smell like it. Also the packaging came smelling so strongly of mothballs and I had to leave the boxes outside for a day after removing and disposing of the nasty smelling plastic. I would not buy these again.</li>
            <li> We love this soap. Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap...not too scented and gentle, and the price was excellent.I highly recommend this very good product.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I ordered, and I am happy I got it at this great price!</li>
            <li> Smells great and does wonders for my normally dry skin.</li>
            <li> It takes me back to my childhood ,this is a hard soap that lasts longer and has a very pleasant aroma, does not get mushy.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this soap. It&#x27;s a high quality bar that lasts a while, but the best part is the smell. Sort of a frankincense and camp fire mix? My only complaint is the ingredient list. As we move towards more natural products, I was very disheartened to see Pears begin including a ton of chemicals (preservatives, detergents, stabilizers, etc) beginning in 2009. I&#x27;m not sure why the product was unchanged for 200 years but now required the addition of these items? I&#x27;m tempted to lower the star rating further because of this. Until I find a more natural product that smells as good, though, I plan to keep using this.</li>
            <li> Pears soap&#x27;s formula has changed as of 2009.  It is no longer the wonderful, natural product we all knew and loved.    Original ingredients: Sodium Palmitate, Natural Rosin, Glycerine, Water, Sodium Cocoate, Rosemary Extract, Thyme Extract, Pears Fragrance Essence.    New ingredients: Sorbitol, Aqua, Sodium Palmate/stearate, Sodium Palmkernelate, Sodium Rosinate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, PEG-4, Alcohol, Glycerin, Perfume, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Meta Bisulfite, Etidronic acid, Tetra Sodium EDTA, BHT, Cl 12490, Cl 47005, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Cinnamal, Eugenol, Limonene, Linalool.</li>
            <li> None better. Pay the extra money and get quality unsurpassed by none.</li>
            <li> This HAS to be the stinkiest and nastiest soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  No wonder it&#x27;s sold mostly in dollar stores.  So strange that folks say it &amp;#34;used to be&amp;#34; a fine soap with a nice odor.  Why would they change it?  Also strange that the best soap I&#x27;ve ever found was the WHITE PEARS - oval in all directions and stamped with the Queen&#x27;s Royal stamp on both the soap and the box.  This was in England about 15 years ago ... it was quite common, relatively inexpensive, and it was fantastic.  Why it is not available in the USA or even on the internet, I can&#x27;t imagine.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful bar soap that lasts and doesn&#x27;t just become a sloppy mess in the soap dish. Very mild, yet cleanses and deodorizes the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels very different than it use to. if it aint broke...</li>
            <li> This is always a favorite of ours.  Came as expected and no package damage.</li>
            <li> I ordered Pears soap because it is one of only two soaps I can use -- period! That was the old formulation, of course. There was absolutely nothing in the description telling me the formula had changed and Pears now contains a plethora of chemicals as well as perfume. Which I cannot tolerate at all, being severely asthmatic. I noticed the cellophane wrapper when I opened it but didn&#x27;t think anything about it. Then I used it in my morning shower. The smell is enough to bring me to my knees, gasping for breath. It is seriously pesticide smelling and horrible. I am returning my order to Amazon today.    If anyone finds a source for the great OLD Pears soap, please post it on here! For those of us with severe allergies, this is a catastrophe!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years and I love it. Every time I try another soap, I end up coming back to Pears.</li>
            <li> My grandmother died recently, and during the process of dispersing and donating her things, we came across an old travel soap keeper. Within was a bar of Pears soap, likely from last century. I will keep this bit of wonderful smelling and pleasing-to-look-at memorabilia for as long as I live, probably. It will remind me that there used to be a soap that smelled divine, lathered nicely, and didn&#x27;t make my skin itch like an attack of fire ants. Meanwhile, I&#x27;ll continue to ignore this newly formulated, foul-smelling Pears, the one that burns like turpentine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pay $4.00 a bar at my local health food co-op for a soap that is kind to my skin. I would pay double for a bar of the Pears I used to know.</li>
            <li> I got onto Pears a long time ago and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.  Yes, the aroma has changed (not for the better, I fear--it smells a bit &amp;#34;medicine-y&amp;#34; now, although that abates some with use) but otherwise, it&#x27;s the same old Pears and my skin is very happy.  I&#x27;m glad I can get it in bulk from Amazon--much more economical.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap! No soap-scum residue. Light fragrance, not flowery. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The ad for this product shows a 4.4 OZ (125 g) package of PEARS hypoallergenic bar soap. The actual product you will receive is a 3.5 OZ (100 g) package of PEARS not hypoallergenic bar soap. You will receive 20% less product than you paid for!</li>
            <li> Always loved this soap.  Its clean and clear and gives the right amount of suds in our soft water.  Any ex-pat Brit who loved it from home will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good soap we have been buying Pears for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> This soap is now and has been a favorite - cleans well and lasts much longer than softer bar soaps.</li>
            <li> We have been using Pears soap for years and it is appropriate for everyone in the family.  It is hard to find it in stores, but ordering it by the dozen bars on the internet is easy and practical.</li>
            <li> The new formula is terrible. If you are used to the old Pears soap this will be a giant dissappointment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only soap I can use that doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch. Neutrogena got too expensive and I love the smell of rosemary.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I (foolishly) believed that it was POSSIBLE that these were some of the leftover orignal Pears. I was wrong, but I decided to keep the 12 bars anyway. Hopefully, if I take them out of their cellophane bags well before I want to use them, they won&#x27;t smell so bad. Still, I&#x27;m stuck with the extra crap they&#x27;ve added to the new (Indian) formula.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pears soap for over 20 years.  I had gotten used to the new (and horrible) formula which is wrapped in cellophane inside the box, and which lasts half as long as the original soap, but I now find that the bars are 3.5 oz. instead of 4.4 oz. What more can this wretched company do to destroy this wonderful soap? I am planning to write Consumer Reports which just this month did a story entitled, \\&quot;Packaging Gotchas,Mad at hard-to-open, shrinking, undersized, or overwrapped products.</li>
            <li> Fast, inexpensive, delivered to my house...can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, everyone loves Pears and the smell and apparently theres a new formula that everyone hates. I wanted to try the old one, but this seems like that tar-smelling one that everyone complains about. Ah well.</li>
            <li> This soap does a really good job.  It makes your skin feel nice and clean plus the fragrance is also enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my case of Pears Soap.  It has such a lovely scent and is so easy to use.  I have used it all my life,</li>
            <li> The absolute best soap for all skin types.  I have sensitive skin and this soap never cause problems.  It&#x27;s also nice to use a product that has been around since 1807.  I love the liquid hand soap too, but it is very difficult to find in the US (unless you wish to pay a premium for it).</li>
            <li> I used to live in England and became a fan of Pears soap, love the smell and the feel.</li>
            <li> As a child growing up in England my mother always used Pears soap. I love the smell of the original, have never tried any of the other fragrances. This will remind me of my mum!</li>
            <li> This is the Indian version of Pears which is supposed to be closer to the original Pears than the British version. hey, it works.</li>
            <li> Great to get this many bars at such a good price.</li>
            <li> I like this because it&#x27;s less expensive and lasts much longer than the other glycerin soap I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m a long-time user of this product.</li>
            <li> When I was in Minnesota, I preferred it over other soaps to protect my skin from getting dry. And it did protect well. But I wouldn&#x27;t use it in summer times as it will make me dark. Then I switch to the regular soaps that contain milk etc. I usually buy Pears in Dollar Tree.</li>
            <li> I like this soap a lot - mild, pleasant, works well, and looks cool (transparent/translucent) - and this was a good price on a fairly large quantity. Product and seller both recommended.</li>
            <li> I just opened on of my latest batch of Pear&#x27;s Soap and I didn&#x27;t notice any of the negative things expressed by other commentators. I&#x27;ve used this soap for 40+ years and never use any other at home. It&#x27;s gentle and mild and leaves no residue. To me the aroma is pleasantly subtle and not over powering. It arrived promptly and was well packed.</li>
            <li> As a faithful PEARS user for over 50 years I can state emphatically the new formula is HORRIBLE!! Upon release from it&#x27;s wrapper, it now releases a foul stench. It now aggravates my eczema where the original Pears actually relieved it. A disgusting \\&quot;update\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly pay twice the price to get the authentic product back on the market, there are so few really good bar soaps left. Any substitute suggestions are welcome.</li>
            <li> Is a joy to use, lathers well.  My wife likes how I smell after I shower with it. If there is a negative it would be that the bar does not seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> This is the way soap should be: translucent, free of perfumes and dyes and easy to hold. I love collecting beautiful, expensive soap from the best shops around the world. The problem has been that their scents can be overpowering. Pears is unique because it&#x27;s so radically simple. I find myself stockpiling Pears and putting a bar in every bathroom and sink in the house.</li>
            <li> Hello pears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rang your Australian supplier (Pental) on 03 92512311.&lt;br /&gt;To ask them if the original Pears soap is back.&lt;br /&gt;The person I spoke to sent me a 3 pack of Pears Transparent.&lt;br /&gt;The batch number is 1112B655.&lt;br /&gt;We opened the package, only to be set back with the strong chemical smell. Not very nice at all!&lt;br /&gt;So we gave it a try, 3 showers later and it was gone!&lt;br /&gt;We will never purchase it again!&lt;br /&gt;I am now asking you to please bring back the \\&quot;original\\&quot; pears transparent soap.&lt;br /&gt;The soap with the beautiful aroma that is darker than the new one and lasts for 28 showers!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;October 2013, and still we wait for the return of the ORIGINAL!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  People say they Pear&#x27;s has changed the manufacturing process but the soap works well for me.  I use it twice a day, everyday, and have for years.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this soap and my husband loves it.  He is allergic to most soaps and is delighted with Pears.  I like the way it smells and I&#x27;v always liked &amp;#34;see-through&amp;#34; soaps.</li>
            <li> A couple of years back Pears decided to reformulate its soap, including changing its distinctive scent. This was an odd move, given that this is (I believe) the longest-running product in the world, and given that people don&#x27;t like change. But once you get used to the new scent, or if you weren&#x27;t familiar with the old scent in the first place, this is excellent glycerine soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pears soap is free from animal products, which is important to those of us who are vegetarian or vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the scent pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s long-lasting soap compared to other glycerine soaps that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t go mushy, like other glycerine soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one of the famous features of this soap is that the sliver of old soap fits neatly into the hollow on a new bar, so that you don&#x27;t waste any of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is also very reasonable. Many of the glycerine soaps in my local health-food store are $5 or so per bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love Pears soap!  It&#x27;s better than Neutrogena and lasts longer.  Leaves my skin soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Speedy delivery, too!</li>
            <li> Used this soap since I was a boy, really like it ! Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> This soap feels good, gets to the oil on my face and gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite soap. Works great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> WHY do companies change the ingredients in long-time favorites? This soap smells so bad I had to air out the bathroom. It smells like industrial-strength floor cleaner. And the chemicals in the ingredients! What were they thinking?</li>
            <li> Bought for my son&#x27;s bathroom - recently he had a skin irritation, so I thought that a good bar soap will be better for his daily needs. Opened the box - terrible smell!!! left it in the bathroom for a while, thinking that will read on line about this soap - because of the smell I thought that I bought something wrong, something industrial, maybe for laundry... After reading reviews, the bar is going back to the store!!!!</li>
            <li> i really like the soap-however I found the exact same soap at the Dollar Store- for, you guessed it... a dollar each!!!!  The bottom line is-shop the Dollar Store first.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for a few years and I love it.  I use it mostly on my face and I believe it gives me a more youthful feel and look.  Great price also!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this soap for more than forty years!  It&#x27;s been increasingly difficult to find it in stores, though, and to find it at a good price.  The twelve bars from Amazon arrive in perfect condition, and will last you about twelve weeks, even if you are an avid user, as I am.  The price is a little more than you would pay at a discount store, but sometimes those stores are out of stock, have only a few bars, or have bars that are broken.  It&#x27;s well worth spending a bit extra to have the availability, quantity, and quality you want.  This soap is great for all skin types, for an all-over wash, just hands, or even for your face.  Once you try Pears, I doubt you will want any other soap.</li>
            <li> We have used this mild unscented soap for decades and keep going back to it as scented soaps create problems for our sensitive skin. Great as face soap, great in the shower.</li>
            <li> Although the box lists the product as being the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Pears soap, the product in the box definitely was not.  I believe that there is a certain amount of deceit on the part of the new Indian ownership of the company in listing the product as &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;.  It certainly was not the soap that I had been using for the last 40 years.</li>
            <li> Soap is Awesome and the delivery time was superior! Thanks</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel soft and clean!</li>
            <li> Believe the horrible reviews. I loved this soap when I first used it 25 years ago ... Loved it so much, in fact, that I went searching for it. I read the negative reviews -- but also read that the company had been forced to change its loathsome new recipe due to customer complaint. Because the words &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; were on the packaging and in the description, I was fooled into believing I was buying the original soap, or AT LEAST the improved &amp;#34;revised&amp;#34; recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever I bought, it was horrible. Someone said it smelled like Napalm, and I&#x27;m inclined to agree. Do not buy this. Trust me.</li>
            <li> The best soap there is!!</li>
            <li> Over a year ago I ordered this soap because it was recommended for those who have allergic reactions to many soaps. Since then, I have since reordered twice and given a few bars away to family members with similar problems. Obviously I have been pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that I am not allergic to.  Thank you for carrying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap since after my birth in 1939, having been introduced to it by a grandmother in St. Louis, Missouri.  I love it&#x27;s amber color, its smell and over all appearance of not having a lot of chemical ingredients, except a simple combination delighting me all these years.  Perhaps it&#x27;s just my personal history of this Pears Soap, but I do love it and give a bar as a gift on occasions.</li>
            <li> Thank you, as expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent shipping, great product, would buy again. A+++</li>
