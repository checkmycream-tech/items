            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>I really love this fragrance, I purchased 2 and when it runs out</li>
            <li>My grandmother had this in her bathroom cabinet and I tried some of it and fell in love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite scent from Bath &amp; Body Works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I talked my grandmother into letting me have the bottle. :)</li>
            <li>My favorite body spray.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in a timely fashion with nice packaging, personal touch, and good quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a heavier fragrance, more earthy and peaceful; not in any way fruity or flowery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for years and love it so much.</li>
            <li>just right delivered earlier than expected great value too</li>
            <li>Black Amethyst is my all time FAVORITE Bath and Body Works scent!</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing and a couple squirts can go a long way.</li>
            <li>The bottle can last forever if you use only a little--the scent is strong, but not overpowering, and distinctly sharp in a pleasant way.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The seller got it to me fast.</li>
            <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
            <li>The perfume itself is a scent I love, but may have been discontinued--I can&#x27;t find it anywhere other than online.</li>
            <li>Took a chance on ordering this as I&#x27;d never smelled this fragrance before however I was very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it was old and lost it&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mature but not old lady mature.</li>

            <li> This scent is absolutely delicious!  Wish there was a cologne so it would stick with me.</li>
            <li> I think this is my favorite body spray!  I had this in the Middle East and was told that people could smell me as I walked by.  Um...okay!</li>
            <li> This spray was discontinued at Bath &amp; Body works. I was happy to find it available with this seller. Every time I wear it I get compliments.</li>
            <li> The product was as described and I was very satisfied. It smells so good and I will definetly buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely fashion with nice packaging, personal touch, and good quality. The perfume itself is a scent I love, but may have been discontinued--I can&#x27;t find it anywhere other than online. The bottle can last forever if you use only a little--the scent is strong, but not overpowering, and distinctly sharp in a pleasant way. Was a bit bemused by the fact that my bottle came with snowflakes on it, but won&#x27;t question it. Would buy from this seller again. :)</li>
            <li> This smells like Heaven in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Bath and Body Works, why you no make it!!??</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
            <li> just right delivered earlier than expected great value too</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift at my granddaughters request.  I was also impressed with the speed the mist was sent.</li>
            <li> Love The Smell Of This It&#x27;s Refreshing !!!!</li>

            <li> Took a chance on ordering this as I&#x27;d never smelled this fragrance before however I was very pleasantly surprised.  I really love this fragrance, I purchased 2 and when it runs out I&#x27;ll purchase more!</li>
            <li> My grandmother had this in her bathroom cabinet and I tried some of it and fell in love. The scent is refreshing and a couple squirts can go a long way. I recommend it! It&#x27;s my favorite scent from Bath &amp; Body Works. I&#x27;m glad I talked my grandmother into letting me have the bottle. :)</li>
            <li> Black Amethyst is my all time FAVORITE Bath and Body Works scent! It&#x27;s mature but not old lady mature. I really like it. It&#x27;s a great mixture of scents. The seller got it to me fast. I didn&#x27;t have to wait long. Good condition. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for years and love it so much. It&#x27;s a heavier fragrance, more earthy and peaceful; not in any way fruity or flowery.  It isn&#x27;t sold in the stores anymore, so getting it online is the only option.</li>
            <li> Perfect conditions !!&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing....&lt;br /&gt;Must buy (:</li>
            <li> My favorite body spray. I love it! I don&#x27;t know what I do if they stop selling it!!</li>
            <li> The product had NO scent to it at all!! I have used this fragrance for years, so it isn&#x27;t just a case of &amp;#34;not what I expected it to be&amp;#34;! I had absolutely no scent! Maybe it was old and lost it&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
