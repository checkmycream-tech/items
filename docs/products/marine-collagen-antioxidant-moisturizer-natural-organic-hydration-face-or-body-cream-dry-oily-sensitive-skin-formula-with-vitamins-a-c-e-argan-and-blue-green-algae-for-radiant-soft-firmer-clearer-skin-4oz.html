    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was able to purchase this at a great discount. I love it! Winter has been harsh here on New England and I needed a good moisturizer for my dry skin. This moisturizer has a creamy, buttery texture but it is not too greasy. The scent is very pretty and clean; it reminds me of the ocean. I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> this cream is so amazing.....I love the way my skin feels after I use it and I have to say you need very little of it to cover a lot. I has a great and very pleasant scent and is easy to apply.....def. my new favorite body cream</li>
            <li> Super creamy makes my skin soft and glow</li>
            <li> Aniti-aging? I AM IN!! Yes I can say it.. my mom told me so. I remember as a young girl maybe 18-20 yrs old. My mom told me I better start taking care of my skin now or I would regret it. But hey I was young, nothing wrong with my skin except it was a little dry, so why worry right?  Well now somewhat 20yrs later, I think she might have been telling me something I should have taken a little mores serious. I still have dry skin, but now it&#x27;s 10- times dryer, and I have to be very careful what types of creams or lotions I use. If they are  scented strongly they burn. I really like Marine Collagen Body Cream for that fact and many others. I put the cream on everywhere cause I am dry everywhere, plus its winter and its always worse in winter. It did not seem greasy at all. it went on and absorbed into my skin with no greasy, yuky feeling. I have not been using this cream long but can tell I will be adding it to my daily routine now.  I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review  and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li> i received this product and was asked to give my honest opinion. i really enjoy the light smell that this body cream has. it hydrates your skin just perfectly. i love putting on body cream before bed but can&#x27;t stand when most products leave a greasy feel to your skin. that drives me crazy at night and i end up having to wash most products off. this product goes on great and leaves your skin silky smooth and grease-less. i have already noticed a glow and firmness to certain areas where i have used this body cream. i recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> This is a really great anti aging moisturizer. It comes in a very professional sleek jar. This cream is awesome. It is packed full of vitamins and minerals that make my face look so great. It moisturizes my face so it is soft and smooth. This is a nice creamy moisturizer so it doesn&#x27;t take a lot so this jar will last you awhile. It absorbs nicely into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy or oily. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face! Best face cream I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product, and I&#x27;m already loving it. With the winter doing it&#x27;s best to dry out my skin, I needed a really good moisturizing product for my face, and I was so happy to purchase this body cr&amp;egrave;me during a launching promotion. It is amazing. When I first opened the bottle, the cr&amp;egrave;me looked like a rich dense decadent pudding. I tried it on my hand first and then my face. It&#x27;s so rich and sinks right into your skin, and there is no greasy or sticky feeling afterwards; just softness. The smell is incredibly light and vaguely smells of ocean and lemon to me. You need very little to moisturize your whole face and neck, so this bottle is going to last. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone in great need of some major moisturizing.</li>
            <li> .. does seem to turn to water if you don&#x27;t use it for a couple of weeks.  Does feel good on your skin.  NOT oily!!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product and have been using it for 2 days now.  This is the time of year when my skin is itchy, dry and cracked.  I work in the health care field so I am constantly washing my hands leaving them cracked and sore.  The consistency of this anti-aging cream is like that of a body butter but it feels smoother when you put it on.  My skin absorbed it right away and feels soft and hydrated for the first time in 3 months.  Even my hands are showing signs of improvement after just 2 days of use. It has a wonderful mildly floral scent.  My sensitive skin did not react to any of the ingredients in this product which is rare for me.  A little goes a long way so I expect to get a lot of use out of Maroc 100 cream.  I&#x27;m so glad I was offered to purchase this product to try during a promotion to share my experience.  I am very impressed with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.  If you&#x27;ve never experienced dry skin you have no idea how frustrating that can be.  I&#x27;ve purchased many lotions and anti-aging creams; some work, some do not, but I&#x27;m always looking for “the perfect one.”  I got this product during a launch promotion and have been impressed at how quickly it absorbs, without making my skin sticky.  The cream hydrates my skin and smells fresh and clean.  The fragrance is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume or cologne.</li>
            <li> I received this product for review at a discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Body Creme Boost. I tend to have dry patches and creped skin in areas, so I am looking for this cream to help moisten and plump. The directions are very simple: apply Skin Fuel Cocktail daily for luxuriously soft, glowing and dewy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY 1; The cream does not have a flowery smell. I kind of like my creams to smell very girly, but then I am a girl. This cream has an organic smell, more like freshly mowed grass.  It is not gooey greasy either. It has more of a silky feeling to it. I tested it by using a small piece of fabric rubbed on the area I applied the cream and there is no oily residue transferred to the material. So, it stays on the skin really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY2; I am liking this cream even better. Once it is applied to the skin, the earthy smell gets much softer and is really very pleasant. I believe this cream is going to become one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY 6: Using the cream each day on the same area I can say I definitely see an improvement in the elasticity and smoothness of my skin. I am giving this product a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> This cream has a very rich, creamy and has a whipped texture. There is a strong rose or floral like scent that does linger for a little while on the skin. If you are sensitive to scents it might be a bit strong for you, but if not then this will be such an amazing body moisturizer for you that you can enjoy for the hydrating properties. It does leave a very silky smooth feeling that feels very nice on the skin and leaves my legs shiny and hydrated. A little bit of this cream goes a long way. With that said getting this cream in this sized jar you may think it is small for a body cream, but as I said a little goes a long was. You only need about a nickel sized amount per leg. I received this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and unbiased opinions</li>
            <li> Cannot stand the smell of this product. Gave me an instant migraine and the smell does not fade away. Seemed promising, a little thick on the skin though. Dont know how this product got such rave reviews. Guess the free/discounted product reviews dont make for unbiased opinions after all. Sellers were very nice though I could not take them up on their offer for a free replacement hence the three stars.</li>
            <li> Well, I just realized that this product contains phenoxyethanol which can cause skin irritation and I already have problems with psoriasis&lt;br /&gt;so I am not a happy camper. It says all organic as this chemical was deemed safe, but they are removing it from the safe list and companies that want to continue to be called organic will have to eliminate this ingredient. It is higly irritating to some poeple, so if you have sensitive skin, I would recommend avoiding it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my neck and body for a few days now. I really like how smooth it makes my skin feel. Honestly it is great, very rich and creamy. I enjoy the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it really. I ate when creams interfere with my perfume smell. I say give t a try, it is very hydrating!</li>
            <li> This cream is really nice. It really helped to smooth and soften my skin. It hydrated and moisturized wonderfully! It didn&#x27;t leave a film and wasn&#x27;t greasy at all. The cream absorbs quickly. It is made with marine and plant extracts and that really shines through in the fresh scent, its clean kind of like ocean and cucumbers. I am happy to purchase this through a discount promotion to review. I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> This creme is lovely and so nourishing! My hands have been dry and cracked from the brutal winters we have had in the Northeast. I have been keeping this near my kitchen sink to use on my dry hands and elbows, specifically. I can say that this creme definitely is helping with dishpan hands and dryness!  I have noticed a difference on my cuticles and the skin surrounding my nails which gets particularly  dry. This is a very generous sized jar; I imagine this will last quite a while. I was given the opportunity to test and try this product. Highly recommend based on quality and results.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick and rich cream.  I&#x27;ve been using it not only on my face but on my feet as well.  The winter has really taken a toll on them.  After about an hour with the cream and socks on, my feet were already feeling softer.  The smell is very nice and spa-like.  I was excited to purchase this during a promotional period.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and apply just before my routine make up. I love that it absorbs quick and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. It has no harsh odors and you dont need to use much. I definitely recommend this product. it came at such a great value.</li>
            <li> This is silky smooth and well worth the $ ...</li>
            <li> My skin is unbearably dry in the winter; my entire body is flaky and itchy. I have dry patches all over.  My husband also has very dry hands and elbows.  I&#x27;ve not been able to find a product that we love, because  they&#x27;re either too thin, too greasy, smell awful, etc.  This body cream is amazing!  It&#x27;s thick and feels silky as you rub it into your skin.  It only takes a small amount to leave your skin feeling hydrated and nourished, so a little will go a long way!  I have used other Maroc100 lotions before and have been completely satisfied, so I jumped at the chance to try this new product at a special price during a recent promotion. Again, I was not disappointed with his body cream!  My husband is loving the cream too.  After a few weeks the dry patches have almost disappeared and the itching has been eliminated.  My skin looks to healthy.  I love the natural ingredients: shea butter, green tea, natural oils and other all natural marine ingredients; nothing artificial.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Impressed at the quality of lotion for the price. Works well!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a body cream with anti-aging benefits so when I was given the chance to try this during a promotion and give my honest opinion about the product I jumped at the chance.  All I can say is Wow!  This stuff is amazing.  It feels great on my skin and smells wonderful...it is not overpowering at all but a nice subtle relaxing fragrance.  It absorbs right into my skin and is not greasy or wet.  I just put some on my hands and I am type...if that is any indication of the fact that it is not greasy I don&#x27;t know what is.  The consistency is amazing.  I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it...kind of like butter.  My skin is so dry this time of year and I have been using this since I received it.  I have noticed a huge difference in my skin and I have tried everything...even body OILS and nothing has made a change like this.  That is the immediate pay off.  The long term pay off is the marine collagen that will help with firmness and suppleness.  I will use this sparingly and hide it from my husband.  He can use all of the other body creams and lotions I have collected...this one is ALL MINE!</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.  I was happy to get it during a launch promotion.  I live in MN and the cold weather does a number on skin.  My package was delivered to my work, and I promptly opened it and used it on my cheeks.  It&#x27;s not an overly thick....or very thin cream.  It took the tightness away, and smells good too.  I have also used this out of the shower on my arms and shoulders.  It&#x27;s not greasy, but to be fair, my skin has been so dry, it soaks right in.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream!! Makes my hands and entire body feel wonderful. Only problem is the price, much too expensive for me to keep buying 😞. Bummer!!!</li>
            <li> I get really bad dry and cracked skin in the winter since it is so dry and cold where I live so I am always on the lookout for good moisturizers!  So I jumped on this when I was given the chance to try out this moisturizer at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion!  It works awesomely!  I keep it on my bedside table so that I can just reach for it in the morning and at night when I am getting ready!  It has truly helped to get rid of the itchy, dry spots that I have gotten throughout the winter!  I also really enjoy that all the ingredients are plant based and natural.  The only thing that kinda gets me is that once you take some out of the pot it gets kinda watery and you have to rub it in just a little bit more than other thicker moisturizers BUT it works way better than any of the thicker moisturizers that I own so I can make do with that!  I am really enjoying my skin looking and feeling healthier since I have started using this cream!  I also enjoy the scent of it!  It has a very clean and fresh scent that just makes me think I am getting better ingredients.  There is definitely no perfumes in it which can actually work against your moisturizer and dry your skin out more!  I will definitely be buying more of this when my pot runs out!</li>
