            <li>Ahhhhh I love this perfume so happy to find it here for such a good price</li>
            <li>(summer is pretty good)-</li>
            <li>Love, love love the super floral scent.</li>
            <li>Definitely love the sweet, but not over powering smell.</li>
            <li>this fragrance is the most evident /forward scent regarding this Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and elegant :)</li>
            <li>This is already the second bottle of this product that I am using and am still not bored with it coz it smells so good..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to get something that you&#x27;ll really appreciate like Bulgari Rose Essentielle, Channel Chances, Versace (pink) Angel by Tierry Muegler, Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Calvin Klein</li>
            <li>Love this product, have ordered before - the first one the sprayer didn&#x27;t work luckily I still had old bottle</li>
            <li>I think its the right balance of everything</li>
            <li>The scent is light and does not fade quickly, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, I bought this for 25, when all the perfume shops in my area are selling the smaller size of this for way  more.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long...</li>
            <li>The perfume box was wrapped in plastic, which I really like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s leaking so much when I use it.</li>
            <li>I completely love this perfume and I paid 3x less on Amazon than the MSRP price in a retailer store.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough that it would last until the end of the day but light enough that you will not fill-up the room or overwhelm the people around you with the smell!</li>
            <li>The package looked brand new and the perfume smelled the way it should.</li>
            <li>I mean they smell great and last long.</li>
            <li>Have always loved this fragrance but unfortunately the nozzle was leaking and couldn&#x27;t use it properly.</li>
            <li>Scent was exactly what was provided by other reviewers.</li>
            <li>I like sweet fragrances but do not like the extremely fruity or extremely flowery perfumes..</li>
