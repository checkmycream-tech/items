            <li>washes like Listerine and the ultrasound just was too much for the little bit of enamel that I had left on my teeth.</li>

            <li> Great! My dentist office told me to use it and was charging me 40.00 for the bottle! Then I got smart and went to Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is so great! 15.00  for the same bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Product is great!</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy with this rinse.  I could not use acid rinses or toothpastes since my last teeth cleaning.  My teeth had become too sensitive.  It was the first time I had my teeth cleaned using ultrasound.  I found out that I probably already had enamel loss form using acid toothpastes and acid mouth washes like Listerine and the ultrasound just was too much for the little bit of enamel that I had left on my teeth. I had gone online and searched acid content of common brand names of toothpastes and mouthwashes and found that CariFree CTx3 has a really high ph rating; This means that it is not at all acidic. So I found some non acid toothpaste and started using the CariFree rinse with it besides flossing of course.  My mouth feels great.  My teeth shine and are slippery again so that every meal doesn&#x27;t stick to my teeth.  The CartiFreeCTx3  did all of this, not the toothpaste.  I will never stop using CariFree.  I have found my pot of gold.  Thanks to the makers for making it.</li>
            <li> If you want a cleaner mouth use this. For added help also use the tooth paste. My dentist had me buy this it&#x27;s the same cost in his office as on here. Brush your teeth and wake with a clean mouth!! Such a great feeling.</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel healthier and cleaner longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay so much if I didn&#x27;t feel like it works better than anything thing else.</li>
            <li> My dentist introduced me to CariFree. I love it</li>
            <li> No problem with order. Came promptly.</li>
            <li> Stained my teeth YELLOW.  Can&#x27;t get the stain off my teeth and it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve done different with my routine.  Apparently, after doing a google search on &amp;#34;Carifree stained teeth&amp;#34;, I found other Amazon reviews saying the same thing, but for some reason it was removed (shady). See for yourself: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MX6GLX7S29B1</li>
            <li> Was using Listerine and Act my whole life until dentist had me switch to CTx3 because of the acidity of my saliva.  Those mouthwashes are very acidic which eats away your enamel.  The fact that it is PH neutral and has xylitol (bacteria cannot break it down so they die) is unique and exactly what a mouthwash should be.  Been using it for two months now and I love it.  Only downside is how expensive it is, but one bottle lasts me about a month - 1.5 months using once / day.</li>
            <li> Use it daily as part of my dental care routine - have considerable bone loss and gum recession and feel this helps with plaque and leaves a clean, fresh feeling in my mouth.  Have used it daily for a year and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my endodontist after he (sadly) had to extract two teeth (gone bad, undetected, under crowns).  I only wish I had known about this product sooner, but am thrilled to have it available now.  Tastes great!</li>
            <li> Fine, dentist told me to get because it is glutton free, and a product he uses. Good taste.&lt;br /&gt;The top is something of a testy thing though. Think it&#x27;s on and shake it and bam  all over the place! The top is hard to get off and then hard to get on.</li>
            <li> Fast on time shipping.  This was recommended for my daughter from her dentist. She enjoys the flavor and that there&#x27;s no burn when she&#x27;s rinsing. We are pleased with the item. She also uses the toothpaste to accompany rinse and we recommend them both!</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  Have bought it several times and will keep on buying it.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is great. I love the flavor and the xylitol. Not sure about the price, though.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to this product! I bought the gel and the rinse and my mouth has completely broken out in canker sores!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works great. Recommended by my dentist.  Really helped me.</li>
            <li> Burns at least as bad as Listerine. Good ingredients though if this isn&#x27;t a problem for you.</li>
