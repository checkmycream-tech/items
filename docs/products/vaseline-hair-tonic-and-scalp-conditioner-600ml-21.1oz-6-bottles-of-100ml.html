            <li>My father-in-law loves it and was so happy to get the hair tonic!</li>
            <li>One of the best things it does is&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good hair oil .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good hair food ...</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED VASELINE HAIR TONIC FOR YEARS, IT IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>A great product for scalp treatment.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Great Product.  </li>
            <li>good shine</li>
            <li>For what it does, it is quite good.</li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>He has been using it for many years and it great for him.</li>
            <li>A nice product.  </li>
            <li>I got this quickly and in great condition from the shipper.</li>
            <li>It would be more effective to just buy plane mineral oil / hypo-allergic baby oil.</li>
            <li>Same wonderful hair tonic as manufactured by Suave.  </li>
            <li>It has a stringent, almost medicinal scent, which I would be okay with except it hangs on for hours.</li>
            <li>But it is not what most tonic users expect.</li>
            <li>I used to use it but have not been able to find it for some time.  </li>
            <li>Glad to get it.</li>
            <li>He has used this for many years and was searching for it.  </li>
            <li>He will be set for many years now.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>The hair tonic has proven to be very effective and gentle on his hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon and their exceptional delivery that VHT was delivered to my dad this week in St. Louis, 9 days before the Xmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The performance of the product otherwise is fine, but like others have said, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a product.</li>
            <li>I doubt it had that terribly cheap fragrance.</li>
            <li>I dont understand why its not so widely available</li>
            <li>My dad has experienced the same scenario.</li>
            <li>So primarily for those who want the &amp;quot;wet&amp;quot</li>
            <li>WHEN MY ORDER ARRIVED THE PACKAGE WAS FILLED WITH SPILLED OIL.</li>
            <li>I wish it was still available in the U.S..</li>
            <li>So it is unique.</li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger 3 Purposes comes to mind, and so does Jeris with Oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonics for the scalp (dandruff), with mild hold</li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger&lt;br</li>
            <li>He says that he will have to live another 80 years to use both bottles:)</li>
            <li>but I am sure he will be surprised that I did get not just one bottle of it but TWO!</li>
            <li>(but no shine or sheen), fresh scent&lt;</li>
            <li>This is exactly like the Vaseline Hair tonic I used as a youth.</li>

            <li>It makes hair oily and it DOES weight it down because it has too many ingredients for a simple tonic (more ingredients than baby oil even).</li>
            <li>USA stopped manufacturing and hard to find; however, Amazon had good selection of containers and prices.  </li>
            <li>Some people don&#x27;t really know the difference between hair tonics.</li>
            <li>In fact, Vaseline Hair tonic is not a tonic at all but really a brilliantine disguised as a hair tonic.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not something I would use a lot since I don&#x27;t really do the &amp;quot;wet&amp;quot;</li>
            <li>REAL HARM DONE,</li>
            <li>My husband had been looking for Vaseline  hair tonic for awhile and was very happen to receive the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dolores Hernandez</li>
            <li>and it is very similar to Brylcreem and &#x27;Groom and Clean&#x27;.</li>
            <li>But if you use Brylcreem, Groom and Clean or Three Flowers Brilliantine, definitely give this a whirl.</li>
            <li>with little hold but conditioning to the hair, soft hair, nice scent and</li>
            <li>am curious to know if the old product was better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>I waited a long time to find this item and it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>This new product just like the old product we used to buy in USA in 60s and 70s.  </li>
            <li>Luckily the other item was not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Last but not least, it is MADE IN INDIA.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to locate and get the Vaseline Hair Tonic in other parts of the world vs. in the US.</li>
            <li>and I searched high and low the whole northeast and southern area, but for the past 6-7 months we could not locate the oil anywhere.</li>
            <li>ONLY PROBLEM WITH MY ORDER WAS THAT THE TWO BOTTLES WERE SHIPPED WITH THERE TOPS LOOSE AND CAUSED THE PACKAGE TO GET SOILED AND THE POST OFFICE HAD TO TAKE PROTECTIVE ACTION TO PROCESS THE PACKAGE IN A PLATIC PROTECTIVE BAG.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s the only hair tonic that works for my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My complaint is &amp;#34; it was very over-priced and unavailable in local stores in the USA!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was doing research on what men used in the 1940s to imitate the classic hairstyle of the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of the product,and it suits my needs.  </li>
            <li> Of course you guys that don&#x27;t have long hair have no need of it.</li>
            <li> your getting some grey hair</li>
            <li> it darkens the grey.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In one of the reviews, I had read that someone&#x27;s gray hair started turning black with regular use of the Vaseline Hair Tonic.</li>
            <li> have seen this problem in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> You just need a little dab to keep your hair from getting dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> The scent is very minimal, almost non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> look, but sometimes a little used can make some difference.</li>
            <li> My dad uses this product everyday and loves it .  </li>
            <li> JUST A FEW DROPS MAKES ALL THE&lt;br /&gt;DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li> Frankly, I was appalled at how much the buyer paid for what is essentially mineral oil + fragrances.</li>
            <li> with maximum hold, with shine, but may make hair feel icky due to the holding power, little to no scent:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> The other ingredients are a stabilizer + a bunch of plant-derived substances commonly used as cosmetic fragrances (and also as insect repellants, so I guess you won&#x27;t have to worry about termites in your hair if you use this stuff)</li>
            <li> has 5 other ingredients besides mineral oil, and the fragrance is cheap and terrible.</li>
            <li> but it is a thick syrup type liquid.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to take approximately 3 plus weeks for delivery as the hair tonic is delivered from the UK.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s not wonderful.</li>

            <li> My dad uses this product everyday and loves it .  He has been using it for many years and it great for him.</li>
            <li> Same wonderful hair tonic as manufactured by Suave.  It&#x27;s the only hair tonic that works for my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product for years. I tried using mineral oil but it just wasn&#x27;t the same. This is exactly like the Vaseline Hair tonic I used as a youth. You just need a little dab to keep your hair from getting dry and brittle. They stopped selling this in the USA but this came from the UK via Amazon. Great product. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> The product is overpriced and so was the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;It has 5 other ingredients besides mineral oil, and the fragrance is cheap and terrible. No way can one apply some and go out into the world. It makes hair oily and it DOES weight it down because it has too many ingredients for a simple tonic (more ingredients than baby oil even). It would be more effective to just buy plane mineral oil / hypo-allergic baby oil. Last but not least, it is MADE IN INDIA.&lt;br /&gt;I am curious to know if the old product was better. I doubt it had that terribly cheap fragrance.</li>
            <li> A nice product.  Second time purchasing this.  The bottles leak, not a lot, but enough to make the bottle slippery and soak into the cardboard Amazon shipped  them in. Luckily the other item was not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen this problem in other reviews.  I thought once told they would figure out a way to fix the problem.  They definitely should.</li>
            <li> My father-in-law loves it and was so happy to get the hair tonic! He says that he will have to live another 80 years to use both bottles:)</li>
            <li> I got this quickly and in great condition from the shipper. The seller was terrific to work with, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to do business with them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product, however, left something to be desired. It has a stringent, almost medicinal scent, which I would be okay with except it hangs on for hours. The performance of the product otherwise is fine, but like others have said, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a product. There are lots of others with oils which have a nicer scent (Lucky Tiger 3 Purposes comes to mind, and so does Jeris with Oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s not wonderful.</li>
            <li> This was mailed to our house to give to a housebound relative. Frankly, I was appalled at how much the buyer paid for what is essentially mineral oil + fragrances. The product is manufactured by Hindustan Unilever in India and per the label, the ingredients are mineral oil, perfume, benzyl benzoate, citronellol, geraniol, limonene and linalool. If all you want is the shine and grease, mineral or baby oil will work. The other ingredients are a stabilizer + a bunch of plant-derived substances commonly used as cosmetic fragrances (and also as insect repellants, so I guess you won&#x27;t have to worry about termites in your hair if you use this stuff)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good hair oil .</li>
            <li> I dont understand why its not so widely available</li>
            <li> My dad has been using Vaseline Hair Tonic for over 60 plus years and cannot imagine a day without his hair&#x27;s beauty essential. It&#x27;s much easier to locate and get the Vaseline Hair Tonic in other parts of the world vs. in the US. The hair tonic has proven to be very effective and gentle on his hair and scalp. I cannot imagine seeing my dad&#x27;s hair with the proper settings of VHT. Interestingly enough, during his recent travels he ran out of his beloved hair tonic and I searched high and low the whole northeast and southern area, but for the past 6-7 months we could not locate the oil anywhere. Finally, I decided to give it a try on amazon and lo and behold, I located it. It was supposed to take approximately 3 plus weeks for delivery as the hair tonic is delivered from the UK. This was my Xmas surprise gift for my dad as he had given up on it. Thanks to Amazon and their exceptional delivery that VHT was delivered to my dad this week in St. Louis, 9 days before the Xmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one of the reviews, I had read that someone&#x27;s gray hair started turning black with regular use of the Vaseline Hair Tonic. My dad has experienced the same scenario. He has salt and pepper hair and he never dyed them. The quality and the results of the oil speak for itself. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t really know the difference between hair tonics. For example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonics for the scalp (dandruff), with mild hold (but no shine or sheen), fresh scent&lt;br /&gt;1. Pinaud Quinine&lt;br /&gt;2. Pinaud Portugal&lt;br /&gt;3. Jeris without oil&lt;br /&gt;4. Gabel&#x27;s Hair Tonic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonics with little hold but conditioning to the hair, soft hair, nice scent and good shine&lt;br /&gt;1. Jeris with oil&lt;br /&gt;2. Masters with oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonics with maximum hold, with shine, but may make hair feel icky due to the holding power, little to no scent:&lt;br /&gt;1. Vitalis and its knockoff brands (Rite-Aid, CVS, Walgreen knock off)&lt;br /&gt;2. Lucky Tiger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline hair tonic is different from any tonic I have used, as it has no alcohol at all and it is very similar to Brylcreem and &#x27;Groom and Clean&#x27;. In fact, Vaseline Hair tonic is not a tonic at all but really a brilliantine disguised as a hair tonic. It is designed to be almost like hair gel but it is a thick syrup type liquid. So primarily for those who want the &amp;quot;wet&amp;quot; look. So it is unique. The scent is very minimal, almost non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s not something I would use a lot since I don&#x27;t really do the &amp;quot;wet&amp;quot; look, but sometimes a little used can make some difference. For what it does, it is quite good. But it is not what most tonic users expect. But if you use Brylcreem, Groom and Clean or Three Flowers Brilliantine, definitely give this a whirl.</li>
            <li> Gives me the control I need.</li>
            <li> While this hair product is expensive, it is great for your hair and scalp.  I used to use it but have not been able to find it for some time.  Glad to get it.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND HAS USED THIS FOR YEARS AND WOULD&#x27;NT BE WITHOUT IT!!!  JUST A FEW DROPS MAKES ALL THE&lt;br /&gt;DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD AFTER EACH SHAMPOO!!!!  RECOMMEND HIGHLY!!!!!!!!!AAAAAAAA</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good hair food ...my kid loves it</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED VASELINE HAIR TONIC FOR YEARS, IT IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH MY ORDER WAS THAT THE TWO BOTTLES WERE SHIPPED WITH THERE TOPS LOOSE AND CAUSED THE PACKAGE TO GET SOILED AND THE POST OFFICE HAD TO TAKE PROTECTIVE ACTION TO PROCESS THE PACKAGE IN A PLATIC PROTECTIVE BAG. WHEN MY ORDER ARRIVED THE PACKAGE WAS FILLED WITH SPILLED OIL. I THEN REMOVED THE 2 BOTTLES AND WASHED THEM AND DISPOSED OF THE PACKAGING.&lt;br /&gt;NO REAL HARM DONE, BUT I THOUGHT I SHOULD REPORT IT ANYWAY TO IMPROVE QUALITY CONTROL.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was desired.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my Dad.  He has used this for many years and was searching for it.  I found it for him.  He will be set for many years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of the product,and it suits my needs.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I wish it was still available in the U.S..</li>
            <li> I waited a long time to find this item and it was worth the wait. A great product for scalp treatment. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give your hair any hold. I bought this because I was doing research on what men used in the 1940s to imitate the classic hairstyle of the past and I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than anything it will make your hair shine, but again...no hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it can be used to coat your hair over a pomade that has a weaker shine, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I respect it, but don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Because my husband was searching the stores for this product and couldn&#x27;t find it, I searched the internet to get it for Christmas for him He hasn&#x27;t opened his present yet but I am sure he will be surprised that I did get not just one bottle of it but TWO! My complaint is &amp;#34; it was very over-priced and unavailable in local stores in the USA!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My husband had been looking for Vaseline  hair tonic for awhile and was very happen to receive the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dolores Hernandez</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I was a kid then couldn&#x27;t find it after a while,thought they took it off market.  Glad I&lt;br /&gt;found it again. Of course you guys that don&#x27;t have long hair have no need of it. One of the best things it does is&lt;br /&gt;if your getting some grey hair and you put it on it darkens the grey. This stuff is great. It smells good too!!&lt;br /&gt;Dennis</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.  USA stopped manufacturing and hard to find; however, Amazon had good selection of containers and prices.  This new product just like the old product we used to buy in USA in 60s and 70s.  Thank you for stocking.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Just what I wanted and on ti!</li>
