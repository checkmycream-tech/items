            <li>I am now on the search for a replacement to yet another great product &#x27;they&#x27; decided needed revamping.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for sun exposure.</li>
            <li>but i am happy if it just protect from the sun.  </li>
            <li>you have a sun allergy like me, you too can know the amazing feeling of going out after 10AM without feeling like you&#x27;re in a rotisserie oven!</li>
            <li>Having access to a truly effective sunscreen, for me, has been like getting a superpower: The power to go out between the hours of 10AM and 3 PM, even in the summer!</li>

            <li>The most effective sunscreen is the one you will wear.  </li>
            <li>The most effective sunscreen is the one you will wear.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly with good level of spf</li>
            <li>Means you can carry it on the plane, but you are paying more for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many years.</li>
            <li>I love the Neova products I have using for about a year &amp;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Am enjoying the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any outstanding negatives.</li>
            <li>Love their products</li>
            <li>It protects my face as well as having anti-aging properties in it to help my skin look better.</li>
            <li>she didn&#x27;t recognize the brand, she OK&#x27;d</li>
            <li>Pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>My makeup stays so well on top of it.</li>
            <li>I had used it every day for years, and I&#x27;ve never found a better sunblock.  </li>
            <li>I love it annnnnnnnd have been using it for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this sunscreen for two years, it is very nice and protects my skin very well :)</li>
            <li>It goes on very easily and more transparently than the Eltas, and the smoothness of it makes it easier to get full coverage.</li>
            <li>This product offers great every-day sun protection with high-quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is the best product I found that goes smooth and not sticky in a very long time.</li>
            <li>The sunblock goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and fair</li>
            <li>it was not greasy and went on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage without the white film.</li>
            <li>This is light and blends in well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Neova was light,</li>
            <li>so light I didn&#x27;t think it would work.</li>
            <li>Fragrance free and does not have a tint which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t make me breakout, it just isn&#x27;t so fantastic that I can justify sticking with it.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin and who needs good skin protection.  </li>
            <li>Thanks NEOVA DNA.!!!</li>
            <li>A very nice daily moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li>exceptional for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>BEST SUNSCREEN, it doesn&#x27;t take much so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Choose the other new Neova product to truly replace the wonderful Ti-Silc we know and love.</li>
            <li>It felt like a normal, gentle moisturizer, but was a very effective block.  </li>
            <li>But living in Texas, the sun shines every month of the year and will blister you in the summer months, so you must take precautions, otherwise you will need to get way too familiar with a dermatologist after you pass the 30 mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has a ver clean feel.</li>
            <li>For those familiar to Z-Silc, it is much lighter than Z-Silc, while now more protective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Whether it is a true \\&quot;SPF 43\\</li>
            <li>Whether it is a true \\&quot;SPF 43\\</li>
            <li>Overall is good except too pricey.</li>
            <li>I used Neova&#x27;s Ti-Silc Sheer for seven or eight years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>No bad chemicals like paraben and it doesn’t make my skin oily.</li>
            <li>Were it not an exceptional product on that count, would deduct a star for the minuses set out above.  </li>
            <li>Were it not an exceptional product on that count, would deduct a star for the minuses set out above.  </li>
            <li>Love the high SPF too.</li>
            <li>great skin product for all year round.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it was cheap.</li>
            <li>At that point, I had tried almost every over-the-counter brand from Banana Boat to Neutrogena; if it said \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; on the label and cost more than $15, I tried it.  </li>
            <li>Neova has a reputation to maintain and this DNA Damage Control proves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money, sunscreen is not the place to skimp.</li>
            <li>so I purchased it right away.  </li>
            <li>This cream is very light and absorbs quickly with no white residue.  </li>
            <li>the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neova DNA Damage Control 43 is the next generation of zinc-based sunscreens and a far superior successor to Z-Silc.  </li>
            <li>Its great to hear people think your 10 years younger than you actually are!</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it turned out that Z-Silc was pretty good: it kept you from getting a sunburn, washed off easily, and, most importantly, didn&#x27;t anger the skin, unlike the sunscreens that used chemical barriers.  </li>
            <li>very light, feels like a regular lotion on your face</li>
            <li>Sunblock is so important to keep healthy young looking skin, this works, but you just got to remember to put this on every day in the morning and maybe some during the day especially if you are outdoors.</li>
            <li>First time I am using this product so time will tell which is always the reality with skin care products.</li>
            <li>Sellers if the products have consistently done well.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product feels and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>I use the Elta sunscreens quite a bit, partly because they&#x27;re a bit cheaper, but ultimately the Neova is my favorite for both face and body.</li>
            <li>The pleasantness of it ultimately encourages me to use it more</li>
            <li>Even better used over a vitamin C serum, for extra sun-protection and anti-aging boost.</li>
            <li>I’m on my 3rd bottle and absolutely love this face sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 3-4 years and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen because it is not greasy and it does not white out my face.  </li>
            <li>I used it but always had Neova in the back of my mind because it is more emollient</li>
            <li>Go with something more natural with less chemicals that will offer better protection.  </li>
            <li>As to zinc-based sunscreens in particular, apply them from top of your face down -- something about the grain of the skin such that this looks better when applied than trying to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As to zinc-based sunscreens in particular, apply them from top of your face down -- something about the grain of the skin such that this looks better when applied than trying to rub in.    </li>
            <li>I recommend for every lady who cares for their skin and wants to protect from all sun damage.</li>
            <li>Since it is a bit liquidy it comes out of the tube a bit too fast.  </li>
            <li>Very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I have a history of Melanoma and this works very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why Neova would discontinue such a perfect product and add irritating ingredients to a sunblock for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Then, a couple years ago, thanks to a recommendation from my dermatologist, I discovered the new crop of zinc-based sunscreens.</li>
            <li>few years ago, a dermatologist recommended Z-Silc (rated SPF 30) as a good daily wear sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>My MD advised me to use this product daily, since I have been using it I have avoided getting any extra sun damage and it has even made my skin better.</li>
            <li>too bad they took away the old formula that worked better and was cheaper to buy, this one still works but not as good and pricier.</li>
            <li>Goes on like a normal mosturizer.</li>
            <li>I try a lot of products like this and don&#x27;t like most because they are too heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>&quot; one just to try something new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a disappointment, because Neova&#x27;s discontinued Z-Silc was perfect.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and cannot tolerate the anti-aging ingredients in this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for sensitive skin, though pricey.</li>
            <li>In the past, I had tried many brands of sunscreen on my face, but broke out with acne every time, which deterred me from using sunscreen on my face.  </li>
            <li>Other sunscreens, esp the higher SPF ones, would make my skin and makeup very oily.</li>
            <li>this is totally clear and a bt shinier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, if you have sensitive skin, this might be your sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>In summary, if you have sensitive skin, this might be your sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it runs havoc with my naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li>Light feel not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne-prone skin and have had no problem with any Neova product.</li>
            <li>Dr. Marcus of Redondo Beach,Ca used this and while the Neutrogena that I had used was ok it always felt heavy especially with humidity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Separately, would also acknowledge that this is really too long a review for such a prosaic product, but if saves one person from a future trip to the dermatologist for sun damage, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Separately, would also acknowledge that this is really too long a review for such a prosaic product, but if saves one person from a future trip to the dermatologist for sun damage, it is worth it.    </li>
            <li>high enough SPF for my liking</li>
            <li>The price you paid was that if was garishly white and, if overapplied, would lead to an unintentional goth rock look -- a particularly tragic side effect in that your underlying purpose for wearing sunscreen was enjoying more time in</li>
            <li>They are all fading and now I can barely see the spot on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>Then my skin care professional started using a different product and, of course, recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li>The amount dispersed is a little too much.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for two years, it is very nice and protects my skin very well :)</li>
            <li> It goes on very easily and more transparently than the Eltas, and the smoothness of it makes it easier to get full coverage.</li>
            <li> This product offers great every-day sun protection with high-quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is the best product I found that goes smooth and not sticky in a very long time.</li>
            <li> The sunblock goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and fair</li>
            <li> it was not greasy and went on smooth.  </li>
            <li> Great coverage without the white film.</li>
            <li> This is light and blends in well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Neova was light,</li>
            <li> so light I didn&#x27;t think it would work.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free and does not have a tint which is a plus for me.</li>

            <li> I recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin and who needs good skin protection.  </li>
            <li> Thanks NEOVA DNA.!!!</li>
            <li> A very nice daily moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> exceptional for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> BEST SUNSCREEN, it doesn&#x27;t take much so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Choose the other new Neova product to truly replace the wonderful Ti-Silc we know and love.</li>
            <li> It felt like a normal, gentle moisturizer, but was a very effective block.  </li>
            <li> But living in Texas, the sun shines every month of the year and will blister you in the summer months, so you must take precautions, otherwise you will need to get way too familiar with a dermatologist after you pass the 30 mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has a ver clean feel.</li>
            <li> For those familiar to Z-Silc, it is much lighter than Z-Silc, while now more protective.  </li>

            <li> Whether it is a true \\&quot;SPF 43\\</li>
            <li> Overall is good except too pricey.</li>
            <li> I used Neova&#x27;s Ti-Silc Sheer for seven or eight years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> No bad chemicals like paraben and it doesn’t make my skin oily.</li>
            <li> Were it not an exceptional product on that count, would deduct a star for the minuses set out above.  </li>
            <li> Were it not an exceptional product on that count, would deduct a star for the minuses set out above.  </li>
            <li> Love the high SPF too.</li>
            <li> great skin product for all year round.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it was cheap.</li>
            <li> At that point, I had tried almost every over-the-counter brand from Banana Boat to Neutrogena; if it said \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; on the label and cost more than $15, I tried it.  </li>
            <li> Neova has a reputation to maintain and this DNA Damage Control proves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money, sunscreen is not the place to skimp.</li>
            <li> so I purchased it right away.  </li>
            <li> This cream is very light and absorbs quickly with no white residue.  </li>
            <li> the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neova DNA Damage Control 43 is the next generation of zinc-based sunscreens and a far superior successor to Z-Silc.  </li>
            <li> Its great to hear people think your 10 years younger than you actually are!</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, it turned out that Z-Silc was pretty good: it kept you from getting a sunburn, washed off easily, and, most importantly, didn&#x27;t anger the skin, unlike the sunscreens that used chemical barriers.  </li>
            <li> very light, feels like a regular lotion on your face</li>
            <li> Sunblock is so important to keep healthy young looking skin, this works, but you just got to remember to put this on every day in the morning and maybe some during the day especially if you are outdoors.</li>
            <li> First time I am using this product so time will tell which is always the reality with skin care products.</li>
            <li> Sellers if the products have consistently done well.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use the Elta sunscreens quite a bit, partly because they&#x27;re a bit cheaper, but ultimately the Neova is my favorite for both face and body.</li>
            <li> The pleasantness of it ultimately encourages me to use it more</li>
            <li> Even better used over a vitamin C serum, for extra sun-protection and anti-aging boost.</li>
            <li> I’m on my 3rd bottle and absolutely love this face sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 3-4 years and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen because it is not greasy and it does not white out my face.  </li>
            <li> I used it but always had Neova in the back of my mind because it is more emollient</li>
            <li> Go with something more natural with less chemicals that will offer better protection.  </li>
            <li> As to zinc-based sunscreens in particular, apply them from top of your face down -- something about the grain of the skin such that this looks better when applied than trying to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As to zinc-based sunscreens in particular, apply them from top of your face down -- something about the grain of the skin such that this looks better when applied than trying to rub in.    </li>
            <li> I recommend for every lady who cares for their skin and wants to protect from all sun damage.</li>
            <li> Since it is a bit liquidy it comes out of the tube a bit too fast.  </li>
            <li> Very well packaged.  </li>
            <li> I have a history of Melanoma and this works very well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why Neova would discontinue such a perfect product and add irritating ingredients to a sunblock for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Then, a couple years ago, thanks to a recommendation from my dermatologist, I discovered the new crop of zinc-based sunscreens.</li>
            <li> few years ago, a dermatologist recommended Z-Silc (rated SPF 30) as a good daily wear sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> My MD advised me to use this product daily, since I have been using it I have avoided getting any extra sun damage and it has even made my skin better.</li>
            <li> too bad they took away the old formula that worked better and was cheaper to buy, this one still works but not as good and pricier.</li>
            <li> Goes on like a normal mosturizer.</li>
            <li> I try a lot of products like this and don&#x27;t like most because they are too heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> &quot; one just to try something new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a disappointment, because Neova&#x27;s discontinued Z-Silc was perfect.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot tolerate the anti-aging ingredients in this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for sensitive skin, though pricey.</li>
            <li> In the past, I had tried many brands of sunscreen on my face, but broke out with acne every time, which deterred me from using sunscreen on my face.  </li>
            <li> Other sunscreens, esp the higher SPF ones, would make my skin and makeup very oily.</li>
            <li> this is totally clear and a bt shinier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, if you have sensitive skin, this might be your sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> In summary, if you have sensitive skin, this might be your sunscreen.  </li>

            <li> Otherwise, it runs havoc with my naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li> Light feel not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne-prone skin and have had no problem with any Neova product.</li>
            <li> Dr. Marcus of Redondo Beach,Ca used this and while the Neutrogena that I had used was ok it always felt heavy especially with humidity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Separately, would also acknowledge that this is really too long a review for such a prosaic product, but if saves one person from a future trip to the dermatologist for sun damage, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Then my skin care professional started using a different product and, of course, recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li> The amount dispersed is a little too much.</li>
            <li> allergy is not Neova&#x27;s fault, of course, but I just wanted to warn anyone who has used Ti-Silc successfully that this product does not have the same ingredients, and you may be in for an unpleasant surprise!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is \\&quot;re-building\\&quot; DNA as claimed, but is very efficient as a sun block.</li>
            <li> those new to Neova or zinc-based sunscreen, a few pluses and minuses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in AZ and we have sun all year round.  </li>
            <li> so I only use it in the winter when my skin is dry.  </li>
            <li> Only one complaint - spurts out of tube too quickly &amp; is wasteful, especially since it&#x27;s not cheap!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about Z-Silc as the primary ingredient was zinc.  </li>
            <li> It is much thinner, less moisturizing, more expensive, smaller of a tube and a poor substitute.</li>

            <li> A very little amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Since finding this product, however, have abandoned using products with a claimed SPF 70, 90, 100+ as the tradeoff of protection to willingness to apply was not worth it.  </li>

            <li> This cream is very light and absorbs quickly with no white residue.  A very little amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the coverage and texture of the Neova Damage Control Everyday SPF 43 sunscreen.  Have already purchased Neova in the active sunscreen, but have not tried it yet.</li>
            <li> I hate sunscreen. But living in Texas, the sun shines every month of the year and will blister you in the summer months, so you must take precautions, otherwise you will need to get way too familiar with a dermatologist after you pass the 30 mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, a dermatologist recommended Z-Silc (rated SPF 30) as a good daily wear sunscreen.  At that point, I had tried almost every over-the-counter brand from Banana Boat to Neutrogena; if it said \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; on the label and cost more than $15, I tried it.  But each suffered a weakness: from insufficient sun protection, to inflamed skin, to pasty films that required scrubbing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about Z-Silc as the primary ingredient was zinc.  My recollection of zinc was that it was blue and you put it under your ski goggles.  Nonetheless, it turned out that Z-Silc was pretty good: it kept you from getting a sunburn, washed off easily, and, most importantly, didn&#x27;t anger the skin, unlike the sunscreens that used chemical barriers.  The price you paid was that if was garishly white and, if overapplied, would lead to an unintentional goth rock look -- a particularly tragic side effect in that your underlying purpose for wearing sunscreen was enjoying more time in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neova DNA Damage Control 43 is the next generation of zinc-based sunscreens and a far superior successor to Z-Silc.  For those familiar to Z-Silc, it is much lighter than Z-Silc, while now more protective.  If you liked Z-Silc, you will like this much better.  The only downside is that the tube is now 2.5 ounces rather than 3.5 ounces.  Means you can carry it on the plane, but you are paying more for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those new to Neova or zinc-based sunscreen, a few pluses and minuses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses:&lt;br /&gt;1. fairly close to transparent when applied&lt;br /&gt;2. very light, feels like a regular lotion on your face&lt;br /&gt;3. exceptional for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:&lt;br /&gt;1. expensive - costs at least 3X of a mass market brand&lt;br /&gt;2. may discolor dark clothes (though usually washes out)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it is a true \\&quot;SPF 43\\&quot; is unknown, though one should be suspicious about all of the SPF claims.

            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t want to stop using it ever. It is the best product I found that goes smooth and not sticky in a very long time. I recommend for every lady who cares for their skin and wants to protect from all sun damage. Thanks NEOVA DNA.!!!</li>
            <li> too bad they took away the old formula that worked better and was cheaper to buy, this one still works but not as good and pricier. Sunblock is so important to keep healthy young looking skin, this works, but you just got to remember to put this on every day in the morning and maybe some during the day especially if you are outdoors. Overall is good except too pricey.</li>
            <li> This is great because it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  In the past, I had tried many brands of sunscreen on my face, but broke out with acne every time, which deterred me from using sunscreen on my face.  I discovered this when I told my neighbor about my problem with sunscreen and acne, and she told me she had the same problem and suggested I try this.  I have been using this for many years.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin and who needs good skin protection.  My dermatologist recommended it to me and all the Neova products have been great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go a day without it!</li>
            <li> it was not greasy and went on smooth.  I wish it came in a pump instead of a tube.  Since it is a bit liquidy it comes out of the tube a bit too fast.  Otherwise I would recommend the product</li>
            <li> First time I am using this product so time will tell which is always the reality with skin care products. I love the Neova products I have using for about a year &amp;&lt;br /&gt;happy with the results. Sellers if the products have consistently done well.</li>
            <li> I used Neova&#x27;s Ti-Silc Sheer for seven or eight years and loved it.  It has recently been discontinued and I mistakenly ordered this product as a replacement.  I had a severe allergic reaction that is painful and ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My allergy is not Neova&#x27;s fault, of course, but I just wanted to warn anyone who has used Ti-Silc successfully that this product does not have the same ingredients, and you may be in for an unpleasant surprise!  Choose the other new Neova product to truly replace the wonderful Ti-Silc we know and love.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and I love it. I especially love that it is SPF 44. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for two years, it is very nice and protects my skin very well :)</li>
            <li> Great coverage without the white film. Goes on like a normal mosturizer.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely.  Am enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> The sunblock goes on easily. Leaves the skin soft. I have to go by their word that it meets the protection specs as advertised. I don&#x27;t see any outstanding negatives. I have not gotten anything close to a burn. There isn&#x27;t even any pink tone. The amount dispersed is a little too much. I feel I may be wasting it. But, that is such an insignificant issue.</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen on my face, neck  and chest every day. It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. It has great sun protection!</li>
            <li> The springtime sun made me break out in hives and eczema every year. The &amp;#34;UVA/UVB 100 SPF&amp;#34; drugstore stuff just never worked for me. Then, a couple years ago, thanks to a recommendation from my dermatologist, I discovered the new crop of zinc-based sunscreens. I use the Elta sunscreens quite a bit, partly because they&#x27;re a bit cheaper, but ultimately the Neova is my favorite for both face and body. It goes on very easily and more transparently than the Eltas, and the smoothness of it makes it easier to get full coverage. It is sleek, so I can put makeup on over it as needed, and it moisturizes as well. The pleasantness of it ultimately encourages me to use it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a sun allergy like me, you too can know the amazing feeling of going out after 10AM without feeling like you&#x27;re in a rotisserie oven! You too can roll up your sleeves and feel the breeze on your arms! You too can go out on a boat in July! Having access to a truly effective sunscreen, for me, has been like getting a superpower: The power to go out between the hours of 10AM and 3 PM, even in the summer!</li>
            <li> This product offers great every-day sun protection with high-quality ingredients. A very nice daily moisturizer as well. My esthetician recommended it to me years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I have my boyfriend using it too. Very good product. Even better used over a vitamin C serum, for extra sun-protection and anti-aging boost.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and fair so I use this every morning after wasking as my daily moisturizer.  At night I use the Neova DNA nurishing cream (blue stuff) and eye lifter.  Been using them for years.  Love their products BUT you pay for it.  Started getting at Amazon instead of doctor&#x27;s office and about 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly with good level of spf</li>
            <li> I try a lot of products like this and don&#x27;t like most because they are too heavy and greasy. This is light and blends in well.  It protects my face as well as having anti-aging properties in it to help my skin look better. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Showed it to my dorm doc at my annual skin cancer screening &amp; tho she didn&#x27;t recognize the brand, she OK&#x27;d the zinc oxide %.  I like its feel &amp; how it disappears.  Only one complaint - spurts out of tube too quickly &amp; is wasteful, especially since it&#x27;s not cheap!</li>
            <li> My MD advised me to use this product daily, since I have been using it I have avoided getting any extra sun damage and it has even made my skin better.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this purchase.  Provides excellent coverage as advertised.  Seller prompt with order.</li>
            <li> Works great under makeup and give great protection.</li>
            <li> Great SPF lotion for the face and neck.  I use it every day here in Florida, along with the NEOVA DNA Repair Factor Nourishing Lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been using Neova Sunscreen for 2 years now, and I just recently switched to the \\&quot;face\\&quot; one just to try something new. I love it! It doesn&#x27;t feel icky on my skin, and I feel like it serves as a primer. My makeup stays so well on top of it. BEST SUNSCREEN, it doesn&#x27;t take much so the bottle lasts a long time. I would reccommend this to anyone! I think I would be happy with any of Neova&#x27;s products. Don&#x27;t change anything!</li>
            <li> I started using Neova Ti-Silc on my dermatologists recommendation about 5 yrs ago. Dr. Marcus of Redondo Beach,Ca used this and while the Neutrogena that I had used was ok it always felt heavy especially with humidity.&lt;br /&gt;Neova was light, so light I didn&#x27;t think it would work. But working at a garden center all day proved that it worked. And it didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin as chemical blocks do.&lt;br /&gt;I love this and was very glad that I could find it on Amazon after I moved from California.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and improves your skin. Fragrance free and does not have a tint which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I have not seen it do any thing for my &amp;#34;damaged&amp;#34; skin.  It is also a bit greasy so I only use it in the winter when my skin is dry.  Otherwise, it runs havoc with my naturally oily skin. It is also a chemical based sunblock (although it does offer some mineral based protection).  Go with something more natural with less chemicals that will offer better protection.  This product is not worth it for its price.</li>
            <li> I had patches on my face from the sun its all gone since using this control everyday.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot tolerate the anti-aging ingredients in this product.  It&#x27;s such a disappointment, because Neova&#x27;s discontinued Z-Silc was perfect.  I had used it every day for years, and I&#x27;ve never found a better sunblock.  It felt like a normal, gentle moisturizer, but was a very effective block.  I can&#x27;t understand why Neova would discontinue such a perfect product and add irritating ingredients to a sunblock for sensitive skin.  The package even acknowledges it can cause a rash, as it did for me (as well as a breakout).  This product is not good for acne-prone skin, as Z-Silc was.  Neova, please bring back Z-Silc!</li>
            <li> I love it annnnnnnnd have been using it for quite some time.  It really is great!</li>
            <li> Neova has a reputation to maintain and this DNA Damage Control proves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great skin product for all year round.</li>
            <li> This is not my Z-Silc that I used for years and years. It is much thinner, less moisturizing, more expensive, smaller of a tube and a poor substitute. I don&#x27;t know why they would get rid of a good thing! This doesn&#x27;t make me breakout, it just isn&#x27;t so fantastic that I can justify sticking with it. I am now on the search for a replacement to yet another great product &#x27;they&#x27; decided needed revamping.</li>
            <li> Perfect day cream. Im 52 drying skin.  This has a ver clean feel. Light feel not too heavy.  Moisturizes well.  I use Neova exclusively now with toner and Night DNA repair.  I get compliments on my skin often.  Its great to hear people think your 10 years younger than you actually are!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times, and while I like the texture, it doesn&#x27;t seem to protect from sunburn as well other products...</li>
            <li> look forward to seeing results</li>
            <li> Does everything it says.  Love this!</li>
            <li> I’m on my 3rd bottle and absolutely love this face sunscreen. No bad chemicals like paraben and it doesn’t make my skin oily. My makeup looks the same in the evening as when I applied it in the morning. Other sunscreens, esp the higher SPF ones, would make my skin and makeup very oily. Love the high SPF too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after I read about it in a magazine.  I am impressed.  I can already see a difference in my skin.  I have a brown mark on my forehead and also some on the side of my face by my eyes.  They are all fading and now I can barely see the spot on my forehead.  Goes on smoothly.  I use it everyday on my face, neck and chest.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues as reported by some reviewers.  A little goes a long way.  I will be ordering more of this.</li>
            <li> I have a history of Melanoma and this works very well. Not sure if it is \\&quot;re-building\\&quot; DNA as claimed, but is very efficient as a sun block. Highly recommend for sensitive skin, though pricey.</li>
            <li> This product has a bit of a sunscreen smell when applied, but that fades as it dries. Compared to the photo finish Neova this is totally clear and a bt shinier. I have sensitive acne-prone skin and have had no problem with any Neova product. Totally worth the money, sunscreen is not the place to skimp. I learned the hard way trying some of the &#x27;natural&#x27; sunscreens that were less expensive and I ended up with sun damage.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Nice product, good coverage and feels good on your skin</li>
            <li> Oy vey. Horrible, horrible rashes erupted everywhere this touched my skin. Very disappointed with this product. Returned and good riddance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 3-4 years and love it. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and high enough SPF for my liking</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen because it is not greasy and it does not white out my face.  I live in AZ and we have sun all year round.  This is perfect for the face.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for sun exposure. I use it everyday under make-up. It is light and non-greasy and feels great on my skin. Occasionally use it on my arms during the summer.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product years ago.  Then my skin care professional started using a different product and, of course, recommended it to me.  I used it but always had Neova in the back of my mind because it is more emollient and I know it provides excellent protection.  I didn&#x27;t know if I could find this product on Amazon but one day decided to check...and there it was so I purchased it right away.  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I hate to use sunscreen because of the smell and feel but this does not have the sunscreen &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; and is light so i don&#x27;t feel it on my face.  not sure if it does damage control but i am happy if it just protect from the sun.  a little pricer than other sunscreens but if i dont&#x27; use it it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it was cheap.</li>
