    <ol>

            <li>Its perfect.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this hair coloring system is excellent.  </li>
            <li>The color is just awesome</li>
            <li>if your looking for the best , i couldnt recomend any better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the best hair lightening system on the market</li>
            <li>They are the best.</li>
            <li>Beautiful.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m happy with this product</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>well i have to say i was so happy to find it again</li>
            <li>questions i am happy to answer to those who doubt it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rhonda in Indiana</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this here on Amazon, as it is not in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>Loved this kit.</li>
            <li>Good luck! :)</li>
            <li>, I love the continuous shine cream that comes with it, gives my hair a beautiful finish.</li>
            <li>I just love how you get that just came from the salon feeling when using this product!</li>
            <li>NOTHING MORE!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>On the plus side, I did get amazing lift with this product.</li>
            <li>It has its own moisturizer (if you&#x27;ve used bleach before I recommend you use it.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t feel the need to use it), has its own shampoo and conditioner, and shine control.</li>
            <li>For about 15 of those years, I have colored my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Every product that I have liked over the years seems to have been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much better than looking goofy for 3-4 months!</li>
            <li>My own color is dishwater and lightens easily.</li>
            <li>You will get there :).</li>
            <li>I love this product it is my favorite</li>
            <li>and I wont use anything else, I just absolutely love the color it gives me, it makes me feel so sexy</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on it</li>
            <li>I love it, and I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.     </li>
            <li>and I hope that I&#x27;ll be able to find it again when it comes time to do my roots.</li>
            <li>So the fact that this one lifts SO much more in just one step astounds me, and I have hope for my roots and am itching to buy another box as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So many things to try.</li>
            <li>how are we still able to purchase it from these dealers.</li>
            <li>i liked it very much!  </li>
            <li>I do highly recommend to anyone wanting bright platinum hair.</li>
            <li>I had medium brown hair and it turned my hair a beautiful blonde, like the box shows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy, and it produces fantastic results every time.  </li>
            <li>But this product is fantastic, I work in the beauty industry, and while I have tons of friends that do hair, I do this myself at home since I am one all over color.  </li>
            <li>available-</li>
            <li>Wish it were available in stores...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could comb through my hair smoothly after washing it out, and the hair is still smooth without feeling like burnt cotton candy.  </li>
            <li>The seller has amazing fast shipping</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner that comes with smells amazing and makes your hair super soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feels in good condition thanks to the xtra products that came with this order but the other light blonde colors also come with great conditioner products.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect shade to eliminate the last few patches of hair that have not gone white, and freshen the rest up to an attractive &amp;#34;baby blonde&amp;#34; shade.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not completely crazy, I even think this was cheaper on Amazon than the price the store used to charge.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for the price and includes shampoo and conditioner as well as other things you won&#x27;t find with a normal bleaching kit!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the other colors, but they have to be as good as the lightening kit, the color blends so well with muti-faceted tones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more yellow than I had been hoping for, but I&#x27;m still pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I plan on coloring parts of my hair red, but I think I&#x27;m gonna leave it how it turned out right now for a while :).</li>
            <li>The color came out almost exactly as I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Anywho, I really do recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It used to be in stores, but as I understand, there was some problems with the directions in the boxes (NOT WITH THE ACTUAL HAIR COLOR ITEMS THEMSELVES), and they were taken off most shelves.  </li>
            <li>I have tried Feria, other Loreal products, Clairol, Umberto Beverly Hills, etc etc, all other box brands over the years, and this is hands-down the BEST blonde-bleaching kit that protects and nourishes your hair.  </li>
            <li>I will be using Wella&#x27;s Color Charm toner in T18 to hopefully tone the yellow to a more ashy shade, along with purple shampoo.</li>
            <li>The look in the end should be all worth it, just don&#x27;t do too much and always call</li>
            <li>a specialist-FIRST(it dosn&#x27;t hurt and you NEED to if it is your first time).</li>
            <li>I used this product EXACTLY how the instructions said to use and my hair is brassy...</li>
            <li>No weird tones.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t crisp up.  </li>
            <li>but I have two more boxes left and will try it with the purple/blue powder instead.</li>
            <li>I love my blonde hair tho,</li>
            <li>At the end my hair was pretty damaged, and thinner.</li>
            <li>Well, my hair started out almost black underneath and light brown on top.</li>
            <li>It is my beautiful hair secret, and I get TONS of compliments on my HEALTHY platinum blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>can of course redo the process in the same day and lift the color more, but your hair will be very damaged by the end.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The blonde that comes out of this box is luxurious and almost always looks better than my professionally dyed platinum hair!!!</li>
            <li>I dyed my whole head with it the first time then</li>
            <li>(so so so blonde) to the bottom layers (a deep orange/brown/copper color), and I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually born a brunette with light brown hair.</li>
            <li>and it took 4 bleachings to get my whole head to that shade before.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve had some light blonde products leave a mixture of orange and brown on my roots, but this product colors your hair</li>
            <li>completely light blonde with no misses and no unintended colors.  </li>
            <li>I have decided to go back to being a blonde and look who I came back to in order to get the BEST L&#x27;OREAL BLONDE COLOR SYSTEM that has ever been made.</li>
            <li>So this product really is strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>decided to wait, so my hair is still orange/yellow but not as much as in the beginning.</li>
            <li>wow color white love this</li>
            <li>Lovely platinum blonde, no harsh smell</li>
            <li>it is full proof, i have used i think all others out there even paid for salon lightning, never got the results like this gives, not terrible smelling, didnt tangle or ruin my hair like others have, an you dont need a toner , it gives yuou a very natural pure pale blond even all over, so</li>
            <li>I got distracted shaving - but the product is more gentle I believe, in other words, I did not feel like my hair was going to fall out.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Super Blonde #205 SUPER BLEACH BLONDE, which worked well on my hair, but still didn&#x27;t lift it as much as the Baby&#x27;s Breath Blonde).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to go blonde this is / was the best drugstore kit on the market, unfortunately it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I was using loreal super blonde before</li>
            <li>you could get several more colors than you can now, so maybe the supply is now running low.</li>
            <li>I realized is that, see, the Glistening Magnolia, even though it&#x27;s #11 (and technically, the higher the number, the more blonde -- #100 is I think supposed to be a #10 blonde, but</li>
            <li>pitch-black hair to white blonde isn&#x27;t easy -- after all, it&#x27;s taken me 3 and a half months and 8 lightenings (5 on my own) to finally get it, so far.</li>
            <li>The color does not fade, and depending on how my hair grows, ( I live in the South ) depends on how often I use the product.</li>
            <li>My nearly-black dark orange roots were BRIGHT, and the rest of my hair was near the platinum blonde white shade I&#x27;d always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i remember using L&#x27;oreal Dream Blonde when it first came out-</li>
            <li>Since going blonde (which started with three bleachings at the salon in one day, and then three more subsequent lightenings at home), I have tried a LOT of different brands and products.</li>
            <li>Just ordered my 2nd box because the first box, after an hour, didn&#x27;t lift my medium brown hair.  </li>
            <li>already light blonde hair WHITE PLATINUM BLONDE (which is what I was aiming for), and turned my very dark orange (after the Glistening Magnolia!) and black roots light orange, almost blonde, which is really good considering</li>
            <li>Also, the colors are too cheap that they don&#x27;t even last long (talking about Splat)....</li>
            <li>but the smell was really harsh to me, and it got on my scalp really easily and irritated it --</li>
            <li>So far I have a lot of red/gold tones, but I am hoping this 2nd box really brings out the blonder highlights!  </li>
            <li>The Kit is complete..</li>
            <li>: This product is not for people with sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li>so I am going to switch to Garnier&#x27;s 100 because it&#x27;s for sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li>After reading some reviews online, I realized that I had definitely scored, haha.</li>
            <li>i have natural about medium-ash-brown color hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to do the roots again, since I know that to get naturally</li>
            <li>Ill never buy a different kind!</li>
            <li>every time since then I only do the new growth on my roots.</li>
            <li>The fact that it came with post-bleaching tubes of shampoo, conditioner and &amp;#34;shine creme&amp;#34; really helped to preserve your hair and keep it from getting too dry or damaged.</li>
            <li>I will be 70 yrs old in several weeks and now my hair is cut very short which should make going back much easier.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to stumble upon this product at a local Big Lots for about $4.50.</li>
            <li>It turned my naturally black roots to a very dark orange, and did nothing to lift or lighten the rest of my hair (which was already very light</li>
            <li>I have a lot of red undertone in my hair, but my son is a natural .   </li>
            <li>Blonde Complete Color System - #11 Glistening Magnolia]], which, if you read my review over on that page, did not turn out well.</li>
            <li>The shampoo they give you smells terrific, kinda like old Prell shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I started coloring my hair platinum blonde in 1972 when I was 28 years old.</li>
            <li>My hair is no longer black (only on the tips where I left it), the black/brown turned to a dark brassy blonde and the light brown is now a golden brassy blonde.</li>
            <li>The only major problem i have is one of the box was already open.</li>
            <li>While I love that I was able to get rid of the dark colors, I hate the fact that my hair is now brassy all over.</li>
            <li>the color is fabulous, and if you have VERY VERY dark roots, and VERY VERY dark hair, this is the one for you.  </li>

            <li> If you want to go blonde this is / was the best drugstore kit on the market, unfortunately it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I was using loreal super blonde before</li>
            <li> you could get several more colors than you can now, so maybe the supply is now running low.</li>
            <li> I realized is that, see, the Glistening Magnolia, even though it&#x27;s #11 (and technically, the higher the number, the more blonde -- #100 is I think supposed to be a #10 blonde, but</li>
            <li> pitch-black hair to white blonde isn&#x27;t easy -- after all, it&#x27;s taken me 3 and a half months and 8 lightenings (5 on my own) to finally get it, so far.</li>
            <li> The color does not fade, and depending on how my hair grows, ( I live in the South ) depends on how often I use the product.</li>
            <li> My nearly-black dark orange roots were BRIGHT, and the rest of my hair was near the platinum blonde white shade I&#x27;d always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i remember using L&#x27;oreal Dream Blonde when it first came out-</li>
            <li> Since going blonde (which started with three bleachings at the salon in one day, and then three more subsequent lightenings at home), I have tried a LOT of different brands and products.</li>
            <li> Just ordered my 2nd box because the first box, after an hour, didn&#x27;t lift my medium brown hair.  </li>
            <li> already light blonde hair WHITE PLATINUM BLONDE (which is what I was aiming for), and turned my very dark orange (after the Glistening Magnolia!) and black roots light orange, almost blonde, which is really good considering</li>
            <li> Also, the colors are too cheap that they don&#x27;t even last long (talking about Splat)....</li>
            <li> but the smell was really harsh to me, and it got on my scalp really easily and irritated it --</li>
            <li> So far I have a lot of red/gold tones, but I am hoping this 2nd box really brings out the blonder highlights!  </li>
            <li> The Kit is complete..</li>
            <li> : This product is not for people with sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li> so I am going to switch to Garnier&#x27;s 100 because it&#x27;s for sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews online, I realized that I had definitely scored, haha.</li>
            <li> i have natural about medium-ash-brown color hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to do the roots again, since I know that to get naturally</li>
            <li> Ill never buy a different kind!</li>
            <li> every time since then I only do the new growth on my roots.</li>
            <li> The fact that it came with post-bleaching tubes of shampoo, conditioner and &amp;#34;shine creme&amp;#34; really helped to preserve your hair and keep it from getting too dry or damaged.</li>
            <li> I will be 70 yrs old in several weeks and now my hair is cut very short which should make going back much easier.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to stumble upon this product at a local Big Lots for about $4.50.</li>
            <li> It turned my naturally black roots to a very dark orange, and did nothing to lift or lighten the rest of my hair (which was already very light</li>
            <li> I have a lot of red undertone in my hair, but my son is a natural .   </li>
            <li> Blonde Complete Color System - #11 Glistening Magnolia]], which, if you read my review over on that page, did not turn out well.</li>
            <li> The shampoo they give you smells terrific, kinda like old Prell shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I started coloring my hair platinum blonde in 1972 when I was 28 years old.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer black (only on the tips where I left it), the black/brown turned to a dark brassy blonde and the light brown is now a golden brassy blonde.</li>
            <li> The only major problem i have is one of the box was already open.</li>
            <li> While I love that I was able to get rid of the dark colors, I hate the fact that my hair is now brassy all over.</li>
            <li> the color is fabulous, and if you have VERY VERY dark roots, and VERY VERY dark hair, this is the one for you.  </li>
            <li> I got #100 Ultra Lightening, and my hair went from being a dirty blonde to more of a tweety bird blonde.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Dream Blonde Glistening Magnolia for a long time but it has been discontinued and also can not get it on Amazon any longer</li>
            <li> Long ago I used Ultra Blue byClairol (I think)</li>
            <li> my natural hair is PITCH black</li>
            <li> They even give you a Step 1 dry end protector to put on your already blonde ends</li>
            <li> It does not damage it, keeps it silky soft, and DOES not turn it orange no matter how long or how little I leave it in.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t colored my hair in a long while</li>
            <li> Keep in mind though I am not a professional hair</li>
            <li> Be careful and only leave it on for 30 mins....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they would pull such an awesome product and leave some terrible products on the shelf, but I&#x27;m not the buyer for the store.  </li>
            <li> already dark- blonde hair/</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you have naturally dark blonde hair and want the platinum look.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry towards the ends after washing the stuff out, but that&#x27;s to be expected with bleach.</li>
            <li> If you put it on the already dyed part it will make your hair very very dry and break.</li>
            <li> The orange in my roots isn&#x27;t an awful orange, but actually blends nicely intothe white-blonde, and you can barely even tell the orange.</li>
            <li> I wanted to go pale blonde and after reading the reviews I though that I would give this product a shot.</li>
            <li> My natural color is a very dull dark blonde and I use this about every 6-8 weeks</li>
            <li> My scalp burned so bad the last time I used it and for the next week my scalp was peeling large chunks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Baby&#x27;s Breath Blonde, indeed; even though I&#x27;m not sure what that means</li>
            <li> I already expected this to happen since my hair was dark.</li>
            <li> Of course not right away.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this hands down and to forget what they got at the store.  </li>
            <li> and alot of other bleaches/dyes!  </li>
            <li> It is foolproof and less damaging than straight-up bleach.  </li>
            <li> I have darker hair almost black</li>
            <li> The smell is slightly there</li>
            <li> Lost a little length from breakage.</li>
            <li> I have been using this dye for a few months now</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not THAT harsh,</li>
            <li> In the mean time, I will purchase a purple/blue shampoo to tone my color down.</li>
            <li> The dye goes on like a thick shampoo, no runny mess.  </li>
            <li> No more L&#x27;Oreal for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed and just wish it was back in stores!</li>
            <li> If u need to do again wait few days and don&#x27;t shampoo for at least a week!</li>
            <li> Let your hair rest for at least two-three days.</li>
            <li> This is also the least damaging hair dye I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> just use it with some common sense an</li>
            <li> so at least I will have some if I cannot get it anymore.</li>
            <li> I use the Ultra Lightening 100 kit, and it is very hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> This one is worse than the others .</li>
            <li> I did purchase discontinued kits though and they still worked well for me without decreased effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with that brassiness at all.</li>
            <li> But after half an hour or so, I was shocked when I looked at the mirror.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why it says bleach when it was merely just coloring to a lighter shade (didn&#x27;t even feel like bleach xD).</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years, But it is difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I think my scalp can&#x27;t handle it anymore</li>
            <li> forgive me if I&#x27;m wrong), is a COLORING system.</li>
            <li> I was piling on the bleach/color on my hair, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong if you purchase this item</li>
            <li> I thought that was crazy.  </li>
            <li> Then one very sad day, Meijers stopped carrying it -</li>
            <li> anymore it is so disappointing!!!</li>

            <li> The color came out almost exactly as I wanted.  Next time I will just leave it on longer to get the color I want.  There was enough dye to get every inch of my medium length hair covered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a lot of luck with L&#x27;Oreal Blonde products ... always turns my hair red &amp; when I re-do it to get it blonde, it breaks  my hair off.   This one is worse than the others . It turned us ORANGE. I have a lot of red undertone in my hair, but my son is a natural .   If this isn&#x27;t discontinued, it should be.  No more L&#x27;Oreal for me. Kuene is much more expensive but it&#x27;s much better than looking goofy for 3-4 months!</li>
            <li> This product has EVERYTHING you need to protect your hair from frying! I don&#x27;t understand why it says bleach when it was merely just coloring to a lighter shade (didn&#x27;t even feel like bleach xD). Now I wasn&#x27;t born with blonde hair. I&#x27;m actually born a brunette with light brown hair. But over the years since I was 18 I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair. At 18 I used Splat to bleach my hair and that stuff FRIED my hair ( STAY AWAY FROM SPLAT!). Also, the colors are too cheap that they don&#x27;t even last long (talking about Splat)....Moving on....Anywho, I really do recommend this product! It has its own moisturizer (if you&#x27;ve used bleach before I recommend you use it. I haven&#x27;t colored my hair in a long while so I didn&#x27;t feel the need to use it), has its own shampoo and conditioner, and shine control. And it has all the contents you need to color your hair. This stuff works! Yes my hair is now different shades of blonde/brown/copper from my root (so so so blonde) to the bottom layers (a deep orange/brown/copper color), and I love it! I plan on coloring parts of my hair red, but I think I&#x27;m gonna leave it how it turned out right now for a while :). If you do want a lighter shade then I do recommend recoloring. Of course not right away. Let your hair rest for at least two-three days. You will get there :). Keep in mind though I am not a professional hair colorist.&lt;br /&gt;Source: Self-Experience.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is my favorite and I wont use anything else, I just absolutely love the color it gives me, it makes me feel so sexy, I love the continuous shine cream that comes with it, gives my hair a beautiful finish. This product is A+ in my book. I just love how you get that just came from the salon feeling when using this product!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years, But it is difficult to find in stores. the color is fabulous, and if you have VERY VERY dark roots, and VERY VERY dark hair, this is the one for you.  The Kit is complete..and Yes I order in multiples, so that I am NEVER without.  The color does not fade, and depending on how my hair grows, ( I live in the South ) depends on how often I use the product. If you are looking for a permanent solution to removing  color and coloring  your hair  in one set..This is your product.</li>
            <li> If you want to go blonde this is / was the best drugstore kit on the market, unfortunately it&#x27;s been discontinued. The fact that it came with post-bleaching tubes of shampoo, conditioner and &amp;#34;shine creme&amp;#34; really helped to preserve your hair and keep it from getting too dry or damaged. I did purchase discontinued kits though and they still worked well for me without decreased effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this dye for a few months now and I love it. My natural color is a very dull dark blonde and I use this about every 6-8 weeks and it makes my hair bleach blonde. I get so many compliments on it everyone can&#x27;t believe it comes out of a box. I dyed my whole head with it the first time then every time since then I only do the new growth on my roots. NOTHING MORE! If you put it on the already dyed part it will make your hair very very dry and break. I leave it on for about 40 minutes and it comes out perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESIVED: This product is not for people with sensitive scalps. My scalp burned so bad the last time I used it and for the next week my scalp was peeling large chunks. Unfortunately, I think my scalp can&#x27;t handle it anymore so I am going to switch to Garnier&#x27;s 100 because it&#x27;s for sensitive scalps. Remember this is a BLEACHING kit. I do highly recommend to anyone wanting bright platinum hair.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY hair color I use.  I use the Ultra Lightening 100 kit, and it is very hard to find in stores.  It used to be in stores, but as I understand, there was some problems with the directions in the boxes (NOT WITH THE ACTUAL HAIR COLOR ITEMS THEMSELVES), and they were taken off most shelves.  You can still find them occasionally in beauty based drug stores and such, places with a lot of hair color products/selection.  This is the ONLY bleach lightening kit I will use on my platinum blonde hair.  It does not damage it, keeps it silky soft, and DOES not turn it orange no matter how long or how little I leave it in.  It is foolproof and less damaging than straight-up bleach.  It is my beautiful hair secret, and I get TONS of compliments on my HEALTHY platinum blonde hair.  I also use a purple based conditioning toner (Shimmerlights) to take out any brassiness as the hair color wears out over the weeks.  But this product is fantastic, I work in the beauty industry, and while I have tons of friends that do hair, I do this myself at home since I am one all over color.  It&#x27;s so easy, and it produces fantastic results every time.  I have tried Feria, other Loreal products, Clairol, Umberto Beverly Hills, etc etc, all other box brands over the years, and this is hands-down the BEST blonde-bleaching kit that protects and nourishes your hair.  I love it, and I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.     I don&#x27;t know about the other colors, but they have to be as good as the lightening kit, the color blends so well with muti-faceted tones.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to stumble upon this product at a local Big Lots for about $4.50. After reading some reviews online, I realized that I had definitely scored, haha. I got #100 Ultra Lightening, and my hair went from being a dirty blonde to more of a tweety bird blonde. It&#x27;s a little more yellow than I had been hoping for, but I&#x27;m still pretty happy with the results. I&#x27;m currently in the process of getting my hair to a white blonde, so this definitely helped. I will be using Wella&#x27;s Color Charm toner in T18 to hopefully tone the yellow to a more ashy shade, along with purple shampoo. My hair is dry towards the ends after washing the stuff out, but that&#x27;s to be expected with bleach. All in all, I&#x27;m happy with this product and I hope that I&#x27;ll be able to find it again when it comes time to do my roots.</li>
            <li> i remember using L&#x27;oreal Dream Blonde when it first came out- i liked it very much!  i believe i have to use the lightest color available- i have natural about medium-ash-brown color hair.  i used the product to dye my roots; and already dark- blonde hair/ the roots i missed before.  Dream Blonde #100 took all the brassiness out and left it lightest blonde(like on the box).  i am VERY happy with the results!  However i did lose alot of hair.  i ALSO should NOT have used the product because it says not to if you have used henna or metallic dyes(Nice-n-Easy-might be one!- i did.) and alot of other bleaches/dyes!  i know you have to wait till the color oxidizes, so the hair you leave bleached w/o extra dye(i do for damage control) will be alittle different.  The look in the end should be all worth it, just don&#x27;t do too much and always call a specialist-FIRST(it dosn&#x27;t hurt and you NEED to if it is your first time).</li>
            <li> wow color white love this</li>
            <li> I have darker hair almost black this is one of the few hair dyes that I&#x27;ve found that actually dyes my hair straight to blonde in one use. The shampoo and conditioner that comes with smells amazing and makes your hair super soft. This is also the least damaging hair dye I&#x27;ve used. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. I wanted to go pale blonde and after reading the reviews I though that I would give this product a shot. Well, my hair started out almost black underneath and light brown on top. I used this product EXACTLY how the instructions said to use and my hair is brassy...ALL OVER! I am not happy with that brassiness at all. On the plus side, I did get amazing lift with this product. My hair is no longer black (only on the tips where I left it), the black/brown turned to a dark brassy blonde and the light brown is now a golden brassy blonde. While I love that I was able to get rid of the dark colors, I hate the fact that my hair is now brassy all over. So, I ordered Shimmerlights shampoo and I am hoping that it does the trick. If it does I will update my post for anyone else having the brassy issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: John Freida Tone Corrector did wonders for the brassiness! It is cheaper than Shimmerlights and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I was using loreal super blonde before and i would describe it as &amp;#34;laser lemon&amp;#34;. Then, I stumbled upon this while looking for a bleach to lighten my hair before putting a color in it. I had medium brown hair and it turned my hair a beautiful blonde, like the box shows. No weird tones. Its perfect. Ill never buy a different kind!</li>
            <li> Since going blonde (which started with three bleachings at the salon in one day, and then three more subsequent lightenings at home), I have tried a LOT of different brands and products. My seventh coloring/lightening was with [[ASIN:B001EXJPIU Loreal Dream Blonde Complete Color System - #11 Glistening Magnolia]], which, if you read my review over on that page, did not turn out well. It turned my naturally black roots to a very dark orange, and did nothing to lift or lighten the rest of my hair (which was already very light blonde).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I realized is that, see, the Glistening Magnolia, even though it&#x27;s #11 (and technically, the higher the number, the more blonde -- #100 is I think supposed to be a #10 blonde, but forgive me if I&#x27;m wrong), is a COLORING system. This shade, Baby&#x27;s Breath Blonde, is BLEACH (even though it isn&#x27;t blue -- the only actually BLUE bleach I&#x27;ve found in a DIY store box color is L&#x27;Oreal Super Blonde #205 SUPER BLEACH BLONDE, which worked well on my hair, but still didn&#x27;t lift it as much as the Baby&#x27;s Breath Blonde).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was piling on the bleach/color on my hair, I was skeptical. Contrary to when I used to dye my hair red and I could SEE the color go in, it&#x27;s obviously not been as immediate when going blonde (and blonder). But after half an hour or so, I was shocked when I looked at the mirror. My nearly-black dark orange roots were BRIGHT, and the rest of my hair was near the platinum blonde white shade I&#x27;d always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;shade\\&quot; (or bleach) finally made my (after 3 bleachings and 4 box colors! stubborn hair...) already light blonde hair WHITE PLATINUM BLONDE (which is what I was aiming for), and turned my very dark orange (after the Glistening Magnolia!) and black roots light orange, almost blonde, which is really good considering my natural hair is PITCH black and it took 4 bleachings to get my whole head to that shade before. The orange in my roots isn&#x27;t an awful orange, but actually blends nicely intothe white-blonde, and you can barely even tell the orange. I&#x27;m planning to do the roots again, since I know that to get naturally pitch-black hair to white blonde isn&#x27;t easy -- after all, it&#x27;s taken me 3 and a half months and 8 lightenings (5 on my own) to finally get it, so far. So the fact that this one lifts SO much more in just one step astounds me, and I have hope for my roots and am itching to buy another box as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baby&#x27;s Breath Blonde, indeed; even though I&#x27;m not sure what that means (how can a baby&#x27;s breath be blonde... or have any color, for that matter...?). I think I&#x27;ve finally found the box color/shade/bleach I&#x27;ve been looking for. Wish it were available in stores...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Color your hair in a well-ventilated area, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but the smell was really harsh to me, and it got on my scalp really easily and irritated it -- but it&#x27;s not THAT harsh, so don&#x27;t let this detail detract from your experience. Good luck! :)</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Meijers and was so geeked when I saw a product made for blondes.  Then one very sad day, Meijers stopped carrying it - I thought that was crazy.  I&#x27;m not sure why they would pull such an awesome product and leave some terrible products on the shelf, but I&#x27;m not the buyer for the store.  Anyway, this hair coloring system is excellent.  The dye goes on like a thick shampoo, no runny mess.  The smell is slightly there but it&#x27;s not so overpowering that it&#x27;s burning your nose hairs and making you turn on two fans.  The color is just awesome - I&#x27;ve had some light blonde products leave a mixture of orange and brown on my roots, but this product colors your hair completely light blonde with no misses and no unintended colors.  Additionally, there is no pain in your scalp like some of those bleaches terrorize you with.  I left this one longer than I should - I got distracted shaving - but the product is more gentle I believe, in other words, I did not feel like my hair was going to fall out.  I could comb through my hair smoothly after washing it out, and the hair is still smooth without feeling like burnt cotton candy.  The shampoo they give you smells terrific, kinda like old Prell shampoo.  They even give you a Step 1 dry end protector to put on your already blonde ends so they don&#x27;t crisp up.  I will continue to buy this hands down and to forget what they got at the store.  If I&#x27;m not completely crazy, I even think this was cheaper on Amazon than the price the store used to charge.  Beautiful.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Loved this kit. I had enough to do my hair and for my mom to do her&#x27;s in one box. Lovely platinum blonde, no harsh smell and it didn&#x27;t burn. I&#x27;ll definitely get this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Dream Blonde Glistening Magnolia for a long time but it has been discontinued and also can not get it on Amazon any longer so I decided to try this. It came out too yellow (left on for 45 min.) but I have two more boxes left and will try it with the purple/blue powder instead. In the mean time, I will purchase a purple/blue shampoo to tone my color down. My own color is dishwater and lightens easily. Long ago I used Ultra Blue byClairol (I think) and I see Loreal has the blue powder packets and 40 developer so I will try that in the future. My hair feels in good condition thanks to the xtra products that came with this order but the other light blonde colors also come with great conditioner products. That Wisper Blonde might work also. So many things to try.</li>
            <li> The only major problem i have is one of the box was already open.</li>
            <li> Works great. Had to do 2x tho to get color. Lost a little length from breakage. Be careful and only leave it on for 30 mins.... If u need to do again wait few days and don&#x27;t shampoo for at least a week! Gl! I love my blonde hair tho,</li>
            <li> This did not lift my color at all. It actually made the color way to red and brassy, which I never have issues with before.</li>
            <li> , i used to use this all the time till i guess it was pulled from stores because of some error in the directions, well i have to say i was so happy to find it again, i am estatic!!!!!!!!! just use it with some common sense an it is full proof, i have used i think all others out there even paid for salon lightning, never got the results like this gives, not terrible smelling, didnt tangle or ruin my hair like others have, an you dont need a toner , it gives yuou a very natural pure pale blond even all over, so if your looking for the best , i couldnt recomend any better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;any questions i am happy to answer to those who doubt it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rhonda in Indiana</li>
            <li> Well here I go again. I have decided to go back to being a blonde and look who I came back to in order to get the BEST L&#x27;OREAL BLONDE COLOR SYSTEM that has ever been made. I started coloring my hair platinum blonde in 1972 when I was 28 years old. At that time I bleached my hair and used Born Blonde Toner. Off and on I have gone back and forth from brown to blonde hair but around 2010 or 11 when I decided to change the color once again to blonde I heard about this product and tried it purchasing and finding it only on Amazon. It is the best hair lightening system on the market and I will never understand why L&#x27;Oreal stopped making it. What I cannot figure out is if L&#x27;Oreal is not making it anymore how are we still able to purchase it from these dealers. I do know that back in 2010 you could get several more colors than you can now, so maybe the supply is now running low. This time I purchased 4 of them so at least I will have some if I cannot get it anymore. You won&#x27;t go wrong if you purchase this item and I would give it 10 stars if I could. I will be 70 yrs old in several weeks and now my hair is cut very short which should make going back much easier. All thru the years I have only used L&#x27;Oreal color products. They are the best.</li>
            <li> Just ordered my 2nd box because the first box, after an hour, didn&#x27;t lift my medium brown hair.  So far I have a lot of red/gold tones, but I am hoping this 2nd box really brings out the blonder highlights!  It&#x27;s a great product for the price and includes shampoo and conditioner as well as other things you won&#x27;t find with a normal bleaching kit!</li>
            <li> I have had platinum blonde hair for 20 years.  For about 15 of those years, I have colored my own hair.  Every product that I have liked over the years seems to have been discontinued.  Which led me to this product. However, I don&#x27;t believe that you can find this in stores anymore either!  So I order off Amazon.  The seller has amazing fast shipping and I have never had a problem with the product.  I would recommend this product if you have naturally dark blonde hair and want the platinum look.  I follow up with a purple based shampoo to remove any brassy tones after coloring.</li>
            <li> If you have platinum hair and your roots are starting to show this is the stuff for you!!! I can&#x27;t believe you can not buy it in stores anymore it is so disappointing!!! The blonde that comes out of this box is luxurious and almost always looks better than my professionally dyed platinum hair!!! I&#x27;m obsessed and just wish it was back in stores! Lets all write Loreal and demand it be brought back!!! Xoxo!!!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this here on Amazon, as it is not in stores anymore. This is the perfect shade to eliminate the last few patches of hair that have not gone white, and freshen the rest up to an attractive &amp;#34;baby blonde&amp;#34; shade.</li>
            <li> The day Dream Blonde arrived I immediately used it. It comes with shampoo, conditioner, bleach, developer, protective hair cream, and a shine cream for after. When I used I could automatically see that It was working. It lifted my hair color. Not to the color I wanted, but it did lift. My hair was a a brown, with highlights in it so my hair went from brown to orange/yellow. I already expected this to happen since my hair was dark. but it was still a shocker. At the end my hair was pretty damaged, and thinner. So this product really is strong.&lt;br /&gt;So my advice is if you have darker hair like myself be prepared to have the orange/yellow color. If you have lighter hair this should work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;You can of course redo the process in the same day and lift the color more, but your hair will be very damaged by the end.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to wait, so my hair is still orange/yellow but not as much as in the beginning.Shampooing your hair helps.Remember CONDITION, CONDITION, CONDITION. Deep condition your hair so it healthier. If you don&#x27;t have a deep conditioner, use regular conditioner and leave it over night and wash it in the morning.</li>
