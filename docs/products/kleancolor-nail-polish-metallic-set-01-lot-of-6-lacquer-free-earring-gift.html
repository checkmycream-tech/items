            <li> It is true it can be hard to take off with regular nail polish remover</li>
            <li> , I had to wear some strog red on top to forget about my ugly greed nails beacause of this.</li>
            <li> Only down fall is the color stains your nails...</li>
            <li> less then a week only issue was the green nail polished was not tightly closed when they shipped it so by the time it reached my mailbox</li>
            <li> thats my only complaint.</li>
            <li> , I tried the green one and it lasted NOTHING,, then.</li>
            <li> Even when bottle is mixed the color pigment is fairly thin.</li>
            <li> It was a mess!</li>
            <li> , my nails stayed green for 4 days!</li>
            <li> The smell is nauseating and the Polish is thick.</li>
            <li> I would recommend maybe a clear base coat to try and avoid the nails from staining...</li>
            <li> For the purposes of frequent use and water marbling, it is one of the worst you can use.</li>
            <li> but it leaves a stain which looks ugly.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is the worst.</li>

            <li> Great colors, wish there were more.  Haven&#x27;t used them yet, I picked them up to go into a nail polish kit as a birthday gift for my daughter.  Hope she likes them as much as I did.  I also hope two coats will do the trick.  We&#x27;ll find out soon.</li>
            <li> The polish is beautiful and arrived super-dooper quick. I do plan on ordering more polish really, really soon! The seller responded immediately whenever I had a question. They&#x27;re very approachable. The polish was also packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li> The colors stay so well, and I usually only have to put on one coat. They come off pretty easily too, even with cheap nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is the worst. I have ever seen!, I tried the green one and it lasted NOTHING,, then. I went to take this off and guess what?, my nails stayed green for 4 days! , I had to wear some strog red on top to forget about my ugly greed nails beacause of this. WHAT A WAIST OF MONEY</li>
            <li> the colors are great and look almost like the picture except the orange one isnt too good. but it chips off soo fast even with a top coat. thats my only complaint. im still using them</li>

I would recommend maybe a clear base coat to try and avoid the nails from staining... I received them in less then a week only issue was the green nail polished was not tightly closed when they shipped it so by the time it reached my mailbox it had leaked all inside the bubble wrap. It was a mess!</li>
