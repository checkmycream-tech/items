            <li>but this one is amazing</li>
            <li>The amount of eyeshadow it picks up is amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anyone should feel like they have to buy this brush in order to have nice looking eye shadow or this product</li>
            <li>Really nice, does what its supposed to</li>
            <li>this brush is the best brush for applying eyeshadow, its works so nice and soft, some of the brushes hurts your eye when u use them</li>
            <li>The cut and qualify of the brushes makes it very easy to apply my make-up.</li>
            <li>honestly way better than anything ive used.</li>
            <li>~ Sigma brushes are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I do own the Mac 239, which I love, but the sigma is comparable.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this brush!</li>
            <li>This is a great brush Sigma is a great company however the brush came chipped and its such a pain to return the item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very precise.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, and it&#x27;s a good quality brush.</li>
            <li>That was until my mom recently bought a palette from Tarte that included the best brush ever.  </li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size to fill in my inner and outer lids and I would reccomend this in need of a lid brush!</li>
            <li>I love Sigma, always have and always will.</li>
            <li>Love Sigma brushes for durability and ease of use.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>just a personal thought, the rest was excellent, including the seller!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>better than my MAC brush</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Great brush to really pack on color.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this brush.  </li>
            <li>But I am so pleased with my perchase</li>
            <li>need to buy more and use for ALL my shadows.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>Apply it in patting motions for more depth coverage.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love love love the Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not! :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I love watching makeup videos</li>
            <li>I love the Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>You just want to us it more and more.</li>
            <li>YES, to everybody who wants to apply eyeshadows with joy.</li>
            <li>I love Sigma, always have and always will.</li>
            <li>Packs on color very well, and is a great shading tool.</li>
            <li>Look no further for the perfect shade brush.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Most brushes are too prickly for me and cause my eyelids to swell.</li>
            <li>5 stars :)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and authentic products!!</li>
            <li>They are as great as everyone says and I love this particular brush for patting eyeshadow on my lids.</li>
            <li>They are very good and soft, very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and picks up shadow beautifully, you will really be pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>But, who has very itchy eyelids and needs a good scratch, go for MAC 239 :).</li>
            <li>I found it to be very true.</li>
            <li>I like the shorter bristles, and rounded edge, and find that I can place color more precisely.</li>
            <li>I heard that it was a really good brush because it packed on eyeshadow w/o much fallout.</li>
            <li>Very nice, dense, soft, and sturdy.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>For crease brushes, on the other hand, I have found Hourglass has the best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and can&#x27;t wait to try out a few more brushes from Sigma.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It makes appling eye shadow so easy.</li>
            <li>Quality of this brush is amazing and no shedding at all on the first wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more full (thickness) than it may appear in these pictures.</li>
            <li>The brush is fine but the company is no help when a problem arises...</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft but super dense, which is great for shading.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic brush.</li>
            <li>Fabulous make up brush</li>
            <li>The sigma brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for padding colors on your eye lid with a clear edge.</li>
            <li>Wonderful brush for applying all over base eye shadow color, and is very good quality for the price!</li>
            <li>Its size made it perfect for the lid and really anywhere on the eye (that being said I do have big eyes).</li>
            <li>I am sure to be ordering more very soon</li>
            <li>E55 is dens, but in the same time very soft and awesomely gentl (like a cloud), it picks up eyeshadows so dem&#x27;n well and, of course, applies them, no metter they are powdered or pressed, with glitter or matte.</li>
            <li>It is great for packing on color on your lid but works much better with a little moisture on the brush.  </li>
            <li>i am in love with the sigma flat top brushes too :)</li>
            <li>I love the quality of the brush, it is perfect for working the color into the eye, and I expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li>You get just the right amount of product and it deposits easily.</li>
            <li>Initially, after watching a couple of videos on how the MAC 239 brush was good for the eyelids I was eager to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Plus, the fur is much softer and it comes in many varieties of colors.</li>
            <li>Plus, the fur is much softer and it comes in many varieties of colors.</li>
            <li>use this everyday for precise application of eyeshadow, works great for pigments and anything that you want to push onto the lid (creams/high fallout eyeshadows)&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT, i&#x27;m pretty happy with my \\&quot;mistake\\&quot; now :) ( even though i still need that small shader )</li>
            <li>After the very first use of this brush I just &amp;#34;fell in love&amp;#34; with it, if i can say that.</li>
            <li>this is just as good if not better than mac brushes :)</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy more from the Sigma Collection!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great brush for packing color on the lid and especially for cream products and also some of the new cream gel eye shadows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a cheap ELF brush for awhile, which was doing a decent job, and wanted to try out the true and tested Sigma brand.</li>
            <li>This brush applies eyeshadow pigment very well and precise.</li>
            <li>I love how this eye shading brush is soft and it picks up a lot of color pigment.</li>
            <li>I will continue to build my Sigma collection, I love how soft and sturdy they are.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, soft, and dense bristles.  </li>
            <li>Love Sigma brushes so far.</li>
            <li>I only own</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love how this eye shading brush is soft and it picks up a lot of color pigment.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s the only one I really like in that set, but it&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>I love the soft bristles.</li>
            <li>The brush applies the shadow smoothly, quickly, and evenly and feels very gentle on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used MAC and other good quality brushes but this brush exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>is my favorite eye shadow brush, whether I&#x27;m using my elf palette or the Wet-n-Wild palettes or even now using some of my mineral Bare Escentuals eye makeup.</li>
            <li>The size and shape is great and doesn&#x27;t apply too much or too little.</li>
            <li>Love this eyeshadow brush, picks up eyeshadow really well and soft to the feel.  </li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and was packaged really well too.</li>
            <li>It holds makeup very well and rather than hard bristles that put more product into the air than on your face, this is a nice applicator with an airy-blended look once applied to the face.</li>
            <li>I have several sigma brushes and love them all.</li>
            <li>looking forward to ordering more Sigma brushes in the future after using this one!</li>
            <li>Definitely going to purchase more of Sigma products.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>

            <li>Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a MAC only convert, I was able to buy 3 sigma brushes for the price of one MAC brush!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>highly recommend these brushes to anyone that loves quality!!</li>
            <li>I just wish I&#x27;d known sooner how much easier it is to apply eye shadow with a brush!</li>

            <li>Definitely going to purchase more of Sigma products.</li>
            <li>The E55 is a personal favorite, and a softer, thicker dup for the MAC 239 brush.</li>
            <li>More than one of these brushes is necessary for all makeup addicts!</li>
            <li>Super high quality and still cheaper than MAC for example.</li>
            <li>I think Sigma brushes are a good alternative to the more expensive MAC brushes.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying another one of these E55 brush because I just love it so much.</li>
            <li>I like how the bristles aren&#x27;t too long, which allows for better precision and control.</li>
            <li>I like the like the long brush stick which gives you more control of the brush when applying the eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>This came promptly and is such a nice brush to work with- was definitely worth the extra money!</li>
            <li>Super soft and washes well.</li>

            <li>I was a little unsure about the quality of this brush being that I found it here on Amazon you can never be too sure.</li>
            <li>The bristles arrived wrinkled and have not yet returned to normal.</li>
            <li>I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s normal or not.</li>
            <li>It is very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not sure if it&#x27;s any better than a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li>I definitely have other brushes that do a better job than this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tight and thick and applies beautifully.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It came with instructions on how to use, and a book full of their other brushes that you can purchase....which I will be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the larger side for a C-shaped shadow brush, but I think it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue for most people.</li>
            <li>Feels soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised with this brush.</li>
            <li>Soft, but not flimsy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably soft and has not shed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;No shedding so far</li>
            <li>It packs on color really well, especially for shadows that are of a lower quality.</li>
            <li>The hairs are soft and pick up product well</li>
            <li>Surprised?  </li>
            <li>It is a complete opposit to MAC 239:</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft yet firm enough to be easy to guide.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended brand overall!</li>
            <li>No other shading brush can compare!</li>
            <li>You cannot go wrong with these, you will love any brush made by Sigma!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great quality and the price isn&#x27;t so bad either.</li>
            <li>I alternate this brush with the MAC 239 natural hair brush.</li>
            <li>I really like the fluffy, largest headed brush in the Real Techniques Basic Eye set</li>
            <li>sad because the brushes are nice.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s half the price of MAC&#x27;s brush</li>
            <li>I have used several different high quality brushes before and hadn&#x27;t found a size and shape that totally blew me away.  </li>
            <li>So if you want to splurge a little this brush is worth it, but it isn&#x27;t necessary.  </li>
            <li>What I like about it compared to other versions is that it is fairly small, with relatively short bristles, which gives me more control.  </li>
            <li>I have small eyelids and this brush actually gets right into my crease and glides effortlessly.</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> but this one is amazing</li>
            <li> The amount of eyeshadow it picks up is amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone should feel like they have to buy this brush in order to have nice looking eye shadow or this product</li>
            <li> Really nice, does what its supposed to</li>
            <li> this brush is the best brush for applying eyeshadow, its works so nice and soft, some of the brushes hurts your eye when u use them</li>
            <li> The cut and qualify of the brushes makes it very easy to apply my make-up.</li>
            <li> honestly way better than anything ive used.</li>
            <li> ~ Sigma brushes are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I do own the Mac 239, which I love, but the sigma is comparable.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this brush!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush Sigma is a great company however the brush came chipped and its such a pain to return the item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very precise.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, and it&#x27;s a good quality brush.</li>
            <li> That was until my mom recently bought a palette from Tarte that included the best brush ever.  </li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size to fill in my inner and outer lids and I would reccomend this in need of a lid brush!</li>
            <li> I love Sigma, always have and always will.</li>
            <li> Love Sigma brushes for durability and ease of use.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> just a personal thought, the rest was excellent, including the seller!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> better than my MAC brush</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Great brush to really pack on color.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this brush.  </li>
            <li> But I am so pleased with my perchase</li>
            <li> need to buy more and use for ALL my shadows.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Apply it in patting motions for more depth coverage.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love love love the Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not! :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I love watching makeup videos</li>
            <li> I love the Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> You just want to us it more and more.</li>
            <li> YES, to everybody who wants to apply eyeshadows with joy.</li>
            <li> I love Sigma, always have and always will.</li>
            <li> Packs on color very well, and is a great shading tool.</li>
            <li> Look no further for the perfect shade brush.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Most brushes are too prickly for me and cause my eyelids to swell.</li>
            <li> 5 stars :)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and authentic products!!</li>
            <li> They are as great as everyone says and I love this particular brush for patting eyeshadow on my lids.</li>
            <li> They are very good and soft, very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft and picks up shadow beautifully, you will really be pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> But, who has very itchy eyelids and needs a good scratch, go for MAC 239 :).</li>
            <li> I found it to be very true.</li>
            <li> I like the shorter bristles, and rounded edge, and find that I can place color more precisely.</li>
            <li> I heard that it was a really good brush because it packed on eyeshadow w/o much fallout.</li>
            <li> Very nice, dense, soft, and sturdy.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> For crease brushes, on the other hand, I have found Hourglass has the best.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and can&#x27;t wait to try out a few more brushes from Sigma.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It makes appling eye shadow so easy.</li>
            <li> Quality of this brush is amazing and no shedding at all on the first wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more full (thickness) than it may appear in these pictures.</li>
            <li> The brush is fine but the company is no help when a problem arises...</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft but super dense, which is great for shading.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brush.</li>
            <li> Fabulous make up brush</li>
            <li> The sigma brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for padding colors on your eye lid with a clear edge.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush for applying all over base eye shadow color, and is very good quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Its size made it perfect for the lid and really anywhere on the eye (that being said I do have big eyes).</li>
            <li> I am sure to be ordering more very soon</li>
            <li> E55 is dens, but in the same time very soft and awesomely gentl (like a cloud), it picks up eyeshadows so dem&#x27;n well and, of course, applies them, no metter they are powdered or pressed, with glitter or matte.</li>
            <li> It is great for packing on color on your lid but works much better with a little moisture on the brush.  </li>
            <li> i am in love with the sigma flat top brushes too :)</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the brush, it is perfect for working the color into the eye, and I expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> You get just the right amount of product and it deposits easily.</li>
            <li> Initially, after watching a couple of videos on how the MAC 239 brush was good for the eyelids I was eager to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Plus, the fur is much softer and it comes in many varieties of colors.</li>
            <li> Plus, the fur is much softer and it comes in many varieties of colors.</li>
            <li> use this everyday for precise application of eyeshadow, works great for pigments and anything that you want to push onto the lid (creams/high fallout eyeshadows)&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT, i&#x27;m pretty happy with my \\&quot;mistake\\&quot; now :) ( even though i still need that small shader )</li>
            <li> After the very first use of this brush I just &amp;#34;fell in love&amp;#34; with it, if i can say that.</li>
            <li> this is just as good if not better than mac brushes :)</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy more from the Sigma Collection!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great brush for packing color on the lid and especially for cream products and also some of the new cream gel eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a cheap ELF brush for awhile, which was doing a decent job, and wanted to try out the true and tested Sigma brand.</li>
            <li> This brush applies eyeshadow pigment very well and precise.</li>
            <li> I love how this eye shading brush is soft and it picks up a lot of color pigment.</li>
            <li> I will continue to build my Sigma collection, I love how soft and sturdy they are.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, soft, and dense bristles.  </li>
            <li> Love Sigma brushes so far.</li>
            <li> I only own</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love how this eye shading brush is soft and it picks up a lot of color pigment.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s the only one I really like in that set, but it&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> I love the soft bristles.</li>
            <li> The brush applies the shadow smoothly, quickly, and evenly and feels very gentle on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used MAC and other good quality brushes but this brush exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> is my favorite eye shadow brush, whether I&#x27;m using my elf palette or the Wet-n-Wild palettes or even now using some of my mineral Bare Escentuals eye makeup.</li>
            <li> The size and shape is great and doesn&#x27;t apply too much or too little.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeshadow brush, picks up eyeshadow really well and soft to the feel.  </li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and was packaged really well too.</li>
            <li> It holds makeup very well and rather than hard bristles that put more product into the air than on your face, this is a nice applicator with an airy-blended look once applied to the face.</li>
            <li> I have several sigma brushes and love them all.</li>
            <li> looking forward to ordering more Sigma brushes in the future after using this one!</li>
            <li> Definitely going to purchase more of Sigma products.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush!</li>
            <li> Nice product - exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> It blends really well!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a MAC only convert, I was able to buy 3 sigma brushes for the price of one MAC brush!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> highly recommend these brushes to anyone that loves quality!!</li>
            <li> I just wish I&#x27;d known sooner how much easier it is to apply eye shadow with a brush!</li>
            <li> It was the first time I cleaned them.  </li>
            <li> Definitely going to purchase more of Sigma products.</li>
            <li> The E55 is a personal favorite, and a softer, thicker dup for the MAC 239 brush.</li>
            <li> More than one of these brushes is necessary for all makeup addicts!</li>
            <li> Super high quality and still cheaper than MAC for example.</li>
            <li> I think Sigma brushes are a good alternative to the more expensive MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying another one of these E55 brush because I just love it so much.</li>
            <li> I like how the bristles aren&#x27;t too long, which allows for better precision and control.</li>
            <li> I like the like the long brush stick which gives you more control of the brush when applying the eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This came promptly and is such a nice brush to work with- was definitely worth the extra money!</li>

            <li> Shipping was fast and I really like them.</li>
            <li> this brush is high quality, almost bought mac brand but decided to give this one a chance!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pick up much product.  </li>
            <li> I wear expensive makeup and by far best brushes!</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and applying eye shadow is a breeze with this brush!!!</li>
            <li> This is a must for eye make-up application - it is soft and does not shed - very affordable!</li>
            <li> I have used ELF brushes for eyeshadow for years and while they are nice for the price, I was never completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush for the money</li>
            <li> Very soft, yet very dense &amp; sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very soft, picks up eyeshadow very well.</li>
            <li> im into high end products</li>
            <li> I would order these brushes again - they are high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have some brushes from Coastal Scents even that pack color on a little better, and they are softer on your lid.  </li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about the quality of this brush being that I found it here on Amazon you can never be too sure.</li>
            <li> The bristles arrived wrinkled and have not yet returned to normal.</li>
            <li> I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s normal or not.</li>
            <li> It is very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure if it&#x27;s any better than a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> I definitely have other brushes that do a better job than this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tight and thick and applies beautifully.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It came with instructions on how to use, and a book full of their other brushes that you can purchase....which I will be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the larger side for a C-shaped shadow brush, but I think it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue for most people.</li>
            <li> Feels soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised with this brush.</li>
            <li> Soft, but not flimsy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably soft and has not shed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No shedding so far</li>
            <li> It packs on color really well, especially for shadows that are of a lower quality.</li>
            <li> The hairs are soft and pick up product well</li>
            <li> Surprised?  </li>
            <li> It is a complete opposit to MAC 239:</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft yet firm enough to be easy to guide.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended brand overall!</li>
            <li> No other shading brush can compare!</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with these, you will love any brush made by Sigma!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great quality and the price isn&#x27;t so bad either.</li>
            <li> I alternate this brush with the MAC 239 natural hair brush.</li>
            <li> I really like the fluffy, largest headed brush in the Real Techniques Basic Eye set</li>
            <li> sad because the brushes are nice.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s half the price of MAC&#x27;s brush</li>
            <li> I have used several different high quality brushes before and hadn&#x27;t found a size and shape that totally blew me away.  </li>
            <li> So if you want to splurge a little this brush is worth it, but it isn&#x27;t necessary.  </li>
            <li> What I like about it compared to other versions is that it is fairly small, with relatively short bristles, which gives me more control.  </li>
            <li> I have small eyelids and this brush actually gets right into my crease and glides effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go back to MAC brushes ever after using these high quality brushes for A LOT less!  </li>
            <li> But I just find this to be a bit large for my small eyelids as an all over shadow brush.</li>
            <li> The Sigma brush is soft but stiff enough to shade.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve cleaned it a few times with no trouble</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dense and soft, yet firm.</li>
            <li> A little pre-history: after watching lots of reviews on Youtube where everybody says that MAC 239 a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;, decided to treat my self for holidays and bought it at the local MAC counter (in our local mall).</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t regret a single dime.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and invested in some quality brushes and the E55</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a basic brush for laying down shadow on the lid.  </li>
            <li> It has soft, but stiff fibers that are not as itch as some of my other brushes.</li>
            <li> Not too soft not too hard.</li>
            <li> Its hard to be soft with this brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this one by mistake, actually wanting to order small shader.</li>
            <li> wish they said it&#x27;s not meant for small eyes or asian eyes.</li>
            <li> Would not buy another brush due to this problem..</li>
            <li> I will never use any other brushes again.</li>
            <li> I also feel like there is less fallout onto my cheek.</li>
            <li> but i also dont want to spend 30 dollars on a brush that i can find for half the price.</li>
            <li> Because MAC 239 was very stiff, hursh, small, did not pick up eyeshadows well enough, scratchy, etc.</li>
            <li> This is not original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little scratchy &amp; does an alright job with packing colour on.</li>
            <li> It really does work well applying my eye shadow with a thick consent coat, but I have less expensive brushes that work well too.  </li>
            <li> I also use it to blend in my eyeshadow so its not too harsh.  </li>
            <li> small eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li> Verdict:crap (at least for me).</li>
            <li> The package that was sent is not good.</li>
            <li> hated it with whole my heart- ended up by returning it to the MAC counter.</li>
            <li> Also the eye shadow does not fly all over the place as you&#x27;re applying it to your lid.</li>
            <li> It applied the shadow thinly and evenly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will be impossible to get help from sigma.</li>
            <li> Absolutely disappointed....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a good quality brush. I gave it three stars because my $3 brush from the drugstore does the same job just as well.</li>
            <li> I have used several different high quality brushes before and hadn&#x27;t found a size and shape that totally blew me away.  That was until my mom recently bought a palette from Tarte that included the best brush ever.  Since then, I have searched for a similar brush and I found this one.  I have not purchased Sigma brushes before, but I would purchase them again.  The size and shape is great and doesn&#x27;t apply too much or too little.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality brush, as all the ones from Sigma are. Super soft and washes well. But I just find this to be a bit large for my small eyelids as an all over shadow brush.</li>
            <li> This works great for applying color on the brow bone.  I also use it to blend in my eyeshadow so its not too harsh.  I love this brush!</li>
            <li> Nice compact bristles, picks up colors marvelously.  Feels soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love the product,it is awesome and the seller is excellent.Everything was just perfect including the quick delivery</li>
            <li> These are great brushes and this is a honest seller. Fast delivery and authentic products!!</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are a MUST have.  I wouldn&#x27;t go back to MAC brushes ever after using these high quality brushes for A LOT less!  This brush is perfect for packing on eyeshadow on the eye lid.</li>
            <li> Perfect texture and softness for applying eye makeup.  Not too soft not too hard.</li>
            <li> Sigma rocks!! Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this one by mistake, actually wanting to order small shader. BUT, i&#x27;m pretty happy with my \\&quot;mistake\\&quot; now :) ( even though i still need that small shader ) I was very pleasantly surprised with this brush. I use it to apply eyeshadow on my lid, but it&#x27;s great for blending, shading, building color and just about anything else to do with your eyes. It&#x27;s super soft but sturdy, as all Sigma brushes i have are. And no matter what type of look you prefer to have, you can accomplish it with this brush!</li>
            <li> I love this one. It&#x27;s good for padding colors on your eye lid with a clear edge. Definitely what I need.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a really good shading brush buy this one.  The bristles are so soft and picks up shadow beautifully, you will really be pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast. The seller kept me updated all the time. Will definitely buy from this seller again.  Love this eyeshadow brush, picks up eyeshadow really well and soft to the feel.  Blends my eyeshadow really well. No shedding noted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner with eye makeup. I&#x27;ve been using a cheap ELF brush for awhile, which was doing a decent job, and wanted to try out the true and tested Sigma brand. This is a fantastic brush. It has soft, but stiff fibers that are not as itch as some of my other brushes. I like the shorter bristles, and rounded edge, and find that I can place color more precisely. I also feel like there is less fallout onto my cheek. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and can&#x27;t wait to try out a few more brushes from Sigma.</li>
            <li> Great quality and works well.  It really does work well applying my eye shadow with a thick consent coat, but I have less expensive brushes that work well too.  I don&#x27;t think anyone should feel like they have to buy this brush in order to have nice looking eye shadow or this product will greatly improve the appearance of the eye shadow.  So if you want to splurge a little this brush is worth it, but it isn&#x27;t necessary.  I have several sigma brushes and love them all.</li>
            <li> beautiful brush! highly recommended brand overall! looking forward to ordering more Sigma brushes in the future after using this one!</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing the Sigma E55 shading brush. I think it&#x27;s a great brush for packing color on the lid and especially for cream products and also some of the new cream gel eye shadows. You get just the right amount of product and it deposits easily. I alternate this brush with the MAC 239 natural hair brush. That one works well for powder eye shadows. The price is reasonable, too. I think Sigma brushes are a good alternative to the more expensive MAC brushes. I have both in my eye shadow brush collection. This is a quality brush that does what it is supposed to do. The brush also holds its shape well after cleaning. An excellent value!</li>
            <li> Initially, after watching a couple of videos on how the MAC 239 brush was good for the eyelids I was eager to purchase it. But, then I stumbled on dupes and this one caught my attention. First, it&#x27;s half the price of MAC&#x27;s brush and once I received it, I couldn&#x27;t see myself purchasing it. It is the perfect size to fill in my inner and outer lids and I would reccomend this in need of a lid brush! I have yet tried the 239 brush but I&#x27;m not eager to it either.</li>
            <li> All my friends use the brushes of sigma, so I decided to try. The brushes are really good and the price are affordable. I recommend the brand.</li>
            <li> Great for applying shadow to brow line and lid.  Soft, but not flimsy.  I use this to apply all-over eye area, or just on lid.</li>
            <li> I love Sigma, always have and always will. The quality is good and it&#x27;s a cheaper alternative to MAC. Plus, the fur is much softer and it comes in many varieties of colors. I love how this eye shading brush is soft and it picks up a lot of color pigment. Definitely going to purchase more of Sigma products.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! I recommend!</li>
            <li> Love Sigma brushes for durability and ease of use. The bristles apply eye shadow well.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush! I have another shader brush but the quality of Sigma beats it every time! I will continue to build my Sigma collection, I love how soft and sturdy they are. I recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent for packing on color to eyelids!... I even found myself using it for blending in the crease area. The brush itself is well made, nicely dense and perfect fit for eyelids!!! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Puts the pigment on your eyelid and doesn&#x27;t stick in the brush</li>
            <li> just dont be a dillhole and buy that sheeet. honestly way better than anything ive used. this is just as good if not better than mac brushes :)i am in love with the sigma flat top brushes too :) also makeup geek has some amazing brushes tooo! i wouldnt lie im into high end products and i am a makeup artist alsoo. :)</li>
            <li> I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to blend color and result is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product and ship so fast, no need to drive to Macy and store !!</li>
            <li> This is the best shading brush that I have every used. I use to swear by MAC&#x27;s shading brushs but after this using this brush I will never go back to MAC. This brush is so soft and applying eye shadow is a breeze with this brush!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for packing the shadows on your lid. definitely a must for makeup lovers out there! Quality of this brush is amazing and no shedding at all on the first wash. What else can I say, its perfect!</li>
            <li> I ordered this through my husband&#x27;s account. It&#x27;s a pretty awesome brush. My make up artist friend recommended these as the best brand of brushes you&#x27;ll find. I found it to be very true.</li>
            <li> Great quality, great shipping everything great, but the brush is HUGE.&lt;br /&gt;Totally not for small eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Is just a personal thought, the rest was excellent, including the seller!&lt;br /&gt;I wish they said it&#x27;s not meant for small eyes or asian eyes.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for shading. It is very soft. I like how the bristles aren&#x27;t too long, which allows for better precision and control. Perfect!!! It shipped quickly and was packaged really well too.</li>
            <li> This is my go to brush for a variety of reasons. I use it to shade my eyelids and use as a highlighter as well. The cut and qualify of the brushes makes it very easy to apply my make-up.</li>
            <li> This is a must for eye make-up application - it is soft and does not shed - very affordable! Sigma brushes are great! I now want the entire collection.</li>
            <li> Nice product - exactly what I expected. It holds makeup very well and rather than hard bristles that put more product into the air than on your face, this is a nice applicator with an airy-blended look once applied to the face. I would order these brushes again - they are high quality.</li>
            <li> This is Legit!  better than my MAC brush</li>
            <li> PIcks up eyeshadows wonderfully. Love it</li>
            <li> Great brush to really pack on color. Very soft, yet very dense &amp; sturdy. Would be great to apply foiled shadows or shimmers &amp; glitters. Highly recommend this brush. I&#x27;ll pick this one over my MAC brushes that were double the price.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, and it&#x27;s a good quality brush. I have no complaints. I&#x27;m just not sure if it&#x27;s any better than a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> Loved!!! Great brush and amazing quality! Definitely recommend. You surely can&#x27;t beat the price! I wear expensive makeup and by far best brushes!</li>
            <li> This brush is an essential!  It picks up a ton of color and is a great brush for make up beginners or experts.  Easy to clean, soft, and dense bristles.  I use this brush daily for my eyeshadow and will definitely be getting another E55 when I need to replace my current one.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It applies the eye shadow across my lid evenly. Also the eye shadow does not fly all over the place as you&#x27;re applying it to your lid. It&#x27;s very precise. I also have the perfect blending kit from Sigma. I highly recommend these brushes. They&#x27;re great quality and the price isn&#x27;t so bad either. Super high quality and still cheaper than MAC for example.</li>
            <li> I like this brush.  I don&#x27;t love this brush.  It is great for packing on color on your lid but works much better with a little moisture on the brush.  Doesn&#x27;t grab hold of product that well, I feel.  I have some brushes from Coastal Scents even that pack color on a little better, and they are softer on your lid.  Its hard to be soft with this brush.  You have to use quite a bit of pressure.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to. Works very well. It also cleans well. Love Sigma brushes so far.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about the quality of this brush being that I found it here on Amazon you can never be too sure. But I am so pleased with my perchase and I don&#x27;t regret a single dime. I think it does well at blending the shadow and the brush has held together well even after being washed several times. I am not a pro make up artist but i also dont want to spend 30 dollars on a brush that i can find for half the price. The product was great.</li>
            <li> I was going to order the travel kit from the Sigma website, but did not want all the brushes in the set.  When I saw they had them on Amazon individually, I decided to get just the ones I wanted.  I&#x27;m so glad I did! They are as great as everyone says and I love this particular brush for patting eyeshadow on my lids. I got 3 brushes I wanted for way cheaper than buying the set that had brushes I didn&#x27;t want and not all the brushes I wanted.  If that makes sense.  Anyway I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It blends really well!</li>
            <li> i love this brush, perfect application. need to buy more and use for ALL my shadows. perfect size weight and great for strokes</li>
            <li> I only own 3 or 4 Sigma brushes bu tthis has been a favorite! It hold a good amount of product and is the perfect size for my lids:)</li>
            <li> Excellent brush!  Perfect!  Love!</li>
            <li> Very soft, picks up eyeshadow very well. Glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush, well worth it</li>
            <li> My favorite brushes!!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this brush!</li>
            <li> It is a great brush. I use it. I like it. Does exactly what it says it does. Good quality.  Apply it in patting motions for more depth coverage.</li>
            <li> Very nice, dense, soft, and sturdy. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better!</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush for applying all over base eye shadow color, and is very good quality for the price!</li>
            <li> This brush is great for applying lid color. It&#x27;s reasonably soft and has not shed. It&#x27;s a little on the larger side for a C-shaped shadow brush, but I think it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue for most people. It&#x27;s a bit more full (thickness) than it may appear in these pictures.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Easy to use and sufficient coverage to a specific area. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I heard that it was a really good brush because it packed on eyeshadow w/o much fallout. And it&#x27;s true! This brush is best for patting (or packing ) on shadow more than for sweeping. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a MAC only convert, I was able to buy 3 sigma brushes for the price of one MAC brush!&lt;br /&gt;I use this everyday for precise application of eyeshadow, works great for pigments and anything that you want to push onto the lid (creams/high fallout eyeshadows)&lt;br /&gt;No shedding so far and I&#x27;ve cleaned it a few times with no trouble</li>
            <li> Love love love the Sigma brushes. I finally broke down and invested in some quality brushes and the E55 is my favorite eye shadow brush, whether I&#x27;m using my elf palette or the Wet-n-Wild palettes or even now using some of my mineral Bare Escentuals eye makeup. I love the quality of the brush, it is perfect for working the color into the eye, and I expect it to last a long time. It&#x27;s tight and thick and applies beautifully. Love It!</li>
            <li> This came promptly and is such a nice brush to work with- was definitely worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> Fabulous make up brush ~ Sigma brushes are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. You cannot go wrong with these, you will love any brush made by Sigma!</li>
            <li> Better than MAC! It applies like a dream!</li>
            <li> I have used ELF brushes for eyeshadow for years and while they are nice for the price, I was never completely satisfied. I decided to get the Sigma brush after reading reviews, and I am really happy. It packs on color really well, especially for shadows that are of a lower quality. It&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
            <li> This Sigma brush definitely lives up to the hype! I&#x27;ve used MAC and other good quality brushes but this brush exceeded my expectations. The hairs are soft and pick up product well and it  feels sturdy and well-made.</li>
            <li> I think sigma can definitely give Mac a run for there money on quality and durability. They definitely got them beat on the prices lol. This brush only cost $9.00.I highly recommend these brushes to anyone that loves quality!!</li>
            <li> Surprised?  I&#x27;m not! :)&lt;br /&gt;It came with instructions on how to use, and a book full of their other brushes that you can purchase....which I will be.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Absolutely my go to brush for packing on shadow on the lid</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for applying eye shadow to the lid. I do own the Mac 239, which I love, but the sigma is comparable. The Mac 239 is slightly smaller in comparison. I use both for different application purposes.</li>
            <li> I love watching makeup videos and I noticed how girls on them always seem to use brushes like this one to pack on the color. So I ordered one and saw why they were all using them. The brush is super soft and still compact. Its size made it perfect for the lid and really anywhere on the eye (that being said I do have big eyes). Still I think it would be perfect for any girl and for any job on the eye.</li>
            <li> This brush is well made and places the product very nicely onto my eye lids. I look forward to purchasing more from Sigma!</li>
            <li> I love the Sigma brushes. This is the 5th Sigma brush I&#x27;ve purchased since last year. They are good quality brushes and work well with makeup. I can&#x27;t wait to use this shadow brush tomorrow...</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush for the money</li>
            <li> Great brush and picks up the product well!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> lo que yo esperaba y me funciona sigma es lo mejor, y llego a tiempo, y escuchado tanto acerca de este producto que supero mis espectativas, viva sigma</li>
            <li> The brush is all good. The package that was sent is not good. The bristles arrived wrinkled and have not yet returned to normal.</li>
            <li> I use this brush every day. I use it to pat eyeshadow on my lids.</li>
            <li> Great brush!  This is a Sigma authorized seller according to the Sigma site, so you are in good hands purchasing through this one.  Either way, the brush works great.  It&#x27;s dense and soft, yet firm.</li>
            <li> I got this brush to replace a similar brush from another brand that was starting to fray.  Right off the bat, you can tell that the quality of the brush is very soft.  When I applied the eyeshadow, it picked up the color very nicely and I didn&#x27;t have to dust any off to avoid a cakey look.  It applied the shadow thinly and evenly. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> this brush is the best brush for applying eyeshadow, its works so nice and soft, some of the brushes hurts your eye when u use them but this one is amazing</li>
            <li> All these years, I&#x27;ve used the sponge applicators that came with my eye shadow, but since I recently bought some shadow that didn&#x27;t come with the applicator, I bought a brush.  What a difference!  This brush is quality; I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and it has yet to shed at all.  The bristles are soft yet firm enough to be easy to guide.  The brush applies the shadow smoothly, quickly, and evenly and feels very gentle on my eyelids.  I just wish I&#x27;d known sooner how much easier it is to apply eye shadow with a brush!</li>
            <li> I always use this brush when I do my eye make up. It&#x27;s the best all over eye lid brush. It packs on shadows so good on my lids. I use this brush and wash this brush so much and it&#x27;s still in great shape. No other shading brush can compare!</li>
            <li> A little pre-history: after watching lots of reviews on Youtube where everybody says that MAC 239 a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;, decided to treat my self for holidays and bought it at the local MAC counter (in our local mall). Used it for about one week- hated it with whole my heart- ended up by returning it to the MAC counter. Why? Because MAC 239 was very stiff, hursh, small, did not pick up eyeshadows well enough, scratchy, etc. It was like to use a kitchen spatula... Verdict:crap (at least for me). Absolutely disappointed....&lt;br /&gt; So, after reading reviews about Sigma E55, desided to give this one a try, because I still needed a brush to apply my eyeshadows. And I&#x27;m very glad I did! After the very first use of this brush I just &amp;#34;fell in love&amp;#34; with it, if i can say that. It is a complete opposit to MAC 239: E55 is dens, but in the same time very soft and awesomely gentl (like a cloud), it picks up eyeshadows so dem&#x27;n well and, of course, applies them, no metter they are powdered or pressed, with glitter or matte. You just want to us it more and more. That&#x27;s how good this one is. I am thinking to buy another one as a back up. Would I recomend this brush?Definitely YES, to everybody who wants to apply eyeshadows with joy. But, who has very itchy eyelids and needs a good scratch, go for MAC 239 :).</li>
            <li> Perfect packs in all the color I need</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  This brush puts on color in just the amount you want.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I needed good blending brushes but I canâ€™t afford a 25-35$ for a mac brush. So I asked around and seen that sigma are as good as mac but cheaper so I got the E35,E25 E30 E55 E45 and the E40. They are very good and soft, very easy to use and clean. Shipping was fast and I really like them. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5, when I washed them some of the hair came out. It was the first time I cleaned them.  I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s normal or not. I havenâ€™t tried cleaning them again Iâ€™m scared.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are the best, I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li> Me encanta esta brocha, las sombras quedan perfectas, es muy suave y se desliza muy bien en mis ojos, estoy feliz con ella.</li>
            <li> One of the best eyeshadow brushes I have ever own. This brush applies eyeshadow pigment very well and precise. The hair on the brush feel of very high quality. I like the like the long brush stick which gives you more control of the brush when applying the eyeshadow. I will definitely be buying another one of these E55 brush because I just love it so much. This Sigma brush is definitely a must-have!</li>
            <li> I love Sigma, always have and always will. The quality is good and it&#x27;s a cheaper alternative to MAC. Plus, the fur is much softer and it comes in many varieties of colors. I love how this eye shading brush is soft and it picks up a lot of color pigment. Definitely going to purchase more of Sigma products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several Sigma eyeshadow brushes and this is my favourite. It&#x27;s a basic brush for laying down shadow on the lid.  What I like about it compared to other versions is that it is fairly small, with relatively short bristles, which gives me more control.  Excellent quality and synthetic (cruelty free).  For crease brushes, on the other hand, I have found Hourglass has the best.  For blending out existing shadows and just blurring the lines between colours I really like the fluffy, largest headed brush in the Real Techniques Basic Eye set (it&#x27;s the only one I really like in that set, but it&#x27;s so good it&#x27;s worth the money and I&#x27;m not a really big RT fan.)  All of these use synthetic hair.  Beware the white haired eye brushes, which are often goat hair.  If you have allergies to horses like me, any hair from hoofed animals is risky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about the Sigma brushes, and had to try one for myself. Packs on color very well, and is a great shading tool. I would definitely buy more from the Sigma Collection!</li>
            <li> this brush is high quality, almost bought mac brand but decided to give this one a chance! I use it every day!!</li>
            <li> The brush is fine but the company is no help when a problem arises...so just be warned if you have an issue&lt;br /&gt;It will be impossible to get help from sigma. Would not buy another brush due to this problem..&lt;br /&gt;How sad because the brushes are nice.</li>
            <li> I only use this brush when putting eyeshadow on my lid. It packs the product on really well the brush is super soft.</li>
            <li> Look no further for the perfect shade brush. I have small eyelids and this brush actually gets right into my crease and glides effortlessly. Love it.</li>
            <li> one of the best ive tried</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I was expecting for the eye lid.  It doesn&#x27;t pick up much product.  I actually use it for crease and it works well for that.</li>
            <li> Good quality bristles</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect. After always using drugstore brand brushes I decided to see what the hype was about with the Sigma brushes. I will never use any other brushes again. The Sigma brush is soft but stiff enough to shade. Most brushes are too prickly for me and cause my eyelids to swell. Not with this brush. The amount of eyeshadow it picks up is amazing. Now I see what the hype is about and I am a Sigma Believer!</li>
            <li> This is not original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little scratchy &amp; does an alright job with packing colour on. I think Sigma could distribute these brushes for a lower price. I definitely have other brushes that do a better job than this one. Quality 3.5/5.</li>
            <li> Great brush&lt;br /&gt;Evenly distributes make up</li>
            <li> Just received my Sigma eye shading-E55 brush. I love the soft bristles. It makes appling eye shadow so easy. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush Sigma is a great company however the brush came chipped and its such a pain to return the item. However the item its self and what its meant to do its great. It blends eye shadows great</li>
            <li> Really easy to use and worked perfectly. Haven&#x27;t cleaned it yet but it looks like it&#x27;ll be great for washing. The brushes are soft but super dense, which is great for shading. 5 stars :)</li>
            <li> The sigma brushes are fantastic. The density, softness, and color transfer is comparable to that of Mac or NARS brushes. The E55 is a personal favorite, and a softer, thicker dup for the MAC 239 brush. More than one of these brushes is necessary for all makeup addicts!</li>
            <li> I am loving my brush! I am sure to be ordering more very soon</li>
            <li> Really nice, does what its supposed to</li>
