            <li>Works great for that style.</li>
            <li>Great for tycoons, spikes, and holds well.</li>
            <li>While some of these are wonderful in their own way, the Gatsby line is</li>

            <li>Great product for holding hair</li>
            <li>They have a great hold to them.</li>
            <li>If you already use this then you can agree that it&#x27;s a fairly great product (despite its price for a hair product).</li>
            <li>If you have hair around the lenght showed on the products picture this will work great for you.</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Also, the price is amazing!</li>
            <li>Ok so let me start off by saying how awesome the shipping was.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a hair product that I am happy with that provides a matte finish with good control, without the crunchy gel-type feeling.  </li>
            <li>Oh and it&#x27;s awesome for asian hair not the best but awesome.</li>
            <li>Great hold strong and with excellent control.  </li>
            <li>There is also a fairly pleasant smell to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just fun for me!!!!</li>
            <li>Very pleased to make my boyfriend happy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>I like Spice Sisters since they are not \\&quot;as hard\\&quot; as these Gastby, good over all product for the price.</li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for spikes, hawks, sticking up, sticking out, gravity defying styles.</li>
            <li>Good control</li>
            <li>Good hold, good smell, no sticky or shiny</li>
            <li>smells good.</li>
            <li>Good hold just have to learn what amount you need to use.</li>
            <li>as a good started as it&#x27;s like a sampler pack.</li>
            <li>It provides a matte finish with good hold and plenty of flexibility.  </li>
            <li>This product is good for stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>everything is good about this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the \\&quot;Air rise\\&quot; which is good too but probably for a bit longer of hair than</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>Great for spiking medium hair, great texture look, but doesnt feel fantastic to touch  Nuance Motion:</li>
            <li>more lol.</li>
            <li>Quality, authentic stuff, works great.</li>
            <li>great product none greasy love</li>
            <li>so i was really happy and pleased to find that out.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably good to own both.</li>
            <li>Wild shake is a great hair product that works best on medium hair</li>
            <li>I had it thinned as is recommended by people who have been able to use this product successfully, but my result was a head of hair that was frizzy all over as if I&#x27;d just been rubbing a balloon on my head.</li>
            <li>My hair sticks up, more so on the sides and with this it manages it!</li>
            <li>Kudos for amazon carrying this  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>First of all they are great!  </li>
            <li>very good product we like very cool and stylish</li>
            <li>My favorite part of all of the Gatsby products is the pleasant smell, but this one was a bit lacking in that respect.</li>
            <li>when I want a light hold, it still has great control with a matte appearance.</li>
            <li>Amazing strength</li>
            <li>Your hair can be reshaped all day and has an amazing apple</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I am using it at a daily basis and work just perfect.</li>
            <li>Really holds and smells great!</li>
            <li>I did NOT order two day shipping, i think the supplier is just awesome haha.</li>
            <li>THE WA- ALSO NICE TEXTURE OF THE CONTAINER.</li>
            <li>kind of way.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice hold to your hair</li>
            <li>My hair stays in place all day with a nice, matte finish.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>Kind of just made my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>It washes out without a problem in warm water</li>
            <li>It smells good and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds great for about 10 hours and you hair does not look super wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it boasts, perfect to make nice spikes but yet retains a moveable and manageable hold...even on baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Product works great, is a fair and reasonable price, shipped the day after I purchased it.</li>
            <li>ITS VERY STRONG, SO</li>
            <li>I buy this for my husband, he loves this product and says it&#x27;s the most effective wax he&#x27;s had.</li>
            <li>But after using the recommended amount (and slightly more), I found it held amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Really nice, since most of my gels wear off from just being out side for a period of time.</li>
            <li>This purple one has a nice hold but is still more creamy than clay like.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>So strong you can style even after you shower and wash your hair!</li>
            <li>Smells great, but is very very sticky in hair.</li>
            <li>,it&#x27;s not my first time using this product , it&#x27;s  really great</li>
            <li>Awesome for early mornings cause it messes up your hair, adds a bit of volume, and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can also style it in a more formal look with this paste.</li>
            <li>This product is phenomenal and works with almost anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing works better.</li>
            <li>My favorite at the moment.</li>
            <li>Never feels like too much product is in your hair, and holds great.</li>
            <li>Otherwise ok product.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product - the smell, how it feels, and after application.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s better for thicker hair, etc.</li>
            <li>Then I read more about this product and its users</li>
            <li>Which means I&#x27;d have to wait on using this product for many months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll experiment more with it and update when I get a chance.</li>
            <li>Goes on great and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>Glad I stumbled upon this product.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to do anything with it.</li>
            <li>(~2-4 inches, give or take) with a more relaxed style (i.e., not sharpened to a spike.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my aunt as its her favorite hair wax.</li>
            <li>Better than what i thought.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>GATSBY MAKES SOME OF THE BEST PRODUCTS AND THIS DOESN&#x27;T FALL SHORT...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but i love the way it works.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brand to anyone, just make sure you look at their chart of different products and choose the one with the correct texture for you and the one which is best for your hair type and length.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more and trying out others as well.</li>
            <li>Top quality styling wax.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>Hair spray on top does not work/.   2.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m buying more of this when I run out</li>
            <li>Perfect for holding short to medium hair.</li>
            <li>Has a more naturual look and feel than gel.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite hair putty.</li>
            <li>Like the Spike Edge a bit more.</li>
            <li>I love Gatsby and I have many colors.</li>
            <li>Better for shorter hair I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>using gatsby make us exceptionally glad</li>
            <li>However, when I put it on my hair, it worked like magic to hold my stubborn hair like magic.  </li>
            <li>It also holds a lot better.</li>
            <li>but since there isn&#x27;t, amazon is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>I like the Red one the best.</li>
            <li>Way better than any products that are in stores.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>A bit more sticky than I had thought it would be, but it does indeed hold up throughout the day, and then some.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Or use a bit more and you can be quite creative!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have finally found the perfect hair wax.</li>
            <li>Because of the properties of this wax, I am able to keep my hair from covering my ears, which has always been affecting my hearing.</li>
            <li>Spiky edge/wild shake combo is what i use depending on the length of my hair and they both work phenomenally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you have read reviews on Gatsby products.  </li>
            <li>The gatsby doesn&#x27;t hold what I want all day but it&#x27;s better than chia hair.</li>
            <li>Best wax i have tried on the market compare to the american ones</li>
            <li>xoxo very nice very style</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this purchase I am definitely going to buy more!</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good, and i recommend it.</li>
            <li>Thinning out your hair makes it more fine, which makes it lighter and more moveable.</li>
            <li>So once you get your hair more thinned out, more fine and flexible, this product will do wonders for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This works best on dry hair and not damp hair.</li>
            <li>i love this product, those asians really know thier stuff when it comes to hair wax, and it smells sooooo good, if i could eat</li>
            <li>Natural shine, workable, great hold.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see that this product is paraben free.</li>
            <li>Works better than that cheap Axe hair wax stuff.</li>
            <li>i tried first and it was by far the best product ive ever tried, even compared to a bottle of Aquage transforming paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>some - but in my case that&#x27;s a good thing because my hair stands straight up if there is no product in it.</li>
            <li>Very good for the simple fact that it is easy to work into longer hair.</li>
            <li>No shine, no mess, just a great product.</li>
            <li>The right amount, which I never seem to get onto my finger, is amazing.</li>
            <li>the best texture and hold for my hair compared to the other Gatsby products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Pliable, easy to reshape.  </li>
            <li>easy to put it and use.</li>
            <li>Strong, but washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>Strong hold.</li>
            <li>Strong hold as advertised.</li>
            <li>It has a strong hold and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as strong as bed head.</li>
            <li>Yet it&#x27;s still strong, unlike lots of gels.</li>
            <li>Leave it to Japan to make an amazing product ;)</li>
            <li>Been using gatsby since 6th grade, the purple one is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best product I have ever used in my hair.  </li>
            <li>It washes out just fine.</li>
            <li>Luckily for you, you have stumbled upon your solution!</li>
            <li>Cheap and work super well!</li>
            <li>The product has the best hold out of any hair wax I have used with just a little bit of shine.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try Gatsby, however, after years of hearing how great it holds.</li>
            <li>This gets the job done with a strong clean hold.</li>
            <li>Its a great product to use daily</li>
            <li>Asian hair + gatsby &#x3D; win.  </li>
            <li>It holds my hair in place really well and looks really nice.</li>
            <li>Which brings me to the next point: it&#x27;s re-workable until the moment you wash it off, which is great if you&#x27;re trying to fix a droopy piece halfway through your day.    </li>
            <li>It has a pliable, flexible, matte looking hold perfect for creating pieced, spiked, messy hairstyles.</li>
            <li>All in all a great product for short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li>I have always struggled to find a good product for my picky hair, and I think I may have found it with the Gatsby Moving Rubber Wild Shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice, easy to use, holds you hair for a long time, easy to wash off and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Works best if hair is dry first.</li>
            <li>True strong, rubber hold with no flaking or stiffness.</li>
            <li>People say that this this mold is supposed to be super strong.</li>
            <li>Well the day it came in I was excited</li>
            <li>I was using, this stuff is pretty cheap too!</li>
            <li>Very good hold for pin straight Asian hair.</li>
            <li>Superior to Axe products (not hard to believe) and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Wild Shake Gatsby is perfect for those of us with short hair.</li>
            <li>Before this product I used the Bumble &amp; Bumble Sumo Tech Styling Wax, which is still a favorite, but the Gatsby product just seems to work with my hair in a much more natural way.</li>
            <li>I was usimg the the pink spikey edge, which is great for shorter hair.</li>
            <li>The wild shake comes in a soft touch purple rubber container that is aesthetically beautiful.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product for medium hair and makes my hair look natural and controlled.</li>
            <li>product did not hold a full 48 hours.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, it&#x27;s really frizzy.</li>
            <li>To apply, take a nickel-sized amount and rub it between your palms until it&#x27;s warm and soft.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking to be cool, this is the one to get.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried, Gatsby Moving Rubber is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>Product works great, and smells better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried; shipping was fast and without any issues.</li>
            <li>It has that lowered down hold compared to the spiky edge but still a good hold, overall its great product.</li>
            <li>I discovered Gatsby a few years ago and really its the best brand of hair styling stuff I have used.</li>
            <li>I can confirm that this is the best styling pomade for men with shorter hair (regardless of whether it is fine, super fine, medium, or thicker hair) -- if, like me, you have more complex medium-ish-short hair that needs some pomade before getting the suit on and going to work, but you have fine/wavy or fine/straight hair, then this works great but the Gatsby Air Rise (green tin) works way better because it doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair at all.</li>
            <li>fun.&lt;br /&gt;Girls respond to a stylish modern man, so keep your hair stylish and classy</li>
            <li>These are surprisingly clean though, as far as these things go, perhaps because it is made in Japan (they may have more strict standards).</li>
            <li>i like this good quality ship very fast and it is same as introduced</li>
            <li>Loose Shuffle was my previous favorite for holding my spikes on the top and back of my head, Air Rise was my favorite for my sides as it gave a nice teased look, and Grunge Mat was nice for thinning and defining hair bundles even more for certain styles.</li>
            <li>So bottom line, they&#x27;re all great if you know what they&#x27;re for and after trying em on short and long hair, still love em.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome to say the least!</li>
            <li>It truly lasts all day and more; I&#x27;ve slept in it and it still held strong for the next morning.</li>
            <li>The product washes out extremely easily and if there&#x27;s still some left over, make sure to use conditioner as it&#x27;ll get the remainder out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product that gives your hair a that controlled but messy look, then this will be great for you.  </li>
            <li>The scent of green apples is great.</li>
            <li>and I can restyle it more naturally.</li>
            <li>But all the asian models you see trying this product out, look at their hair closely, it&#x27;s been thinned out (most likely for months and months before) and layered by professionals, making the hair more manageable and the product makes the hair 90% better looking.</li>
            <li>I kind of kicking myself for not finding this earlier...</li>
            <li>So it totally worth trying.</li>
            <li>This stuff is seriously worth the money.</li>
            <li>Usually I love opening a new container and using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of products, including other Gatsby products, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This product works great, hold hair in place, but not too stiff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use a comb right after applying it.</li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that way you use the right amount and not have to replace it so soon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to hold most of your hair and is really flexible.</li>
            <li>I am now able to sit in the back row in class with the cool kids and still hear the professor.</li>
            <li>I recently tried RedKin hair wax which was good for short hair, but just left my medium hair length floppy, and it took a good 20 minutes to get it fully in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are more fair haired and your hair is thin and straight, you&#x27;ll get the full benefit of this as I found out by giving the rest of mine to a friend.  </li>
            <li>Spiky Edge: A more intense version of wild shake.</li>
            <li>Product gives hair a natural look and the hold is quite strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched for the best hair styling product for me and have settled on a few different products that I use depending on the situation.  </li>
            <li>Holds really well, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>But I pretty much like it if I&#x27;m in the rush and just need a quick touch</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair.</li>
            <li>Hard to wash out, but otherwise works great for my medium-length &amp;#34;faux-hawk&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this &amp;#34;Wildshake&amp;#34; (purple tin) and the &amp;#34;Air Rise&amp;#34; (green tin) after doing several hours worth of research on finding the best possible pomade for men with fine, short/medium hair.</li>
            <li>Never even had to bother touching it for almost the entire day.</li>
            <li>I am able to spike my hair which lasts the entire day, even on windy days.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve used many kinds of wax and gel throughout the years and stages of my hairstyles, Gatsby beats them all especially for my style</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that my hair seems to be stuck together - I can&#x27;t use that sexy, run-my-fingers-through-my-hair move.  </li>
            <li>I have used Crew Fiber (blue top) for years.</li>
            <li>This isnt quite the same as it is more creamy</li>
            <li>but I use tea trea shampoo first and that gets it out.</li>
            <li>Yes, I keep my hair short to medium in length, more of the atheletic look.  </li>
            <li>Now Gatsby Moving Rubber gives me an interesting look no matter how I use it, and it lasts the entire day!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly that.</li>
            <li>That is particularly evident because it doesn&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li>This is my first gatsby and it styles the way I want it too look without looking unnatural.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gatsby!</li>
            <li>These products are way better than some of the American Crew products.</li>
            <li>My son absolutely loves this stuff!  </li>
            <li>the exact way I want it and</li>
            <li>This is actually my first time ordering one for myself, but I know how this product works.</li>
            <li>As for as description, it&#x27;s exactly as described.</li>
            <li>have a hairstyle you want for a whole day, even if you get water on yoself!</li>
            <li>The gray one is better and i recommend it for people who have short to medium hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft wax in the container, but after you put a little on your palm and rub your hands together, then run your hands through your hair, it provides great all day hold.  </li>
            <li>I found works best is while my hair is shorter and wants to stay down i used the Pink \\&quot;spiky edge\\&quot; to maintain my style throughout the day.</li>
            <li>For most asian guys, it&#x27;s the side of the head that really gets us.</li>
            <li>the product its self worked wonderfully with my thick asian hair.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews on this and 98% of them of all positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as any of the other products I mentioned earlier, and has a strong sort of latex or silicone rubber smell to it.</li>
            <li>You will know the next day at the shower, it will not be easy to take off..</li>
            <li>I think because it doesn&#x27;t absorb and become greasy, I now notice more how dry my hair is.</li>
            <li>If you are willing to have great styled hair, but not great feeling hair</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend American Crew - Fiber instead.</li>
            <li>and they are designed to be used for certain hair lengths.  </li>
            <li>The key to finding a great product is trying enough different ones to see exactly what works for you.</li>
            <li>I have short curly fine hair</li>
            <li>So if you have MY type of  hair as I have described above, and it is not thinned out or fine by a salon, then this product will not do anything for you.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of a dry feeling product (like rubber!).</li>
            <li>It is pretty decent for its price and does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>I have straight black hair and was trying different products to give me a more interesting look.</li>
            <li>How to know you used to much..?</li>
            <li>Moved instead to pomade, which holds much much much...better.</li>
            <li>It makes the hair styling so much easier.</li>
            <li>It smells great and takes only a tiny amount to obtain the same style that would have involved a lot of gel and hairspray.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My hair type is straight</li>
            <li>It felt cheap and when I put it in my hair, my hair looked the same before I put the stuff in.</li>
            <li>And fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of this and the way it works on my longer hair days.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but it makes my hair very sticky</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;d suggest this product if you&#x27;re looking for something simple and cheap and works like it should.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>You really have to try all the colors.</li>
            <li>This one adds a bit too much volume.</li>
            <li>Very moldable throughout the day, too.</li>
            <li>I am very displeased with this.</li>
            <li>This thing can cost as much as 20 dollars and hair addicts will clamor for it .</li>
            <li>It just goes to show the company really cares about affordability in its customers.</li>
            <li>and I think it is very creative!&lt;br</li>
            <li>make sure its not too wet</li>
            <li>I know these products are aimed for people that have hair like asians, but they worked really well for me even though I have hair nothing like asains.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can find it SOOO much cheaper online.</li>
            <li>This does absolutely nothing, except make my hair smell like product.</li>
            <li>and they all seem to work terribly with my hair type; However this product is awesome and sculpts my hair perfectly and keeps it messy spiked</li>
            <li>The pink has more hold</li>
            <li>for others: follow the instruction on their website, it really helps</li>
            <li>it makes your hair really sticky once you apply</li>
            <li>This product did not work for me, it didn&#x27;t hold up as much as the gray one did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I like to use all natural products that are known to be safe for personal care use.</li>
            <li>Green one is also nice.</li>
            <li>It Creates fullness, sharp edges, and clean styles even with a head full of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It keeps everything in place and does not look or feel stiff or leave any kind of residue.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it&#x27;s super light, so it doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair at all.</li>
            <li>Really strong wax, holds well for really long time.</li>
            <li>Love this product.. don&#x27;t think I will buy another hair mesh other than this one.</li>
            <li>The best hairstyling product is this one can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li>This wax functioned better than clay, promade (spelling goof), and other stuff.</li>
            <li>It takes A LONG time for my hair to get all fine and flexible from thinning at the salon.</li>
            <li>The cream is too sticky, and easy to become dry.</li>
            <li>For the past few years I have been trying to find the perfect hair holding product.</li>
            <li>Probably my least favorite, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Works great for medium length, thick, fine hair to achieve a messy look.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a hair product with strong hold, that doesn&#x27;t loose effect over the day, and that doesn&#x27;t have a greasy or oily look or build up....</li>
            <li>If your hair is kind of soft, you don&#x27;t need to use just a bit, and even the next day, you may wake up with the same look you went to bed..</li>
            <li>Funny, they call it wild shake</li>
            <li>Also, I love how the product isn&#x27;t gross and sticky like regular hair gel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I searched all of the ingredients, and nothing was listed as medium or high concern, except for \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;--but</li>
            <li>Then I use a high end shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s what you get when you order high quality Gatsby from Mandom.</li>
            <li>I used this product during my high school years because my brother had it.</li>
            <li>hold strength won&#x27;t last long, but you can always re-style your hair pretty easy over the time.</li>
            <li>After trying many hair waxes, gels, mousses, pomades, sprays, and whatever those kids make in their kitchens or labs and subjecting them to my thick unruly Asian hair, Gatsby moving rubber hair waxes is one of the very few hair products that seems to work reliably and makes sure hair stylish and popping.</li>
            <li>For me personally, I have a ton of hair, but it&#x27;s all Spanish hair - fine, silky and not super volume-rich after putting most pomades into it (because most of them weigh the hair down and flatten it).</li>
            <li>Little bit more pricey</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and pliant and you can really work with it.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair naturally (normal white-guy hair)</li>
            <li>Works for long hair, but you&#x27;ll have to use a lot and is much better for short --&gt;</li>
            <li>I thought this product will do wonders for my hair, even at its normal state.</li>
            <li>Gatsby Purple has found a slot especially for when I have a fresh haircut, for day-to-day situations.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and  types of wax but so far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>and this is pretty much the only product I use for my hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through numerous types of hair gel and wax over the years, and my previous best was the stuff you find in salons - American Crew Fibaer ($15), but have since settled on Gatsy Moving Rubber Purple (and the Pink one as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s not hard and crunchy like hair gels.</li>
            <li>Most products I&#x27;ve tried went dull pretty early in the day.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give much poof to my layered hair, but it gives it enough to make it seem like my hair isn&#x27;t so thin :P</li>
            <li>The effect is kind of like hair spray, except that you can actually reshape your hair over and over again with little loss of effect.</li>
            <li>I picked up a little jar of Gatsby Wild Shake by chance at the convenience store and found my new favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;m really happy with Wild Shake, have gotten tons of compliments, and I&#x27;m curious to try other Gatsby products in the future.</li>
            <li>Has a really subtle scent and looks nice.</li>
            <li>Great product that is hard to find in the U.S.other than at the occasional Japanese grocer / market.  </li>
            <li>Spikes almost as well as wild shake!  </li>
            <li>It held up all day in the hot sun and into the NEXT day, too!</li>
            <li>After reading several reviews, I decided to try out Gatsby for the first time and it didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>With this \\&quot;moving rubber,\\&quot; my hair actually holds its shape pretty well, yet it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s anything in it, and the product doesn&#x27;t seem to contribute to greasiness over time at all.</li>
            <li>For Asian men hair, its much better than the most expensive gel i buy.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It keeps it up and looks natural!</li>
            <li>I sat next to the hot girls.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t frizz up right away, but after setting for a few minutes it pops right up.  </li>
            <li>If I use too much product, my hair will look a little &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; but a quick tussle</li>
            <li>First it was blue hair gel that had little or no hold, and then thick gel which was great for my spiky hair.</li>
            <li>Something typical asian hair (like mine) isn&#x27;t able to do.</li>
            <li>Even though this product is for asian hair and it says it does wonders for typical asian hair, it supposedly only works on asian hair that has been thinned out and altered to be more fine in texture.</li>
            <li>The wax itself is actually pretty soft, almost a creamy paste consistency, so it was a little deceiving when I first opened the tub.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m just conscious to use a little extra conditioner to make sure my hair is well</li>
            <li>not only did the look last all day, but his hair actually looked better the next day!  </li>
            <li>Wild Shake:</li>
            <li>Get a natural look with a medium hold</li>
            <li>hair product is going to make your hair gone wild.</li>
            <li>This is wild &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.I&#x27;m almost 70 years old</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m experimenting,but I also bought another type - the wet/shine look.</li>
            <li>my hair feels soft when using the product.</li>
            <li>but no where near the amount I used to and with this, my style holds all day.  </li>
            <li>This hair wax works really well, especially for short to medium length straight hair.</li>
            <li>I read and saw reviews saying it can really style asian hair</li>
            <li>Works so well for straighter Asian hair compared to the products you would normally available in your local drugstore, supermarket, or big box store.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t make my hair appear &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, but a natural look.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t know how this product is, they sent me spikey edge instead of wild shake.</li>
            <li>I have short layers and to medium length hair in some parts but this stuff really lifts up the layers how I wanted it.  </li>
            <li>hair looks Naturally mess.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a white guy with medium length naturally straight hair</li>
            <li>I have tried most products out there (American Crew, Bumble and Bumble, Kevin Murphy, Got2B, Moosehead, Dax, Garnier, Redken, Schwarzkopf, Bedhead and Paul Mitchell to name a few).</li>
            <li>Once you thin your hair out, layered it, and over a few months your hair begins to change in texture, it&#x27;s finer, more soft, more movable and thinner, THEN you can use this product.</li>
            <li>The expensive stuff you buy at the stylist held out for a good portion of the day.</li>
            <li>If push came to shove, I would say, I choose the Spiky Edge for really short hair (like a flat top or military look) and I choose the Wild Shake for hair that is noticeably longer.  </li>
            <li>Many are not strong or resilient enough for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More than any other product I have tried, this stuff actually creates lasting body in the hair without any shiny residue.</li>
            <li>Hair becomes really simple to style once applied, it doesn&#x27;t get stick and wet like a hair gel, and it looks natural and clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was skeptical about the Gatsby hair wax as it was not a thick wax, but once I ran it through my hair it had an amazing hold.</li>
            <li>I seriously didn&#x27;t think anything would be able to work on my hair.    </li>
            <li>Decent for Asian hair.</li>
            <li>First off I just want to say I&#x27;m not Asian, I&#x27;m actually Hispanic.</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite for when my hair which is usually cut short starts to grow and has weight to it.  </li>
            <li>Like the rest of their waxes, it takes very little to use and the styling holds very well,  Restyling is easy and requires no new use of product.  </li>
            <li>Like many Japanese things, that get little carried away and make like \\&quot;20\\&quot; different versions of these with varying strength.</li>
            <li>The wax has a strong hold, it kinda makes it hard to style your way you wanted.</li>
            <li>And to put it to the real test, I recently took it on a trip to Vegas last week.</li>
            <li>Also the product came in quite fast as it arrived 2 days earlier prior to the estimated delivery.</li>
            <li>had incredibly thick medium-short hair that teeters back and forth from being just wavy to curly, and this product helped me style my hair in a way that gets me many compliments.  </li>
            <li>It is tough to wash out compared to water-based gels, though; I recommend shampooing twice, the first time with a cheap generic shampoo to save money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen it work well for other hair types first hand, but it&#x27;s not a be</li>
            <li>only downside to Wild Shake is the smell!</li>
            <li>but it works in a way no other products I&#x27;ve tried have.</li>
            <li>I was losing hope quick finding something to tame my hair.</li>
            <li>A little bit (it goes a long way) allows you to shape your hair any way you see fit.</li>
            <li>This product seamlessly integrates itself into my hair while at the same time not showing any apparent flakes.</li>
            <li>I have both the Grey Grunge and the Air rise wax as well and this one is the one I really like to use on the daily.</li>
            <li>Lasts several months and doesn&#x27;t take up any space for those who travel frequently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have this and have a totally matte, natural finish.</li>
            <li>hair is brown, straight, limp, prone to cal-licks, grows pretty thick, but normally falls flat without much texture or body.</li>
            <li>The spiky edge mandom (pink one) would be recommended for ultra short hair with ultimate control and an ultra hold, sometimes I use that one the first couple of weeks of a haircut.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;really\\&quot; going to look, because it will get absorbed and then slowly break down or get absorbed, eventually leaving my  hair somewhat greasier by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Seriously, the Asians may have figured out the hair thing--why isn&#x27;t this available in U.S. stores?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is about 4 inches long and it holds very well and for a long period a of time (I also use hair spray).</li>
            <li>Check out the description as the different products Gatsby offers have different hold and shine ratings.</li>
            <li>way better then any of the other american products that i have tryed in the past.  </li>
            <li>so I was little sketical at first.</li>
            <li>instructions suggest a fingertip&#x27;s worth, and that&#x27;s usually plenty.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or it can leave hair SLIGHTLY crunchy.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s a slight shine to it which is hard to find in most waxes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really you need to use only a little and it can style for volume and can really shape your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Gatsby has a great reputation and sounded almost like a miracle product.</li>
            <li> Works great for that style.</li>
            <li> Great for tycoons, spikes, and holds well.</li>
            <li> While some of these are wonderful in their own way, the Gatsby line is</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and holds for quite a while.</li>

            <li> Great product for holding hair</li>
            <li> They have a great hold to them.</li>
            <li> If you already use this then you can agree that it&#x27;s a fairly great product (despite its price for a hair product).</li>
            <li> If you have hair around the lenght showed on the products picture this will work great for you.</li>
            <li> This one works great and smells great too.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Also, the price is amazing!</li>
            <li> Ok so let me start off by saying how awesome the shipping was.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a hair product that I am happy with that provides a matte finish with good control, without the crunchy gel-type feeling.  </li>
            <li> Oh and it&#x27;s awesome for asian hair not the best but awesome.</li>
            <li> Great hold strong and with excellent control.  </li>
            <li> There is also a fairly pleasant smell to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just fun for me!!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased to make my boyfriend happy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I like Spice Sisters since they are not \\&quot;as hard\\&quot; as these Gastby, good over all product for the price.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for spikes, hawks, sticking up, sticking out, gravity defying styles.</li>
            <li> Good control</li>
            <li> Good hold, good smell, no sticky or shiny</li>
            <li> smells good.</li>
            <li> Good hold just have to learn what amount you need to use.</li>
            <li> as a good started as it&#x27;s like a sampler pack.</li>
            <li> It provides a matte finish with good hold and plenty of flexibility.  </li>
            <li> This product is good for stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> everything is good about this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the \\&quot;Air rise\\&quot; which is good too but probably for a bit longer of hair than</li>
            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Great for spiking medium hair, great texture look, but doesnt feel fantastic to touch  Nuance Motion:</li>
            <li> more lol.</li>
            <li> Quality, authentic stuff, works great.</li>
            <li> great product none greasy love</li>
            <li> so i was really happy and pleased to find that out.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably good to own both.</li>
            <li> Wild shake is a great hair product that works best on medium hair</li>
            <li> I had it thinned as is recommended by people who have been able to use this product successfully, but my result was a head of hair that was frizzy all over as if I&#x27;d just been rubbing a balloon on my head.</li>
            <li> My hair sticks up, more so on the sides and with this it manages it!</li>
            <li> Kudos for amazon carrying this  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> First of all they are great!  </li>
            <li> very good product we like very cool and stylish</li>
            <li> My favorite part of all of the Gatsby products is the pleasant smell, but this one was a bit lacking in that respect.</li>
            <li> when I want a light hold, it still has great control with a matte appearance.</li>
            <li> Amazing strength</li>
            <li> Your hair can be reshaped all day and has an amazing apple</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I am using it at a daily basis and work just perfect.</li>
            <li> Really holds and smells great!</li>
            <li> I did NOT order two day shipping, i think the supplier is just awesome haha.</li>
            <li> THE WA- ALSO NICE TEXTURE OF THE CONTAINER.</li>
            <li> kind of way.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice hold to your hair</li>
            <li> My hair stays in place all day with a nice, matte finish.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> Kind of just made my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> It washes out without a problem in warm water</li>
            <li> It smells good and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds great for about 10 hours and you hair does not look super wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it boasts, perfect to make nice spikes but yet retains a moveable and manageable hold...even on baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Product works great, is a fair and reasonable price, shipped the day after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> ITS VERY STRONG, SO</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband, he loves this product and says it&#x27;s the most effective wax he&#x27;s had.</li>
            <li> But after using the recommended amount (and slightly more), I found it held amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Really nice, since most of my gels wear off from just being out side for a period of time.</li>
            <li> This purple one has a nice hold but is still more creamy than clay like.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> So strong you can style even after you shower and wash your hair!</li>
            <li> Smells great, but is very very sticky in hair.</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s not my first time using this product , it&#x27;s  really great</li>
            <li> Awesome for early mornings cause it messes up your hair, adds a bit of volume, and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can also style it in a more formal look with this paste.</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal and works with almost anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better.</li>
            <li> My favorite at the moment.</li>
            <li> Never feels like too much product is in your hair, and holds great.</li>
            <li> Otherwise ok product.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product - the smell, how it feels, and after application.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s better for thicker hair, etc.</li>
            <li> Then I read more about this product and its users</li>
            <li> Which means I&#x27;d have to wait on using this product for many months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll experiment more with it and update when I get a chance.</li>
            <li> Goes on great and very manageable.  </li>
            <li> Glad I stumbled upon this product.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to do anything with it.</li>
            <li> (~2-4 inches, give or take) with a more relaxed style (i.e., not sharpened to a spike.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my aunt as its her favorite hair wax.</li>
            <li> Better than what i thought.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> GATSBY MAKES SOME OF THE BEST PRODUCTS AND THIS DOESN&#x27;T FALL SHORT...</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> but i love the way it works.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brand to anyone, just make sure you look at their chart of different products and choose the one with the correct texture for you and the one which is best for your hair type and length.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more and trying out others as well.</li>
            <li> Top quality styling wax.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Hair spray on top does not work/.   2.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m buying more of this when I run out</li>
            <li> Perfect for holding short to medium hair.</li>
            <li> Has a more naturual look and feel than gel.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite hair putty.</li>
            <li> Like the Spike Edge a bit more.</li>
            <li> I love Gatsby and I have many colors.</li>
            <li> Better for shorter hair I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> using gatsby make us exceptionally glad</li>
            <li> However, when I put it on my hair, it worked like magic to hold my stubborn hair like magic.  </li>
            <li> It also holds a lot better.</li>
            <li> but since there isn&#x27;t, amazon is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I like the Red one the best.</li>
            <li> Way better than any products that are in stores.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> A bit more sticky than I had thought it would be, but it does indeed hold up throughout the day, and then some.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Or use a bit more and you can be quite creative!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have finally found the perfect hair wax.</li>
            <li> Because of the properties of this wax, I am able to keep my hair from covering my ears, which has always been affecting my hearing.</li>
            <li> Spiky edge/wild shake combo is what i use depending on the length of my hair and they both work phenomenally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you have read reviews on Gatsby products.  </li>
            <li> The gatsby doesn&#x27;t hold what I want all day but it&#x27;s better than chia hair.</li>
            <li> Best wax i have tried on the market compare to the american ones</li>
            <li> xoxo very nice very style</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase I am definitely going to buy more!</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, and i recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thinning out your hair makes it more fine, which makes it lighter and more moveable.</li>
            <li> So once you get your hair more thinned out, more fine and flexible, this product will do wonders for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This works best on dry hair and not damp hair.</li>
            <li> i love this product, those asians really know thier stuff when it comes to hair wax, and it smells sooooo good, if i could eat</li>
            <li> Natural shine, workable, great hold.</li>
            <li> I was glad to see that this product is paraben free.</li>
            <li> Works better than that cheap Axe hair wax stuff.</li>
            <li> i tried first and it was by far the best product ive ever tried, even compared to a bottle of Aquage transforming paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> some - but in my case that&#x27;s a good thing because my hair stands straight up if there is no product in it.</li>
            <li> Very good for the simple fact that it is easy to work into longer hair.</li>
            <li> No shine, no mess, just a great product.</li>
            <li> The right amount, which I never seem to get onto my finger, is amazing.</li>
            <li> the best texture and hold for my hair compared to the other Gatsby products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Pliable, easy to reshape.  </li>
            <li> easy to put it and use.</li>
            <li> Strong, but washes out easily.  </li>
            <li> Strong hold.</li>
            <li> Strong hold as advertised.</li>
            <li> It has a strong hold and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as strong as bed head.</li>
            <li> Yet it&#x27;s still strong, unlike lots of gels.</li>
            <li> Leave it to Japan to make an amazing product ;)</li>
            <li> Been using gatsby since 6th grade, the purple one is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best product I have ever used in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It washes out just fine.</li>
            <li> Luckily for you, you have stumbled upon your solution!</li>
            <li> Cheap and work super well!</li>
            <li> The product has the best hold out of any hair wax I have used with just a little bit of shine.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try Gatsby, however, after years of hearing how great it holds.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done with a strong clean hold.</li>
            <li> Its a great product to use daily</li>
            <li> Asian hair + gatsby &#x3D; win.  </li>
            <li> It holds my hair in place really well and looks really nice.</li>
            <li> Which brings me to the next point: it&#x27;s re-workable until the moment you wash it off, which is great if you&#x27;re trying to fix a droopy piece halfway through your day.    </li>
            <li> It has a pliable, flexible, matte looking hold perfect for creating pieced, spiked, messy hairstyles.</li>
            <li> All in all a great product for short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I have always struggled to find a good product for my picky hair, and I think I may have found it with the Gatsby Moving Rubber Wild Shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice, easy to use, holds you hair for a long time, easy to wash off and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Works best if hair is dry first.</li>
            <li> True strong, rubber hold with no flaking or stiffness.</li>
            <li> People say that this this mold is supposed to be super strong.</li>
            <li> Well the day it came in I was excited</li>
            <li> I was using, this stuff is pretty cheap too!</li>
            <li> Very good hold for pin straight Asian hair.</li>
            <li> Superior to Axe products (not hard to believe) and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Wild Shake Gatsby is perfect for those of us with short hair.</li>
            <li> Before this product I used the Bumble &amp; Bumble Sumo Tech Styling Wax, which is still a favorite, but the Gatsby product just seems to work with my hair in a much more natural way.</li>
            <li> I was usimg the the pink spikey edge, which is great for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> The wild shake comes in a soft touch purple rubber container that is aesthetically beautiful.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product for medium hair and makes my hair look natural and controlled.</li>
            <li> product did not hold a full 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, it&#x27;s really frizzy.</li>
            <li> To apply, take a nickel-sized amount and rub it between your palms until it&#x27;s warm and soft.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking to be cool, this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried, Gatsby Moving Rubber is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> Product works great, and smells better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried; shipping was fast and without any issues.</li>
            <li> It has that lowered down hold compared to the spiky edge but still a good hold, overall its great product.</li>
            <li> I discovered Gatsby a few years ago and really its the best brand of hair styling stuff I have used.</li>
            <li> I can confirm that this is the best styling pomade for men with shorter hair (regardless of whether it is fine, super fine, medium, or thicker hair) -- if, like me, you have more complex medium-ish-short hair that needs some pomade before getting the suit on and going to work, but you have fine/wavy or fine/straight hair, then this works great but the Gatsby Air Rise (green tin) works way better because it doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair at all.</li>
            <li> fun.&lt;br /&gt;Girls respond to a stylish modern man, so keep your hair stylish and classy</li>
            <li> These are surprisingly clean though, as far as these things go, perhaps because it is made in Japan (they may have more strict standards).</li>
            <li> i like this good quality ship very fast and it is same as introduced</li>
            <li> Loose Shuffle was my previous favorite for holding my spikes on the top and back of my head, Air Rise was my favorite for my sides as it gave a nice teased look, and Grunge Mat was nice for thinning and defining hair bundles even more for certain styles.</li>
            <li> So bottom line, they&#x27;re all great if you know what they&#x27;re for and after trying em on short and long hair, still love em.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome to say the least!</li>
            <li> It truly lasts all day and more; I&#x27;ve slept in it and it still held strong for the next morning.</li>
            <li> The product washes out extremely easily and if there&#x27;s still some left over, make sure to use conditioner as it&#x27;ll get the remainder out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that gives your hair a that controlled but messy look, then this will be great for you.  </li>
            <li> The scent of green apples is great.</li>
            <li> and I can restyle it more naturally.</li>
            <li> But all the asian models you see trying this product out, look at their hair closely, it&#x27;s been thinned out (most likely for months and months before) and layered by professionals, making the hair more manageable and the product makes the hair 90% better looking.</li>
            <li> I kind of kicking myself for not finding this earlier...</li>
            <li> So it totally worth trying.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously worth the money.</li>
            <li> Usually I love opening a new container and using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of products, including other Gatsby products, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This product works great, hold hair in place, but not too stiff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use a comb right after applying it.</li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> that way you use the right amount and not have to replace it so soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to hold most of your hair and is really flexible.</li>
            <li> I am now able to sit in the back row in class with the cool kids and still hear the professor.</li>
            <li> I recently tried RedKin hair wax which was good for short hair, but just left my medium hair length floppy, and it took a good 20 minutes to get it fully in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are more fair haired and your hair is thin and straight, you&#x27;ll get the full benefit of this as I found out by giving the rest of mine to a friend.  </li>
            <li> Spiky Edge: A more intense version of wild shake.</li>
            <li> Product gives hair a natural look and the hold is quite strong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for the best hair styling product for me and have settled on a few different products that I use depending on the situation.  </li>
            <li> Holds really well, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> But I pretty much like it if I&#x27;m in the rush and just need a quick touch</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair.</li>
            <li> Hard to wash out, but otherwise works great for my medium-length &amp;#34;faux-hawk&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this &amp;#34;Wildshake&amp;#34; (purple tin) and the &amp;#34;Air Rise&amp;#34; (green tin) after doing several hours worth of research on finding the best possible pomade for men with fine, short/medium hair.</li>
            <li> Never even had to bother touching it for almost the entire day.</li>
            <li> I am able to spike my hair which lasts the entire day, even on windy days.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve used many kinds of wax and gel throughout the years and stages of my hairstyles, Gatsby beats them all especially for my style</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that my hair seems to be stuck together - I can&#x27;t use that sexy, run-my-fingers-through-my-hair move.  </li>
            <li> I have used Crew Fiber (blue top) for years.</li>
            <li> This isnt quite the same as it is more creamy</li>
            <li> but I use tea trea shampoo first and that gets it out.</li>
            <li> Yes, I keep my hair short to medium in length, more of the atheletic look.  </li>
            <li> Now Gatsby Moving Rubber gives me an interesting look no matter how I use it, and it lasts the entire day!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly that.</li>
            <li> That is particularly evident because it doesn&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li> This is my first gatsby and it styles the way I want it too look without looking unnatural.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gatsby!</li>
            <li> These products are way better than some of the American Crew products.</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loves this stuff!  </li>
            <li> the exact way I want it and</li>
            <li> This is actually my first time ordering one for myself, but I know how this product works.</li>
            <li> As for as description, it&#x27;s exactly as described.</li>
            <li> have a hairstyle you want for a whole day, even if you get water on yoself!</li>
            <li> The gray one is better and i recommend it for people who have short to medium hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft wax in the container, but after you put a little on your palm and rub your hands together, then run your hands through your hair, it provides great all day hold.  </li>
            <li> I found works best is while my hair is shorter and wants to stay down i used the Pink \\&quot;spiky edge\\&quot; to maintain my style throughout the day.</li>
            <li> For most asian guys, it&#x27;s the side of the head that really gets us.</li>
            <li> the product its self worked wonderfully with my thick asian hair.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this and 98% of them of all positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as any of the other products I mentioned earlier, and has a strong sort of latex or silicone rubber smell to it.</li>
            <li> You will know the next day at the shower, it will not be easy to take off..</li>
            <li> I think because it doesn&#x27;t absorb and become greasy, I now notice more how dry my hair is.</li>
            <li> If you are willing to have great styled hair, but not great feeling hair</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend American Crew - Fiber instead.</li>
            <li> and they are designed to be used for certain hair lengths.  </li>
            <li> The key to finding a great product is trying enough different ones to see exactly what works for you.</li>
            <li> I have short curly fine hair</li>
            <li> So if you have MY type of  hair as I have described above, and it is not thinned out or fine by a salon, then this product will not do anything for you.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more of a dry feeling product (like rubber!).</li>
            <li> It is pretty decent for its price and does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I have straight black hair and was trying different products to give me a more interesting look.</li>
            <li> How to know you used to much..?</li>
            <li> Moved instead to pomade, which holds much much much...better.</li>
            <li> It makes the hair styling so much easier.</li>
            <li> It smells great and takes only a tiny amount to obtain the same style that would have involved a lot of gel and hairspray.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My hair type is straight</li>
            <li> It felt cheap and when I put it in my hair, my hair looked the same before I put the stuff in.</li>
            <li> And fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this and the way it works on my longer hair days.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but it makes my hair very sticky</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;d suggest this product if you&#x27;re looking for something simple and cheap and works like it should.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> You really have to try all the colors.</li>
            <li> This one adds a bit too much volume.</li>
            <li> Very moldable throughout the day, too.</li>
            <li> I am very displeased with this.</li>
            <li> This thing can cost as much as 20 dollars and hair addicts will clamor for it .</li>
            <li> It just goes to show the company really cares about affordability in its customers.</li>
            <li> and I think it is very creative!&lt;br</li>
            <li> make sure its not too wet</li>
            <li> I know these products are aimed for people that have hair like asians, but they worked really well for me even though I have hair nothing like asains.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can find it SOOO much cheaper online.</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing, except make my hair smell like product.</li>
            <li> and they all seem to work terribly with my hair type; However this product is awesome and sculpts my hair perfectly and keeps it messy spiked</li>
            <li> The pink has more hold</li>
            <li> for others: follow the instruction on their website, it really helps</li>
            <li> it makes your hair really sticky once you apply</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me, it didn&#x27;t hold up as much as the gray one did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I like to use all natural products that are known to be safe for personal care use.</li>
            <li> Green one is also nice.</li>
            <li> It Creates fullness, sharp edges, and clean styles even with a head full of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It keeps everything in place and does not look or feel stiff or leave any kind of residue.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it&#x27;s super light, so it doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Really strong wax, holds well for really long time.</li>
            <li> Love this product.. don&#x27;t think I will buy another hair mesh other than this one.</li>
            <li> The best hairstyling product is this one can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> This wax functioned better than clay, promade (spelling goof), and other stuff.</li>
            <li> It takes A LONG time for my hair to get all fine and flexible from thinning at the salon.</li>
            <li> The cream is too sticky, and easy to become dry.</li>
            <li> For the past few years I have been trying to find the perfect hair holding product.</li>
            <li> Probably my least favorite, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Works great for medium length, thick, fine hair to achieve a messy look.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hair product with strong hold, that doesn&#x27;t loose effect over the day, and that doesn&#x27;t have a greasy or oily look or build up....</li>
            <li> If your hair is kind of soft, you don&#x27;t need to use just a bit, and even the next day, you may wake up with the same look you went to bed..</li>
            <li> Funny, they call it wild shake</li>
            <li> Also, I love how the product isn&#x27;t gross and sticky like regular hair gel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I searched all of the ingredients, and nothing was listed as medium or high concern, except for \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;--but</li>
            <li> Then I use a high end shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what you get when you order high quality Gatsby from Mandom.</li>
            <li> I used this product during my high school years because my brother had it.</li>
            <li> hold strength won&#x27;t last long, but you can always re-style your hair pretty easy over the time.</li>
            <li> After trying many hair waxes, gels, mousses, pomades, sprays, and whatever those kids make in their kitchens or labs and subjecting them to my thick unruly Asian hair, Gatsby moving rubber hair waxes is one of the very few hair products that seems to work reliably and makes sure hair stylish and popping.</li>
            <li> For me personally, I have a ton of hair, but it&#x27;s all Spanish hair - fine, silky and not super volume-rich after putting most pomades into it (because most of them weigh the hair down and flatten it).</li>
            <li> Little bit more pricey</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and pliant and you can really work with it.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair naturally (normal white-guy hair)</li>
            <li> Works for long hair, but you&#x27;ll have to use a lot and is much better for short --&gt;</li>
            <li> I thought this product will do wonders for my hair, even at its normal state.</li>
            <li> Gatsby Purple has found a slot especially for when I have a fresh haircut, for day-to-day situations.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and  types of wax but so far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> and this is pretty much the only product I use for my hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through numerous types of hair gel and wax over the years, and my previous best was the stuff you find in salons - American Crew Fibaer ($15), but have since settled on Gatsy Moving Rubber Purple (and the Pink one as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s not hard and crunchy like hair gels.</li>
            <li> Most products I&#x27;ve tried went dull pretty early in the day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give much poof to my layered hair, but it gives it enough to make it seem like my hair isn&#x27;t so thin :P</li>
            <li> The effect is kind of like hair spray, except that you can actually reshape your hair over and over again with little loss of effect.</li>
            <li> I picked up a little jar of Gatsby Wild Shake by chance at the convenience store and found my new favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;m really happy with Wild Shake, have gotten tons of compliments, and I&#x27;m curious to try other Gatsby products in the future.</li>
            <li> Has a really subtle scent and looks nice.</li>
            <li> Great product that is hard to find in the U.S.other than at the occasional Japanese grocer / market.  </li>
            <li> Spikes almost as well as wild shake!  </li>
            <li> It held up all day in the hot sun and into the NEXT day, too!</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews, I decided to try out Gatsby for the first time and it didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> With this \\&quot;moving rubber,\\&quot; my hair actually holds its shape pretty well, yet it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s anything in it, and the product doesn&#x27;t seem to contribute to greasiness over time at all.</li>
            <li> For Asian men hair, its much better than the most expensive gel i buy.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It keeps it up and looks natural!</li>
            <li> I sat next to the hot girls.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t frizz up right away, but after setting for a few minutes it pops right up.  </li>
            <li> If I use too much product, my hair will look a little &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; but a quick tussle</li>
            <li> First it was blue hair gel that had little or no hold, and then thick gel which was great for my spiky hair.</li>
            <li> Something typical asian hair (like mine) isn&#x27;t able to do.</li>
            <li> Even though this product is for asian hair and it says it does wonders for typical asian hair, it supposedly only works on asian hair that has been thinned out and altered to be more fine in texture.</li>
            <li> The wax itself is actually pretty soft, almost a creamy paste consistency, so it was a little deceiving when I first opened the tub.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m just conscious to use a little extra conditioner to make sure my hair is well</li>
            <li> not only did the look last all day, but his hair actually looked better the next day!  </li>
            <li> Wild Shake:</li>
            <li> Get a natural look with a medium hold</li>
            <li> hair product is going to make your hair gone wild.</li>
            <li> This is wild &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.I&#x27;m almost 70 years old</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m experimenting,but I also bought another type - the wet/shine look.</li>
            <li> my hair feels soft when using the product.</li>
            <li> but no where near the amount I used to and with this, my style holds all day.  </li>
            <li> This hair wax works really well, especially for short to medium length straight hair.</li>
            <li> I read and saw reviews saying it can really style asian hair</li>
            <li> Works so well for straighter Asian hair compared to the products you would normally available in your local drugstore, supermarket, or big box store.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t make my hair appear &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, but a natural look.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know how this product is, they sent me spikey edge instead of wild shake.</li>
            <li> I have short layers and to medium length hair in some parts but this stuff really lifts up the layers how I wanted it.  </li>
            <li> hair looks Naturally mess.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white guy with medium length naturally straight hair</li>
            <li> I have tried most products out there (American Crew, Bumble and Bumble, Kevin Murphy, Got2B, Moosehead, Dax, Garnier, Redken, Schwarzkopf, Bedhead and Paul Mitchell to name a few).</li>
            <li> Once you thin your hair out, layered it, and over a few months your hair begins to change in texture, it&#x27;s finer, more soft, more movable and thinner, THEN you can use this product.</li>
            <li> The expensive stuff you buy at the stylist held out for a good portion of the day.</li>
            <li> If push came to shove, I would say, I choose the Spiky Edge for really short hair (like a flat top or military look) and I choose the Wild Shake for hair that is noticeably longer.  </li>
            <li> Many are not strong or resilient enough for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More than any other product I have tried, this stuff actually creates lasting body in the hair without any shiny residue.</li>
            <li> Hair becomes really simple to style once applied, it doesn&#x27;t get stick and wet like a hair gel, and it looks natural and clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical about the Gatsby hair wax as it was not a thick wax, but once I ran it through my hair it had an amazing hold.</li>
            <li> I seriously didn&#x27;t think anything would be able to work on my hair.    </li>
            <li> Decent for Asian hair.</li>
            <li> First off I just want to say I&#x27;m not Asian, I&#x27;m actually Hispanic.</li>
            <li> This one is my favorite for when my hair which is usually cut short starts to grow and has weight to it.  </li>
            <li> Like the rest of their waxes, it takes very little to use and the styling holds very well,  Restyling is easy and requires no new use of product.  </li>
            <li> Like many Japanese things, that get little carried away and make like \\&quot;20\\&quot; different versions of these with varying strength.</li>
            <li> The wax has a strong hold, it kinda makes it hard to style your way you wanted.</li>
            <li> And to put it to the real test, I recently took it on a trip to Vegas last week.</li>
            <li> Also the product came in quite fast as it arrived 2 days earlier prior to the estimated delivery.</li>
            <li> had incredibly thick medium-short hair that teeters back and forth from being just wavy to curly, and this product helped me style my hair in a way that gets me many compliments.  </li>
            <li> It is tough to wash out compared to water-based gels, though; I recommend shampooing twice, the first time with a cheap generic shampoo to save money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen it work well for other hair types first hand, but it&#x27;s not a be</li>
            <li> only downside to Wild Shake is the smell!</li>
            <li> but it works in a way no other products I&#x27;ve tried have.</li>
            <li> I was losing hope quick finding something to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> A little bit (it goes a long way) allows you to shape your hair any way you see fit.</li>
            <li> This product seamlessly integrates itself into my hair while at the same time not showing any apparent flakes.</li>
            <li> I have both the Grey Grunge and the Air rise wax as well and this one is the one I really like to use on the daily.</li>
            <li> Lasts several months and doesn&#x27;t take up any space for those who travel frequently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have this and have a totally matte, natural finish.</li>
            <li> hair is brown, straight, limp, prone to cal-licks, grows pretty thick, but normally falls flat without much texture or body.</li>
            <li> The spiky edge mandom (pink one) would be recommended for ultra short hair with ultimate control and an ultra hold, sometimes I use that one the first couple of weeks of a haircut.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;really\\&quot; going to look, because it will get absorbed and then slowly break down or get absorbed, eventually leaving my  hair somewhat greasier by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the Asians may have figured out the hair thing--why isn&#x27;t this available in U.S. stores?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is about 4 inches long and it holds very well and for a long period a of time (I also use hair spray).</li>
            <li> Check out the description as the different products Gatsby offers have different hold and shine ratings.</li>
            <li> way better then any of the other american products that i have tryed in the past.  </li>
            <li> so I was little sketical at first.</li>
            <li> instructions suggest a fingertip&#x27;s worth, and that&#x27;s usually plenty.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much or it can leave hair SLIGHTLY crunchy.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a slight shine to it which is hard to find in most waxes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really you need to use only a little and it can style for volume and can really shape your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In 5 minutes my hair was fully in place with little shine and no hard look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buying again!</li>
            <li> It hardly weighs down the hair and still does it&#x27;s job of having a strong hold with some shine.</li>
            <li> Aside from Grunge Mat, Wild Shake managed to replace both of the other products I&#x27;ve been using at the same time.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, just enough lift without my hair being hard and shinny from gel&lt;br</li>
            <li> It holds up really well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you want this product to work at FULL potential you MUST thin out your asian hair and have it styled.</li>
            <li> First of all, some people probably are not going to like this product because it&#x27;s kinda hard to apply to the hair.</li>
            <li> and I keep it short because it is a little thin on top.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m too lazy to do much, this is the one i use.  </li>
            <li> Last long too if you ration it well.</li>
            <li> A must have for any asian guy with med to long hair.  </li>
            <li> A lil goes a long way and this lil jar will last me 6 months.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have with the moving rubber wild shake is that it leaves a residue in your hair that makes it a little sticky...</li>
            <li> My only negative about his product is that it tends to clump if you use too much and will leave residue in your hair and scalp which looks like dandruff.</li>
            <li> I use it in dry hair and it works instantly.</li>
            <li> I have short spikey hair and have tried every product from expensive to cheap to get my hair to stand up and stay up.</li>
            <li> I have straight thick asian hair</li>
            <li> first the product was a little strange because it behaves a little differently than I am used to.</li>
            <li> Note that I have short, Asian hair, so can&#x27;t comment for other types of hair.</li>
            <li> Very dry, not flexible, it can only stay in one place.</li>
            <li> It feels a little bit tacky at first, but this diminishes as soon as the product has dried.</li>
            <li> If your hair is even slightly long, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I feel it should.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold up for too long unless you set it with spray though.</li>
            <li> Then a few weeks into my haircut I switch to the Purple \\&quot;Wild shake\\&quot; because it basically is a variation of the spiky edge specifically for a bit longer hair.</li>
            <li> I had gatsby on my mined for a long time</li>
            <li> it will stay like that all day long without feeling sticky or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the heaviest product I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  </li>
            <li> With hair products, I am less careful than with skin products, but  I use sulfate-free shampoo and an all natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> It provides a natural textured look without making your hair sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> Without it, my hair just looks plain and far from</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and heavy, and throughout all my years of using various gels, waxes, and other miscellaneous pastes, nothing has managed to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> I use this to give my hair a dry style.</li>
            <li> Im white, thin straight hair, but I like some volume, all day hold while still being pliable and not looking like grease in my hair.  </li>
            <li> hair: VERY straight, fairly thin strands, but lots of it.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s capabilities are indeed limited.</li>
            <li> Loose Shuffle:</li>
            <li> My sides would not go down, it just kept getting \\&quot;poufing\\&quot; back up.</li>
            <li> So after I go bike down the street for example, I just comb my fingers through to get it back in order from what the wind has done to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> typically style in a pompadour and this product gives that extra bit of texture, but still makes it look as if you&#x27;re not using products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good choice if your hair is fragile and soft.</li>
            <li> If you are skeptical of synthetic chemicals, I was surprised to discover the hard way that Paul Mitchell products are full of them.</li>
            <li> A little hard to wash out if you use too much.</li>
            <li> Your hair will feel a little sticky but it will definitely help you create a fringe hairstyle.</li>
            <li> But the next day when I tried it, it seemed like any other half ass hair product you can find in drugstores.</li>
            <li> After a few hours, gravity would take over and it would fall neatly back into place.</li>
            <li> Then during the day I just wet my hand and &amp;#34;scrunge&amp;#34; up the curls</li>
            <li> It actually works to give you that grunge look or messy look.  </li>
            <li> , that will rule over the alleged hold of the product.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair looking wet and with a bit of a stiffener reactions</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a wet or spiky look, so</li>
            <li> The product does not &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; yet it isn&#x27;t wet.</li>
            <li> my recommendation is going with the pink moving rubber if you have hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Green one -- not enough control...</li>
            <li> I have this one and the one in pink which is called the Spiky Edge wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the yellow version for a few years but this product works wonders, but it also has it&#x27;s cons.</li>
            <li> Favorite hair product thus far.. Grew up with thick hair that was ugly.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I have EXTREMELY coarse and thick asian hair.</li>
            <li> If you want less shine go with the grey grunge matte.</li>
            <li> Previously I used the Loose Shuffle, Air Rise, and Grunge Mat.</li>
            <li> Too much made my hair feel weird, too little was passable but couldn&#x27;t stand up to my daily bike commute.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not really sure what the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; means,but it has a very different feel to it.</li>
            <li> Other than that it makes my hair do what I want.</li>
            <li> Compared to price for other hair gels/waxes/etc</li>
            <li> Wish I had known about it sooner before wasting money on other gels and waxes.</li>
            <li> He switched over to this after years of using got 2b gel and all those other hair gel brands.</li>
            <li> Moving Rubber is a hair wax brand unlike any other.</li>
            <li> Forget the other products out there...</li>
            <li> I am Asian and have a hard time finding products the hold my hair the way I want.</li>
            <li> I personally have thick, heavy, slightly curly hair that can be a bit on the dry side at times.</li>
            <li> If someone where to ask me if I had to choose between this one or the Spiky Edge, it would be difficult to decide since I really like them both</li>
            <li> the wax.&lt;br /&gt;*don&#x27;t apply too much, it makes the hair look unrealistic.</li>
            <li> but if you shake your hair, the natural curl or cowlick will take over (but it will look worse than if you had not used the product at all.</li>
            <li> , I guess you could say typical thick asian hair</li>
            <li> Our sides just won&#x27;t go down.</li>
            <li> Some products are greasy, some weigh your hair down so your style doesn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li> my hair stays pieced, standing up or laying down...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the Pink version -- way too stiff.</li>
            <li> For some background, I&#x27;d tried all the Crew products (meh) before, then ventured out to try to find something more specific to the needs of my hair that maybe didn&#x27;t have a ton of insane chemicals in it either.</li>
            <li> Stands up if not styles and looks like a baby chick (except black)</li>
            <li> Apply less on areas where you want your hair to dangle.</li>
            <li> I usually love Gatsby products and have had this one before, but the one I ordered recently was awful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to thin my hair like every other month for it to finally change in texture and manageableness.</li>
            <li> This hair wax is really hard to wash it off, it leaves a dry &amp; residual feeling to your hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit heavy, so may weigh down your hair</li>
            <li> It does feel pretty nasty though in your hair, but I don&#x27;t think that can really be helped.</li>
            <li> Compared to axe messy hair it is much less sticky.</li>
            <li> So, just a little bit of the product will do the trick..</li>
            <li> I still spritz a little hairspray on after (habit I guess)</li>
            <li> A LITTLE</li>
            <li> One little 80g thing is about the size of a hockey puck and lasts forever (Months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want stronger hold I would recommend adding another hair product which I&#x27;m not familiar with.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I do not like about this product is the fact that it is very very hard to wash out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very very thick red hair.</li>
            <li> He has very thick Asian har</li>
            <li> Heres what i thought of a few of em    </li>
            <li> I also use the air rise mandom (green one)</li>
            <li> As for me, well, my hair isn&#x27;t thinned out or anything so this product was basically a waste.</li>
            <li> I kinda wish it didn&#x27;t smell like green apple, but you can&#x27;t beat Gatsby.</li>
            <li> TO FIRM</li>
            <li> It did have a bit of a green apple smell to it like Air Rise, but it was overpowered by that rubbery smell.</li>
            <li> Axe messy hair tended to leave a lot of residue on my palms and fingers even accumulating on my hair from time to time and people had to get it out.</li>
            <li> In a messy, but controlled; scruffy, but neat kinda way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You should buy this product over shit like Axe hair any day.</li>
            <li> , hair doesn&#x27;t fall down after using a small dab on the fingers.&lt;br /&gt;- Timing, lasts till the end of the day</li>
            <li> I use Tigi Matte Separation Wax but that is near impossible to use when your hair is long.</li>
            <li> He uses Gatsby everyday for his hair now and loves how it doesn&#x27;t make the hair stiff.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Moderately hard to wash out of your hair, but easier than some other waxes out there</li>
            <li> Just basically makes your hair greasy and stiff.</li>
            <li> Usually, I have to work a product in and wait a little bit before I know how it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It will seem like any other wax or pomade that has failed your rough and tough asian hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried all of the gatsby colours over the past few months</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for my hair and it usually does well.</li>
            <li> If you are an Asian male, you will understand how hard it is to style your hair, and might even think that it&#x27;s impossible.</li>
            <li> This one is a little bit heavier which works well when I get my hair cut shorter, however, will still work on medium length hair if you have really thick or tangly hair that you need to make behave.</li>
            <li> I usually dab on a quarter sized amount and just work it into the hair, if I feel like a neat look</li>
            <li> I have stereotypical asian hair and all, why didn&#x27;t it work for me?</li>
            <li> My hair is really heavy and thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what that means.</li>
            <li> Smells like a middle schooler and is difficult to wash out.  </li>
            <li> Yes, usually that \\&quot;anime or dragon ball</li>
            <li> a small blob of Gatsby</li>
            <li> The product is usually like a semi-liquid, but this one is hardened and is like clay.  </li>
            <li> and I have not seen any adverse affects to my hair or scalp over the past 24 months</li>
            <li> I usually put it in damp hair so it is easier to work with but</li>
            <li> but I usually end up mixing both.</li>
            <li> The problem was that gel makes your hair look too stiff and hard.</li>
            <li> Not \\&quot;styled\\&quot; that&#x27;s what the product is for, but if you have EXTREMELY COARSE, THICK, FRIZZY, POUFY hair (like my hair), This product will fail.</li>
            <li> It may be a little hard to wash out, but it&#x27;s nothing too serious.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair rock hard nor does it give it that look/feel.</li>
            <li> Hard to wash out though</li>
            <li> What I dislike about it is that it is hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s REALLY hard to find anything that can hold it up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard like some gels or hairsprays.</li>
            <li> Not exactly great to the touch (a little sticky)</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> What could possibly be negative about it?</li>
            <li> and I saw in all their videos and all their written reviews they had one thing in common.  </li>
            <li> The feel of your hair is icky.</li>
            <li> and Now it feels thick</li>
            <li> They even work on really thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do my hair like the pictures they suggest but this product makes a mean comb over or spiky fauxhawk.</li>
            <li> Usually my hair is just boring and really stringy like a chia pet</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to sprayed and stiff hair and weird textures from products</li>
            <li> Very hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> Also like others have noticed, its a bit tough to wash off your hands and out of your hair in the evenings.</li>
            <li> purple container is not as volumizing as the moving rubber, and seems to absorb into the hair leaving a thin film of crustiness on my hair...</li>
            <li> Majority of ebay Gatsby products are fake and made in China.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad that I can&#x27;t find this brand at salons here in the states</li>
            <li> it has a weird fruity smell but its not that bad</li>
            <li> and I also spike my hair to make it look crazy some days.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair like a charm with no problems, defenetly recommend this one for a crazy look.</li>
            <li> Really DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> But this time I opened it and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and it did like noting I looked at the crap U.S hair product and said why did you do that</li>
            <li> but this is the worst.     </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> best hair paste ive ever bought</li>
            <li> Works great for medium length, thick, fine hair to achieve a messy look. I can also style it in a more formal look with this paste. If I use too much product, my hair will look a little &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; but a quick tussle and I can restyle it more naturally.</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal and works with almost anyone&#x27;s hair. I don&#x27;t do my hair like the pictures they suggest but this product makes a mean comb over or spiky fauxhawk.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend after reading the reviews.  He was amazed at the stamina of his hair....not only did the look last all day, but his hair actually looked better the next day!  But tested...product did not hold a full 48 hours.  Pliable, easy to reshape.  Very pleased to make my boyfriend happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I am using it at a daily basis and work just perfect. If your hair is kind of soft, you don&#x27;t need to use just a bit, and even the next day, you may wake up with the same look you went to bed.. How to know you used to much..? You will know the next day at the shower, it will not be easy to take off.. So, just a little bit of the product will do the trick..</li>
            <li> Really holds and smells great!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband, he loves this product and says it&#x27;s the most effective wax he&#x27;s had. we keep buying it and I have to say I do like that bubble gum-like smell.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair naturally (normal white-guy hair) and I&#x27;ve tried all of the gatsby colours over the past few months and I haven&#x27;t found one I don&#x27;t like. Heres what i thought of a few of em    Wild Shake: Great for spiking medium hair, great texture look, but doesnt feel fantastic to touch  Nuance Motion: Probably my least favorite, but not bad at all. Its for waving your hair, so dont expect volume and it is great!  Grunge Mat: My favorite at the moment. Never feels like too much product is in your hair, and holds great. Spikes almost as well as wild shake!  Loose Shuffle: Awesome for early mornings cause it messes up your hair, adds a bit of volume, and is really easy to use. When I&#x27;m too lazy to do much, this is the one i use.  Spiky Edge: A more intense version of wild shake. Works for long hair, but you&#x27;ll have to use a lot and is much better for short --&gt; medium short.    So bottom line, they&#x27;re all great if you know what they&#x27;re for and after trying em on short and long hair, still love em.</li>
            <li> If your hair is even slightly long, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I feel it should. Moved instead to pomade, which holds much much much...better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.. don&#x27;t think I will buy another hair mesh other than this one. In fact I went to order 3 more lol.</li>
            <li> Nice, easy to use, holds you hair for a long time, easy to wash off and very easy to apply. Despite gray color does not affect hair color, does not stink, and not shiny.</li>
            <li> Very hard to wash out. Must use a clarifying shampoo!! Otherwise ok product.</li>
            <li> Hair products have always been quite a problem for me. My hair is super thick and heavy, and throughout all my years of using various gels, waxes, and other miscellaneous pastes, nothing has managed to keep it in place. After a few hours, gravity would take over and it would fall neatly back into place. I seriously didn&#x27;t think anything would be able to work on my hair.    I finally decided to try Gatsby, however, after years of hearing how great it holds. The wax itself is actually pretty soft, almost a creamy paste consistency, so it was a little deceiving when I first opened the tub. But after using the recommended amount (and slightly more), I found it held amazingly well. Not to mention it&#x27;s super light, so it doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair at all. Never even had to bother touching it for almost the entire day. And to put it to the real test, I recently took it on a trip to Vegas last week. It held up all day in the hot sun and into the NEXT day, too! In fact, when I woke up, it was as if my head never touched the pillow. Awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product! Wax over gel!</li>
            <li> Ok so let me start off by saying how awesome the shipping was. I ordered it tuesday and the estimated delivery date was about the 28th, and it came in 2 days later which was thursday!! I did NOT order two day shipping, i think the supplier is just awesome haha. Also, gatsby works how it is showed on youtube. however you want to mold your hair, it will stay that way! I am so happy with this purchase I am definitely going to buy more!</li>
            <li> Quality, authentic stuff, works great. Majority of ebay Gatsby products are fake and made in China. Gatsby is a japanese product, made in japan. Amazon delivers again.</li>
            <li> Been using gatsby since 6th grade, the purple one is hands down the best. Get a natural look with a medium hold</li>
            <li> best hair product on the market. I have very straight hair. This gets the job done with a strong clean hold.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. It holds well initially, and even when it&#x27;s time-worn/tousled it still holds quite well and has a solid \\&quot;dry\\&quot; look. I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of products, including other Gatsby products, and this one is by far the best. Note that I have short, Asian hair, so can&#x27;t comment for other types of hair.</li>
            <li> First of all, some people probably are not going to like this product because it&#x27;s kinda hard to apply to the hair. But I pretty much like it if I&#x27;m in the rush and just need a quick touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair product is going to make your hair gone wild. For me to apply, I take only a size of dime in one time, spread it evenly to your hand, then work from side to side, front to back. Take another dime size wax again if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold strength won&#x27;t last long, but you can always re-style your hair pretty easy over the time.</li>
            <li> perfect for what i need</li>
            <li> Gatsby has a great reputation and sounded almost like a miracle product. Natural shine, workable, great hold. What could possibly be negative about it? Well, it&#x27;s capabilities are indeed limited. If you don&#x27;t have the hair for this product, it won&#x27;t work for you. I personally have thick, heavy, slightly curly hair that can be a bit on the dry side at times. If your hair has any of these features, you may not like this product. If you are more fair haired and your hair is thin and straight, you&#x27;ll get the full benefit of this as I found out by giving the rest of mine to a friend.  For me, this product would not let me do what I wanted with my hair. I had it thinned as is recommended by people who have been able to use this product successfully, but my result was a head of hair that was frizzy all over as if I&#x27;d just been rubbing a balloon on my head. It&#x27;s the result every time I use it. It doesn&#x27;t frizz up right away, but after setting for a few minutes it pops right up.  This is by no means a bash against Gatsby products. I&#x27;ve seen it work well for other hair types first hand, but it&#x27;s not a be all end all product. The key to finding a great product is trying enough different ones to see exactly what works for you. Gatsby didn&#x27;t work for me, and may or may not work for you, so if you try it and have results like mine don&#x27;t be too discouraged. Try some D:Fi D:Struct or American Crew Fiber for a similar finish for different hair types.</li>
            <li> This is wild &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.I&#x27;m almost 70 years old and I&#x27;ve never tried anything like this before.I have short curly fine hair and Now it feels thick and I only used just a tiny-weenie amount.Then during the day I just wet my hand and &amp;#34;scrunge&amp;#34; up the curls and I&#x27;m good for the rest of the day.I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;pomades&amp;#34; before and I&#x27;m not really sure what the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; means,but it has a very different feel to it.So far I&#x27;m experimenting,but I also bought another type - the wet/shine look.It&#x27;s just fun for me!!!!</li>
            <li> Its a great product to use daily and i love it. my hair feels soft when using the product. I  recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best hair wax out there! It makes the hair styling so much easier.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;m a girl with haircut similar in length to the model for this product. It smells great and takes only a tiny amount to obtain the same style that would have involved a lot of gel and hairspray. I still spritz a little hairspray on after (habit I guess) but no where near the amount I used to and with this, my style holds all day.  Highly recommended. I wont buy anything else now.</li>
            <li> I can wrap this conclusion up in a jiffy.  Asian hair + gatsby &#x3D; win.  I love this product - the smell, how it feels, and after application.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It has that lowered down hold compared to the spiky edge but still a good hold, overall its great product.</li>
            <li> Decent for Asian hair. I like Spice Sisters since they are not \\&quot;as hard\\&quot; as these Gastby, good over all product for the price.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT - ITS VERY STRONG, SO JUST USE A LITTLE BY THE WA- ALSO NICE TEXTURE OF THE CONTAINER.</li>
            <li> Perfect for medium-longish hair.  I was usimg the the pink spikey edge, which is great for shorter hair. Tried this because I wanted the longer spiked/messy style. Works great for that style.</li>
            <li> First off I just want to say I&#x27;m not Asian, I&#x27;m actually Hispanic. My hair type is straight and I keep it short because it is a little thin on top. This product is awesome to say the least! My hair sticks up, more so on the sides and with this it manages it! It hardly weighs down the hair and still does it&#x27;s job of having a strong hold with some shine. I usually dab on a quarter sized amount and just work it into the hair, if I feel like a neat look I&#x27;ll use a comb right after applying it.The spiky edge mandom (pink one) would be recommended for ultra short hair with ultimate control and an ultra hold, sometimes I use that one the first couple of weeks of a haircut. I also use the air rise mandom (green one) when I want a light hold, it still has great control with a matte appearance. All of these products by mandom are simply awesome! I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li> This hair wax works really well, especially for short to medium length straight hair. I am able to spike my hair which lasts the entire day, even on windy days. My only negative about his product is that it tends to clump if you use too much and will leave residue in your hair and scalp which looks like dandruff.</li>
            <li> Lasts several months and doesn&#x27;t take up any space for those who travel frequently.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this and 98% of them of all positive reviews. I bought it thinking it would help style my hair. Let me start off by saying I have EXTREMELY coarse and thick asian hair. On top of that, it&#x27;s really frizzy. I&#x27;m a guy btw. I read and saw reviews saying it can really style asian hair, it&#x27;s better for thicker hair, etc. Well the day it came in I was excited, I thought I&#x27;ve found the holy grail. But the next day when I tried it, it seemed like any other half ass hair product you can find in drugstores. It felt cheap and when I put it in my hair, my hair looked the same before I put the stuff in. For most asian guys, it&#x27;s the side of the head that really gets us. Our sides just won&#x27;t go down. I put an emphasis on my sides when I tried this product out, but nothing. My sides would not go down, it just kept getting \\&quot;poufing\\&quot; back up. Really DISAPPOINTED. I have stereotypical asian hair and all, why didn&#x27;t it work for me? Then I read more about this product and its users and I saw in all their videos and all their written reviews they had one thing in common.  If you want this product to work at FULL potential you MUST thin out your asian hair and have it styled. Not \\&quot;styled\\&quot; that&#x27;s what the product is for, but if you have EXTREMELY COARSE, THICK, FRIZZY, POUFY hair (like my hair), This product will fail. You need to get your asian hair thinned out, and layered, etc. That&#x27;s why the 2 stars. I thought this product will do wonders for my hair, even at its normal state. But all the asian models you see trying this product out, look at their hair closely, it&#x27;s been thinned out (most likely for months and months before) and layered by professionals, making the hair more manageable and the product makes the hair 90% better looking. Thinning out your hair makes it more fine, which makes it lighter and more moveable. Something typical asian hair (like mine) isn&#x27;t able to do. My hair is really heavy and thick. Think of the straws on a broomstick. That&#x27;s mostasian hair. Very dry, not flexible, it can only stay in one place. So once you get your hair more thinned out, more fine and flexible, this product will do wonders for you. As for me, well, my hair isn&#x27;t thinned out or anything so this product was basically a waste. It takes A LONG time for my hair to get all fine and flexible from thinning at the salon. I&#x27;d have to thin my hair like every other month for it to finally change in texture and manageableness. Which means I&#x27;d have to wait on using this product for many months. So if you have MY type of  hair as I have described above, and it is not thinned out or fine by a salon, then this product will not do anything for you. It will seem like any other wax or pomade that has failed your rough and tough asian hair. Once you thin your hair out, layered it, and over a few months your hair begins to change in texture, it&#x27;s finer, more soft, more movable and thinner, THEN you can use this product. Even though this product is for asian hair and it says it does wonders for typical asian hair, it supposedly only works on asian hair that has been thinned out and altered to be more fine in texture.</li>
            <li> Great hair product for styling! Last long too if you ration it well. Great for tycoons, spikes, and holds well.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews, I decided to try out Gatsby for the first time and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. Hair becomes really simple to style once applied, it doesn&#x27;t get stick and wet like a hair gel, and it looks natural and clean.  Also the product came in quite fast as it arrived 2 days earlier prior to the estimated delivery.</li>
            <li> I have tried most products out there (American Crew, Bumble and Bumble, Kevin Murphy, Got2B, Moosehead, Dax, Garnier, Redken, Schwarzkopf, Bedhead and Paul Mitchell to name a few). While some of these are wonderful in their own way, the Gatsby line is the best and Gatsby Moving Rubber Wild Shake is the best of the best. It does exactly what it says it does. It holds your hair basically any way you want it and it allows you to restyle it as necessary. It doesn&#x27;t flake. It washes out just fine. Often the hold lasts through the next day after sleeping on it. And it smells like apples in a &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; kind of way. If you can only afford one product and you have short hair that needs shaping, spare yourself the money and the research and buy this stuff. It&#x27;s good for spikes, hawks, sticking up, sticking out, gravity defying styles.</li>
            <li> Product gives hair a natural look and the hold is quite strong.  So strong you can style even after you shower and wash your hair!</li>
            <li> I was on a trip to South Korea and lost my toiletry bag, so I had to go out and find replacement personal care products. I picked up a little jar of Gatsby Wild Shake by chance at the convenience store and found my new favorite hair product. Seriously, the Asians may have figured out the hair thing--why isn&#x27;t this available in U.S. stores?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is brown, straight, limp, prone to cal-licks, grows pretty thick, but normally falls flat without much texture or body. More than any other product I have tried, this stuff actually creates lasting body in the hair without any shiny residue. The effect is kind of like hair spray, except that you can actually reshape your hair over and over again with little loss of effect. So after I go bike down the street for example, I just comb my fingers through to get it back in order from what the wind has done to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the product was a little strange because it behaves a little differently than I am used to. Usually, I have to work a product in and wait a little bit before I know how it&#x27;s \\&quot;really\\&quot; going to look, because it will get absorbed and then slowly break down or get absorbed, eventually leaving my  hair somewhat greasier by the end of the day. With this \\&quot;moving rubber,\\&quot; my hair actually holds its shape pretty well, yet it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s anything in it, and the product doesn&#x27;t seem to contribute to greasiness over time at all. It feels a little bit tacky at first, but this diminishes as soon as the product has dried. I think because it doesn&#x27;t absorb and become greasy, I now notice more how dry my hair is. I&#x27;d rather have this and have a totally matte, natural finish. Now I&#x27;m just conscious to use a little extra conditioner to make sure my hair is well moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I like to use all natural products that are known to be safe for personal care use. With hair products, I am less careful than with skin products, but  I use sulfate-free shampoo and an all natural conditioner. I was glad to see that this product is paraben free. I also just went to [...] and I searched all of the ingredients, and nothing was listed as medium or high concern, except for \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;--but I&#x27;m not sure what that means. I don&#x27;t believe there is a way yet to determine if the specific fragrance in this product could have harmful effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;m really happy with Wild Shake, have gotten tons of compliments, and I&#x27;m curious to try other Gatsby products in the future.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of hair products, wax, gel, different brands of hair putty but none of theme compares to this one. It has a really nice hold to your hair but it doesnt have the shiny effect that gel has. I recommend this! it&#x27;s perfect for getting that bed head effect</li>
            <li> Hard to wash out, but otherwise works great for my medium-length &amp;#34;faux-hawk&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> Very good for the simple fact that it is easy to work into longer hair. I use Tigi Matte Separation Wax but that is near impossible to use when your hair is long. This works well though.</li>
            <li> Just basically makes your hair greasy and stiff. I was hoping for more of a dry feeling product (like rubber!). I&#x27;ll experiment more with it and update when I get a chance.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best product I have ever used in my hair.  Goes on great and very manageable.  Glad I stumbled upon this product.  I was losing hope quick finding something to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells like a middle schooler and is difficult to wash out.  Other than that it makes my hair do what I want.</li>
            <li> Awesome! And fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product. It holds my hair in place really well and looks really nice. There&#x27;s a shine, but it is not too conspicuous. It may be a little hard to wash out, but it&#x27;s nothing too serious.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve used many kinds of wax and gel throughout the years and stages of my hairstyles, Gatsby beats them all especially for my style right now.&lt;br /&gt;I have the, I guess you could say typical thick asian hair and I&#x27;m able to do anything with it. Yes, usually that \\&quot;anime or dragon ball z\\&quot; style.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of wax&#x27;s claim to hold your hair all day, but don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Just a small blob of Gatsby and I can control all my hair, however I want. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair rock hard nor does it give it that look/feel. It Creates fullness, sharp edges, and clean styles even with a head full of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I finish it off with some spray gel and my hair lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Wild shake is a great hair product that works best on medium hair (~2-4 inches, give or take) with a more relaxed style (i.e., not sharpened to a spike. For that look into spiky edge).    It truly lasts all day and more; I&#x27;ve slept in it and it still held strong for the next morning. Which brings me to the next point: it&#x27;s re-workable until the moment you wash it off, which is great if you&#x27;re trying to fix a droopy piece halfway through your day.    To apply, take a nickel-sized amount and rub it between your palms until it&#x27;s warm and soft. Then transfer it onto your fingers and let your fingers comb through your hair, pinching or twisting if necessary. You know the drill.    It is tough to wash out compared to water-based gels, though; I recommend shampooing twice, the first time with a cheap generic shampoo to save money.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my aunt as its her favorite hair wax. She has a short pixie style hair cut and this is the only wax she uses. It keeps everything in place and does not look or feel stiff or leave any kind of residue.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, Gatsby products are the &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34; type. You really only need about a pea-size amount per use. The product washes out extremely easily and if there&#x27;s still some left over, make sure to use conditioner as it&#x27;ll get the remainder out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically style in a pompadour and this product gives that extra bit of texture, but still makes it look as if you&#x27;re not using products. As an added bonus it smells great!</li>
            <li> I kinda wish it didn&#x27;t smell like green apple, but you can&#x27;t beat Gatsby. I use it in dry hair and it works instantly. Your hair will move to wherever you want it to and it will stay there, and you could change your mind and do something different with it hours later. I&#x27;ve woken up the next day, about 12 hours after putting it in and it still worked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now. Kudos for amazon carrying this  LOVE IT! perfect balance of hold and shine</li>
            <li> Really strong wax, holds well for really long time. Smells pretty good, and i recommend it. Better than what i thought.</li>
            <li> I have very very thick red hair. This stuff works great and holds for quite a while. It does feel pretty nasty though in your hair, but I don&#x27;t think that can really be helped. Compared to price for other hair gels/waxes/etc I was using, this stuff is pretty cheap too!</li>
            <li> always been using this</li>
            <li> One of the few hair products that can actually hold my hair in place and you don&#x27;t need too much of it to work either</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for the best hair styling product for me and have settled on a few different products that I use depending on the situation.  Gatsby Purple has found a slot especially for when I have a fresh haircut, for day-to-day situations.  My hair stays in place all day with a nice, matte finish. The only drawback is that my hair seems to be stuck together - I can&#x27;t use that sexy, run-my-fingers-through-my-hair move.  Also like others have noticed, its a bit tough to wash off your hands and out of your hair in the evenings.</li>
            <li> great product none greasy love</li>
            <li> Product works great, and smells better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried; shipping was fast and without any issues. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Love it. Wish I had known about it sooner before wasting money on other gels and waxes.</li>
            <li> GATSBY MAKES SOME OF THE BEST PRODUCTS AND THIS DOESN&#x27;T FALL SHORT... IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A MEDIUM TO FIRM HOLD THIS IS THE STUFF FOR YOU , THE PRICE WAS GREAT COMPARED TO WHAT MY STYLIST SELLS IT FOR.. SO ITS ALWAYS A BUY FOR ME</li>
            <li> Love this product. Buy it religiously. Don&#x27;t use too much or it can leave hair SLIGHTLY crunchy.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. I have used Crew Fiber (blue top) for years. This isnt quite the same as it is more creamy but i love the way it works. Has a really subtle scent and looks nice. I will say that you need a lot of shampoo to get it out of your hair though. Definitely not as greasy as a lot of products though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this &amp;#34;Wildshake&amp;#34; (purple tin) and the &amp;#34;Air Rise&amp;#34; (green tin) after doing several hours worth of research on finding the best possible pomade for men with fine, short/medium hair. I can confirm that this is the best styling pomade for men with shorter hair (regardless of whether it is fine, super fine, medium, or thicker hair) -- if, like me, you have more complex medium-ish-short hair that needs some pomade before getting the suit on and going to work, but you have fine/wavy or fine/straight hair, then this works great but the Gatsby Air Rise (green tin) works way better because it doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair at all. This one is a little bit heavier which works well when I get my hair cut shorter, however, will still work on medium length hair if you have really thick or tangly hair that you need to make behave. For me personally, I have a ton of hair, but it&#x27;s all Spanish hair - fine, silky and not super volume-rich after putting most pomades into it (because most of them weigh the hair down and flatten it). Anyway, if you&#x27;re anything like me, the air rise is the way to go, but if you have really short hair then I&#x27;d go with this. It&#x27;s probably good to own both. For some background, I&#x27;d tried all the Crew products (meh) before, then ventured out to try to find something more specific to the needs of my hair that maybe didn&#x27;t have a ton of insane chemicals in it either. If you are skeptical of synthetic chemicals, I was surprised to discover the hard way that Paul Mitchell products are full of them. These are surprisingly clean though, as far as these things go, perhaps because it is made in Japan (they may have more strict standards). I&#x27;m sad that I can&#x27;t find this brand at salons here in the states but I have been very happy to find them so inexpensively on Amazon. I would recommend this brand to anyone, just make sure you look at their chart of different products and choose the one with the correct texture for you and the one which is best for your hair type and length.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It has a pliable, flexible, matte looking hold perfect for creating pieced, spiked, messy hairstyles. Works so well for straighter Asian hair compared to the products you would normally available in your local drugstore, supermarket, or big box store.</li>
            <li> I am Asian and have a hard time finding products the hold my hair the way I want. This gives me the perfect texture and hold I desire. Hard to wash out though but I use tea trea shampoo first and that gets it out. Then I use a high end shampoo and conditioner. Love this stuff. Will be buying more and trying out others as well.</li>
            <li> i like the smell of it</li>
            <li> This item does the job holds hair in place. It smells good and easy to wash out. Buy it and try it.</li>
            <li> Top quality styling wax. Holds really well, quick shipping. Little bit more pricey but that&#x27;s what you get when you order high quality Gatsby from Mandom.</li>
            <li> Works great and smell great. Can&#x27;t ask for more. Works better than that cheap Axe hair wax stuff. This is the way to go.</li>
            <li> For Asian men hair, its much better than the most expensive gel i buy. Good control and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t make my hair appear &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, but a natural look.</li>
            <li> It is the greatest wax that I have already used!</li>
            <li> Its working good to keep my hair style, but its causing my hair to fall!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know how this product is, they sent me spikey edge instead of wild shake.</li>
            <li> Great product for holding hair</li>
            <li> I have now used 3 of their hair wax products and they are all excellent.  This one is my favorite for when my hair which is usually cut short starts to grow and has weight to it.  I really like the feel of this and the way it works on my longer hair days.  I have also used it on short hair and I also like it as well.  It does have a different hold feel to the hair and it does what it says it will do.  It actually works to give you that grunge look or messy look.  Like the rest of their waxes, it takes very little to use and the styling holds very well,  Restyling is easy and requires no new use of product.  All you have to do is move the hair where you want it.  If someone where to ask me if I had to choose between this one or the Spiky Edge, it would be difficult to decide since I really like them both and they are designed to be used for certain hair lengths.  I do not know about the rest of you, but my hair length noticeably changes after about 2 weeks and I need to cut my hair every 3-4 weeks.  Yes, I keep my hair short to medium in length, more of the atheletic look.  So, I like both products because they do what they are suppose to for the length they were designed for.  If push came to shove, I would say, I choose the Spiky Edge for really short hair (like a flat top or military look) and I choose the Wild Shake for hair that is noticeably longer.  So I need both since I have 2 different lengths between hair cuts.</li>
            <li> I have straight black hair and was trying different products to give me a more interesting look. Most products I&#x27;ve tried went dull pretty early in the day. The expensive stuff you buy at the stylist held out for a good portion of the day. Now Gatsby Moving Rubber gives me an interesting look no matter how I use it, and it lasts the entire day! Also, the price is amazing! I kind of kicking myself for not finding this earlier...</li>
            <li> I went swimming and the gel doesn&#x27;t come out and still has the same elasticity as when I put it on! Really nice, since most of my gels wear off from just being out side for a period of time. Granted, of course, I can&#x27;t get the gel out when I&#x27;m showering... Otherwise, it&#x27;s a very good product!</li>
            <li> I like it, but it makes my hair very sticky</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a hair product that I am happy with that provides a matte finish with good control, without the crunchy gel-type feeling.  This product does exactly that. If you are looking for a product that gives your hair a that controlled but messy look, then this will be great for you.  It is a little bit heavy, so may weigh down your hair some - but in my case that&#x27;s a good thing because my hair stands straight up if there is no product in it. I have also listed my hair qualities below so you can understand my hair type&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair: VERY straight, fairly thin strands, but lots of it. Stands up if not styles and looks like a baby chick (except black)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and  types of wax but so far this one is my favorite. Good hold, good smell, no sticky or shiny</li>
            <li> Gatsby...what can I say? They have a great hold to them. I suggest watching some videos on how to apply them, that way you use the right amount and not have to replace it so soon. If you already use this then you can agree that it&#x27;s a fairly great product (despite its price for a hair product). Good stuff!</li>
            <li> this is a great product &#x3D;D it actually came in the mail a day earlier then it was exspected to so i was really happy and pleased to find that out.   the product its self worked wonderfully with my thick asian hair. way better then any of the other american products that i have tryed in the past.  So it totally worth trying.</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to sprayed and stiff hair and weird textures from products but this is the worst.     1. It doesn&#x27;t hold. It does form into the shape but it does not hold it. Hair spray on top does not work/.   2. The feel of your hair is icky. That is particularly evident because it doesn&#x27;t hold so you need to keep reshaping it.  3. If your hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own, that will rule over the alleged hold of the product. Funny, they call it wild shake but if you shake your hair, the natural curl or cowlick will take over (but it will look worse than if you had not used the product at all.</li>
            <li> A little hard to wash out if you use too much. Otherwise great all day hold!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but is very very sticky in hair.</li>
            <li> I have short layers and to medium length hair in some parts but this stuff really lifts up the layers how I wanted it.  It stays in and holds. smells good. easy to put it and use. im white, not asian and it works. so i&#x27;d suggest this product if you&#x27;re looking for something simple and cheap and works like it should. i&#x27;m buying more of this when I run out</li>
            <li> Wow! What a great hair paste! I was recomended to this product by a friend of mine. He was visitng here from vietnam. So i tried some of his and was hooked! Gatsby Rubber lets you style your hair however you like. Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good choice if your hair is fragile and soft. The cream is too sticky, and easy to become dry.</li>
            <li> Perfect for holding short to medium hair. Has a more naturual look and feel than gel.</li>
            <li> If you have hair around the lenght showed on the products picture this will work great for you. My hair is about 4 inches long and it holds very well and for a long period a of time (I also use hair spray). I use Gatsby to hold my hair in place when I comb it and I also spike my hair to make it look crazy some days. Very good product. Ive bought it twice and will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my short to medium hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair style - fohawk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds great for about 10 hours and you hair does not look super wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not need to use a lot each time to style your hair. I imagine it is going to last me about 2-3 months with daily use.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair matte and keeps it in place even when windy. It takes a while to take off.</li>
            <li> i love this product, those asians really know thier stuff when it comes to hair wax, and it smells sooooo good, if i could eat i would. buy it! you will not regret it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to hold most of your hair and is really flexible. Apply less on areas where you want your hair to dangle. It gives you a &amp;#34;badass I just woke up&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Strong hold. My husband&#x27;s favorite hair putty.</li>
            <li> A must have for any asian guy with med to long hair.  A lil goes a long way and this lil jar will last me 6 months.  You really have to try all the colors.</li>
            <li> Strong hold as advertised. Doesn&#x27;t leave a shine. Like the Spike Edge a bit more. This one adds a bit too much volume.</li>
            <li> Kind of just made my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, because I wanted to replace the teenager style Axe hair product I have been using for a decade. This one works great and smells great too. Leaves the hair looking wet and with a bit of a stiffener reactions but it is not &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; or anything like that. Superior to Axe products (not hard to believe) and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> If you are an Asian male, you will understand how hard it is to style your hair, and might even think that it&#x27;s impossible. Luckily for you, you have stumbled upon your solution! I don&#x27;t like a wet or spiky look, so I use this to give my hair a dry style. Very moldable throughout the day, too.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gave the best texture and hold for my hair compared to the other Gatsby products I&#x27;ve tried. Previously I used the Loose Shuffle, Air Rise, and Grunge Mat. Loose Shuffle was my previous favorite for holding my spikes on the top and back of my head, Air Rise was my favorite for my sides as it gave a nice teased look, and Grunge Mat was nice for thinning and defining hair bundles even more for certain styles. Aside from Grunge Mat, Wild Shake managed to replace both of the other products I&#x27;ve been using at the same time. It doesn&#x27;t quite give the same texture as Air Rise on my sides, but still gave the volume I wanted, and I switched to curling the ends on my sides out anyways for a different look so the change in texture wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to Wild Shake is the smell! It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as any of the other products I mentioned earlier, and has a strong sort of latex or silicone rubber smell to it. My favorite part of all of the Gatsby products is the pleasant smell, but this one was a bit lacking in that respect. It did have a bit of a green apple smell to it like Air Rise, but it was overpowered by that rubbery smell.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for my hair and it usually does well. I love Gatsby and I have many colors.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend, and he loves it. He switched over to this after years of using got 2b gel and all those other hair gel brands. He uses Gatsby everyday for his hair now and loves how it doesn&#x27;t make the hair stiff. There is also a fairly pleasant smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;Since I have re-ordered this every month for this year now, I think it deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Good hold just have to learn what amount you need to use. Better for shorter hair I&#x27;d say. Works best if hair is dry first.</li>
            <li> I have medium asian hair and I like this a lot. This is my first gatsby and it styles the way I want it too look without looking unnatural. The scent of green apples is great. What I dislike about it is that it is hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> very good product we like very cool and stylish using gatsby make us exceptionally glad xoxo very nice very style</li>
            <li> I have short \\&quot;asian\\&quot; hair (which just means that it&#x27;s coarse and stubborn) and this stuff works like a charm.  It&#x27;s a cream with a consistency of pudding in the container so I was little sketical at first. However, when I put it on my hair, it worked like magic to hold my stubborn hair like magic.  Like many Japanese things, that get little carried away and make like \\&quot;20\\&quot; different versions of these with varying strength. I suggest you try [[ASIN:B00A7YVOH2 B00A7YVOH2]] as a good started as it&#x27;s like a sampler pack.</li>
            <li> For the past few years I have been trying to find the perfect hair holding product. First it was blue hair gel that had little or no hold, and then thick gel which was great for my spiky hair. The problem was that gel makes your hair look too stiff and hard. I recently tried RedKin hair wax which was good for short hair, but just left my medium hair length floppy, and it took a good 20 minutes to get it fully in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about the Gatsby hair wax as it was not a thick wax, but once I ran it through my hair it had an amazing hold. In 5 minutes my hair was fully in place with little shine and no hard look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buying again!</li>
            <li> Overpriced but works well with my husband&#x27;s hair texture. Doesn&#x27;t hold up for too long unless you set it with spray though.</li>
            <li> The best hairstyling product is this one can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I usually love Gatsby products and have had this one before, but the one I ordered recently was awful.  Usually I love opening a new container and using it for the first time.  But this time I opened it and was disappointed.  The product is usually like a semi-liquid, but this one is hardened and is like clay.  the product seems to have denatured and doesn&#x27;t work as well as it should.  I am very displeased with this.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hair product with strong hold, that doesn&#x27;t loose effect over the day, and that doesn&#x27;t have a greasy or oily look or build up....and this is it.  It provides a natural textured look without making your hair sticky or stiff.  It&#x27;s a soft wax in the container, but after you put a little on your palm and rub your hands together, then run your hands through your hair, it provides great all day hold.  Check out the description as the different products Gatsby offers have different hold and shine ratings.</li>
            <li> This product feels, smells, and looks great! Not only does it get the job done, but if you ever feel like changing up the style on a whim throughout the day, you can just remold it. The product does not &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; yet it isn&#x27;t wet. That&#x27;s the beauty of hair wax.</li>
            <li> Well I finished using it so I thought I would leave a review. It is pretty decent for its price and does what it claims to do. Your hair will feel a little sticky but it will definitely help you create a fringe hairstyle.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair like a charm with no problems, defenetly recommend this one for a crazy look.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moD7HXHX17L34G]]Gatsby Moving Rubber is a hair wax brand unlike any other. For the price of the product, you get a steal. This thing can cost as much as 20 dollars and hair addicts will clamor for it . It just goes to show the company really cares about affordability in its customers. The wild shake comes in a soft touch purple rubber container that is aesthetically beautiful. It has the hint of grape to its fragrance and I think it is very creative!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the effectiveness of the product itself. The product has the best hold out of any hair wax I have used with just a little bit of shine. It creates beautiful textures on my fringes. Compared to axe messy hair it is much less sticky. Axe messy hair tended to leave a lot of residue on my palms and fingers even accumulating on my hair from time to time and people had to get it out. This product seamlessly integrates itself into my hair while at the same time not showing any apparent flakes. It also holds a lot better. If you want less shine go with the grey grunge matte. All in all a great product for short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Japan makes the greatest items. Wild Shake Gatsby is perfect for those of us with short hair. And it smells so good! Also, I love how the product isn&#x27;t gross and sticky like regular hair gel. It&#x27;s soft and pliant and you can really work with it. This stuff is seriously worth the money. Thanks Gatsby!</li>
            <li> I have both the Grey Grunge and the Air rise wax as well and this one is the one I really like to use on the daily. Doesn&#x27;t give much poof to my layered hair, but it gives it enough to make it seem like my hair isn&#x27;t so thin :P</li>
            <li> I like this product.  For the price, I think it&#x27;s great.  I use it on a daily basis.  It provides a matte finish with good hold and plenty of flexibility.  It washes out without a problem in warm water and I have not seen any adverse affects to my hair or scalp over the past 24 months I&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works best on dry hair and not damp hair.</li>
            <li> After trying many hair waxes, gels, mousses, pomades, sprays, and whatever those kids make in their kitchens or labs and subjecting them to my thick unruly Asian hair, Gatsby moving rubber hair waxes is one of the very few hair products that seems to work reliably and makes sure hair stylish and popping. Without it, my hair just looks plain and far from fun.&lt;br /&gt;Girls respond to a stylish modern man, so keep your hair stylish and classy</li>
            <li> I like it ,it&#x27;s not my first time using this product , it&#x27;s  really great and I recommended it .</li>
            <li> This product is good for stubborn hair. I usually put it in damp hair so it is easier to work with but make sure its not too wet otherwise it wont work like it should. The only thing that I do not like about this product is the fact that it is very very hard to wash out of your hair. You deff need a clarifying shampoo with this product!</li>
            <li> Im white, thin straight hair, but I like some volume, all day hold while still being pliable and not looking like grease in my hair.  The moving rubber i tried first and it was by far the best product ive ever tried, even compared to a bottle of Aquage transforming paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purple container is not as volumizing as the moving rubber, and seems to absorb into the hair leaving a thin film of crustiness on my hair...my recommendation is going with the pink moving rubber if you have hair like mine.</li>
            <li> This is the only styling product I buy and use for my hair. I wish there was a local store that carries it but since there isn&#x27;t, amazon is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I have always struggled to find a good product for my picky hair, and I think I may have found it with the Gatsby Moving Rubber Wild Shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had incredibly thick medium-short hair that teeters back and forth from being just wavy to curly, and this product helped me style my hair in a way that gets me many compliments.  Before this product I used the Bumble &amp; Bumble Sumo Tech Styling Wax, which is still a favorite, but the Gatsby product just seems to work with my hair in a much more natural way. (Plus,Gatsby being 1/3 the price of Sumo Tech</li>
            <li> Out of all the hair products I have used, this wax has been the best. These products are way better than some of the American Crew products. They even work on really thick hair like mine. I know these products are aimed for people that have hair like asians, but they worked really well for me even though I have hair nothing like asains.</li>
            <li> Great product that is hard to find in the U.S.other than at the occasional Japanese grocer / market.  This purple one has a nice hold but is still more creamy than clay like. Matte finish with no crunch.</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through numerous types of hair gel and wax over the years, and my previous best was the stuff you find in salons - American Crew Fibaer ($15), but have since settled on Gatsy Moving Rubber Purple (and the Pink one as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Amazing strength, hair doesn&#x27;t fall down after using a small dab on the fingers.&lt;br /&gt;- Timing, lasts till the end of the day&lt;br /&gt;- Moderately hard to wash out of your hair, but easier than some other waxes out there&lt;br /&gt;- Used to have to visit stores in J-town to find this, now on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. I like the Red one the best. Green one is also nice. But I don&#x27; buy this one in the future.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have ever used. Smells great and holds in place all day. I have reordered this hair product about 5 times now without any issue whatsoever. Get lots of compliments on my hair. So happy I found this product. A container last&#x27;s me about 3 months.</li>
            <li> Way better than any products that are in stores. True strong, rubber hold with no flaking or stiffness.</li>
            <li> Not exactly great to the touch (a little sticky) but it works in a way no other products I&#x27;ve tried have. instructions suggest a fingertip&#x27;s worth, and that&#x27;s usually plenty.</li>
            <li> The PRODUCT is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find it SOOO much cheaper online.</li>
            <li> This product works great, hold hair in place, but not too stiff.  Strong, but washes out easily.  I use it every day and prefer it to anything else.</li>
            <li> Very good hold for pin straight Asian hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it every morning and have all the different style types. Cheap and work super well!</li>
            <li> This is da bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like wearing my hair disheveled... In a messy, but controlled; scruffy, but neat kinda way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what gets me there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the Pink version -- way too stiff. I&#x27;ve tried the Green one -- not enough control... This purple varietal is the best of both worlds. It&#x27;s just THAT awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to be cool, this is the one to get. Do it!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this is pretty much the only product I use for my hair! It keeps it up and looks natural!</li>
            <li> I like it very much, just enough lift without my hair being hard and shinny from gel&lt;br /&gt;although it has a weird fruity smell but its not that bad</li>
            <li> i like this good quality ship very fast and it is same as introduced everything is good about this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good wax. It leave residue on your hands after using. But it gets the job done and there&#x27;s a slight shine to it which is hard to find in most waxes.</li>
            <li> Best hair product for men.  It gives you a great hold without making it look like you have any product in your hair!</li>
            <li> It does the job. A bit more sticky than I had thought it would be, but it does indeed hold up throughout the day, and then some.</li>
            <li> My brother and I use this when we need it. It has a strong hold and lasts all day. Very good.</li>
            <li> People say that this this mold is supposed to be super strong. It&#x27;s just as strong as bed head. I have straight thick asian hair and it&#x27;s REALLY hard to find anything that can hold it up. This does absolutely nothing, except make my hair smell like product.</li>
            <li> I discovered Gatsby a few years ago and really its the best brand of hair styling stuff I have used. Many are not strong or resilient enough for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really you need to use only a little and it can style for volume and can really shape your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or use a bit more and you can be quite creative!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff, try all the Gatsby styles - they are bloody great.</li>
            <li> This wax works well. hair looks Naturally mess.&lt;br /&gt; everything I put this thing my hair looks sexy!!&lt;br /&gt;and stay in the same shape until the end of the day</li>
            <li> Out of all the hair gels/waxes/goops/etc. I&#x27;ve tried, Gatsby Moving Rubber is my absolute favorite. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard like some gels or hairsprays. Yet it&#x27;s still strong, unlike lots of gels. A little bit (it goes a long way) allows you to shape your hair any way you see fit. No shine, no mess, just a great product.</li>
            <li> I have finally found the perfect hair wax. Because of the properties of this wax, I am able to keep my hair from covering my ears, which has always been affecting my hearing. I am now able to sit in the back row in class with the cool kids and still hear the professor. I sat next to the hot girls. This wax got me laid.</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loves this stuff!  He has very thick Asian har and it holds great without flaking!  Forget the other products out there...this is the one!</li>
            <li> Love it! My hair is thick and hard to manage. This stuff gives me excellent control that is tweakable during the day yet it&#x27;s not hard and crunchy like hair gels. I can sculpt my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white guy with medium length naturally straight hair and I have tried multiple brands and types of hair gel, hairspray, paste and they all seem to work terribly with my hair type; However this product is awesome and sculpts my hair perfectly and keeps it messy spiked just the way i like it. I&#x27;ve tried 3 types of the product and have been happy with them all. One little 80g thing is about the size of a hockey puck and lasts forever (Months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found works best is while my hair is shorter and wants to stay down i used the Pink \\&quot;spiky edge\\&quot; to maintain my style throughout the day. Then a few weeks into my haircut I switch to the Purple \\&quot;Wild shake\\&quot; because it basically is a variation of the spiky edge specifically for a bit longer hair. I&#x27;ve also tried the \\&quot;Air rise\\&quot; which is good too but probably for a bit longer of hair than i have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: The product is awesome and I don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;ll do if they ever discontinue it. Spiky edge/wild shake combo is what i use depending on the length of my hair and they both work phenomenally. You should buy this product over shit like Axe hair any day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you have read reviews on Gatsby products.  First of all they are great!  Great hold strong and with excellent control.  The only issue I have with the moving rubber wild shake is that it leaves a residue in your hair that makes it a little sticky... of course this is why it works so well.  If you are willing to have great styled hair, but not great feeling hair this is the product.</li>
            <li> I had about every U.S hair products I can get my hands on but noting worked for my hair everyone of them sucked as a big fan of everything Japan I had gatsby on my mined for a long time I was thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t work for me:will the hell with it I&#x27;am going to try it and it did like noting I looked at the crap U.S hair product and said why did you do that then I threw everyone of them in the trash and then I Laugh like Phil ken HA HA HAAA!!!!! YES http://youtu.be/JuQ9fk2UeT4 I think they should bring gatsby to the U.S god knows I need HA HA HAAA! Dangly Parts</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it boasts, perfect to make nice spikes but yet retains a moveable and manageable hold...even on baby fine hair.  I use this after applying the Gatsby Perfect Hold Wax all over.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks it out! I have short spikey hair and have tried every product from expensive to cheap to get my hair to stand up and stay up. Some products are greasy, some weigh your hair down so your style doesn&#x27;t hold. This stuff? INCREDIBLE!!!!  my hair stays pieced, standing up or laying down... the exact way I want it and it will stay like that all day long without feeling sticky or looking greasy. I have this one and the one in pink which is called the Spiky Edge wax. The pink has more hold but I usually end up mixing both.</li>
            <li> I used this product during my high school years because my brother had it. This is actually my first time ordering one for myself, but I know how this product works. As for as description, it&#x27;s exactly as described. I got my product today, which is a week before the earliest estimated delivery date (received: Aug. 27 / estimate: Sep. 4).</li>
            <li> Pretty good product for medium hair and makes my hair look natural and controlled. Usually my hair is just boring and really stringy like a chia pet but this helps! The gatsby doesn&#x27;t hold what I want all day but it&#x27;s better than chia hair. If you want stronger hold I would recommend adding another hair product which I&#x27;m not familiar with. Hair spray? Maybe? Oh and it&#x27;s awesome for asian hair not the best but awesome.</li>
            <li> Received it on time and in great shape too. Best wax i have tried on the market compare to the american ones</li>
            <li> Got damn this stuff works homeboy!  I be looking freshhh doe!  It&#x27;s a must have for yall who wanna have a hairstyle you want for a whole day, even if you get water on yoself!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the yellow version for a few years but this product works wonders, but it also has it&#x27;s cons. Your hair can be reshaped all day and has an amazing apple scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for others: follow the instruction on their website, it really helps&lt;br /&gt;*don&#x27;t use conditioner coz it makes your hair really sticky once you apply the wax.&lt;br /&gt;*don&#x27;t apply too much, it makes the hair look unrealistic.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me, it didn&#x27;t hold up as much as the gray one did. The gray one is better and i recommend it for people who have short to medium hair.</li>
            <li> Product works great, is a fair and reasonable price, shipped the day after I purchased it. This stuff also lasts forever and is great in any length of hair. Literally lasts all day and is mold-able throughout the day. Leave it to Japan to make an amazing product ;)</li>
            <li> Favorite hair product thus far.. Grew up with thick hair that was ugly. This wax functioned better than clay, promade (spelling goof), and other stuff. Too much made my hair feel weird, too little was passable but couldn&#x27;t stand up to my daily bike commute. The right amount, which I never seem to get onto my finger, is amazing. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> great product! Bought this for my sister&#x27;s boyfriend and he LOVES it. It holds up really well and a little goes a long way. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> Works well but leaves hair feeling sticky all day</li>
            <li> This is the heaviest product I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  Didn&#x27;t like the texture either.</li>
            <li> This hair wax is really hard to wash it off, it leaves a dry &amp; residual feeling to your hair. The wax has a strong hold, it kinda makes it hard to style your way you wanted. I would strongly recommend American Crew - Fiber instead.</li>
