            <li>Really good weight and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I had no problem fitting my tweezerman brush and merkur model 180 on the stand.</li>
            <li>so my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t mind if I leave it out between shaves.  :)</li>
            <li>There is another 1\\&quot; piece of all-thread which screws into the top of the shaft, through the flange that holds the razor and brush, and into a acorn nut--the top of the unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s made just like you would think, just like it would have been 100 years ago and for the most part out of quality materials that would have been used 100 years ago.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>It has not tipped over after more than a month of use.</li>
            <li>Most of all it passed the &amp;#34;wife test.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Either way I am extremely satisfied with this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this choice...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay more for anything that looks like this one.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Very beautiful, looks like one solid piece.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have done any better.  </li>

            <li>I love the styling.</li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy stand and it looks great.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me.</li>
            <li>Description of unit says it fits most brush sizes, this is not the case.</li>
            <li>I have nothing more to say about this product</li>
            <li>Count me as a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the stand.</li>
            <li>I am able to make do by putting the brush on the stand where the handle joins the bristles.</li>
            <li>My Merkur 34 fits perfectly and it has held up with daily use.</li>
            <li>When hanging the brush, make sure you wash it out and the bristles are facing downwards!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am extremely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>5-stars:&lt;br /&gt;-It was priced better</li>
            <li>It keeps my brush (Silvertip Badger, of course) and razor in position and reduces clutter on the counter top.</li>
            <li>, it gets the job done, what more to complain about?</li>
            <li>Its a nice stand and relatively cheap.  </li>
            <li>It fits, yes, but could be better.</li>
            <li>It is on permanent display on my bathroom counter top.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and it looks great.</li>
            <li>When I replace it I will make sure it fits my stand.</li>
            <li>Holds both perfectly and solidly built.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I love the look and glad to have a place to hang my badger brush.</li>

            <li>What more can you expect?</li>

            <li>very sturdy, works great</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>otherwise the item is top quality.</li>
            <li>I love the way it has cleaned up my bathroom sink...and moved my razor to safety:</li>
            <li>Check to make sure the holder widths are compatible with your razor/brush dimensions.</li>
            <li>perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is stable, elegant and functional.</li>
            <li>- they have to hang by the knot rather than the top of the handle like I wanted.</li>
            <li>We love this shaving stand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite elegant, substantial and well made.  </li>
            <li>The stand is solidly built and is an excellent stand for my Merkur Futur razor and brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this stand.</li>

            <li>My hubby loves his stand, and I love that his extra-manly shaving kit is stored in a neat and orderly fashion.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I ordered this stand but didn&#x27;t research if the parker brush would fit, but it did!  </li>
            <li>I have a Merkur short handle razor and a Tweezerman badger hair brush; it fits the stand perfectly lengthwise.</li>
            <li>Is very sturdy and looks great.</li>
            <li>My twenty year old brush fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Somehow elevates the chore of shaving to something more.</li>
            <li>This stand is very sturdy, and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>but I love seeing the quality of this device every day.</li>
            <li>The ends of the stand should be turned up a bit more to help hold the items on the stand better.  </li>
            <li>Nothing more needed by me.</li>
            <li>Wise purchase if you need a nice looking, quality stand that is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Good to have the right stuff:)</li>
            <li>Is a very nice product, heavy, and fit my husbands badger brush and razor perfectly!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, hefty, solid stand, at a good price.  </li>

            <li>Looks very nice and seems very durable.  </li>
            <li>What can I say, it&#x27;s classy and clean and an excellent display of bathroom</li>
            <li>The brush can be &amp;#34;hung&amp;#34; on it but not the appropriate way so it doesn&#x27;t look as clean and snazzy as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li>Looks very stylish, helps preserve the shape of my badger brush after use, and overall is a great addition to my bathroom vanity top.</li>

            <li>The bottom is weighted to keep it from tipping over and the height is perfect for holding a badger shaving brush and pretty much any quality shaving razor.</li>
            <li>It keeps clean and shines up really nicely with just a damp cloth.</li>
            <li>nice look and clean look.</li>

            <li>I can honestly say that the quality of the Escali stand is right on par with the overpriced one at &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34;.  </li>

            <li>I have other stands and cheaper stands but this is the best !</li>

            <li>Easy fix.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of stands out there, but the price and style made this an easy choice.</li>
            <li>The stand that came with my husband&#x27;s badger hair shaving brush was flimsy and rusted very quickly.</li>
            <li>easily* insert a Gilette ProGlide</li>
            <li>Because they do not, the razor and brush are precariously supported and can easily fall off.</li>
            <li>Well packaged and came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.</li>

            <li>so it will not tip over easily.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the purchase, glad i was able to save money.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed to get my brush &amp; razor out of the way, yet easy to get to in a quality product.</li>
            <li>I have been making do with a plastic cup for my DE Razor and brush for a while and decided that it was time to get something more useful and better looking.</li>
            <li>Love the stand looks nice and is very portable.</li>
            <li>and I cannot foresee it being easily knocked over.  </li>
            <li>It does gather water stains, but can easily be cleaned with a damp cloth.</li>

            <li>Very quick delivery.</li>

            <li>so it won&#x27;t tip easy.</li>
            <li>Water stains wipe off easily.</li>
            <li>I love the finish and the clean look.</li>

            <li>I love this little stand because it has great balance, holds my razor and brush nicely, and still fits in my medicine cabinet so that nobody has to see it.</li>
            <li>It holds both the razor and the brush for proper drying and does so in an easily cleaned and beautiful fashion.  </li>
            <li>The stands in the malls are a lot more money and not half as good.</li>

            <li>For the first time in my 69 years I can honestly say I look forward to shaving now.  </li>
            <li>The Parker razor&#x27;s handle is a bit longer than an average DE razor handle but the stand holds both it and the Art of Shaving brush perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It was boxed nicely for wrapping and arrived pretty promptly.</li>
            <li>Looks nice and it beats the higher priced version.</li>
            <li>Looks are terrific and beautifully displays my DE razor and brush.  </li>

            <li>it seems nice, and it is pretty.</li>
            <li>Gives my old Gillette a nice retro look!</li>
            <li>It also works brilliantly with the Paker Safety Razor 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Ebony handle (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LY2PG4/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2) which also highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it sure gleams easily when you quickly towel it off.</li>
            <li>My husband just loved this new stand he received for his birthday.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s non-stick and fine around water.  </li>
            <li>Works just fine -</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping this merchant is a straight shooter, what you see is what you get!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this exact one, but I&#x27;m sure that all the others work just as well.</li>
            <li>I recommend measuring your shaver &amp; brush first, because mine didn&#x27;t fit, but that&#x27;s my own fault.  </li>
            <li>but it fits both the brush and razor just fine.</li>
            <li>but once that&#x27;s done its just fine.</li>
            <li>It holds my razor and my brush just fine.</li>

            <li>Seems fine.  </li>
            <li>Which is fine, but</li>

            <li>I have a long-handled Merkur razor and this holds it fine.</li>

            <li>Looks fine..</li>
            <li>It might not work for a longer (non-standard) razor or brush, but was fine for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on, it stays on fine.</li>
            <li>Would make a fine gift.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>Super sturdy too!</li>
            <li>THE PRICE AND THE QUALITY WAS SUPER!</li>
            <li>Fits my Merkur 38c perfectly, as I hand the razor upside down, but it would fit right-side up, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The small company working thru Amazon was wonderful with very nice pakaging and super fast delivery....</li>
            <li>Seems to be pretty good product, but right off the bat</li>
            <li>The brush holder is perfect; the razor holder is just a teensy bit too tight to *</li>
            <li>My Escali brush and Merkur razor fit on it just fine.  </li>
            <li>Both fit just fine.  </li>
            <li>Fit and finish are just fine with no issues.</li>
            <li>Very stylish, clean and classic!</li>
            <li>I have been using the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and</li>
            <li>of the cost of a certain popular men&#x27;s shaving store that is spreading around the country.</li>
            <li>I made a little adjustment to the brush prongs and now fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>This little stand works great for both!</li>
            <li>My boar bristle brush I picked up at Walmart doesn&#x27;t fit, but a badger brush I picked up on Amazon fit&#x27;s just fine</li>
            <li>My Van Der Hagen badger brush didn&#x27;t fit, but I&#x27;m working on purchasing a brush from Whippeddog.com that should fit just fine.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected - high quality, razor and brush fit perfectly, looks good in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and holds both the razor and the brush securely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solidly built, holds the razor and brush securely, and looks great.</li>
            <li>Not much that can be said about this - it looks great, matches most safety razors (including mine, a Mekeur 180) and is well made.  </li>
            <li>The stand is very solid, sturdy and looks great in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>great design and made to last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t comment on how it would fit.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it with the Tweezerman&#x27;s brush and the Merkur Long-Handled Safety Razor and have had no issues with fit or support of either.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.  </li>
            <li>Nothing flimsy or cheap about it at all.</li>
            <li>so I cut the bristles to fit the (holder to the base)length.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband and it&#x27;s heavy, sturdy, and attractive!  </li>
            <li>I received a gift certificate for a straight razor shave and really liked the result.</li>
            <li>I really like this stand as it keeps my razor and brush handy and out of the way.</li>
            <li>It is does not seem cheaply made it.  </li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job holding my razor and brush.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>a great choice I made when I finally landed on the Escali stand.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Looks great, fits the Escali 100% Badger Shaving Brush I also purchased and provides enough clearance for the&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not quite fit my custom razor.  </li>
            <li>My brush and DE razor fit well.</li>
            <li>so the razor stand feels secure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing, I went through 10 brushes in about 4 years  because I was too darned cheap to buy one of these.</li>
            <li>Simple, functional stand that works great with my brush and razor.</li>
            <li>The stand is made very well and looks nice with my razor and brush.</li>
            <li>I have a Mach 3 style razor from an online retailer that sells the generic versions and it fits great in the razor side.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because my brush didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Would be great in brushed nickel too.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my fiancé for Valentine&#x27;s day so he can fit his razor and Art of Shaving brush</li>
            <li>Overall great buy.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t get my Omega Proraso and Semogue 2000 brushes to fit on the stand.</li>
            <li>However not all razors fit without sliding off.</li>
            <li>The Escali Razor &amp; Brush stand is an overall great purchase.  </li>
            <li>For cheap.</li>
            <li>The forks should curve up at the ends to securely hold razor and brush.  </li>
            <li>This is NOT some chintzy plastic/metal hybrid with a cheap chrome-colored paint over it.</li>
            <li>handle so that it would fit in the holder.  </li>
            <li>I had to bend it to make it fit</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my brush....</li>
            <li>I really like the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand that I got for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>However, it fits perfectly on the narrow &amp;#34;waist&amp;#34; of the handle.</li>
            <li>It is very well constructed and has a nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li>Great stand, solid build and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I got all this safety razor shaving equipment but thought I could cheap out here</li>
            <li>so have to secure where brush meets the handle.</li>
            <li>Looks great and has a solid build quality.</li>
            <li>Quality is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if it would fit</li>
            <li>The brush and razor fit well</li>
            <li>This is a heavy chrome stand and is a beautiful addition to my shaving kit!</li>
            <li>Smudges clean off easily with a paper towel.  </li>
            <li>The Cassani mirror is truly fogless, as promised, and hangs lightly from the Cassani hook which I have attached beneath my shower head.  </li>
            <li>But here I bought almost free.</li>
            <li>EASY TO CLEAN</li>
            <li>I had to bend it a bit to fit my art of shaving brush</li>
            <li>simple, attractive, shaving system stand.</li>
            <li>The chrome finish looks decorative and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>it looks great and and is solid and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A must have for gents who enjoy a morning shave.</li>
            <li>spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important note</li>
            <li>Fits Escali shaving brush and Edwin Jagger Razor (with some height to spare, could probably fit a longer razor).</li>
            <li>I was concerned before ordering if it would fit my razor as well as the handle of my brush.  </li>
            <li>The stand is built of the highest quality and definitely compliments any safety razor and brush combination while providing great stability.</li>
            <li>Practical, affordable, great looking, solid construction, what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li>It fit my brush and razor, it looks snazzy and it fits in every place I&#x27;ve moved.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solid, and looks great.</li>
            <li>At the $20 price point I was expecting something flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably buy the stainless steel one and fabricate my own shaver and brush stand if this one rusts on me.</li>
            <li>Overall a great purchase</li>
            <li>Definitely fits my brush and razor and looks great in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Stays upright well, and the razor and brush fit</li>
            <li>However, it does fit at the bristles.</li>
            <li>For the price this stand is very sturdy and nice.</li>
            <li>it probably wont fit in this stand.</li>
            <li>Fits my Merkur razor and brush very well and has a surprisingly nice weight.</li>
            <li>and they both fit on here</li>
            <li>It is an attractive stand, shiny chrome, solid weight.</li>
            <li>so the chrome is still holding up fabulously.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy nostaglia</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do anything but hold your tools for you, but this is a nice quality piece.  </li>
            <li>My brush didn&#x27;t fit either, but</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s important to hang your shaving brush upside (promotes longevity of the brush), this works well.</li>
            <li>Before buying this, I tried to find a list of brushes that would fit this or dimensions, but couldn&#x27;t find any of that.  </li>
            <li>Solid, attractive and well-made.  </li>
            <li>both fit well, with plenty of room</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s well worth it, and it beats having your razor and brush just sitting on the counter top.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain, nice finish.</li>
            <li>Fantastic stand for razor and brush.</li>
            <li>Nicely made stand for reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, yet an attractive addition to the vanity.  </li>
            <li>Solid stand that looks great as part of any shave kit.</li>
            <li>Sturdy stand holds my heavy DE safety razor without toppling over and the finish is excellent.</li>
            <li>However, I like the stand itself and will keep it so that when I purchase a shave brush from Parker it will hopefully fit the stand.</li>
            <li>Great stand, very solid and balanced.  </li>
            <li>so far looks great, solid and has good weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks and feel as promised.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and looks nice.</li>
            <li>Razor side should fit any DE or SE razor made (except perhaps the Merkur Futur or Vision; haven&#x27;t tried those).</li>
            <li>Nice chrome and very weighty.</li>
            <li>The chrome is smooth and well done.  </li>
            <li>This was a great purchase, especially for the money!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s slimmest spot to fit.</li>
            <li>It holds my razor and brush very well and is really nice to look at.  </li>
            <li>next time- not as smooth a shave as the 3 or 4 blade disposables, but with good soap, it is much more of a pleasure.</li>
            <li>Overall the quality is great at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, not made of cheap material of cheaply built.</li>
            <li>the brush fit the stand</li>
            <li>also like that it has some weight on the bottom, which keeps everything secure.</li>
            <li>Did not feel wobbly, felt sturdy and secure on my sink.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit my brushes , an Omega and a no-name.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>in fact, said he liked it much better.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Holds my DE safety razor and brush securely and out of the way.</li>
            <li>brush holder did fit my brush</li>
            <li>have an Edwin Jagger DE89, and it fits securely upright or upside down.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for, free shipping came</li>
            <li>fit for my Escali badger brush &amp; Merkur #34C DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>chrome fit and finish, must have shaving accesory.</li>
            <li>I like the bright chrome finish, though it does necessitate frequent cleaning if you keep it nearby when shaving so that it accumulates soap splashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>I was worried this would be a light weight stamped piece of metal.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great stand for the money.</li>
            <li>Awesome stand - heavy duty- looks and works</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit my razor, which wobbles and falls out each time I touch the thing.</li>
            <li>It is a great choice and terrific value.</li>
            <li>how much I&#x27;d appreciate my Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand</li>
            <li>I bought myself a birthday present (along with the GREAT edwin Jaeger</li>
            <li>so overall i´m happy with it.</li>
            <li>Yes, I would suggest it to someone looking for a cheap stand.</li>
            <li>Holds DE safety razor but not a snug fit.</li>
            <li>It looks great and it is build to last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>I cannot attest to its long-term durability, but I can say that it doesn’t have that cheap feeling that cheap things have…</li>
            <li>it was cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>Stainless, effective and perty on any counter or shower.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and</li>
            <li>but I certainly enjoy this stand.</li>
            <li>I have seen others that have a cheap finish or are flimsy, but that is not the case with the Escali stand.</li>

            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>The stand actually has a nice weight to it, which is nice since you don&#x27;t have to worry about tipping it over.  </li>
            <li>Love this stand looks good next to the sink</li>
            <li>Great product with nice weight to hold heavy DE razors without balance issues.</li>

            <li>Arrived on time, very useful.</li>

            <li>It was very nice relative to the price i paid.</li>

            <li>Overall, very nicely made.  </li>
            <li>Fits my Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor perfectly.</li>
            <li>Chrome finish makes me feel like I&#x27;m rich and important.</li>
            <li>I must say this is excellent, and I would highly recommend as the build quality is solid.  </li>
            <li>This is a real joy because it simply works and is of high quality.</li>
            <li>Clean, cheap, and sturdy.</li>
            <li>This is a nice addition to a classic razor set.</li>
            <li>It accommodates my long handled Merkur razor very well, and my B&amp;B brush fits in the brush cradle perfectly.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m pretty happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does its job, It&#x27;s nice to look at, and it came at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect little razor and brush stand, easy to tuck away, weighted and balanced just right.</li>
            <li>awesome little stand!</li>
            <li>Not had it long but very pleased !</li>
            <li>I wont need to buy a new one because this is better and more stable than the one I bought for over 100 dollars over seas.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to clean though the velvet bottom catches dirt and gunk.</li>
            <li>Looks good on the counter, keeps my shaving brush dry and gives me a safe place to keep my razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only functional, but looks amazing!</li>
            <li>straightforward quality built.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has been well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>What else can you say about this beautiful brush and razor stand.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: NOT stamped &amp;#34;Made in cHINA&amp;#34;, heavy, beautiful prepwork before chroming, the only item that I can leave out on the bathroom counter that my wife doesn&#x27;t complain about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>stand probably isn&#x27;t a product to get excited over, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li>The stand fulfills my needs and looks pretty stylish as it does.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I originally thought that having a stand like this for my safety razor and brush was a luxury.</li>
            <li>Looks beautiful and functions exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>How can one be excited over a razor/brush stand you ask?  </li>
            <li>The original brush I bought for it</li>
            <li>How can one write something to get you excited about a Razor and Brush Stand?  </li>
            <li>The Chrome finish is impeccable and can only be explained as being Harley level.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>This razor/brush stand does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it well in a visually appealing package.</li>
            <li>Way sturdier than I originally anticipated.</li>
            <li>Nice and minimal look too, I love it !</li>
            <li>It does exactly that, and nothing more.</li>
            <li>It fits my Gillette Fusion razor perfectly, but my brush is too small.</li>
            <li>Tip : if you want to shave like your grandfather, you can be pretty sure he wouldn&#x27;t pay $100</li>
            <li>I originally was looking at comparable stands at the Art of shaving that were 4x the price.</li>
            <li>Now he can display them on the vanity, and they&#x27;re easily accessible.</li>
            <li>This sturdy yet small razor stand holds my husband&#x27;s razor perfectly.  </li>
            <li>First impression, I love it.</li>
            <li>Pure Badger Shaving Brush (that I purchased on amazon) perfectly as well as the Parker 99R Long Handle Super Heavyweight razor also purchased on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Bought a  Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; Long Safety Razor and this stand works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Having this smartly designed stand is functional (allows the razor and brush to air-dry naturally) and makes an accessory that is proudly displayed on my counter.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and strong!</li>
            <li>great choice for my long handled razor!  </li>
            <li>Easily clean.  </li>
            <li>The only item I need now to complete the set is the perfect Razor.</li>
            <li>Looks clean.</li>
            <li>Could be a smidgeon more base-heavy, and it would be nice if the razor side worked with different razor brands.  </li>
            <li>Quite satisfied, especially since it&#x27;s priced nicely.</li>
            <li>Okay got this 2 days ago as a gift, so far I love it.</li>
            <li>Clean, sleek look.</li>
            <li>This unit does the job, clean lines and presents</li>
            <li>It is best for the old fashioned double edge razor.</li>
            <li>and when I clean the mirror...</li>
            <li>I dropped some cream on it once or twice and clean up was a breeze.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and clean.</li>
            <li>I probably should&#x27;ve looked into it a bit more before buying it, but I really have to shove my brush in there to get it to stay, and it doesn&#x27;t really fit.</li>
            <li>I have to say, seeing his shaving brush and safety razor hung on this stand, on our bathroom counter, looks so much more elegant than his old electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I wish these things were easier to clean.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and hassle free.</li>
            <li>The general air of 1950s sophistication with which it imbues my bathroom is pretty great too.</li>
            <li>The stand is nice and heavy and does the job you want it to do, and it looks good while doing it.  </li>
            <li>and it fits into the little slot perfectly and hangs just right.  </li>
            <li>my Parker 99R Long Handle razor fits very nicely with room to spare.</li>
            <li>received promptly and packaged nicely... very professional.</li>
            <li>the reviews for the Escali seem more positive than the reviews of the Col Conk; time will tell I guess.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It fits his brush perfectly and he can either support his safety razor or straight edge razor on the other side.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I can&#x27;t think of many chrome plated items that don&#x27;t show water spots (other than some Moen and Delta faucets).</li>
            <li>No visible rust after many months of use, perfectly fits my razor and brush, and allows enough room for the brush to air dry a bit.  </li>
            <li>Well, the stand arrived, and it is very nicely done, beautiful chrome, and heavy enough to hold the jagger de89 from the handle, or the head, depending on how you want to display it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stand certainly beats laying his shaving items on the counter top or in a bowl.  </li>
            <li>After being convinced to move from the skin irritation of shaving with an electric razor, I bought some top quality shaving cream along with Escali&#x27;s Pure Badger shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure that your brush handle isnt for large sized</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband as a special gift for his birthday.</li>
            <li>I have no major complaints; this is just a beautiful, functional product that works exactly as advertised without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>Seems to stay clean and put very well on a porcelain counter top.</li>
            <li>very high quality needed it for razor and brush glad I did</li>
            <li>The order arrived right on time, and packaged securely,  The item was a (specifically requested) Christmas gift, and the recipient was excited about it.</li>
            <li>High quality, as good as stands that cost 4-5 time as much.  </li>
            <li>It was great nicer then I expected.</li>
            <li>Liked my first one so much</li>
            <li>Good brush stand, however the yoke for the brush does not accomodate larger diameter brushes.</li>
            <li>Looks nice on the counter, fairly classy with a Merkur razor and Escali brush.</li>
            <li>It will hold a full size razor and brush.</li>
            <li>This would make a nice gift for anybody who shaves with the old school shaving brush, regardless of the razor they use.</li>
            <li>sweet multi use shaving tool</li>
            <li>A fraction of the cost of similar ones - read brand name ones that charge you for the name - but just as good.</li>
            <li>The bottom was nice and soft keeps it in place and doesn&#x27;t scratch counter.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised how nice it was for the price.</li>
            <li>Nice shiny classy finish</li>
            <li>He has told me more than once how much he likes it.</li>
            <li>Works good for most DE razor, including long handle Merkur, Escali Badger brush fits nice, however, the Omega Boar brush handle is larger than the brush opening</li>
            <li>Has a place for your razor and badger brush, and is very sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li>this is a good product, but not a universal product.</li>
            <li>looks well done and very shiny and stylish.</li>
            <li>Finnish has remained true, no rust or flaking of the chrome.</li>
            <li>It has a good solid weight with a rubber grip pad underneath.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time and as described so no question on giving a full rating.</li>
            <li>Looks sweet on the sink.</li>
            <li>This is solidly constructed, looks good on my sink and holds my Edwin Jagger Safety Razor and Escali Brush well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised that the stand came as one unit (no assembly required) and no noticeable screws of any kind.  </li>
            <li>stand is nice and sturdy and classy looking though, so</li>
            <li>The stand has a good solid weight to it.  </li>
            <li>Feels very solid, well built, and from good quality materials.</li>
            <li>My husband wanted to razor and stand to save money and look cool</li>
            <li>The only draw back for me is that it doesn&#x27;t fit my Parker best badger brush.</li>
            <li>A simple device that does what it is supposed to do and looks simply good doing it.</li>
            <li>And the metal is really well done :)</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and sexy.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t speak for the usefulness with a full sized brush.</li>
            <li>To prevent possible corrosion of the stand, I will give it a good coat of car wax.</li>
            <li>Solidly made and good looking.  </li>
            <li>it is a good basic stand.</li>
            <li>I wish I got to use this more, but it holds my razor and brush diligently while I&#x27;m away, ready to go to work anew each morning.</li>
            <li>This stand feels solid and looks good with a chrome razor and lather brush.  </li>
            <li>Solid and looks good.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed my experience so much that I purchased a shaving \\&quot;set\\&quot; as a gift  that included this stand.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the way to if you want to keep you razor and brush in good condition.  </li>
            <li>When my wife saw this item next to our sink, she commented on how good it looked.</li>
            <li>Good solid feel and heft.</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Simple sturdy product - looks good, compact but functional.</li>
            <li>Got fast shipping and product was better than my expectation.</li>
            <li>Surprised how nice the finish is on this thing.</li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy and elegant unit.</li>
            <li>A very well crafted chrome stand that looks elegant.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Escali shaving cream brush at the same time and, it too, is a superior product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solid, has a good weight to it and</li>
            <li>Weight is good so that it doesn&#x27;t wobble around when you&#x27;re putting things back.</li>
            <li>Well made, solid, and just feel good to hold and use.. could not be happier with my purchase and the seller.</li>
            <li>I love all shaving stuff since I was 9, this stand worked really well.</li>
            <li>This makes for a good father&#x27;s day present.</li>
            <li>Love the polished stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>The finninsh is a stylish chrome that matches the finninsh of the razor very well.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad stand</li>
            <li>not bad for $20 delivered.</li>
            <li>importantly, the price is right.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is also pretty easy, a damp cloth does all the work.</li>
            <li>The razor side is a much looser fit but works fine.</li>
            <li>Other than that restriction this stand is a great addition to shaving supplies</li>
            <li>I recommend for keeping shaving articles separate from other items and wife happy about bath appearance</li>
            <li>The only issue iIhave is that out doesn&#x27;t fit my cheap badger brush perfectly, but it works for literally every other brush and razor I could find.</li>
            <li>The stand fits perfectly inside our shallow medicine cabinet when I want it off the counter.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Does the job just fine and the chrome finish looks nice as long as its kept clean.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I had quick shipping and once the stand got here</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quick, arrived with no issue, I&#x27;d buy this again if I needed to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It got to me super quickly too.</li>
            <li>Quick shipped.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it is stainless steel and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It has not rusted at all and with a quick wipe any water marks disappear.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, no problems at all.</li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy, actually much better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I unpacked it.</li>
            <li>Worthy novelty to add to your collection.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Stand was shipped in a quick and timely fashion, well packaged.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly and we&#x27;ll packaged.  </li>
            <li>Quick Delivery, Product as Described</li>
            <li>Very stable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Excellent price too, considering that the Art of Shaving store wanted to charge me $80 for essentially the same thing.</li>
            <li>#34;You have the most luxurious shaver/brush stand&amp;#34; haha, worth it.</li>
            <li>Very well made, easy to luster and clean,</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Not a products you can find in a store, I&#x27;m always leery about reviews, but this products seemed to be worthy of a try.</li>
            <li>easy to clean and much nicer than having things just laying around.</li>
            <li>were plenty satisfied and there&#x27;s no reason this stand wont last many years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly from Perella&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li>Definitely alot cheaper in price than most stands and the quality is alot better too.  </li>
            <li>I bought this stand for the &amp;#34;Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &#x27;Barber Pole&#x27; Long Safety Razor&amp;#34; and it works perfectly, holding everything</li>
            <li>Rave reviews on all the pieces, and this little stand fit in very nicely with the set.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I considered trying to bend the prongs to make everything fit a little bit more nicely, but I didn&#x27;t want to risk scratching it and chipping off the chrome.</li>
            <li>does exactly what it is suppose to do.brush and merkur long handle fits very nicely.</li>
            <li>Not surprisingly, the stand fits perfectly with the Escali shaving brush.</li>
            <li>The first brush I got didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>At first I was pissed because I thought the brush just didn&#x27;t fit at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very elegant looking, and it&#x27;s got enough weight to avoid sliding around the counter when removing and replacing the razor and brush.</li>
            <li>My DE razor kind of barely dangles on, doesn&#x27;t feel stable.</li>
            <li>very stylish, solid, you can feel the metal.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Be aware if you have a Van der Hagen boar brush from the kit it wont fit.</li>
            <li>JUST WHAT I WANTED AND RECEIVED IT VERY FAST!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own a long handled razor, but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now, and I can already tell that it is good quality and will be with me for long time.  </li>
            <li>Good, solid weight, tall enough to hold a long-handled safety razor, and nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>While it is a beautiful stand, the brush does not fit, so he can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>Really nicely made, a good weight, but the opening for the brush is much too narrow for my windmill shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality and most useful product.  </li>
            <li>Good quality stand and the brush is soft and high quality also.</li>
            <li>The chrome is quality, it has a nice shine that it does not loose.</li>
            <li>It fits most brush sizes that I&#x27;ve encountered, and most razors also fit on the other end too.</li>
            <li>so I began my hunt on Amazon for a stylish support stand that was well-made, and complimented our brand new bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I got this with my new razor and badger brush, mostly to feel fancy.  </li>
            <li>Cleans up easily, and most importantly holds my brush and razor off the counter and lets them dry.</li>
            <li>Great stand - exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Looks great in the bathroom and it takes up less space.</li>
            <li>Stand is made very well, strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful razor holder, visually nearly identical to several from The Art of Shaving, but literally at 1/10th of the price.</li>
            <li>The stand was shipped very quickly and packed very well.</li>
            <li>solid product, fits escali brush and merkur long handle perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The height is perfect for a standard length safety razor, but a long handled razor may not sit in the forked hanger</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery was also much appreciated.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and holds the razor and brush easily without tipping over when putting them away.</li>
            <li>It came promptly, looks good and keeps the razor and brush in a compact space and lets it dry efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Comes apart easily so you can travel with it as well, but is very sturdy when assembled.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to get into the world of manly shaving!</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly as presented!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li>The razor stand was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I knew I wanted something functional, sturdy, and aesthetically pleasing, this product was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>My first impression upon taking it out of the box was how good it looked, very shiny and classy.</li>
            <li>Exactly the right fit</li>
            <li>Excellent product, holds both my razor and brush and keeps the brush dry until next use.  </li>
            <li>With a hammer, I was able to spread the prongs enough to slip in easily.</li>
            <li>Perfect to let your shaving brush dry correctly and your double edge razor too.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that my brush didn&#x27;t easily fit into it, though I&#x27;m pretty sure my brush is oversized and probably wouldn&#x27;t fit in any stand.  </li>
            <li>The Derby Blade has been great, and after nearly 3 weeks with 1 blade, I am shaving with less nicks and more comfort than I did with the Wilkinson at any time.  </li>
            <li>Clean, crisp and functional.</li>
            <li>Looks good and with practice handles the chore of holding a razor and brush where they can dry and be available very well.</li>
            <li>Could use a little more length on the razor side to hold the razor better, but the Merkur 33C stays fine.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little device.</li>
            <li>What a great little stand.  </li>
            <li>It looks better and more classical to me than the more modern stands being sold at these new &amp;#34;shaving shops&amp;#34;, and at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>My Harry&#x27;s Razor and 30 year old Kingsley brush fit fine.  </li>
            <li>His original brush was too small to fit, but we purchased a slightly larger one which works great!</li>
            <li>The side to hold the razor is a little off for a disposable but perfect for old school strait razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently ordered this stand along with the shaving brush (Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush) and I cannot be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed anything that even hints of instability in the design, or any product flaws.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say worth the money if you want your shaving set to look nice and be a little better taken care of.</li>
            <li>This stand makes my razor and brush easily accessible, allows the razor and brush to dry and keeps the vanity neat and tidy.</li>
            <li>Great to know I am supporting an American company by purchasing a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Unless you got an unusual or oversized brush or razor it will fit it this stand.</li>
            <li>Great for a heavy safety razor.</li>
            <li>I bought this a few weeks ago and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>The stand is very well made and all the parts fit together snugly.</li>
            <li>The chrome job is great and the bottom is heavy</li>
            <li>This stand is very well made and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>The razor and brush fit very well.  </li>
            <li>This brush stand looks great on my sink, and even holds my heavy chrome brush without a problem.</li>
            <li>OR you  can drop a few dinars and get this attractive shaving stand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheaply made and Looks great.</li>
            <li>I have an Edwin Jagger DE89bl razor and an Escali badger brush, and they both fit very well.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Seems very well made at a most reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Keeps my shaving brush clean and my razor nice and dry.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and has a good solid weight to it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>so much better then laying old razor all over the shelves in the cabinet</li>
            <li>Nothing worth returning it over, but hence the reason for my four-star rating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s versatile enough that I think most of my razors would fit.</li>
            <li>The stand holds both razor and brush firmly, is solidly constructed, and has a nice grip on the bottom</li>
            <li>Its a nice basic stand that will work.</li>
            <li>Definitely would buy it again because of how nice it looks and the quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;J.S. Fort Worth, Texas</li>
            <li>Useful.</li>
            <li>Nice stand and American made!</li>
            <li>I am just getting used to the old school method of shaving now and Love it, always a close shave</li>
            <li>and it just seems like fun breaking a monotonous morning routine.</li>
            <li>Though, we clearly know who would come out on top of that cage match.</li>
            <li>Sort of pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of counter space and overall has a nice look and feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Really nice especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Gave this to my dad as a birthday present because he&#x27;s already using the nice badger fur brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s minimal design is perfect for someone that doesn&#x27;t want a lot of fussy bathroom décor; it&#x27;s solidly built and despite the chrome</li>
            <li>Worth the price; should keep for years.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy again and recommend to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive and nice looking razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li>Compact nice design fits my brush and razor properly..</li>
            <li>It is solid, nice look, well made.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>So nice to find an American made product.  </li>
            <li>It makes my bathroom counter look a bit more classy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy enough to be abused by a teenager, and looks nice as well.</li>
            <li>The design is such that it should fit most razors and brushes on the market today.  </li>
            <li>Nice and simple, matches my safety razor</li>
            <li>so he&#x27;d quit putting his wet shaving brush in the drawer; it worked and he loved it</li>
            <li>A great stand for those needing a simple yet classy accessory.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li>Gives a more mature look than the plastic holder that came with the brush.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>After looking at several offerings on Amazon I stumbled on the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li>Beautiful stand, not much more to add</li>
            <li>Nice job on the chroming.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sits on my bathroom sink and is very solid and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Still handy enough for the travel kit though...</li>
            <li>Everytime I look at it, nostaglia overcomes me and I smile.</li>
            <li>It is functional and performs well in allowing my shaving brush and double-edge safety razor to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And absolute necessity for those who are into wet shaving (a renewed art and a great way to save $ and the environment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It holds my badger hair brush with such tenacity, I feel warm fuzzies inside everytime I look at it.</li>
            <li>The shave is better by far.</li>
            <li>but so far it looks ok.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It holds my razor and my brush and is nice enough to keep out on display in the bathroom even when we have guests.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t slip, is very balanced and secure, and is a good universal size for holding my Merkur Safety Razor &amp; Escali Brush (though I expected this one to fit appropriately).</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Read several reviews, and took a chance on this Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.  </li>
            <li>I might prefer a bit more length on the tines that hold the razor (or perhaps a bit more of an upturn at their ends), but it&#x27;s really not much of a problem unless something bumps it.  </li>
            <li>Good seller, item arrived as expected and on schedule.</li>
            <li>This may sound funny, but it does exactly what is suppose to do; hold my razor and brush.  </li>
            <li>Shaft has same machined style as my merker razor, and my escali brush hangs nicely from it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>complete set sitting on my bathroom sink makes me look and feel sophisticated</li>
            <li>This is a great piece of equipment for the professional man at a low cost.</li>
            <li>get a wider specified knot dimension to be able to fit bigger handles.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Looks great, sturdy one, kind of heavy actually.</li>
            <li>Very solid and has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>This is a solid stand and looks nice.  </li>
            <li>Simple, sturdy, stable, effective, well packed and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>The quality of the Merkur blades is well worth the price difference as the Merkur has platinum edge and is a bit stouter blade.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the mount for the shaver could be a bit longer so it would sit more securely.</li>
            <li>As his mother, I am grateful that I was able to purchase all the components of an \\&quot;old fashioned shave\\&quot; on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Looks great and keeps everything high and dry.</li>
            <li>Strong, high quality.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice, shiny, sturdy, and takes up little room.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice little piece of hardware that helps keep my shaving gear organized.  </li>
            <li>He said he&#x27;s noticed a huge improvement in his skin since switching.&lt;br /&gt;Investing in the right tools really do matter.</li>
            <li>It looks very smart and classy in our master. :)</li>
            <li>Every time I cleaned the bathroom I would clean the stand, spending more time on the old stand than the whole counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works for many other safety razors and brushes also</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers mentioned, this product has a great weight to it, and it&#x27;s very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The product was perfectly adequate, and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and packaged very well too!</li>
            <li>This stand is very nice and heavy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy and hold my brush and razor very nicely.</li>
            <li>Very clean and classy look.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s got a good weight.</li>
            <li>It is quite sharp and is is a good quality product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The stand is sold through Amazon by Parella&#x27;s, a small American from the ground up business, supplying a good product with good customer service.  </li>
            <li>Very neat and useful!</li>
            <li>A lower price would always be nice, but I guess demand isn&#x27;t so high for old school shaving stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a good solid stand with a high quality chrome finish.</li>
            <li>Good buy overall, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Just right size for the tall/long razor</li>
            <li>fits a majority of brushes (using my craptastic escali 10 dollar brush right now).</li>
            <li>Beautiful,sturdy, and just right for my husband&#x27;s long-handled safety razor and brush.</li>
            <li>This one is just right and priced right.</li>
            <li>The packaging was right in point, no damage to the box nor item</li>
            <li>and it arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>Price is right and shipping was speedy.</li>
            <li>My shaving mug fits right under the brush too.  </li>
            <li>He said the weight seemed right for him.</li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>but my Semogue Hog Brush has to be held right where the hairs start.</li>
            <li>Just right.  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>The razor can be a bit tricky to balance it quite right.  </li>
            <li>Have to have it balanced just right, otherwise it falls.</li>
            <li>Works well to keep my brush in the right position for drying and hold my razor.</li>
            <li>and this one is, just right.</li>
            <li>Just the right size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more beautiful than the lousy stock photo.</li>
            <li>This unit is heavy enough and works perfectly with my Escali 100% Badger Shaving Brush ( ASIN BOO3WR3QS6) and my Parker 99R Super Heavyweight Safety Razor (ASINB003NTHWLU)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little razor/brush stand!</li>
            <li>Great little stand!  </li>
            <li>Organizes things well and is very smart looking.</li>
            <li>I really like this stand, specially for the price compared to others I looked at.</li>
            <li>I have a large omega boar brush and it barley fits, but I&#x27;m sure smaller brushes will fit well.</li>
            <li>It would be a great product, if the price was half as much.</li>
            <li>Very good razor-and-brush stand, with a more stable base than many.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about it holding my new Kent BK8, but the brush fits fine without the bristles being pushed by the bar.</li>
            <li>the whole set up looks really cool on my counter.</li>
            <li>I rarely take time to write reviews; however, I realize that many people rely on feedback to know how good (or poor)</li>
            <li>This is small and attractive on the bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra cost compared to some of the cheap look a likes available on here.</li>
            <li>I own a Merkur Long Handle 23c(180)</li>
            <li>also own a vintage shaving cream brush that had longer bristles that happened to be too long</li>
            <li>Solid stand that looks good also ... fits both my brush and razor and keeps both aired out and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Great addition to my bathroom sink!</li>
            <li>Looks pretty good on my sink, holds what it is supposed to hold, no rusting or other cosmetic issues.</li>
            <li>I have the Merkur 180, and the Escali wooden handled badger hair brush, and they both fit it just fine.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my new Parker Safety Razor 100% Best Badger Bristle Shaving Brush -- White &amp; Chrome Handle AND Merkur Long</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly, was packaged nicely and everything I expected!</li>
            <li>I got this stand to go along with a new Escali brush because I knew it would fit.</li>
            <li>&#x27;Twas a smart purchase!</li>
            <li>First off, if you are not using a stand with your brush and safety razor stop right now and buy one.  </li>
            <li>This fits my escali pure badger brush (well, one would hope!)</li>
            <li>I loved it as an addition to my pawpaw&#x27;s old double edge razor I use today.</li>
            <li>The Merkur razor fits nicely, as does his badger hair brush (don&#x27;t remember the brand, but it has the characteristic chunky handle).</li>
            <li>Happy with the item so far as it is what I expected.</li>
            <li>Was more than I wanted to spend, but it&#x27;s certainly worth every dollar and will last years to come!</li>
            <li>Holds my Gillette 1960 Super Speed very well and Brush,</li>
            <li>if you plan to use it with a different brush and a straight razor it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>It has a simple and attractive design, and the construction is solid.</li>
            <li>metal is fairly soft and damages easy.  </li>
            <li>Note that the opening for the brush is quite narrow and won&#x27;t fit around my brush&#x27;s handle, but my brush sits nicely when the handle is inserted around the brush&#x27;s knot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed a stand that would fit my brush (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P6KDHXG?refRID&#x3D;8Y3WJSTT3V100M533FF1&amp;ref_&#x3D;pd_rhf_cr_p_img_10) and many are just a tad bit too wide.</li>
            <li>It looks good - a definite must have for the man transitioning out of being a college bachelor into a polished professional grown up.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, with clean and classic lines.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and reasonable.</li>

            <li>Super fast delivery 2 days before Christmas.</li>
            <li>The brush holder held the two size handles I had, and my single blade safety razor fits nicely.</li>
            <li>This is just what i was looking for a very well made item at a resonable price and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it and looks really nice on the counter, I haven&#x27;t had it for very long but the chrome looks like its decent quality and not likely to chip or flake off.</li>

            <li>Scratched up out of the box not to mention doesn&#x27;t fit brush like many other customers have stated.</li>
            <li>It appears as though it will last for a long time, nice and solid very sturdy and it looks great.</li>
            <li>It needs to be wiped dry almost every use to keep it looking sexy because water gets on it and will leave water marks, easily removed from the highly polished finish.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and easily, and once it dries, it&#x27;s back to</li>

            <li>It holds my old Gillette razor comfortably keeping it away from bacteria on the surface.</li>
            <li>It sits there and holds my brush and razor and looks pretty doing it.</li>
            <li>That said, bear in mind the price - you&#x27;re not going to get anything miraculous, especially at this price point - but know that you don&#x27;t have to spend more to have confidence in your stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My attempt at a wire coat hanger do it yourself stand, did not work ;)</li>
            <li>You definitely get more than you pay for.</li>
            <li>Two weeks with the Wilkinson was more than enough.  </li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>First time Brush Shaver, ordered this stand for my brush and razor.</li>
            <li>First time I have had one of these.  </li>
            <li>Note that the razor handle is made for a Mach 3 or higher.</li>
            <li>After several searches I was able to locate exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The knurled center piece is knurled just like the razor, looks nice.</li>
            <li>My husband is starting to use his brush and shave cream more and this is just what we needed.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture and the plating is well done.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking.  </li>
            <li>Should last many years paired up with my Merkur Barber Pole razor and badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Overall a well-made, stylish stand.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t accommodate my favorite brush... :</li>
            <li>This holder should probably be priced higher for the quality, but to our benefit, its under $25.</li>
            <li>I know they are attractive because my wife hasn&#x27;t complained about them detracting from the bath decor.</li>
            <li>My first shaving stand.</li>
            <li>Make sure to find out what size your badger/boar brush is so it actually fits on the stand though.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it is designed to do.  </li>
            <li>well worth the price, i was going to spend 5 times at much at the Mall.</li>
            <li>Simple, elegant, functional way to hold your razor and brush.</li>

            <li>This was exactly what i needed to keep my brush and razor on.  </li>
            <li>first experience with this brush/razor shaving.</li>
            <li>Looks and functions exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It does so pretty well.</li>

            <li>This holder was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This stand is simple, yet elegant.</li>
            <li>This product  is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>It seems like it will hold most razors but some brush handles may be too big (</li>
            <li>does exactly as described</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend purchasing!!</li>
            <li>My only comment is that I wish it would be able to hold the Fusion razor with the razor side up.</li>
            <li>When he said that he would like to try the razor his father used when he first started to shave, I jumped on the suggestion and did some research.  </li>
            <li>The metal is heavy and of good quality.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty razor and brush stand for a good price.</li>
            <li>Good, well designed stand except the arm that holds the brush is too narrow.  </li>
            <li>bathroom.but looks good and heavy.</li>
            <li>My heavy razor works good in it.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a reasonably priced stand for my new Edwin Jagger DE89 and Escali brush and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Very nice looking, solid and stable even with a heavy brush on one side and a light (plastic) razor in balance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the cheapest stand, but  it keeps your razor and brush dry and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I relied on the previous reviews of this product to make me more comfortable with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>It is an attractive way to keep my shaving gear close at hand and dry for its next use.  </li>
            <li>Nice heavy stand, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>nice heavy product, looks good with my Merkur 180 and Escali brush... other than that</li>
            <li>so I could live with the stand a bit and see what time would reveal of its true character.</li>
            <li>Not only did it arrived before projected due date, but when I opened the package I found a beautifully packaged product.</li>
            <li>simple, effective, classy!</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised at the good looks, high build quality and the solid weight  of the stand.</li>
            <li>Im not an expert that could point out the fine details that make it great or mediocre but it holds my razor and brush.</li>
            <li>It allows the brush to properly drain and dry in a timely manner and additionally, it is very nice looking.</li>
            <li>A month ago I bought an Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand, to go with a new Edwin Jagger razor (De89lbl Double Edge Safey Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, $34.00), Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush ($12.95), Proraso Shaving Soap, and a Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted  and expected made to last  doses a great job.</li>
            <li>but with a little love, you can make it fit your shaving supplies.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned that the unit would twist and unscrew itself after so many uses, but its sturdy and secure.  </li>
            <li>Very practical (his old stand only held his brush) as well as very stylish.</li>
            <li>This neat little stand is an excellent start of a set for a beginning wet shaver.  </li>
            <li>Razor side fits a normal safety razor and would probably fit a brand name cartridge razor like a Gillette fusion (though I haven&#x27;t tried); brush side fits a standard badger-hair brush comfortably.</li>
            <li>Nice weighting, does not tip over when you remove one or the other.</li>
            <li>But other than that for the price it is a nice stand.</li>
            <li>The picture does not do it justice in regards to the flat piece on top where the brush and razor hang from.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality, nicely weighted base.</li>
            <li>I got this with the SimplyBeautiful Basic Badger Hair Shaving Brush, and though at first the brush didn&#x27;t fit in without jamming it in, I was able to easily (but slightly) bend the brush holder to accommodate the wider brush.</li>
            <li>The chrome finish appears to very high quality, and the bottom has a nice rubberized pad to keep it from slipping around on the counter.  </li>
            <li>so it barely fits in the holder but still works out just fine.</li>
            <li>Solid, elegant, and very functional.</li>
            <li>Simple, elegant, reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Simple yet elegant and priced reasonably.</li>
            <li>Reviews on other Escali stands stated that they were the yellowish chrome color and not the real correct chrome color as this one is, so I&#x27;m glad I chose this one!</li>
            <li>It is very well built, stable, packaged well and looks handsome enough to leave on the counter.</li>
            <li>It feels like it&#x27;s solidly built, and I expect it to last a good while.</li>
            <li>Slim enough to not take up a lot of counter top real estate.</li>
            <li>I was worried that it would be flimsy, but it is solid as a rock and actually has some good weight to it.</li>
            <li>Very well made, more than heavy/sturdy enough to do the job well.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a workaround: Just rest the brush horizontally on the forked holder, and all is good with this little gem of a shaving stand!</li>
            <li>Shipped tightly wrapped in bubble wrap so the finish was flawless with no scratches or machine marks other than the knurling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bonus! - The bottom of the base is covered in a nice finish that makes me think it&#x27;s soft enough to not scratch quality vanities (I can&#x27;t be sure, because I certainly don&#x27;t have a great one!)</li>
            <li>Nice basic stand, pretty heavy for the price much better than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Pure Badger Shaving Brush also fits nicely on the other side.</li>
            <li>Very high end look for an extremely reasonable price!</li>
            <li>With a razor and brush stand being one of those items I chose the Escali because of the positive reviews and price point.</li>
            <li>made of heavy metal although it picks up grind quick it shines and does the job great although it doesn quite let your tools sit flat as the fork like prongs flare up a tad bit</li>
            <li>Much larger than I expected, very nice quality.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not careful in placing it precisely the razor falls of when I put the brush on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post again in a few months about the durability, but for now, I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now the prettiest thing on my bathroom sink and helps to neaten up the area which is pretty much covered with bowls of shaving soap and creams and after-shave balms.</li>
            <li>My only recommendation is to get the Escali brush to match with it or make sure your brush dimensions will fit in the holder cause it seems it may be different.</li>
            <li>Pretty straight forward product.</li>
            <li>They are both very well crafted and weighted, I recommend to anyone who uses safety razors, brushes (or any other kind) to keep this in mind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard of plating issues with other stands, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It is much more sturdy and heavy than I expected, in a good way.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it just feels good to return to using instruments from the past.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, well made, good solid base</li>
            <li>This is a great little stand and the quality is far better than I expected or even needed.  </li>
            <li>so plan to wipe it down if that kind of thing bothers you -</li>
            <li>My shave brush and razor are able to properly dry and look good doing it, but the price for this piece of metal seems a little high.</li>
            <li>Hard to really get excited about a razor and brush stand, but this one seems nicely weighted and does the trick.</li>
            <li>The stand holds the items at the right height so that they don&#x27;t touch the counter top or other parts of the stand.</li>
            <li>There I saw a similar stand with brush and razor, although it was prices more than twice as high and the shaving soap, razor and this stand combined.  </li>
            <li>When my teenage son started shaving, I thought, &amp;#34;what better way for him to develop a life-long habit for high quality products&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with this-it&#x27;s a nice heavy stand with excellent chrome plating and appears to be very durable.  </li>
            <li>All the normal store-brand ones we&#x27;ve tried (haven&#x27;t tried Escali) slip right out.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a handy way to store your brush and razor so they&#x27;ll dry out properly, this piece is certainly worthy of your consideration.</li>
            <li>The reason for subtracting one star is that the brush holding fork is somewhat small and needs some convincing to fit the brush handle</li>
            <li>The prongs that have a slight upward curve at the end is nice.</li>
            <li>This stand cost MUCH less and is just as nice.  </li>
            <li>Definitely well made and can disassemble easily.</li>
            <li>It looks super classy and helps to organize the area around my sink.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because it loosens fairly easily.</li>
            <li>A very classic stand.  </li>
            <li>Brush hanger accommodates my 50 year old Ever Ready full sized brush and my AOS travel brush.</li>
            <li>I have well water and this gift was for my teen son who isn&#x27;t easy on any product he owns.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Simple, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Received it quick and so far it fits my two razors and brushes.</li>
            <li>It takes a very steady hand to get the Mach 3 razor handle to balance precariously in this stand (razor side up).  </li>
            <li>Then you stick a couple of rubber bumpers (the kind you&#x27;d attach to the inside of cabinet doors) to the disk to elevate the assembly a few millimeters higher.</li>
            <li>Really good simple stand, it holds the long Merkur DE razor and an Escali badger brush</li>
            <li>The chrome looks good, though it hasn&#x27;t been in my bathroom long enough to see if it holds up against rust.  </li>
            <li>believe that it will last a good, long time.</li>
            <li>With good care I see no reason that it would not last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Does a nice job of holding an Art of Shaving Pure Badger brush (where the bristles meet the handle) and a Harry&#x27;s Truman razor (slightly below the handle shoulder.)</li>
            <li>plus i can get some soap and a EJ pure badger brush for that price.</li>
            <li>There is a cost associated with getting started using a safety razor, but I&#x27;m certain it will pay for itself over the course of the year as I&#x27;m not buying overprice cartridges with 16 blades.  </li>
            <li>I have an Escali Pure Badger Hair Brush and Merkur 34C razor</li>
            <li>Pure Badger Bristle&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got rid of the can and started using a brush (Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush)</li>
            <li>I can be picky, or as my girlfriend says &amp;#34;snobby&amp;#34; when it comes to certain things</li>
            <li>Bought this to have a place to hold my Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Merkur</li>
            <li>I purchased this with a Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Merkur Model 180</li>
            <li>have the Art of Shaving Pure Badger brush</li>
            <li>Pure Badger Shaving Brush with this stand</li>
            <li>My son certainly is.</li>
            <li>B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] and</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the stand might get knocked around on the vanity, but between the heft and the large rubber disk on the bottom, it stays in place.  </li>
            <li>B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] also fits into the brush fork.  </li>
            <li>I  bought a Parker Safety Razor 100% Pure Badger brush and the stand that came with</li>
            <li>Attractive and well-made and about  a half the price of some similar ones I have seen.</li>
            <li>The brush is a little tight fit but works great.  </li>
            <li>Glad my brush can dry like it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li>Ive had this for several months and it holds up just fine....</li>
            <li>I needed something to put my razor and brush on (wire hanger started to rust), so I bought the first decent looking stand.  </li>
            <li>The weight on it is sufficient to keep it pretty steady.  </li>
            <li>The chrome finish is very high quality as well.  </li>
            <li>Stand was as described and very high quality.  </li>
            <li>But prices for razor and a brush stand were very high in specialty stores.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little stand that is well made.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice little stand but the opening for the razor does not work for my razor.  </li>
            <li>This is a handy little stand.  </li>
            <li>The brush holder is a bit snug for the brush I own, so I have to use a little force to get it in and out.  </li>
            <li>For me, there was not very much to know about choosing a stand for my double edge razor and shaving brush - perhaps most important is how it will look on the sink counter.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of these available but this stand is not that expensive and is a natural companion in fit and finish for any Merkur Razor and happens to mate perfectly to the Parker Black</li>
            <li>HIgh quality stand,  exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The service was prompt, and the stand is exactly as advertised -- sturdy stainless, simple, clean design.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a few months and it is easy to keep clean and resists and crud build up quite well.  </li>
            <li>This is an attractive, solid, and heavy stand.</li>
            <li>It is as nice and in some instances nicer than more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>it looks great, and was heavy enough to support my bf&#x27;s razor and brush.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be a huge stand and thought about cancelling the order after I placed it, because I thought it would be too big</li>
            <li>This is a nice stand, very bottom heavy to sit up well.</li>
            <li>Fits inside my narrow medicine cabinet but also looks attractive sitting out in the open.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The shipping was very prompt.  </li>
            <li>Very stable.</li>

            <li>It matches my stainless steel razor and accessories in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>that it doesn&#x27;t draw a lot of attention; because who wants a brush/razor stand to draw attention to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quality material that doesn&#x27;t rust and very sturdy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>It arrived very promptly, well packaged.</li>
            <li>It really sets off the brush and razor.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>After several months now it is rust free (as chrome should be) and spotless.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it three stars was because my brush didn&#x27;t fit by the handle.</li>
            <li>I really like this stand.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Looks very regal sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>

            <li>Anyone that has invested money in a real &#x27;man&#x27; double-edge shaver should get one of this.</li>
            <li>The stand is very sturdy and sleek.</li>
            <li>Have not yet tried a straight razor, but will soon.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be unstable and not too much for water marks on the metal.</li>
            <li>The stand seems very well made, sturdy, and well finished.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery as well.</li>
            <li>and it feels really sturdy in the hand.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know how people would rate this a 1-star.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>Very aesthetically pleasing and the chrome exterior really compliments the Merkur safety razor and Parker brush.</li>
            <li>My husband really like receiving this as a gift for his birthday.</li>
            <li>no mater how much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li>Better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>Received fast.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and has some weight to it.</li>
            <li>This stand absolutely just gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>I gave this one star more than the brush, but it is much easier to make the brush more narrow rather than this larger.</li>
            <li>and neither handle will fit in the slot for same.</li>
            <li>Brush and razor have to be set carefully in the appropriate place otherwise one or both will fall off.</li>
            <li>Thanks Brian and Hanna Kay for the pride you take in shipping your products as well.</li>
            <li>Well made and very shiny.</li>
            <li>Note to buyers: not all brushes fit, you need brushes with smaller handle which I have.</li>
            <li>I really like this stand.</li>
            <li>Very well.</li>
            <li>Not to bulky and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the bathroom.</li>

            <li>There isn&#x27;t anything about it that makes me think &#x27;cheap&#x27; even though it is relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>So far, they have all been worth 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>The one drawback is it doesn&#x27;t hold my razor very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>much so that I bought three of them - one for home, one for a boat, and one for another home often visited.</li>
            <li>Not so much for a DE blade.</li>
            <li>and it Really adds to the bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li>Has performed very well and seems sturdy.  </li>
            <li>The two-prong hanger metal is not thin and it would take some force to bend it.</li>
            <li>Very solid...exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy stand.</li>
            <li>Heavy base, nice finish and my razor and brush fit perfectly.  </li>

            <li>This stand is nice and heavy.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be back to update my review if something unexpected or catastrophic changes my opinion of the product, so if you don&#x27;t see an &#x27;update&#x27; section of my review, I&#x27;m still pleased with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice, heavy stand.  </li>
            <li>Nice and heavy, won&#x27;t fall over if you take the brush off and leave the razor hanging.</li>
            <li>Nice heavy construction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and heavy and well-crafted.  </li>
            <li>It is a classy addition to our bathroom and, although he has only had it for a month, I expect he will get many years of use out of it.</li>
            <li>This stand looks nice and can handle the weight of the heavy razor.</li>
            <li>My own fault, it is too short for a standard brush from e shave.</li>
            <li>Nice, heavy material.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the old double edged razor shaving experience once again.</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li>Nice sturdy heavy stand.  </li>
            <li>Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li>It is nice and heavy and he loves it.</li>
            <li>Though this has not presented a problem, I do notice that the bottom is very slippery when the counter top is wet.</li>
            <li>This is a nice heavy combo holder for razor and brush.  </li>
            <li>This is avery nice, HEAVY stand.</li>
            <li>My Escali brush and razor fit it perfectly and the weighted base keeps it stable.</li>
            <li>The chrome stand is attractive but plain enough</li>
            <li>As some other reviews have mentioned not all brushes fit perfectly but most should at the bristles if not by the base.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted; nothing more, nothing less.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m able to hang the razor with the head down, which allows it to dry better.  </li>
            <li>I would imagine any razor that is too long for this stand is a real monster and probably not that easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is heavy enough to be stable and the finish is very nice.</li>
            <li>That said, I haven&#x27;t had rust on the first one ordered, it still looks new.</li>
            <li>This exactly what the hubby wanted for his new razor.</li>
            <li>stand is solid and heavy and holds my Parker 24C, Parker 99R and Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor and Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush, Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush and a Boars Hair brush perfectly.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, classy, and does the job right.</li>
            <li>A minor issue but a easy correction for the manufacturer to deepen the razor holder part.</li>
            <li>EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE MORE EXPENSIVE STANDS!</li>
            <li>Keeps my shaving area on the counter neat and tidy and makes my collection look sharp and professional.</li>
            <li>I did&#x27;nt really know how to buy a stand, or what made one better than the other, but I did know I did&#x27;nt want to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li>His particular style of shaving brush does fit this stand; but, larger circumference brushes might be a problem.  </li>
            <li>You will have to keep it clean because drying water is likely to leave spots, but there isn&#x27;t much work required in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no point paying more for one than another other.    </li>
            <li>You can pay double or more for the exact same look from another brand.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect match for the Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8) aesthetically and has a nicely weighted base that ensures it does not topple.</li>
            <li>Nice heavy weight and high shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this stand- seems to be made with decent quality, and allows me to hang my shave brush with the bristles down to dry.</li>
            <li>The razor and brush stand is very heavy to avoid toppling over, but compact enough to fit nicely on my countertop.  </li>
            <li>This is very well made and has a classic look.</li>
            <li>The stand is well constructed and weighted at the bottom, and the long handled razor he ordered fits just fine.  </li>
            <li>As a long time non-electric shaver, I&#x27;ve found this product very helpful, convenient and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>so it looks clean, and not big and bulky</li>
            <li>It is attractive and sturdily built, but the base, although adequate, is on the light side.</li>
            <li>It is simple and clean looking.</li>
            <li>Clean simple look.</li>
            <li>The order was promptly filled and the razor and brush stand are exactly what I had expected.</li>
            <li>Great quality and sturdy stand from a small American business.</li>
            <li>I haven’t had it long, but the finish seems to be holding up fine.</li>
            <li>It is small enough to stay out of the way and the Chrome looks great in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Holds my parker brush and 99R long handle with no problems, and it looks nice sitting next to my sink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made, looks nice and it looks like it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only a minor inconvenience though and is still effective.</li>
            <li>Solid construction; seems like it will hold up nicely for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>Chrome appears to be very thick, the stand feels heavy and my old fashioned razor and brush fit in it perfectly</li>
            <li>A handy little stand that makes my area of the bathroom countertop look a little bit neater and stylish.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this stand if you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase, sometimes hard to tell when your just shopping online, but quality is there.</li>
            <li>Stars because I had to buy a new badger brush with a smaller handle that would fit.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping exactly what I want very heavy not to mention it looks good holding my razor and brush next to the sink.</li>
            <li>It holds my razor and brush nicely, keeping it organized and dry for the next use.</li>
            <li>Adds a classic yet contemporary look to my bathroom while being very functional.</li>
            <li>My only regret is not realizing that my Van Der Hagen Luxury Shave set came with a perfectly adequate (and very space efficient) razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li>This stand holds the shaving equipment nicely, allowing it to dry properly.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I do not like about this one is that the brush opening is too narrow for the traditional fat shaving brush, but otherwise, it keeps the vanity area organized and looks very good.</li>
            <li>Got it fast just as described holds up both razor and brush or one or the other without tipping half the price if the shave stores happy with purchase</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to novice and veteran wet shavers that want a solid stand for their more precious shaving equipment.</li>
            <li>I spent $80 at a local store for a stand and the quality isn&#x27;t much better than this one, although it cost 4x the price!</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, item as described, heavy and stable, not suitable as a holder for a Gillette razor, though.</li>
            <li>There is really not much to say here: The product is pretty straightforward and works as intended.</li>
            <li>And I like the fact that I&#x27;m supporting a small American company making quality products for a good price.</li>
            <li>After 5 years using an electric razor, and more than 30 years using multi-edged blades that cost so much, I decided to go back to the double edge safety razors of my youth.  </li>
            <li>No more of my Husband yelling that we used his razor instead of our own.</li>
            <li>SS models are available, but this seems to stand up just fine to moisture as long as you dry it off.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li>It holds the brush and razor nicely with a small footprint on the shelf.</li>
            <li>The quality is immensely better than below average.  </li>
            <li>Looks classy, and Escali really rocks!</li>
            <li>Feels nice and heavy, when you pull it out of the box you would swear you paid 50 bucks for it!</li>
            <li>The razor spins and falls right out of the prongs and my brush knot is to broad.</li>
            <li>I took off a star just because the brush holder was bent slightly down but was able to straighten it out.</li>
            <li>so now I have go and look for a new brush!</li>
            <li>The stand is very heavy and of nice quality.</li>
            <li>A huge improvement to the experience, as I just acquired it and wish I had a long time ago !</li>
            <li>This razor stand is a very convenient addition to my new safety razor and shaving kit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the whole safety razor/brush thing, but needed a place to hang my stuff.  </li>
            <li>Knowing this, I can report that the chrome finish is even, bright, and without pitting or showing any negative signs of frequent contact with water.</li>
            <li>It fit my brush very well, but the razor kept slipping out of it&#x27;s holder.  </li>
            <li>I was able to make it work none the less.</li>
            <li>I see that some previous reviewers found that the size wasn&#x27;t appropriate for their razor, but I didn&#x27;t experience this problem with my Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to let the brush drip dry to prevent the brissles from falling out.  </li>
            <li>helps keep my razor and brush dry; drying your razor is a necessity because moisture typically dulls blades more quickly than the act of shaving&lt;</li>
            <li>The short elevation actually makes the thing look better.</li>
            <li>Decent quality but doesn&#x27;t work with Gillette Mach3 razors.</li>
            <li>but this want a decent razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li>Solid construction, though the top nut came off one day when I grabbed it while moving the entire stand</li>
            <li>Classic and we&#x27;ll constructed.</li>
            <li>Truly a classic.</li>
            <li>The chrome finish is super shiny and seems well built overall.</li>
            <li>It would be better if the opening was larger to accommodate different brush widths.  </li>
            <li>I bouth this razor and brush stand after reading many reviews and looking at several different kinds.</li>
            <li>It holds my Merkur razor and badger-hair brush and is steady as a rock.</li>
            <li>The workmanship and the chrome finish are superior and it is heavy enough not to topple over.</li>
            <li>Super solid, feels a lot heavier than it looks in the photos.</li>
            <li>I will most likely be picking one up for myself once I get back to the joys of bar soap shaving.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a decent quality, inexpensive razer/brush stand</li>
            <li>Classic elegance.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Merkur Classic Safety Razor and Escali 100%</li>
            <li>After many years of electric razor shaving I&#x27;ve returned to double edge razors and Italian soaps.  </li>
            <li>are the cast iron base weight (which is necessary and a good design feature) and the two short pieces of all-thread that fit into either end of the shaft to hold it all together--not a good design feature.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find anything else that even looked decent for under about $60.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, but at the same time elegant.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a classic sturdy stand.</li>
            <li>Good solid and heavy chrome stand.</li>
            <li>Just be aware of that, as some of the larger brushes won&#x27;t fit the smaller stand.</li>
            <li>One slight issue, however, was my brush didn&#x27;t fit at first.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what was expected and quickly shipped.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who uses a shaving brush and &amp;#34;old timey&amp;#34; shave soap.  </li>
            <li>Affordable and high quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>

            <li>I highly recommend getting this stand to accompany your, or your guy&#x27;s, shaving needs.</li>
            <li>Looks high dollar, and compliments the  Merkur razor blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>High quality chrome finish.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very high quality item.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a razor and brush stand for your set up.</li>
            <li>The Badger Shaving Brush easily works up a good lather with a very small amount of Proraso Shaving Soap (just a brief swill of the wet brush in the soap tub is more than sufficient).  </li>
            <li>Stand is sturdy enough to hold either the brush or razor while you use the other one without tipping over, and has a nice looking finish to it.  </li>
            <li>The EJ brush fits well in the large tines, and the smaller tines are just wide enough to perfectly hold my EJ razor by the slight collar at the bottom of the handle.  </li>
            <li>My brush was a tight fit at first</li>
            <li>I was a little sceptical that it would be able to support both, given the weight of a safety razor, but this stand is sturdy and does the job</li>
            <li>I know this is how most stands are, is I wish the brush holder was a little wider.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Adds a little &#x27;class&#x27; to my bathroom :)</li>
            <li>It a little over the top, unless u have a fancy</li>
            <li>Very high quality stand, I was surprised by the weight of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit the SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush that I bought at the same time.</li>
            <li>The packaging in which it arrived was also very sturdy and professional looking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stand for a couple weeks and so far it seems like a very sturdy and quality product.  </li>
            <li>It has already made a difference in keeping my blades dry and clean.</li>
            <li>Great stand (sturdy as can be) without the expensive price.</li>
            <li>It keeps your shaver off the counter and keep it dry and clean.</li>
            <li>It keeps my razor and brush together, clean, dry and neat looking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had it tip, and I don&#x27;t have much concern of knocking it over even if it sits near the edge of the surface.</li>
            <li>The construction is great and looks expensive.  </li>
            <li>when I took it out of the box I was shocked at how well it was made and how really beautiful it looked!</li>
            <li>Keeps your shaving tools organized, at hand and ready for action.</li>
            <li>Sellers ship fast and professionally.</li>
            <li>Given the way the hooks are shaped I&#x27;d guess they fit a wide range of razor handles and brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I think I would give it a 5 star if I had a normal razor.</li>
            <li>The chrome is perfect and the weighted base is enough to hold the SS razor (generally heavier than most).</li>
            <li>I received a Parker 99R razor as a gift a few months ago and I am really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>It is nice heavy stainless steel that will last for years.</li>
            <li>Top nut will not secure the handle mechanism</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to be concerned about it being top heavy.  </li>
            <li>Looks good sitting out and its also small enough to store away in the medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>It is sturdy and the better than another brand that I purchased a few months ago that end up being was with a hefty price tag.</li>
            <li>The stand works well with my short handled merkur razor and whenever I purchase my full size brush, it will be complete.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal grippy self.  </li>
            <li>It is heavy enough to be very stable, and the chrome finish is nice.  </li>
            <li>Water spots polish right off with a dry cloth though I use NeverDull on the stand and my very old chrome Oster hot lather</li>
            <li>A slight tight fit for the badger brush side, other than that a great purchase for my razor and bathroom counter</li>
            <li>Before buying this stand I read other Amazon reviews and initially thought that I should go for a more expensive one, which presumably would be more balanced and better all around.</li>
            <li>so they dry properly to keep them in good condition over the long term.</li>
            <li>It fits my escali brush and all of my razors (an old Gillette and a new modern merkur)</li>
            <li>(but with a tiny bit of maneuvering, the ProGlide does go right in and stays perfectly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact it will only slide into the slot when the brush is turned just right.</li>
            <li>Was a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t fit my large based badger brush, but it fits like a dream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this stand to anyone who is looking to safely store their brush and razor, as well as show them off and add a little class to their bathroom!</li>
            <li>Purchased for my husband and it looks as great as the fancy shave brand store for less than half the price !</li>
            <li>I was VERY disappointed when it didn&#x27;t fit my Parker best badger brush.</li>
            <li>SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush) so it would fit, but that was a minor problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wipe down so it can stay looking shiny.</li>
            <li>I use an old Gillette double edge razor and the stand holds that well also and would probably work with pretty much any razor.</li>
            <li>Other reviews said my brush would fit, maybe I got a misshapen brush?</li>
            <li>The other brush doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Precisely what I wanted and expected!</li>
            <li>opening for the razor will easily fit other types of DE&lt;br /&gt;razors or even a cartridge style if needed.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Nicely weighted, this simple little holder does the job.</li>
            <li>Nice solid little stand that matches my EJ diamond cut razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good purchase, but not great, as the whole idea was to have the stand to hold the razor and the brush, and the opening for the brush is just not wide enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nicely made, but brush holder limits the size of the brush to very small handled brushes.</li>
            <li>I will just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>He loves his new stand.  </li>
            <li>The new ones are wider.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my new son in law and he loves it.</li>
            <li>It even ended up matching my new razor handle by coincidence.</li>
            <li>I decided to treat myself and bought a brush, some sandalwood lather and a new chrome razor.  </li>
            <li>He also seems please with his new razor.  </li>
            <li>My son got a new safety razor for Xmas.</li>
            <li>Works well with his new safety razor and boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new brush and razor stand.</li>
            <li>Got this stand with my new shaver.</li>
            <li>After 2 years looks like new.</li>
            <li>Arrived to me in new condition, packaged well, etc.  </li>
            <li>The stand is new</li>
            <li>What can I say, its fits well with my boyfriend&#x27;s merker and new Parker lather brush.</li>
            <li>I am new to DE shaving, I ordered the razor, Astra blades and soap and all is going so well</li>
            <li>My hubby loves the new razor set I bought him</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s like new again.</li>
            <li>The prongs are bent upward slightly to keep from too easily knocking  the razor and brush off accidently.  </li>
            <li>It is very solid and heavy for its size, and has a nice polished look.</li>
            <li>nice and heavy and stand there well.  would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>My only cautionary note is that some shaving brush handles may be too wide for this (or for most shaving brush stands).</li>
            <li>This stand is a nice quality chrome and feels solid and heavy.</li>
            <li>The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is because the brush holder apparently only holds escali brushes, as two others I&#x27;ve tried have handles that won&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty shiny and complements my Mercur 180 long handled safety razor and badger brush very well.</li>
            <li>Expect a few scrapes early on, but it gets better in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very streamlined looking and doesn&#x27;t class with the decorative items that I have on the sink in our bathroom (which aren&#x27;t much really, but they are a different metal).It&#x27;s not wobbly, so it doesn&#x27;t keel over.</li>
            <li>The stand has no rust or pits and retains shine with just a quick swipe of dry cloth.  </li>
            <li>One of the forks was slightly bent but no big deal i bent it back up and its good.</li>
            <li>the rubber pad at the bottom makes it stand solidly without slipping or moving across the marble sink top.  </li>
            <li>Fit my former razor well, but my Parker 89R is a tad larger.</li>
            <li>The weight is perfect so it will not tip over and the rubber base is hidden and does not mark the counter top.</li>
            <li>Nice quality but some added weight in the base would be nice.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those who are into old fashioned shaving kits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this stand to anybody who owns an old school razor and shave brush.</li>
            <li>Very classy design.</li>
            <li>He will be 42 in October and has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Solid and steady, nice finish.. Not much more to say</li>
            <li>As razors become more and more ridiculous with up to 5 blades to gum up at a cost of $20 for 4 blade replacements, I think a lot of men will look at the simplicity of a single blade for only pennies each, and actually learn that shaving with a brush, shaving soap, and a single blade can be an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if it will tarnish easily.</li>
            <li>First point of note: this, the Colonel Conk, and a half-dozen others like this are all the same model.</li>
            <li>I got tired of the balancing act, and I was able to spread the holders out enough to comfortably hold the brush without damaging the stand.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with this solid choice for a good stand!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll come back and let you know if my first assessment was correct.  </li>
            <li>I had read other reviews of stands where owners were able to &#x27;bend&#x27; the fork to accommodate larger brush sizes.</li>
            <li>The stand is far more solidly built than I expected it would be.</li>
            <li>it makes my kit complete!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly so far!</li>
            <li>Paying any more is a waste of money! .</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for someone who recently started using a straight razor to shave and he loves it!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that classy!  </li>
            <li>It is pretty sturdy and actually matches the Merkur razor I bought with it.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be made pretty solid, and it has not started to rust or chip.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried other razor models, but I suspect that many standard razors would also not stay on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>The Escali is exactly  the same stand as the Col Conk Evernice stand except for the finish.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and solid.</li>
            <li>Very functional and straightforward, but definitely not cheap looking.</li>
            <li>fast shipment, simple steady and efficient product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>, the stand doesn&#x27;t fall down, it&#x27;s simply fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am new to wet shaving and this stand does exactly what it should do and it doesn&#x27;t take up that much space.</li>
            <li>It has a nice weighted base to keep it from tipping, and the brackets are very strong.</li>
            <li>Clean, sharp looking and doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space.</li>
            <li>This stand looks clean and sharp.  </li>
            <li>The stainless steel fits right in with the other bathroom decor.</li>
            <li>It makes my straight razor easy to grab and my brush upside down, which is crucial for drying.</li>
            <li>This will work for new razors as well as old models.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stand is just the right size for my long handled Merkur razor and my Omega badger brush.  </li>
            <li>Finish is still holding up fine and still looks like new after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li>But, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything comparable available for less than around $50.  </li>
            <li>All of my razors and brushes fit this stand (unlike another brand of stand that I bought previously).</li>
            <li>It is heavily weighted so it won&#x27;t fall over easily when putting items on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly heavy, so it doesn&#x27;t fall over easily.</li>
            <li>Quickly received what I expected.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the brush holder wasn&#x27;t wide enough to hold the brush in this set http://amzn.com/B001A3HPT0 (one of the most popular shaving sets on Amazon).</li>
            <li>Holds the razor firmly and the brush is held high enough to not touch the counter top.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice heavy base and a beautiful chrome finish.  </li>
            <li>I use to have a stand very similar that cost over 100 dollars, lost it while moving, bought this one just as a quick replacement until I made a trip back to Europe.  </li>
            <li>My brush handle is a little snug (SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush) in the holder, but its fine.</li>
            <li>It will be a tight fit for an Art of Shaving brush</li>
            <li>My shaving brush is a tight fit in this stand, but otherwise I have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li>Stand itself is a real beauty, only issue is only certain brushes will fit the brush holder when hanging up side down as recommended to maintain shape</li>
            <li>Well made, heavy holds my razor and brush just fine.</li>
            <li>worked fine for my brush but my gillette razor did not fit.</li>
            <li>It is simple in design, not too large, and it is functional.  </li>
            <li>Bought my husband a high end shaving brush and soap for Christmas, and quickly realized we needed one of these to properly store and dry the brush.</li>
            <li>The brush fits a little snug, but it does fit.  </li>
            <li>Brush and razor fit, although the prongs for the razor could be a little broader.</li>
            <li>Stand is very high quality, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Allows them to dry properly in a convenient accessible location.</li>
            <li>The finish is nice and it cost considerably less than other stands.  </li>
            <li>Its attractive, and so far (its new) has not loosened or in any other way done poorly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is too bad because the stand really looks great, and looks like it could have been a matched set with the Jagger, the chrome appears that nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quality of this stand is great, it&#x27;s not too heavy, but heavy enough to stay upright on my sink.</li>
            <li>From the picture I though the stand would be smaller, but when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised by how sturdy it really is.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves the razor and then I purchased the stand, so it is not only functional, but looks classy on the counter.</li>
            <li>Now Parker brush fits perfectly when held by the slot near the base of the handle.</li>
            <li>If I ever need a replacement, I would definitely reorder one, though I don&#x27;t think that will be very soon.</li>
            <li>Also, old fashioned shaving is the way to go (old fashioned safety razor all the way).</li>
            <li>It is no longer a hassle using because the old one would topple over at the slightest touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sturdy to say the least, and I love how it complements my razor.  </li>
            <li>He has now become a total user of the straight razor (been a disposable guy for years).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s classily and sleek.</li>
            <li>so far it has lived up to my expectations with no rust or blemishes.</li>
            <li>Classy design.</li>
            <li>Having never used this type of razor before I was hesitant when I received it as a gift but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>So far, haven&#x27;t noticed any rust.</li>
            <li>I purchased this stand for my husband who recently took up straight edge shaving.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li>Returned and still using my old stand for the moment.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>Happily surprised and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not art, but as a utilitarian piece, it&#x27;s not going to attract any negative attention while it stands on the vanity top.</li>
            <li>Very nice-looking, solid, weighted stand.  </li>
            <li>BTW I still use my old Trac II razor and it fits on the stand.</li>
            <li>It serves it&#x27;s purpose well so far.</li>
            <li>This really pulls the entire set together.</li>
            <li>This has worked out very well for my Double edge razor and shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the fixtures and accessories in my bathroom are polished chrome and this stand only makes the bathroom look that much nicer.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it does not hold my straight razor</li>
            <li>This stand really shows up that you care for your state of the art razors such as Merkur, Feather, Edwin and Jagger etc and the brushes that you have.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone using an old razor, brush and shave cup.</li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>Holding up well so far.</li>
            <li>I have it on my vanity next to my Escali Stainless steel shaving soap bowl.</li>
            <li>and air dries the razor and brush to my complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Like as if the slightest nudge will send my razor flying and slicing off a near by appendage.</li>
            <li>Looks like it is very well made and should last for years and years.</li>
            <li>Keeps the razor and brush firmly off the ground and isn&#x27;t cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a razor and brush stand that would give off the classy 1920s/30s vibe that seemed to match with using a safety razor.</li>
            <li>purchased after seeing a similar one at the Art of Shaving store while purchasing a straight edged razor for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>It appears to be well made and offers sufficient heft to resist tipping over when the brush or razor are removed.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s shiny surface would require frequent cleaning/maintenance, but that has not been the case.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, I bought a standard-sized brush.</li>
            <li>Classy stand for razor &amp;  brush</li>
            <li>I was surprised with the quality.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how the chrome holds up, but so far it works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The stainless look goes with my brushed nickel fixtures well</li>
            <li>It is a solid stand and presents very well.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by its heft allowing the razor and brush to be displayed yet they weren&#x27;t in jeopardy of falling off or flipping the stand on its side.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this product far exceeded my highest expectations.  </li>
            <li>Recently purchased the Escali stainless razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li>Bought it as a gift hubby loves it so far</li>
            <li>Purchased as a birthday gift for my 22 year old son.  </li>
            <li>soft bottom keeps it in place without scratching your counters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the modest price fool you.</li>
            <li>This is a very solid and functional stand at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-It provides the complete &amp;#34;package-feel&amp;#34; to my brush and razor</li>
            <li>Transaction was completely without hassle.</li>
            <li>My shaving brush does not fit in the stand correctly but it is a cheap brush</li>
            <li>Its very solid as well and does not slip off of my very slippery sink.  </li>
            <li>Started straight razor shaving a few months back and stayed in limbo for a while as to buying additional accessories to see if I would enjoy and stick with it.</li>
            <li>Have had it so far for two months with no rusting.  </li>
            <li>Looks classy and it&#x27;s sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much heavier and solid feeling than what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and solid feeling.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, solidly constructed, and fits my razor.  </li>
            <li>Classy stand.</li>
            <li>The initial investment to get into safety razor shaving is definitely worth it, especially when you can get 100 replacement blades for $8.</li>
            <li>I have not had it long enough to write a full out report, but the product seems to be sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li>Of the four brushes I own, only one—my least favorite—fits within the holder as designed.</li>
            <li>He thinks it looks elegant, and loves that it&#x27;s heavy enough not to have to worry about tipping.</li>
            <li>This makes the thing top heavy, but it&#x27;s only a problem if you are trying to slide it or otherwise pick it up and move it with all the stuff hanging in it.</li>
            <li>More than heavy enough to hold my 3.2 oz (90g +) razor without tipping when the brush is out.</li>
            <li>Holds my horsehair bristle shave nation brush perfectly as well as my Parker 22R razor without it hitting the base of the stand.  </li>
            <li>This stand holds my shave brush perfectly and the base is weighted, so it won&#x27;t tip over.</li>
            <li>The stand it nice and heavy, not over bearing on the bling, and elicits the eye roll from my wife when I carefully remove it from the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>The base fits perfectly with my razor and brush.  </li>
            <li>I have a Merkur double edge razor that also fits nicely on the other side, though it can loosely hold disposable razors as well.</li>
            <li>A little class starts the day off right , I would say,and my wife agrees whole heartedly.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the brush holder was not large enough to accomodate my Baxter of California best badger brush.</li>
            <li>My razor doesn&#x27;t fit in it (razor too large for the spacing) and my brush fits very loosely in the other side</li>
            <li>It is a lovely, I mean masculine, addition to my vanity.</li>
            <li>Over the last several months I&#x27;ve done a lot of searching for the right stand.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if brushes from other manufacturers would fit since I have no idea if the size of a brush handle is standard or not.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t put a lot of thought into this product other than, price, will my razor and brush fit and will it last over time.  </li>
            <li>but I only gave it three because I was led to believe by other reviews that it would fit my husbands Art of Shaving brush-</li>
            <li>My Proraso brush was too big to fit, but I knew this from other reviews.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice stand, however, and probably due to my fault it did not fit the brush as designed.</li>
            <li>The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand is extremely sturdy and surprisingly heavy (it doesn&#x27;t look that way from the pictures.  </li>
            <li>a quick wipe down.  </li>
            <li>A quick wipe down</li>
            <li>I finally broke down getting a new shaving brush to replace my old one which I pretty much destroyed by storing it in my shaving mug.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it with other brush/razor combinations, and it amazingly adjusts automatically to the other various weights.</li>
            <li>The brush holder is a little small, but good quality make</li>
            <li>A few water spots on the finish that I can simply clean up.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my brother, who wanted a simple, classic shaving stand.  </li>
            <li>Classic lines and totally functional.</li>
            <li>This is my first razor stand, having recently taken up the traditional art of shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Works well as it allows my brush to completely dry an be nice and fluffy the next day</li>
            <li>Does its job, looks decent enough.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re also pleased that it&#x27;s American made and sold by a small business.  </li>
            <li>THEN, I noticed the metal wasn&#x27;t too thick on the stand and was able to bend the opening open a little bit with a pair of pliers and it fit my brush just fine!&lt;br</li>
            <li>wish the stand was a little more stable, and would the screw that locks the stand to the base was more secure.</li>
            <li>Especially compared to the ridiculous high end stand that don&#x27;t look or work any better.</li>
            <li>High quality, no sign of corrosion after several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this stand</li>
            <li>and the product itself is well weighted and obviously built to a high quality.</li>
            <li>The brush handle is too wide to fit in the Escali stand, but it does fit well by placing the brush so the base of the handle rests on top of the prongs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are in the market for a similar product.</li>
            <li>Other similar stands sell for far more and are probably made by the same manufacturer in China under a different brand name.  </li>
            <li>I do try and keep it free of splash, dry it off when it gets wet.</li>
            <li>It is heavy enough so as not to be knocked over easily.</li>
            <li>I had to return this because it was too small to fit my AoS badger brush.</li>
            <li>The Feather Razor blades have not yet arrived, apparently having to ship from Hong Kong, or somewhere in the far east.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well it will resist water stains and such, but so far it feels solid, stable, and it looks very shiny.</li>
            <li>Not sure I&#x27;ve seen a shaving brush it would fit</li>
            <li>This is my first attempt at wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>The product is heavy enough to work without tipping over, and sized appropriately for a standard razor and brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy enough so that it won&#x27;t knock down too easily, It&#x27;s very attractive looking, the knurling on the vertical post is well executed, the base and hanger tabs nicely mirror plated.  </li>
            <li>The only issue is that the brush holder is a tight fit on my &amp;#34;super large&amp;#34; boar bristle brush.  </li>
            <li>This stand has a stable base so it can securely hold my heavy Burt&#x27;s Bees brush &amp; long handled Merkur razor perfectly.</li>
            <li>The only maintenance required is wash it wit hand soap and it looks as new.</li>
            <li>This stand is something you can live without, but once you have it you can see a big difference.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after while back when I started shaving with a new razor.</li>
            <li>I added a well made razor, new brush and am trying out different shaving soaps.</li>
            <li>Does not take up much room and allows my razor and brush to dry like they should.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my brush and razor dry and readily within reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you see how much you could spend on shaving accoutrement without necessarily understanding what you get for the extra money, this product delights.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Certain brushes do not fit in the brush holder (if their handle is too wide) so make sure that your brush fits the dimensions of the opening.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bunch of stands on amazon, including a stainless steel version that was more expensive</li>
            <li>The handle is too thick and while it can be put in sideways it can easily fall out.  </li>
            <li>Very classy, I cannot recommend it enough!</li>
            <li>Highly polished chrome stand is classy and keeps my badger brush and  Merkur HD shaver dry.</li>
            <li>Keeps razor and brush together in a limited area and stainless steel seems to be holding up well</li>
            <li>Exactly what the other 5-star reviews have said</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well constructed and looks very rich and expensive.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it was made for and does it extremely well.</li>
            <li>I love this little stand, especially the knurled part in the middle, which gives it tactile and visual interest.</li>
            <li>I can offer no other information since this was given as a gift.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and wanted a simple stand to hold my new razor and new brush.</li>
            <li>I have my Parker Badger brush and a Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; Long Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to shave his neck and watch him like my dad, when I was little, get close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also purchased 3 different blades - Wilkinson Sword Classic, Derby Extra ,and Feather Razor.  </li>
            <li>This is a solid piece of metal with a decent weight to it and will definitely not slip of of the counter (plus it is keeps things organized).</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit mine, and I am having a hard time bending it.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality and fits Escali brush perfectly, as expected.</li>
            <li>There are others more expensive, but this is high quality.  </li>
            <li>The brush holder gives my brush a tight fit, which is fine, but I&#x27;m not sure it would accommodate all other brushes.</li>
            <li>Seems very well built and should last a long time.  </li>
            <li>The design is masculine and balance - no tipping - is solid.</li>
            <li>I just went back to the old school eat of shaving with a safety razor and brush.</li>
            <li>So far a very solid item.  </li>
            <li>A simple item, but to paraphrase an old saying, the devil could be in the details.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because my Parker Safety Razor brush barely fits.</li>
            <li>No regrets here.</li>
            <li>Bought it to go with an Escali shaving brush and was pleasantly surprised how well it matched the Merkur double edge razor.</li>
            <li>the prongs are horizontal with barely any upward lip at the end.</li>
            <li>Apparently, hanging a brush is too tempting.</li>
            <li>This product is stainless and shows no signs of rust, and I hang my wet razor and brush on it after shaving every day.  </li>
            <li>The stand was actually much nicer than I expected.</li>
            <li>The product is solidly made with masculine detailing.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I was rather surprised by its sturdiness; do not let the pictures fool you - it has heft and feels very solid when standing on the counter or when held by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stand looks quite classy and simple.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say, really.</li>
            <li>So far, it gives me no reason to doubt that it will last for years.</li>
            <li>the upright seems to be a sold piece and not a hollow tube.  </li>
            <li>Also very durable and easy to clean water spots from the base.</li>
            <li>strong base, clean design, and very functional.</li>
            <li>but I settled on the Escali since the price was good, and there were only a few reviewers who complained about rusting.</li>
            <li>Nice anti-skid pad on the base, keeps your stand from slipping or marking your counter top.</li>
            <li>Shaving brushes come with their own totally lame stands.</li>
            <li>nice heavy base, nice finish</li>
            <li>Nice, heavy base, quality chrome plating, does  the job, and looks nice with an Escali brush.</li>
            <li>you need a good stand for your razor and brush at a reasonable price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality, very heavy and very shiiiiiny.</li>
            <li>The brush opening is just large enough to hold my Art of Shaving Pure Badger brush, but it sits just a little crooked.  </li>
            <li>The chrome plating looks to be very high quality and should last a very long time.</li>
            <li>Keeps shaving equipment high and dry.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my shaving brush high and dry and the razor as well.  </li>
            <li>The stand has kept its shine over the past four months and holds up solidly, providing enough weight at the bottom to keep from being easily knocked over.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my husband&#x27;s new Merkur Classic Safety Razor (short 3\\&quot; handle model - I wanted to specify this as all the other reviews that reference the Merkur razor reference the long-handled version) and Tweezerman&#x27;s Shaving Brush.  </li>
            <li>Fits a brush in easily (and most of the drips will fall onto the base of the stand rather than your counter).</li>
            <li>Fits a brush in easily (and most of the drips will fall onto the base of the stand rather than your counter).</li>
            <li>I love that this stand looks expensive, but was very modestly priced.  </li>
            <li>My heavy shaving brush tips over and falls right off</li>
            <li>I also have another brush that is too narrow and slides right through.</li>
            <li>High quality, no faults.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, hard to get a bad review :D</li>
            <li>It certainly looks solidly made and should last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Amazing quality, nice heavy base and it fits regular razors ( like fusion ) without a problem.</li>
            <li>It looks great and the base is heavy enough that it is secure.</li>
            <li>What wasn&#x27;t fine was being added to Perella&#x27;s mailing list and the multiple emails (at least 3 in 5 days) asking me to leave feedback.</li>
            <li>The base is good size not overly large but sturdy.</li>
            <li>Much much cheaper than other stands.  </li>
            <li>Low profile enough to fit on a small shelf.</li>
            <li>Like the other say, it&#x27;s sturdy and the finish is very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and it looks sharp.</li>
            <li>I originally had a Prorasso chrome handle brush and it was way too thick for the slim slot on this stand</li>
            <li>Pretty good stand, I would have like the base to have been heavier although it is weighted enough to keep from falling over when one side is in use.</li>
            <li>Classic and functional, this stand performs the basic task of allowing your brush and razor to dry without concern for deforming the brush or retaining moisture in the razor.</li>
            <li>Seller was fast, efficient, and arrived a day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>This stand will likely last until my grandkids are old.</li>
            <li>and i said take it back, there are just as nice stands on Amazon without  the silly prices</li>
            <li>Not a huge deal, just does&#x27;t fit where I expected it too.</li>
            <li>My only complaints are that the size of the hole for the brush is too small for my brushes (which are very typical, run of the mill brushes) and that the &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; to keep the razor in place is too shallow, allowing my razor (both the standard Gillette Mach 3 and the nice metal one I got with the stand) to easily fall off.  </li>
            <li>Just a holder so not much else to comment on until it gets older....</li>
            <li>base has a nice thick non-skid type high density foam in it, but I wish it had a chunk of brass in it to give it a bit more bottom end</li>
            <li>My only observation was the razor didn&#x27;t sit evenly on stand, the left side for some reason was slightly fwd than the right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The weight is just right; just heavy enough to avoid toppling.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much nicer than I thought it would be, and, in fact, I ordered a second stand today to use with one of my other razor/brush sets.  </li>
            <li>Wish they would make this in a brushed stainless steel to prevent the water marks after drying, but other than that, holds product well.</li>
            <li>I have a normal razor and it won&#x27;t stay on the hook without carefully balancing it.</li>
            <li>The product was relatively inexpensive but has a weight and finish closer to far more expensive products (Art of Shaving, etc).  </li>
            <li>Pretty heavy duty.</li>
            <li>As a newbie to the world of classic DE and wet shaving I have been trying to assemble the products necessary.</li>
            <li>weighted base keeps it steady, good looking and holds the brush as recommended by manufacture for drying.1 2 3 4</li>
            <li>The base is just the right size to fit on my bathroom window sill, as real estate in there is at a premium.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as expected, feels and looks solid and high quality.</li>
            <li>I bought the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand not because I needed it but because I wanted to change what has become a tedious, boring task (shaving every day) into something more interesting.  </li>
            <li>That said, my only gripe with this razor and brush stand is that it doesn&#x27;t have like a rubber grommet to cross the span or something to hold up straight razors, but I can hardly fault the stand for my lack of readership and it manages to hold up my straight razor with relative ease regardless.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for the wet shavers!</li>
            <li>slight hooks keep the razor and brush in place very well even if bumped.</li>
            <li>The shaving brush I bought him is black with stainless steel trimmings so it goes well.</li>
            <li>It hold my brush so it can dry completely.  </li>
            <li>The stand is long enough to hold my long handle razor which was my main concern</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was expensive but after receiving it I see it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>milled sections match steel razor handles beautifully -- and the weighted base stands up to the heft of my solid steel</li>
            <li>Merkur razor fit perfectly in the smaller u-hook, however my Omega brush did not fit in the bigger u-hook when I tried to hang it by its base; the plastic handle of the brush is too thick even in</li>
            <li>I currently use a Gillette Mach 3 and it usually falls off right away.</li>
            <li>Instead, I hang it by the base of the bristles and while it works fine and dries just fine - some may perceive it as a bit of an eye</li>
            <li>You may find a slightly cheaper on but its worth the small difference from a small USA company that takes pride in a fine product.  </li>
            <li>The only slight down side is that the brush holder is just a wee bit of a snug fit, not a major issue.</li>
            <li>My brush handle is a bit wide, and is very snug against the teeth that support it-- was easily fixed by slightly bending them.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that I wish the razor holder had a slight angle to better hold razor in place.</li>
            <li>The handle of the brush is too large and would just not fit.  </li>
            <li>I can also hang a Weber classic handle in it upside down.</li>
            <li>The handle on the current shaving brush I have does not fit the stand, the handle is too large.  </li>

            <li> I had no problem fitting my tweezerman brush and merkur model 180 on the stand.</li>

            <li> There is another 1\\&quot; piece of all-thread which screws into the top of the shaft, through the flange that holds the razor and brush, and into a acorn nut--the top of the unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s made just like you would think, just like it would have been 100 years ago and for the most part out of quality materials that would have been used 100 years ago.  </li>

            <li> It has not tipped over after more than a month of use.</li>

            <li> otherwise the item is top quality.</li>
            <li> I love the way it has cleaned up my bathroom sink...and moved my razor to safety:</li>
            <li> Check to make sure the holder widths are compatible with your razor/brush dimensions.</li>
            <li> perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is stable, elegant and functional.</li>
            <li> - they have to hang by the knot rather than the top of the handle like I wanted.</li>

            <li> but I love seeing the quality of this device every day.</li>
            <li> The ends of the stand should be turned up a bit more to help hold the items on the stand better.  </li>
            <li> Nothing more needed by me.</li>
            <li> Wise purchase if you need a nice looking, quality stand that is reasonably priced.</li>

            <li> The brush can be &amp;#34;hung&amp;#34; on it but not the appropriate way so it doesn&#x27;t look as clean and snazzy as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!!!!!</li>

            <li> Do your homework to make sure your brush will fit in the space provided.</li>
            <li> They buy did not say the dimension of the brush holder but said it would fit most brushes.</li>

            <li> I can honestly say that the quality of the Escali stand is right on par with the overpriced one at &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34;.  </li>

            <li> easily* insert a Gilette ProGlide</li>
            <li> Because they do not, the razor and brush are precariously supported and can easily fall off.</li>

            <li> it sure gleams easily when you quickly towel it off.</li>
            <li> My husband just loved this new stand he received for his birthday.</li>

            <li> I recommend measuring your shaver &amp; brush first, because mine didn&#x27;t fit, but that&#x27;s my own fault.  </li>

            <li> THE PRICE AND THE QUALITY WAS SUPER!</li>
            <li> Fits my Merkur 38c perfectly, as I hand the razor upside down, but it would fit right-side up, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small company working thru Amazon was wonderful with very nice pakaging and super fast delivery....</li>
            <li> Seems to be pretty good product, but right off the bat</li>

            <li> of the cost of a certain popular men&#x27;s shaving store that is spreading around the country.</li>
            <li> I made a little adjustment to the brush prongs and now fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> This little stand works great for both!</li>
            <li> My boar bristle brush I picked up at Walmart doesn&#x27;t fit, but a badger brush I picked up on Amazon fit&#x27;s just fine</li>
            <li> My Van Der Hagen badger brush didn&#x27;t fit, but I&#x27;m working on purchasing a brush from Whippeddog.com that should fit just fine.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected - high quality, razor and brush fit perfectly, looks good in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and holds both the razor and the brush securely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solidly built, holds the razor and brush securely, and looks great.</li>
            <li> Not much that can be said about this - it looks great, matches most safety razors (including mine, a Mekeur 180) and is well made.  </li>
            <li> The stand is very solid, sturdy and looks great in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> great design and made to last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t comment on how it would fit.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it with the Tweezerman&#x27;s brush and the Merkur Long-Handled Safety Razor and have had no issues with fit or support of either.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.  </li>
            <li> Nothing flimsy or cheap about it at all.</li>
            <li> so I cut the bristles to fit the (holder to the base)length.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and it&#x27;s heavy, sturdy, and attractive!  </li>
            <li> I received a gift certificate for a straight razor shave and really liked the result.</li>
            <li> I really like this stand as it keeps my razor and brush handy and out of the way.</li>
            <li> It is does not seem cheaply made it.  </li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job holding my razor and brush.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> a great choice I made when I finally landed on the Escali stand.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Looks great, fits the Escali 100% Badger Shaving Brush I also purchased and provides enough clearance for the&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not quite fit my custom razor.  </li>
            <li> My brush and DE razor fit well.</li>
            <li> so the razor stand feels secure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing, I went through 10 brushes in about 4 years  because I was too darned cheap to buy one of these.</li>
            <li> Simple, functional stand that works great with my brush and razor.</li>
            <li> The stand is made very well and looks nice with my razor and brush.</li>
            <li> I have a Mach 3 style razor from an online retailer that sells the generic versions and it fits great in the razor side.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because my brush didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Would be great in brushed nickel too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancé for Valentine&#x27;s day so he can fit his razor and Art of Shaving brush</li>
            <li> Overall great buy.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get my Omega Proraso and Semogue 2000 brushes to fit on the stand.</li>
            <li> However not all razors fit without sliding off.</li>
            <li> The Escali Razor &amp; Brush stand is an overall great purchase.  </li>
            <li> For cheap.</li>
            <li> The forks should curve up at the ends to securely hold razor and brush.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT some chintzy plastic/metal hybrid with a cheap chrome-colored paint over it.</li>
            <li> handle so that it would fit in the holder.  </li>
            <li> I had to bend it to make it fit</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my brush....</li>
            <li> I really like the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand that I got for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> However, it fits perfectly on the narrow &amp;#34;waist&amp;#34; of the handle.</li>
            <li> It is very well constructed and has a nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li> Great stand, solid build and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I got all this safety razor shaving equipment but thought I could cheap out here</li>
            <li> so have to secure where brush meets the handle.</li>
            <li> Looks great and has a solid build quality.</li>
            <li> Quality is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if it would fit</li>
            <li> The brush and razor fit well</li>
            <li> This is a heavy chrome stand and is a beautiful addition to my shaving kit!</li>
            <li> Smudges clean off easily with a paper towel.  </li>
            <li> The Cassani mirror is truly fogless, as promised, and hangs lightly from the Cassani hook which I have attached beneath my shower head.  </li>
            <li> But here I bought almost free.</li>
            <li> EASY TO CLEAN</li>
            <li> I had to bend it a bit to fit my art of shaving brush</li>
            <li> simple, attractive, shaving system stand.</li>
            <li> The chrome finish looks decorative and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> it looks great and and is solid and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A must have for gents who enjoy a morning shave.</li>
            <li> spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important note</li>
            <li> Fits Escali shaving brush and Edwin Jagger Razor (with some height to spare, could probably fit a longer razor).</li>
            <li> I was concerned before ordering if it would fit my razor as well as the handle of my brush.  </li>
            <li> The stand is built of the highest quality and definitely compliments any safety razor and brush combination while providing great stability.</li>
            <li> Practical, affordable, great looking, solid construction, what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> It fit my brush and razor, it looks snazzy and it fits in every place I&#x27;ve moved.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid, and looks great.</li>
            <li> At the $20 price point I was expecting something flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably buy the stainless steel one and fabricate my own shaver and brush stand if this one rusts on me.</li>
            <li> Overall a great purchase</li>
            <li> Definitely fits my brush and razor and looks great in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Stays upright well, and the razor and brush fit</li>
            <li> However, it does fit at the bristles.</li>
            <li> For the price this stand is very sturdy and nice.</li>
            <li> it probably wont fit in this stand.</li>
            <li> Fits my Merkur razor and brush very well and has a surprisingly nice weight.</li>
            <li> and they both fit on here</li>
            <li> It is an attractive stand, shiny chrome, solid weight.</li>
            <li> so the chrome is still holding up fabulously.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy nostaglia</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do anything but hold your tools for you, but this is a nice quality piece.  </li>
            <li> My brush didn&#x27;t fit either, but</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s important to hang your shaving brush upside (promotes longevity of the brush), this works well.</li>
            <li> Before buying this, I tried to find a list of brushes that would fit this or dimensions, but couldn&#x27;t find any of that.  </li>
            <li> Solid, attractive and well-made.  </li>
            <li> both fit well, with plenty of room</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s well worth it, and it beats having your razor and brush just sitting on the counter top.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain, nice finish.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stand for razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Nicely made stand for reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, yet an attractive addition to the vanity.  </li>
            <li> Solid stand that looks great as part of any shave kit.</li>
            <li> Sturdy stand holds my heavy DE safety razor without toppling over and the finish is excellent.</li>
            <li> However, I like the stand itself and will keep it so that when I purchase a shave brush from Parker it will hopefully fit the stand.</li>
            <li> Great stand, very solid and balanced.  </li>
            <li> so far looks great, solid and has good weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks and feel as promised.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy and looks nice.</li>
            <li> Razor side should fit any DE or SE razor made (except perhaps the Merkur Futur or Vision; haven&#x27;t tried those).</li>
            <li> Nice chrome and very weighty.</li>
            <li> The chrome is smooth and well done.  </li>
            <li> This was a great purchase, especially for the money!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s slimmest spot to fit.</li>
            <li> It holds my razor and brush very well and is really nice to look at.  </li>
            <li> next time- not as smooth a shave as the 3 or 4 blade disposables, but with good soap, it is much more of a pleasure.</li>
            <li> Overall the quality is great at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, not made of cheap material of cheaply built.</li>
            <li> the brush fit the stand</li>
            <li> also like that it has some weight on the bottom, which keeps everything secure.</li>
            <li> Did not feel wobbly, felt sturdy and secure on my sink.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my brushes , an Omega and a no-name.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> in fact, said he liked it much better.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Holds my DE safety razor and brush securely and out of the way.</li>
            <li> brush holder did fit my brush</li>
            <li> have an Edwin Jagger DE89, and it fits securely upright or upside down.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, free shipping came</li>
            <li> fit for my Escali badger brush &amp; Merkur #34C DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> chrome fit and finish, must have shaving accesory.</li>
            <li> I like the bright chrome finish, though it does necessitate frequent cleaning if you keep it nearby when shaving so that it accumulates soap splashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> I was worried this would be a light weight stamped piece of metal.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a great stand for the money.</li>
            <li> Awesome stand - heavy duty- looks and works</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my razor, which wobbles and falls out each time I touch the thing.</li>
            <li> It is a great choice and terrific value.</li>
            <li> how much I&#x27;d appreciate my Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand</li>
            <li> I bought myself a birthday present (along with the GREAT edwin Jaeger</li>
            <li> so overall i´m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would suggest it to someone looking for a cheap stand.</li>
            <li> Holds DE safety razor but not a snug fit.</li>
            <li> It looks great and it is build to last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to its long-term durability, but I can say that it doesn’t have that cheap feeling that cheap things have…</li>
            <li> it was cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> Stainless, effective and perty on any counter or shower.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and</li>
            <li> but I certainly enjoy this stand.</li>
            <li> I have seen others that have a cheap finish or are flimsy, but that is not the case with the Escali stand.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a very timely manner and was nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li> So far so good on this.</li>

            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> The stand actually has a nice weight to it, which is nice since you don&#x27;t have to worry about tipping it over.  </li>
            <li> Love this stand looks good next to the sink</li>
            <li> Great product with nice weight to hold heavy DE razors without balance issues.</li>

            <li> Solid built, holds both the razor and brush really well and looks great!</li>
            <li> The look matches most razor handles and it has a nice heft to it - its not shoddy and quickly thrown together.</li>

            <li> Arrived on time, very useful.</li>
            <li> This was a very nice replacement for my plastic brush holder that I have had for the last year.  </li>
            <li> very nice stand, no signs or rust, feels very solid</li>
            <li> It was very nice relative to the price i paid.</li>
            <li> A cheaper one would do the same thing, but this one is aesthetically very nice and sturdy</li>

            <li> Not had it long but very pleased !</li>
            <li> I wont need to buy a new one because this is better and more stable than the one I bought for over 100 dollars over seas.  </li>

            <li> straightforward quality built.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has been well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> What else can you say about this beautiful brush and razor stand.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: NOT stamped &amp;#34;Made in cHINA&amp;#34;, heavy, beautiful prepwork before chroming, the only item that I can leave out on the bathroom counter that my wife doesn&#x27;t complain about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> stand probably isn&#x27;t a product to get excited over, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> The stand fulfills my needs and looks pretty stylish as it does.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I originally thought that having a stand like this for my safety razor and brush was a luxury.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful and functions exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> How can one be excited over a razor/brush stand you ask?  </li>
            <li> The original brush I bought for it</li>
            <li> How can one write something to get you excited about a Razor and Brush Stand?  </li>
            <li> The Chrome finish is impeccable and can only be explained as being Harley level.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> This razor/brush stand does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it well in a visually appealing package.</li>
            <li> Way sturdier than I originally anticipated.</li>
            <li> Nice and minimal look too, I love it !</li>
            <li> It does exactly that, and nothing more.</li>
            <li> It fits my Gillette Fusion razor perfectly, but my brush is too small.</li>
            <li> Tip : if you want to shave like your grandfather, you can be pretty sure he wouldn&#x27;t pay $100</li>
            <li> I originally was looking at comparable stands at the Art of shaving that were 4x the price.</li>
            <li> Now he can display them on the vanity, and they&#x27;re easily accessible.</li>
            <li> This sturdy yet small razor stand holds my husband&#x27;s razor perfectly.  </li>
            <li> First impression, I love it.</li>
            <li> Pure Badger Shaving Brush (that I purchased on amazon) perfectly as well as the Parker 99R Long Handle Super Heavyweight razor also purchased on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Bought a  Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; Long Safety Razor and this stand works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Having this smartly designed stand is functional (allows the razor and brush to air-dry naturally) and makes an accessory that is proudly displayed on my counter.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and strong!</li>
            <li> great choice for my long handled razor!  </li>
            <li> Easily clean.  </li>
            <li> The only item I need now to complete the set is the perfect Razor.</li>
            <li> Looks clean.</li>
            <li> Could be a smidgeon more base-heavy, and it would be nice if the razor side worked with different razor brands.  </li>
            <li> Quite satisfied, especially since it&#x27;s priced nicely.</li>
            <li> Okay got this 2 days ago as a gift, so far I love it.</li>
            <li> Clean, sleek look.</li>
            <li> This unit does the job, clean lines and presents</li>
            <li> It is best for the old fashioned double edge razor.</li>
            <li> and when I clean the mirror...</li>
            <li> I dropped some cream on it once or twice and clean up was a breeze.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and clean.</li>
            <li> I probably should&#x27;ve looked into it a bit more before buying it, but I really have to shove my brush in there to get it to stay, and it doesn&#x27;t really fit.</li>
            <li> I have to say, seeing his shaving brush and safety razor hung on this stand, on our bathroom counter, looks so much more elegant than his old electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I wish these things were easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and hassle free.</li>
            <li> The general air of 1950s sophistication with which it imbues my bathroom is pretty great too.</li>
            <li> The stand is nice and heavy and does the job you want it to do, and it looks good while doing it.  </li>
            <li> and it fits into the little slot perfectly and hangs just right.  </li>
            <li> my Parker 99R Long Handle razor fits very nicely with room to spare.</li>
            <li> received promptly and packaged nicely... very professional.</li>
            <li> the reviews for the Escali seem more positive than the reviews of the Col Conk; time will tell I guess.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It fits his brush perfectly and he can either support his safety razor or straight edge razor on the other side.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I can&#x27;t think of many chrome plated items that don&#x27;t show water spots (other than some Moen and Delta faucets).</li>
            <li> No visible rust after many months of use, perfectly fits my razor and brush, and allows enough room for the brush to air dry a bit.  </li>
            <li> Well, the stand arrived, and it is very nicely done, beautiful chrome, and heavy enough to hold the jagger de89 from the handle, or the head, depending on how you want to display it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stand certainly beats laying his shaving items on the counter top or in a bowl.  </li>
            <li> After being convinced to move from the skin irritation of shaving with an electric razor, I bought some top quality shaving cream along with Escali&#x27;s Pure Badger shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure that your brush handle isnt for large sized</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband as a special gift for his birthday.</li>
            <li> I have no major complaints; this is just a beautiful, functional product that works exactly as advertised without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Seems to stay clean and put very well on a porcelain counter top.</li>
            <li> very high quality needed it for razor and brush glad I did</li>
            <li> The order arrived right on time, and packaged securely,  The item was a (specifically requested) Christmas gift, and the recipient was excited about it.</li>
            <li> High quality, as good as stands that cost 4-5 time as much.  </li>
            <li> It was great nicer then I expected.</li>
            <li> Liked my first one so much</li>
            <li> Good brush stand, however the yoke for the brush does not accomodate larger diameter brushes.</li>
            <li> Looks nice on the counter, fairly classy with a Merkur razor and Escali brush.</li>
            <li> It will hold a full size razor and brush.</li>
            <li> This would make a nice gift for anybody who shaves with the old school shaving brush, regardless of the razor they use.</li>
            <li> sweet multi use shaving tool</li>
            <li> A fraction of the cost of similar ones - read brand name ones that charge you for the name - but just as good.</li>
            <li> The bottom was nice and soft keeps it in place and doesn&#x27;t scratch counter.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how nice it was for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice shiny classy finish</li>
            <li> He has told me more than once how much he likes it.</li>
            <li> Works good for most DE razor, including long handle Merkur, Escali Badger brush fits nice, however, the Omega Boar brush handle is larger than the brush opening</li>
            <li> Has a place for your razor and badger brush, and is very sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li> this is a good product, but not a universal product.</li>
            <li> looks well done and very shiny and stylish.</li>
            <li> Finnish has remained true, no rust or flaking of the chrome.</li>
            <li> It has a good solid weight with a rubber grip pad underneath.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as described so no question on giving a full rating.</li>
            <li> Looks sweet on the sink.</li>
            <li> This is solidly constructed, looks good on my sink and holds my Edwin Jagger Safety Razor and Escali Brush well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that the stand came as one unit (no assembly required) and no noticeable screws of any kind.  </li>
            <li> stand is nice and sturdy and classy looking though, so</li>
            <li> The stand has a good solid weight to it.  </li>
            <li> Feels very solid, well built, and from good quality materials.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted to razor and stand to save money and look cool</li>
            <li> The only draw back for me is that it doesn&#x27;t fit my Parker best badger brush.</li>
            <li> A simple device that does what it is supposed to do and looks simply good doing it.</li>
            <li> And the metal is really well done :)</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and sexy.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak for the usefulness with a full sized brush.</li>
            <li> To prevent possible corrosion of the stand, I will give it a good coat of car wax.</li>
            <li> Solidly made and good looking.  </li>
            <li> it is a good basic stand.</li>
            <li> I wish I got to use this more, but it holds my razor and brush diligently while I&#x27;m away, ready to go to work anew each morning.</li>
            <li> This stand feels solid and looks good with a chrome razor and lather brush.  </li>
            <li> Solid and looks good.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed my experience so much that I purchased a shaving \\&quot;set\\&quot; as a gift  that included this stand.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the way to if you want to keep you razor and brush in good condition.  </li>
            <li> When my wife saw this item next to our sink, she commented on how good it looked.</li>
            <li> Good solid feel and heft.</li>
            <li> Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Simple sturdy product - looks good, compact but functional.</li>
            <li> Got fast shipping and product was better than my expectation.</li>
            <li> Surprised how nice the finish is on this thing.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy and elegant unit.</li>
            <li> A very well crafted chrome stand that looks elegant.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Escali shaving cream brush at the same time and, it too, is a superior product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid, has a good weight to it and</li>
            <li> Weight is good so that it doesn&#x27;t wobble around when you&#x27;re putting things back.</li>
            <li> Well made, solid, and just feel good to hold and use.. could not be happier with my purchase and the seller.</li>
            <li> I love all shaving stuff since I was 9, this stand worked really well.</li>
            <li> This makes for a good father&#x27;s day present.</li>
            <li> Love the polished stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> The finninsh is a stylish chrome that matches the finninsh of the razor very well.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad stand</li>
            <li> not bad for $20 delivered.</li>
            <li> importantly, the price is right.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is also pretty easy, a damp cloth does all the work.</li>
            <li> The razor side is a much looser fit but works fine.</li>
            <li> Other than that restriction this stand is a great addition to shaving supplies</li>
            <li> I recommend for keeping shaving articles separate from other items and wife happy about bath appearance</li>
            <li> The only issue iIhave is that out doesn&#x27;t fit my cheap badger brush perfectly, but it works for literally every other brush and razor I could find.</li>
            <li> The stand fits perfectly inside our shallow medicine cabinet when I want it off the counter.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Does the job just fine and the chrome finish looks nice as long as its kept clean.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the quick delivery.</li>

            <li> Quick Delivery, Product as Described</li>
            <li> Very stable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent price too, considering that the Art of Shaving store wanted to charge me $80 for essentially the same thing.</li>
            <li> #34;You have the most luxurious shaver/brush stand&amp;#34; haha, worth it.</li>
            <li> Very well made, easy to luster and clean,</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Not a products you can find in a store, I&#x27;m always leery about reviews, but this products seemed to be worthy of a try.</li>
            <li> easy to clean and much nicer than having things just laying around.</li>
            <li> were plenty satisfied and there&#x27;s no reason this stand wont last many years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly from Perella&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li> Definitely alot cheaper in price than most stands and the quality is alot better too.  </li>
            <li> I bought this stand for the &amp;#34;Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &#x27;Barber Pole&#x27; Long Safety Razor&amp;#34; and it works perfectly, holding everything</li>
            <li> Rave reviews on all the pieces, and this little stand fit in very nicely with the set.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I considered trying to bend the prongs to make everything fit a little bit more nicely, but I didn&#x27;t want to risk scratching it and chipping off the chrome.</li>
            <li> does exactly what it is suppose to do.brush and merkur long handle fits very nicely.</li>
            <li> Not surprisingly, the stand fits perfectly with the Escali shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The first brush I got didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> At first I was pissed because I thought the brush just didn&#x27;t fit at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very elegant looking, and it&#x27;s got enough weight to avoid sliding around the counter when removing and replacing the razor and brush.</li>
            <li> My DE razor kind of barely dangles on, doesn&#x27;t feel stable.</li>
            <li> very stylish, solid, you can feel the metal.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Be aware if you have a Van der Hagen boar brush from the kit it wont fit.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED AND RECEIVED IT VERY FAST!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own a long handled razor, but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now, and I can already tell that it is good quality and will be with me for long time.  </li>
            <li> Good, solid weight, tall enough to hold a long-handled safety razor, and nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> While it is a beautiful stand, the brush does not fit, so he can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> Really nicely made, a good weight, but the opening for the brush is much too narrow for my windmill shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality and most useful product.  </li>
            <li> Good quality stand and the brush is soft and high quality also.</li>
            <li> The chrome is quality, it has a nice shine that it does not loose.</li>
            <li> It fits most brush sizes that I&#x27;ve encountered, and most razors also fit on the other end too.</li>
            <li> so I began my hunt on Amazon for a stylish support stand that was well-made, and complimented our brand new bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I got this with my new razor and badger brush, mostly to feel fancy.  </li>
            <li> Cleans up easily, and most importantly holds my brush and razor off the counter and lets them dry.</li>
            <li> Great stand - exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Looks great in the bathroom and it takes up less space.</li>
            <li> Stand is made very well, strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful razor holder, visually nearly identical to several from The Art of Shaving, but literally at 1/10th of the price.</li>
            <li> The stand was shipped very quickly and packed very well.</li>
            <li> solid product, fits escali brush and merkur long handle perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The height is perfect for a standard length safety razor, but a long handled razor may not sit in the forked hanger</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery was also much appreciated.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and holds the razor and brush easily without tipping over when putting them away.</li>
            <li> It came promptly, looks good and keeps the razor and brush in a compact space and lets it dry efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Comes apart easily so you can travel with it as well, but is very sturdy when assembled.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to get into the world of manly shaving!</li>
            <li> It arrived exactly as presented!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> The razor stand was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I knew I wanted something functional, sturdy, and aesthetically pleasing, this product was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> My first impression upon taking it out of the box was how good it looked, very shiny and classy.</li>
            <li> Exactly the right fit</li>
            <li> Excellent product, holds both my razor and brush and keeps the brush dry until next use.  </li>
            <li> With a hammer, I was able to spread the prongs enough to slip in easily.</li>
            <li> Perfect to let your shaving brush dry correctly and your double edge razor too.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that my brush didn&#x27;t easily fit into it, though I&#x27;m pretty sure my brush is oversized and probably wouldn&#x27;t fit in any stand.  </li>
            <li> The Derby Blade has been great, and after nearly 3 weeks with 1 blade, I am shaving with less nicks and more comfort than I did with the Wilkinson at any time.  </li>
            <li> Clean, crisp and functional.</li>
            <li> Looks good and with practice handles the chore of holding a razor and brush where they can dry and be available very well.</li>
            <li> Could use a little more length on the razor side to hold the razor better, but the Merkur 33C stays fine.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little device.</li>
            <li> What a great little stand.  </li>
            <li> It looks better and more classical to me than the more modern stands being sold at these new &amp;#34;shaving shops&amp;#34;, and at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> My Harry&#x27;s Razor and 30 year old Kingsley brush fit fine.  </li>
            <li> His original brush was too small to fit, but we purchased a slightly larger one which works great!</li>
            <li> The side to hold the razor is a little off for a disposable but perfect for old school strait razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently ordered this stand along with the shaving brush (Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush) and I cannot be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed anything that even hints of instability in the design, or any product flaws.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say worth the money if you want your shaving set to look nice and be a little better taken care of.</li>
            <li> This stand makes my razor and brush easily accessible, allows the razor and brush to dry and keeps the vanity neat and tidy.</li>
            <li> Great to know I am supporting an American company by purchasing a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Unless you got an unusual or oversized brush or razor it will fit it this stand.</li>
            <li> Great for a heavy safety razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and it looks great.  </li>
            <li> The stand is very well made and all the parts fit together snugly.</li>
            <li> The chrome job is great and the bottom is heavy</li>
            <li> This stand is very well made and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> The razor and brush fit very well.  </li>
            <li> This brush stand looks great on my sink, and even holds my heavy chrome brush without a problem.</li>
            <li> OR you  can drop a few dinars and get this attractive shaving stand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheaply made and Looks great.</li>
            <li> I have an Edwin Jagger DE89bl razor and an Escali badger brush, and they both fit very well.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Seems very well made at a most reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Keeps my shaving brush clean and my razor nice and dry.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and has a good solid weight to it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> so much better then laying old razor all over the shelves in the cabinet</li>
            <li> Nothing worth returning it over, but hence the reason for my four-star rating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s versatile enough that I think most of my razors would fit.</li>
            <li> The stand holds both razor and brush firmly, is solidly constructed, and has a nice grip on the bottom</li>
            <li> Its a nice basic stand that will work.</li>
            <li> Definitely would buy it again because of how nice it looks and the quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;J.S. Fort Worth, Texas</li>
            <li> Useful.</li>
            <li> Nice stand and American made!</li>
            <li> I am just getting used to the old school method of shaving now and Love it, always a close shave</li>
            <li> and it just seems like fun breaking a monotonous morning routine.</li>
            <li> Though, we clearly know who would come out on top of that cage match.</li>
            <li> Sort of pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of counter space and overall has a nice look and feel to it.  </li>
            <li> Really nice especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my dad as a birthday present because he&#x27;s already using the nice badger fur brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minimal design is perfect for someone that doesn&#x27;t want a lot of fussy bathroom décor; it&#x27;s solidly built and despite the chrome</li>
            <li> Worth the price; should keep for years.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again and recommend to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive and nice looking razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li> Compact nice design fits my brush and razor properly..</li>
            <li> It is solid, nice look, well made.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> So nice to find an American made product.  </li>
            <li> It makes my bathroom counter look a bit more classy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy enough to be abused by a teenager, and looks nice as well.</li>
            <li> The design is such that it should fit most razors and brushes on the market today.  </li>
            <li> Nice and simple, matches my safety razor</li>
            <li> so he&#x27;d quit putting his wet shaving brush in the drawer; it worked and he loved it</li>
            <li> A great stand for those needing a simple yet classy accessory.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li> Gives a more mature look than the plastic holder that came with the brush.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> After looking at several offerings on Amazon I stumbled on the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li> Beautiful stand, not much more to add</li>
            <li> Nice job on the chroming.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sits on my bathroom sink and is very solid and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Still handy enough for the travel kit though...</li>
            <li> Everytime I look at it, nostaglia overcomes me and I smile.</li>
            <li> It is functional and performs well in allowing my shaving brush and double-edge safety razor to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And absolute necessity for those who are into wet shaving (a renewed art and a great way to save $ and the environment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It holds my badger hair brush with such tenacity, I feel warm fuzzies inside everytime I look at it.</li>
            <li> The shave is better by far.</li>
            <li> but so far it looks ok.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It holds my razor and my brush and is nice enough to keep out on display in the bathroom even when we have guests.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slip, is very balanced and secure, and is a good universal size for holding my Merkur Safety Razor &amp; Escali Brush (though I expected this one to fit appropriately).</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Read several reviews, and took a chance on this Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.  </li>
            <li> I might prefer a bit more length on the tines that hold the razor (or perhaps a bit more of an upturn at their ends), but it&#x27;s really not much of a problem unless something bumps it.  </li>
            <li> Good seller, item arrived as expected and on schedule.</li>
            <li> This may sound funny, but it does exactly what is suppose to do; hold my razor and brush.  </li>
            <li> Shaft has same machined style as my merker razor, and my escali brush hangs nicely from it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> complete set sitting on my bathroom sink makes me look and feel sophisticated</li>
            <li> This is a great piece of equipment for the professional man at a low cost.</li>
            <li> get a wider specified knot dimension to be able to fit bigger handles.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Looks great, sturdy one, kind of heavy actually.</li>
            <li> Very solid and has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> This is a solid stand and looks nice.  </li>
            <li> Simple, sturdy, stable, effective, well packed and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> The quality of the Merkur blades is well worth the price difference as the Merkur has platinum edge and is a bit stouter blade.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the mount for the shaver could be a bit longer so it would sit more securely.</li>
            <li> As his mother, I am grateful that I was able to purchase all the components of an \\&quot;old fashioned shave\\&quot; on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Looks great and keeps everything high and dry.</li>
            <li> Strong, high quality.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice, shiny, sturdy, and takes up little room.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice little piece of hardware that helps keep my shaving gear organized.  </li>
            <li> He said he&#x27;s noticed a huge improvement in his skin since switching.&lt;br /&gt;Investing in the right tools really do matter.</li>
            <li> It looks very smart and classy in our master. :)</li>
            <li> Every time I cleaned the bathroom I would clean the stand, spending more time on the old stand than the whole counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works for many other safety razors and brushes also</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers mentioned, this product has a great weight to it, and it&#x27;s very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The product was perfectly adequate, and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and packaged very well too!</li>
            <li> This stand is very nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and hold my brush and razor very nicely.</li>
            <li> Very clean and classy look.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s got a good weight.</li>
            <li> It is quite sharp and is is a good quality product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The stand is sold through Amazon by Parella&#x27;s, a small American from the ground up business, supplying a good product with good customer service.  </li>
            <li> Very neat and useful!</li>
            <li> A lower price would always be nice, but I guess demand isn&#x27;t so high for old school shaving stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a good solid stand with a high quality chrome finish.</li>
            <li> Good buy overall, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just right size for the tall/long razor</li>
            <li> fits a majority of brushes (using my craptastic escali 10 dollar brush right now).</li>
            <li> Beautiful,sturdy, and just right for my husband&#x27;s long-handled safety razor and brush.</li>
            <li> This one is just right and priced right.</li>
            <li> The packaging was right in point, no damage to the box nor item</li>
            <li> and it arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> Price is right and shipping was speedy.</li>
            <li> My shaving mug fits right under the brush too.  </li>
            <li> He said the weight seemed right for him.</li>
            <li> Priced right.</li>
            <li> but my Semogue Hog Brush has to be held right where the hairs start.</li>
            <li> Just right.  </li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> The razor can be a bit tricky to balance it quite right.  </li>
            <li> Have to have it balanced just right, otherwise it falls.</li>
            <li> Works well to keep my brush in the right position for drying and hold my razor.</li>
            <li> and this one is, just right.</li>
            <li> Just the right size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more beautiful than the lousy stock photo.</li>
            <li> This unit is heavy enough and works perfectly with my Escali 100% Badger Shaving Brush ( ASIN BOO3WR3QS6) and my Parker 99R Super Heavyweight Safety Razor (ASINB003NTHWLU)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little razor/brush stand!</li>
            <li> Great little stand!  </li>
            <li> Organizes things well and is very smart looking.</li>
            <li> I really like this stand, specially for the price compared to others I looked at.</li>
            <li> I have a large omega boar brush and it barley fits, but I&#x27;m sure smaller brushes will fit well.</li>
            <li> It would be a great product, if the price was half as much.</li>
            <li> Very good razor-and-brush stand, with a more stable base than many.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about it holding my new Kent BK8, but the brush fits fine without the bristles being pushed by the bar.</li>
            <li> the whole set up looks really cool on my counter.</li>
            <li> I rarely take time to write reviews; however, I realize that many people rely on feedback to know how good (or poor)</li>
            <li> This is small and attractive on the bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra cost compared to some of the cheap look a likes available on here.</li>
            <li> I own a Merkur Long Handle 23c(180)</li>
            <li> also own a vintage shaving cream brush that had longer bristles that happened to be too long</li>
            <li> Solid stand that looks good also ... fits both my brush and razor and keeps both aired out and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Great addition to my bathroom sink!</li>
            <li> Looks pretty good on my sink, holds what it is supposed to hold, no rusting or other cosmetic issues.</li>
            <li> I have the Merkur 180, and the Escali wooden handled badger hair brush, and they both fit it just fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my new Parker Safety Razor 100% Best Badger Bristle Shaving Brush -- White &amp; Chrome Handle AND Merkur Long</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, was packaged nicely and everything I expected!</li>
            <li> I got this stand to go along with a new Escali brush because I knew it would fit.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Twas a smart purchase!</li>
            <li> First off, if you are not using a stand with your brush and safety razor stop right now and buy one.  </li>
            <li> This fits my escali pure badger brush (well, one would hope!)</li>
            <li> I loved it as an addition to my pawpaw&#x27;s old double edge razor I use today.</li>
            <li> The Merkur razor fits nicely, as does his badger hair brush (don&#x27;t remember the brand, but it has the characteristic chunky handle).</li>
            <li> Happy with the item so far as it is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Was more than I wanted to spend, but it&#x27;s certainly worth every dollar and will last years to come!</li>
            <li> Holds my Gillette 1960 Super Speed very well and Brush,</li>
            <li> if you plan to use it with a different brush and a straight razor it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> It has a simple and attractive design, and the construction is solid.</li>
            <li> metal is fairly soft and damages easy.  </li>
            <li> Note that the opening for the brush is quite narrow and won&#x27;t fit around my brush&#x27;s handle, but my brush sits nicely when the handle is inserted around the brush&#x27;s knot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed a stand that would fit my brush (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P6KDHXG?refRID&#x3D;8Y3WJSTT3V100M533FF1&amp;ref_&#x3D;pd_rhf_cr_p_img_10) and many are just a tad bit too wide.</li>
            <li> It looks good - a definite must have for the man transitioning out of being a college bachelor into a polished professional grown up.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, with clean and classic lines.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and reasonable.</li>
            <li> The Escali stand looks great and is tall enough to properly hang the  [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Nice addition to my bathroom and helps prevent my brush from getting ruined by letting it properly dry.  </li>
            <li> Super fast delivery 2 days before Christmas.</li>
            <li> The brush holder held the two size handles I had, and my single blade safety razor fits nicely.</li>
            <li> This is just what i was looking for a very well made item at a resonable price and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight to it and looks really nice on the counter, I haven&#x27;t had it for very long but the chrome looks like its decent quality and not likely to chip or flake off.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice finish on the holders and the base looks great on the sink in his bathroom.</li>

            <li> I like it because my brush hangs down to dry the way it is best for the brush.  </li>
            <li> Scratched up out of the box not to mention doesn&#x27;t fit brush like many other customers have stated.</li>
            <li> It appears as though it will last for a long time, nice and solid very sturdy and it looks great.</li>
            <li> It needs to be wiped dry almost every use to keep it looking sexy because water gets on it and will leave water marks, easily removed from the highly polished finish.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and easily, and once it dries, it&#x27;s back to</li>
            <li> My wife is hard to please but when she saw the razor and brush holder, she said it looked great too.</li>

            <li> does exactly as described</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend purchasing!!</li>
            <li> My only comment is that I wish it would be able to hold the Fusion razor with the razor side up.</li>
            <li> When he said that he would like to try the razor his father used when he first started to shave, I jumped on the suggestion and did some research.  </li>
            <li> The metal is heavy and of good quality.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty razor and brush stand for a good price.</li>
            <li> Good, well designed stand except the arm that holds the brush is too narrow.  </li>
            <li> bathroom.but looks good and heavy.</li>
            <li> My heavy razor works good in it.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a reasonably priced stand for my new Edwin Jagger DE89 and Escali brush and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking, solid and stable even with a heavy brush on one side and a light (plastic) razor in balance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the cheapest stand, but  it keeps your razor and brush dry and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I relied on the previous reviews of this product to make me more comfortable with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> It is an attractive way to keep my shaving gear close at hand and dry for its next use.  </li>
            <li> Nice heavy stand, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> nice heavy product, looks good with my Merkur 180 and Escali brush... other than that</li>
            <li> so I could live with the stand a bit and see what time would reveal of its true character.</li>
            <li> Not only did it arrived before projected due date, but when I opened the package I found a beautifully packaged product.</li>
            <li> simple, effective, classy!</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised at the good looks, high build quality and the solid weight  of the stand.</li>
            <li> Im not an expert that could point out the fine details that make it great or mediocre but it holds my razor and brush.</li>
            <li> It allows the brush to properly drain and dry in a timely manner and additionally, it is very nice looking.</li>
            <li> A month ago I bought an Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand, to go with a new Edwin Jagger razor (De89lbl Double Edge Safey Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, $34.00), Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush ($12.95), Proraso Shaving Soap, and a Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted  and expected made to last  doses a great job.</li>
            <li> but with a little love, you can make it fit your shaving supplies.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned that the unit would twist and unscrew itself after so many uses, but its sturdy and secure.  </li>
            <li> Very practical (his old stand only held his brush) as well as very stylish.</li>
            <li> This neat little stand is an excellent start of a set for a beginning wet shaver.  </li>
            <li> Razor side fits a normal safety razor and would probably fit a brand name cartridge razor like a Gillette fusion (though I haven&#x27;t tried); brush side fits a standard badger-hair brush comfortably.</li>
            <li> Nice weighting, does not tip over when you remove one or the other.</li>
            <li> But other than that for the price it is a nice stand.</li>
            <li> The picture does not do it justice in regards to the flat piece on top where the brush and razor hang from.  </li>
            <li> Very good quality, nicely weighted base.</li>
            <li> I got this with the SimplyBeautiful Basic Badger Hair Shaving Brush, and though at first the brush didn&#x27;t fit in without jamming it in, I was able to easily (but slightly) bend the brush holder to accommodate the wider brush.</li>
            <li> The chrome finish appears to very high quality, and the bottom has a nice rubberized pad to keep it from slipping around on the counter.  </li>
            <li> so it barely fits in the holder but still works out just fine.</li>
            <li> Solid, elegant, and very functional.</li>
            <li> Simple, elegant, reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Simple yet elegant and priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> Reviews on other Escali stands stated that they were the yellowish chrome color and not the real correct chrome color as this one is, so I&#x27;m glad I chose this one!</li>
            <li> It is very well built, stable, packaged well and looks handsome enough to leave on the counter.</li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s solidly built, and I expect it to last a good while.</li>
            <li> Slim enough to not take up a lot of counter top real estate.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would be flimsy, but it is solid as a rock and actually has some good weight to it.</li>
            <li> Very well made, more than heavy/sturdy enough to do the job well.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a workaround: Just rest the brush horizontally on the forked holder, and all is good with this little gem of a shaving stand!</li>
            <li> Shipped tightly wrapped in bubble wrap so the finish was flawless with no scratches or machine marks other than the knurling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus! - The bottom of the base is covered in a nice finish that makes me think it&#x27;s soft enough to not scratch quality vanities (I can&#x27;t be sure, because I certainly don&#x27;t have a great one!)</li>
            <li> Nice basic stand, pretty heavy for the price much better than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Pure Badger Shaving Brush also fits nicely on the other side.</li>
            <li> Very high end look for an extremely reasonable price!</li>
            <li> With a razor and brush stand being one of those items I chose the Escali because of the positive reviews and price point.</li>
            <li> made of heavy metal although it picks up grind quick it shines and does the job great although it doesn quite let your tools sit flat as the fork like prongs flare up a tad bit</li>
            <li> Much larger than I expected, very nice quality.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not careful in placing it precisely the razor falls of when I put the brush on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post again in a few months about the durability, but for now, I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now the prettiest thing on my bathroom sink and helps to neaten up the area which is pretty much covered with bowls of shaving soap and creams and after-shave balms.</li>
            <li> My only recommendation is to get the Escali brush to match with it or make sure your brush dimensions will fit in the holder cause it seems it may be different.</li>
            <li> Pretty straight forward product.</li>
            <li> They are both very well crafted and weighted, I recommend to anyone who uses safety razors, brushes (or any other kind) to keep this in mind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of plating issues with other stands, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It is much more sturdy and heavy than I expected, in a good way.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it just feels good to return to using instruments from the past.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, well made, good solid base</li>
            <li> This is a great little stand and the quality is far better than I expected or even needed.  </li>
            <li> so plan to wipe it down if that kind of thing bothers you -</li>
            <li> My shave brush and razor are able to properly dry and look good doing it, but the price for this piece of metal seems a little high.</li>
            <li> Hard to really get excited about a razor and brush stand, but this one seems nicely weighted and does the trick.</li>
            <li> The stand holds the items at the right height so that they don&#x27;t touch the counter top or other parts of the stand.</li>
            <li> There I saw a similar stand with brush and razor, although it was prices more than twice as high and the shaving soap, razor and this stand combined.  </li>
            <li> When my teenage son started shaving, I thought, &amp;#34;what better way for him to develop a life-long habit for high quality products&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this-it&#x27;s a nice heavy stand with excellent chrome plating and appears to be very durable.  </li>
            <li> All the normal store-brand ones we&#x27;ve tried (haven&#x27;t tried Escali) slip right out.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a handy way to store your brush and razor so they&#x27;ll dry out properly, this piece is certainly worthy of your consideration.</li>
            <li> The reason for subtracting one star is that the brush holding fork is somewhat small and needs some convincing to fit the brush handle</li>
            <li> The prongs that have a slight upward curve at the end is nice.</li>
            <li> This stand cost MUCH less and is just as nice.  </li>
            <li> Definitely well made and can disassemble easily.</li>
            <li> It looks super classy and helps to organize the area around my sink.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because it loosens fairly easily.</li>
            <li> A very classic stand.  </li>
            <li> Brush hanger accommodates my 50 year old Ever Ready full sized brush and my AOS travel brush.</li>
            <li> I have well water and this gift was for my teen son who isn&#x27;t easy on any product he owns.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Received it quick and so far it fits my two razors and brushes.</li>
            <li> It takes a very steady hand to get the Mach 3 razor handle to balance precariously in this stand (razor side up).  </li>
            <li> Then you stick a couple of rubber bumpers (the kind you&#x27;d attach to the inside of cabinet doors) to the disk to elevate the assembly a few millimeters higher.</li>
            <li> Really good simple stand, it holds the long Merkur DE razor and an Escali badger brush</li>
            <li> The chrome looks good, though it hasn&#x27;t been in my bathroom long enough to see if it holds up against rust.  </li>
            <li> believe that it will last a good, long time.</li>
            <li> With good care I see no reason that it would not last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of holding an Art of Shaving Pure Badger brush (where the bristles meet the handle) and a Harry&#x27;s Truman razor (slightly below the handle shoulder.)</li>
            <li> plus i can get some soap and a EJ pure badger brush for that price.</li>
            <li> There is a cost associated with getting started using a safety razor, but I&#x27;m certain it will pay for itself over the course of the year as I&#x27;m not buying overprice cartridges with 16 blades.  </li>
            <li> I have an Escali Pure Badger Hair Brush and Merkur 34C razor</li>
            <li> Pure Badger Bristle&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got rid of the can and started using a brush (Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush)</li>
            <li> I can be picky, or as my girlfriend says &amp;#34;snobby&amp;#34; when it comes to certain things</li>
            <li> Bought this to have a place to hold my Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Merkur</li>
            <li> I purchased this with a Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Merkur Model 180</li>
            <li> have the Art of Shaving Pure Badger brush</li>
            <li> Pure Badger Shaving Brush with this stand</li>
            <li> My son certainly is.</li>
            <li> B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] and</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the stand might get knocked around on the vanity, but between the heft and the large rubber disk on the bottom, it stays in place.  </li>
            <li> B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] also fits into the brush fork.  </li>
            <li> I  bought a Parker Safety Razor 100% Pure Badger brush and the stand that came with</li>
            <li> Attractive and well-made and about  a half the price of some similar ones I have seen.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little tight fit but works great.  </li>
            <li> Glad my brush can dry like it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> Ive had this for several months and it holds up just fine....</li>
            <li> I needed something to put my razor and brush on (wire hanger started to rust), so I bought the first decent looking stand.  </li>
            <li> The weight on it is sufficient to keep it pretty steady.  </li>
            <li> The chrome finish is very high quality as well.  </li>
            <li> Stand was as described and very high quality.  </li>
            <li> But prices for razor and a brush stand were very high in specialty stores.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little stand that is well made.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice little stand but the opening for the razor does not work for my razor.  </li>
            <li> This is a handy little stand.  </li>
            <li> The brush holder is a bit snug for the brush I own, so I have to use a little force to get it in and out.  </li>
            <li> For me, there was not very much to know about choosing a stand for my double edge razor and shaving brush - perhaps most important is how it will look on the sink counter.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of these available but this stand is not that expensive and is a natural companion in fit and finish for any Merkur Razor and happens to mate perfectly to the Parker Black</li>
            <li> HIgh quality stand,  exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The service was prompt, and the stand is exactly as advertised -- sturdy stainless, simple, clean design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few months and it is easy to keep clean and resists and crud build up quite well.  </li>
            <li> This is an attractive, solid, and heavy stand.</li>
            <li> It is as nice and in some instances nicer than more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> it looks great, and was heavy enough to support my bf&#x27;s razor and brush.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a huge stand and thought about cancelling the order after I placed it, because I thought it would be too big</li>
            <li> This is a nice stand, very bottom heavy to sit up well.</li>
            <li> Fits inside my narrow medicine cabinet but also looks attractive sitting out in the open.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The shipping was very prompt.  </li>
            <li> Very stable.</li>
            <li> What can you really say about a shaving brush stand?</li>

            <li> Very sturdy and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and stable on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> highly recommend to anyone on the fence about buying!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It matches my stainless steel razor and accessories in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> that it doesn&#x27;t draw a lot of attention; because who wants a brush/razor stand to draw attention to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality material that doesn&#x27;t rust and very sturdy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> It arrived very promptly, well packaged.</li>
            <li> It really sets off the brush and razor.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> After several months now it is rust free (as chrome should be) and spotless.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it three stars was because my brush didn&#x27;t fit by the handle.</li>
            <li> I really like this stand.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Looks very regal sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> construction is very sturdy but you can also unscrew and disassemble it for travel or storage.</li>
            <li> Anyone that has invested money in a real &#x27;man&#x27; double-edge shaver should get one of this.</li>
            <li> The stand is very sturdy and sleek.</li>
            <li> Have not yet tried a straight razor, but will soon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be unstable and not too much for water marks on the metal.</li>
            <li> The stand seems very well made, sturdy, and well finished.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery as well.</li>
            <li> and it feels really sturdy in the hand.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know how people would rate this a 1-star.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Very aesthetically pleasing and the chrome exterior really compliments the Merkur safety razor and Parker brush.</li>
            <li> My husband really like receiving this as a gift for his birthday.</li>
            <li> no mater how much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> Better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> Received fast.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and has some weight to it.</li>
            <li> This stand absolutely just gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> I gave this one star more than the brush, but it is much easier to make the brush more narrow rather than this larger.</li>
            <li> and neither handle will fit in the slot for same.</li>
            <li> Brush and razor have to be set carefully in the appropriate place otherwise one or both will fall off.</li>
            <li> Thanks Brian and Hanna Kay for the pride you take in shipping your products as well.</li>
            <li> Well made and very shiny.</li>
            <li> Note to buyers: not all brushes fit, you need brushes with smaller handle which I have.</li>
            <li> I really like this stand.</li>
            <li> Very well.</li>
            <li> Not to bulky and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Very practical.</li>
            <li> I bought very well.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything about it that makes me think &#x27;cheap&#x27; even though it is relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> So far, they have all been worth 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> The one drawback is it doesn&#x27;t hold my razor very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> much so that I bought three of them - one for home, one for a boat, and one for another home often visited.</li>
            <li> Not so much for a DE blade.</li>
            <li> and it Really adds to the bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> Has performed very well and seems sturdy.  </li>
            <li> The two-prong hanger metal is not thin and it would take some force to bend it.</li>
            <li> Very solid...exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy stand.</li>
            <li> Heavy base, nice finish and my razor and brush fit perfectly.  </li>

            <li> The chrome works really well.</li>
            <li> Was well packaged and it looks very class as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much sturdier than it looks online.</li>
            <li> Fast service.  </li>
            <li> Built really well.</li>
            <li> Very utilitarian.  </li>
            <li> The chrome is sleek and matches any modern decor</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t need much from a razor/brush stand, but this delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fed up with what Gillette has to offer (or doesn&#x27;t offer)  me.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a quality product.</li>
            <li> Stands up very well and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, well built, it does hold my razor (Harry&#x27;s Blades razor)</li>
            <li> Sturdy enough and yet compact so that it can fit anywhere without seeming too bulky.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> My wife even made a comment on how much she appreciates the look of the stand.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making a product that isn&#x27;t going to fall apart in a month.</li>
            <li> well built stand for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> - highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is stainless and does not tip over when used.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d care much for this</li>

            <li> Very nice--good quality, matches my Merkur razor well.</li>
            <li> Very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Lightning fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Not so much as a nick yet.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> the price was reasonable.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The razor has an angle that wants to slide off the stand.  </li>

            <li> I really like the way this stand looks on my bathroom shelf.  </li>
            <li> It came in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I found that my razor did not stay on the stand very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an issue really.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much shopping around to see that.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended!</li>

            <li> For under $20 I do not expect much.</li>
            <li> I really like this stand.  </li>
            <li> This is a very stable stand,  It holds my Parker 99r</li>

            <li> Very well balanced and weighted.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> good quality material, however, my only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold the Mach III razor as securely as I hope.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> This really worked out.</li>
            <li> The man in my life has a custom shave brush, so finding something that would fit was key.</li>
            <li> A very well made stand.  </li>
            <li> Very shiny and clean...and stays that way.  </li>
            <li> A real beauty.  </li>
            <li> Since changing to a straight safety razor, the stand is a must.  </li>
            <li> Great quality and very functional, heavy enough</li>
            <li> Nothing much to report.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are made for a real razor and not a bic by the way.</li>
            <li> very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged.</li>
            <li> VERY well done from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At around twenty bucks, it&#x27;s well worth it, so far.</li>
            <li> This stand completes the whole look.</li>
            <li> And shipping was fast as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks very durable.</li>
            <li> Very stable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and reasonably price.  </li>
            <li> very sturdy, husband loves it</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s as heavy as you would expect, and my safety razor fits nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy and never tips over.</li>
            <li> As far as stands go I almost bought another but changed to this one last minute, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It is nice and heavy so there is no fear of it tipping over.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m liking the way it looks with my budget but nice looking Escali shaving brush and Merkur #34c heavy duty DE razor.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect as I&#x27;d just gotten into this whole &#x27;wet shaving&#x27; thing.</li>
            <li> This stand is nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be back to update my review if something unexpected or catastrophic changes my opinion of the product, so if you don&#x27;t see an &#x27;update&#x27; section of my review, I&#x27;m still pleased with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice, heavy stand.  </li>
            <li> Nice and heavy, won&#x27;t fall over if you take the brush off and leave the razor hanging.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy construction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and heavy and well-crafted.  </li>
            <li> It is a classy addition to our bathroom and, although he has only had it for a month, I expect he will get many years of use out of it.</li>
            <li> This stand looks nice and can handle the weight of the heavy razor.</li>
            <li> My own fault, it is too short for a standard brush from e shave.</li>
            <li> Nice, heavy material.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the old double edged razor shaving experience once again.</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy heavy stand.  </li>
            <li> Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> It is nice and heavy and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Though this has not presented a problem, I do notice that the bottom is very slippery when the counter top is wet.</li>
            <li> This is a nice heavy combo holder for razor and brush.  </li>
            <li> This is avery nice, HEAVY stand.</li>
            <li> My Escali brush and razor fit it perfectly and the weighted base keeps it stable.</li>
            <li> The chrome stand is attractive but plain enough</li>
            <li> As some other reviews have mentioned not all brushes fit perfectly but most should at the bristles if not by the base.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted; nothing more, nothing less.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m able to hang the razor with the head down, which allows it to dry better.  </li>
            <li> I would imagine any razor that is too long for this stand is a real monster and probably not that easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is heavy enough to be stable and the finish is very nice.</li>
            <li> That said, I haven&#x27;t had rust on the first one ordered, it still looks new.</li>
            <li> This exactly what the hubby wanted for his new razor.</li>
            <li> stand is solid and heavy and holds my Parker 24C, Parker 99R and Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor and Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush, Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush and a Boars Hair brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, classy, and does the job right.</li>
            <li> A minor issue but a easy correction for the manufacturer to deepen the razor holder part.</li>
            <li> EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE MORE EXPENSIVE STANDS!</li>
            <li> Keeps my shaving area on the counter neat and tidy and makes my collection look sharp and professional.</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;nt really know how to buy a stand, or what made one better than the other, but I did know I did&#x27;nt want to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li> His particular style of shaving brush does fit this stand; but, larger circumference brushes might be a problem.  </li>
            <li> You will have to keep it clean because drying water is likely to leave spots, but there isn&#x27;t much work required in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no point paying more for one than another other.    </li>
            <li> You can pay double or more for the exact same look from another brand.  </li>
            <li> It is the perfect match for the Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8) aesthetically and has a nicely weighted base that ensures it does not topple.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy weight and high shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this stand- seems to be made with decent quality, and allows me to hang my shave brush with the bristles down to dry.</li>
            <li> The razor and brush stand is very heavy to avoid toppling over, but compact enough to fit nicely on my countertop.  </li>
            <li> This is very well made and has a classic look.</li>
            <li> The stand is well constructed and weighted at the bottom, and the long handled razor he ordered fits just fine.  </li>
            <li> As a long time non-electric shaver, I&#x27;ve found this product very helpful, convenient and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> so it looks clean, and not big and bulky</li>
            <li> It is attractive and sturdily built, but the base, although adequate, is on the light side.</li>
            <li> It is simple and clean looking.</li>
            <li> Clean simple look.</li>
            <li> The order was promptly filled and the razor and brush stand are exactly what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Great quality and sturdy stand from a small American business.</li>
            <li> I haven’t had it long, but the finish seems to be holding up fine.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to stay out of the way and the Chrome looks great in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Holds my parker brush and 99R long handle with no problems, and it looks nice sitting next to my sink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, looks nice and it looks like it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a minor inconvenience though and is still effective.</li>
            <li> Solid construction; seems like it will hold up nicely for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Chrome appears to be very thick, the stand feels heavy and my old fashioned razor and brush fit in it perfectly</li>
            <li> A handy little stand that makes my area of the bathroom countertop look a little bit neater and stylish.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this stand if you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase, sometimes hard to tell when your just shopping online, but quality is there.</li>
            <li> Stars because I had to buy a new badger brush with a smaller handle that would fit.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping exactly what I want very heavy not to mention it looks good holding my razor and brush next to the sink.</li>
            <li> It holds my razor and brush nicely, keeping it organized and dry for the next use.</li>
            <li> Adds a classic yet contemporary look to my bathroom while being very functional.</li>
            <li> My only regret is not realizing that my Van Der Hagen Luxury Shave set came with a perfectly adequate (and very space efficient) razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li> This stand holds the shaving equipment nicely, allowing it to dry properly.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like about this one is that the brush opening is too narrow for the traditional fat shaving brush, but otherwise, it keeps the vanity area organized and looks very good.</li>
            <li> Got it fast just as described holds up both razor and brush or one or the other without tipping half the price if the shave stores happy with purchase</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to novice and veteran wet shavers that want a solid stand for their more precious shaving equipment.</li>
            <li> I spent $80 at a local store for a stand and the quality isn&#x27;t much better than this one, although it cost 4x the price!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, item as described, heavy and stable, not suitable as a holder for a Gillette razor, though.</li>
            <li> There is really not much to say here: The product is pretty straightforward and works as intended.</li>
            <li> And I like the fact that I&#x27;m supporting a small American company making quality products for a good price.</li>
            <li> After 5 years using an electric razor, and more than 30 years using multi-edged blades that cost so much, I decided to go back to the double edge safety razors of my youth.  </li>
            <li> No more of my Husband yelling that we used his razor instead of our own.</li>
            <li> SS models are available, but this seems to stand up just fine to moisture as long as you dry it off.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li> It holds the brush and razor nicely with a small footprint on the shelf.</li>
            <li> The quality is immensely better than below average.  </li>
            <li> Looks classy, and Escali really rocks!</li>
            <li> Feels nice and heavy, when you pull it out of the box you would swear you paid 50 bucks for it!</li>
            <li> The razor spins and falls right out of the prongs and my brush knot is to broad.</li>
            <li> I took off a star just because the brush holder was bent slightly down but was able to straighten it out.</li>
            <li> so now I have go and look for a new brush!</li>
            <li> The stand is very heavy and of nice quality.</li>
            <li> A huge improvement to the experience, as I just acquired it and wish I had a long time ago !</li>
            <li> This razor stand is a very convenient addition to my new safety razor and shaving kit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole safety razor/brush thing, but needed a place to hang my stuff.  </li>
            <li> Knowing this, I can report that the chrome finish is even, bright, and without pitting or showing any negative signs of frequent contact with water.</li>
            <li> It fit my brush very well, but the razor kept slipping out of it&#x27;s holder.  </li>
            <li> I was able to make it work none the less.</li>
            <li> I see that some previous reviewers found that the size wasn&#x27;t appropriate for their razor, but I didn&#x27;t experience this problem with my Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to let the brush drip dry to prevent the brissles from falling out.  </li>
            <li> helps keep my razor and brush dry; drying your razor is a necessity because moisture typically dulls blades more quickly than the act of shaving&lt;</li>
            <li> The short elevation actually makes the thing look better.</li>
            <li> Decent quality but doesn&#x27;t work with Gillette Mach3 razors.</li>
            <li> but this want a decent razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li> Solid construction, though the top nut came off one day when I grabbed it while moving the entire stand</li>
            <li> Classic and we&#x27;ll constructed.</li>
            <li> Truly a classic.</li>
            <li> The chrome finish is super shiny and seems well built overall.</li>
            <li> It would be better if the opening was larger to accommodate different brush widths.  </li>
            <li> I bouth this razor and brush stand after reading many reviews and looking at several different kinds.</li>
            <li> It holds my Merkur razor and badger-hair brush and is steady as a rock.</li>
            <li> The workmanship and the chrome finish are superior and it is heavy enough not to topple over.</li>
            <li> Super solid, feels a lot heavier than it looks in the photos.</li>
            <li> I will most likely be picking one up for myself once I get back to the joys of bar soap shaving.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a decent quality, inexpensive razer/brush stand</li>
            <li> Classic elegance.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Merkur Classic Safety Razor and Escali 100%</li>
            <li> After many years of electric razor shaving I&#x27;ve returned to double edge razors and Italian soaps.  </li>
            <li> are the cast iron base weight (which is necessary and a good design feature) and the two short pieces of all-thread that fit into either end of the shaft to hold it all together--not a good design feature.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything else that even looked decent for under about $60.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, but at the same time elegant.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a classic sturdy stand.</li>
            <li> Good solid and heavy chrome stand.</li>
            <li> Just be aware of that, as some of the larger brushes won&#x27;t fit the smaller stand.</li>
            <li> One slight issue, however, was my brush didn&#x27;t fit at first.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what was expected and quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who uses a shaving brush and &amp;#34;old timey&amp;#34; shave soap.  </li>
            <li> Affordable and high quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>

            <li> I highly recommend getting this stand to accompany your, or your guy&#x27;s, shaving needs.</li>
            <li> Looks high dollar, and compliments the  Merkur razor blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very high quality item.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a razor and brush stand for your set up.</li>
            <li> The Badger Shaving Brush easily works up a good lather with a very small amount of Proraso Shaving Soap (just a brief swill of the wet brush in the soap tub is more than sufficient).  </li>
            <li> Stand is sturdy enough to hold either the brush or razor while you use the other one without tipping over, and has a nice looking finish to it.  </li>
            <li> The EJ brush fits well in the large tines, and the smaller tines are just wide enough to perfectly hold my EJ razor by the slight collar at the bottom of the handle.  </li>
            <li> My brush was a tight fit at first</li>
            <li> I was a little sceptical that it would be able to support both, given the weight of a safety razor, but this stand is sturdy and does the job</li>
            <li> I know this is how most stands are, is I wish the brush holder was a little wider.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Adds a little &#x27;class&#x27; to my bathroom :)</li>
            <li> It a little over the top, unless u have a fancy</li>
            <li> Very high quality stand, I was surprised by the weight of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit the SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush that I bought at the same time.</li>
            <li> The packaging in which it arrived was also very sturdy and professional looking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stand for a couple weeks and so far it seems like a very sturdy and quality product.  </li>
            <li> It has already made a difference in keeping my blades dry and clean.</li>
            <li> Great stand (sturdy as can be) without the expensive price.</li>
            <li> It keeps your shaver off the counter and keep it dry and clean.</li>
            <li> It keeps my razor and brush together, clean, dry and neat looking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had it tip, and I don&#x27;t have much concern of knocking it over even if it sits near the edge of the surface.</li>
            <li> The construction is great and looks expensive.  </li>
            <li> when I took it out of the box I was shocked at how well it was made and how really beautiful it looked!</li>
            <li> Keeps your shaving tools organized, at hand and ready for action.</li>
            <li> Sellers ship fast and professionally.</li>
            <li> Given the way the hooks are shaped I&#x27;d guess they fit a wide range of razor handles and brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I think I would give it a 5 star if I had a normal razor.</li>
            <li> The chrome is perfect and the weighted base is enough to hold the SS razor (generally heavier than most).</li>
            <li> I received a Parker 99R razor as a gift a few months ago and I am really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> It is nice heavy stainless steel that will last for years.</li>
            <li> Top nut will not secure the handle mechanism</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to be concerned about it being top heavy.  </li>
            <li> Looks good sitting out and its also small enough to store away in the medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li> It is sturdy and the better than another brand that I purchased a few months ago that end up being was with a hefty price tag.</li>
            <li> The stand works well with my short handled merkur razor and whenever I purchase my full size brush, it will be complete.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal grippy self.  </li>
            <li> It is heavy enough to be very stable, and the chrome finish is nice.  </li>
            <li> Water spots polish right off with a dry cloth though I use NeverDull on the stand and my very old chrome Oster hot lather</li>
            <li> A slight tight fit for the badger brush side, other than that a great purchase for my razor and bathroom counter</li>
            <li> Before buying this stand I read other Amazon reviews and initially thought that I should go for a more expensive one, which presumably would be more balanced and better all around.</li>
            <li> so they dry properly to keep them in good condition over the long term.</li>
            <li> It fits my escali brush and all of my razors (an old Gillette and a new modern merkur)</li>
            <li> (but with a tiny bit of maneuvering, the ProGlide does go right in and stays perfectly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact it will only slide into the slot when the brush is turned just right.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t fit my large based badger brush, but it fits like a dream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this stand to anyone who is looking to safely store their brush and razor, as well as show them off and add a little class to their bathroom!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband and it looks as great as the fancy shave brand store for less than half the price !</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed when it didn&#x27;t fit my Parker best badger brush.</li>
            <li> SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush) so it would fit, but that was a minor problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wipe down so it can stay looking shiny.</li>
            <li> I use an old Gillette double edge razor and the stand holds that well also and would probably work with pretty much any razor.</li>
            <li> Other reviews said my brush would fit, maybe I got a misshapen brush?</li>
            <li> The other brush doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Precisely what I wanted and expected!</li>
            <li> opening for the razor will easily fit other types of DE&lt;br /&gt;razors or even a cartridge style if needed.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Nicely weighted, this simple little holder does the job.</li>
            <li> Nice solid little stand that matches my EJ diamond cut razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good purchase, but not great, as the whole idea was to have the stand to hold the razor and the brush, and the opening for the brush is just not wide enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nicely made, but brush holder limits the size of the brush to very small handled brushes.</li>
            <li> I will just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> He loves his new stand.  </li>
            <li> The new ones are wider.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my new son in law and he loves it.</li>
            <li> It even ended up matching my new razor handle by coincidence.</li>
            <li> I decided to treat myself and bought a brush, some sandalwood lather and a new chrome razor.  </li>
            <li> He also seems please with his new razor.  </li>
            <li> My son got a new safety razor for Xmas.</li>
            <li> Works well with his new safety razor and boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new brush and razor stand.</li>
            <li> Got this stand with my new shaver.</li>
            <li> After 2 years looks like new.</li>
            <li> Arrived to me in new condition, packaged well, etc.  </li>
            <li> The stand is new</li>
            <li> What can I say, its fits well with my boyfriend&#x27;s merker and new Parker lather brush.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving, I ordered the razor, Astra blades and soap and all is going so well</li>
            <li> My hubby loves the new razor set I bought him</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s like new again.</li>
            <li> The prongs are bent upward slightly to keep from too easily knocking  the razor and brush off accidently.  </li>
            <li> It is very solid and heavy for its size, and has a nice polished look.</li>
            <li> nice and heavy and stand there well.  would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My only cautionary note is that some shaving brush handles may be too wide for this (or for most shaving brush stands).</li>
            <li> This stand is a nice quality chrome and feels solid and heavy.</li>
            <li> The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is because the brush holder apparently only holds escali brushes, as two others I&#x27;ve tried have handles that won&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty shiny and complements my Mercur 180 long handled safety razor and badger brush very well.</li>
            <li> Expect a few scrapes early on, but it gets better in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very streamlined looking and doesn&#x27;t class with the decorative items that I have on the sink in our bathroom (which aren&#x27;t much really, but they are a different metal).It&#x27;s not wobbly, so it doesn&#x27;t keel over.</li>
            <li> The stand has no rust or pits and retains shine with just a quick swipe of dry cloth.  </li>
            <li> One of the forks was slightly bent but no big deal i bent it back up and its good.</li>
            <li> the rubber pad at the bottom makes it stand solidly without slipping or moving across the marble sink top.  </li>
            <li> Fit my former razor well, but my Parker 89R is a tad larger.</li>
            <li> The weight is perfect so it will not tip over and the rubber base is hidden and does not mark the counter top.</li>
            <li> Nice quality but some added weight in the base would be nice.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those who are into old fashioned shaving kits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this stand to anybody who owns an old school razor and shave brush.</li>
            <li> Very classy design.</li>
            <li> He will be 42 in October and has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Solid and steady, nice finish.. Not much more to say</li>
            <li> As razors become more and more ridiculous with up to 5 blades to gum up at a cost of $20 for 4 blade replacements, I think a lot of men will look at the simplicity of a single blade for only pennies each, and actually learn that shaving with a brush, shaving soap, and a single blade can be an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if it will tarnish easily.</li>
            <li> First point of note: this, the Colonel Conk, and a half-dozen others like this are all the same model.</li>
            <li> I got tired of the balancing act, and I was able to spread the holders out enough to comfortably hold the brush without damaging the stand.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this solid choice for a good stand!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll come back and let you know if my first assessment was correct.  </li>
            <li> I had read other reviews of stands where owners were able to &#x27;bend&#x27; the fork to accommodate larger brush sizes.</li>
            <li> The stand is far more solidly built than I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> it makes my kit complete!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly so far!</li>
            <li> Paying any more is a waste of money! .</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone who recently started using a straight razor to shave and he loves it!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that classy!  </li>
            <li> It is pretty sturdy and actually matches the Merkur razor I bought with it.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be made pretty solid, and it has not started to rust or chip.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other razor models, but I suspect that many standard razors would also not stay on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> The Escali is exactly  the same stand as the Col Conk Evernice stand except for the finish.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described and solid.</li>
            <li> Very functional and straightforward, but definitely not cheap looking.</li>
            <li> fast shipment, simple steady and efficient product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> , the stand doesn&#x27;t fall down, it&#x27;s simply fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and this stand does exactly what it should do and it doesn&#x27;t take up that much space.</li>
            <li> It has a nice weighted base to keep it from tipping, and the brackets are very strong.</li>
            <li> Clean, sharp looking and doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space.</li>
            <li> This stand looks clean and sharp.  </li>
            <li> The stainless steel fits right in with the other bathroom decor.</li>
            <li> It makes my straight razor easy to grab and my brush upside down, which is crucial for drying.</li>
            <li> This will work for new razors as well as old models.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stand is just the right size for my long handled Merkur razor and my Omega badger brush.  </li>
            <li> Finish is still holding up fine and still looks like new after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> But, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything comparable available for less than around $50.  </li>
            <li> All of my razors and brushes fit this stand (unlike another brand of stand that I bought previously).</li>
            <li> It is heavily weighted so it won&#x27;t fall over easily when putting items on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly heavy, so it doesn&#x27;t fall over easily.</li>
            <li> Quickly received what I expected.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the brush holder wasn&#x27;t wide enough to hold the brush in this set http://amzn.com/B001A3HPT0 (one of the most popular shaving sets on Amazon).</li>
            <li> Holds the razor firmly and the brush is held high enough to not touch the counter top.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice heavy base and a beautiful chrome finish.  </li>
            <li> I use to have a stand very similar that cost over 100 dollars, lost it while moving, bought this one just as a quick replacement until I made a trip back to Europe.  </li>
            <li> My brush handle is a little snug (SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush) in the holder, but its fine.</li>
            <li> It will be a tight fit for an Art of Shaving brush</li>
            <li> My shaving brush is a tight fit in this stand, but otherwise I have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Stand itself is a real beauty, only issue is only certain brushes will fit the brush holder when hanging up side down as recommended to maintain shape</li>
            <li> Well made, heavy holds my razor and brush just fine.</li>
            <li> worked fine for my brush but my gillette razor did not fit.</li>
            <li> It is simple in design, not too large, and it is functional.  </li>
            <li> Bought my husband a high end shaving brush and soap for Christmas, and quickly realized we needed one of these to properly store and dry the brush.</li>
            <li> The brush fits a little snug, but it does fit.  </li>
            <li> Brush and razor fit, although the prongs for the razor could be a little broader.</li>
            <li> Stand is very high quality, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Allows them to dry properly in a convenient accessible location.</li>
            <li> The finish is nice and it cost considerably less than other stands.  </li>
            <li> Its attractive, and so far (its new) has not loosened or in any other way done poorly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is too bad because the stand really looks great, and looks like it could have been a matched set with the Jagger, the chrome appears that nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quality of this stand is great, it&#x27;s not too heavy, but heavy enough to stay upright on my sink.</li>
            <li> From the picture I though the stand would be smaller, but when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised by how sturdy it really is.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves the razor and then I purchased the stand, so it is not only functional, but looks classy on the counter.</li>
            <li> Now Parker brush fits perfectly when held by the slot near the base of the handle.</li>
            <li> If I ever need a replacement, I would definitely reorder one, though I don&#x27;t think that will be very soon.</li>
            <li> Also, old fashioned shaving is the way to go (old fashioned safety razor all the way).</li>
            <li> It is no longer a hassle using because the old one would topple over at the slightest touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sturdy to say the least, and I love how it complements my razor.  </li>
            <li> He has now become a total user of the straight razor (been a disposable guy for years).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s classily and sleek.</li>
            <li> so far it has lived up to my expectations with no rust or blemishes.</li>
            <li> Classy design.</li>
            <li> Having never used this type of razor before I was hesitant when I received it as a gift but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> So far, haven&#x27;t noticed any rust.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stand for my husband who recently took up straight edge shaving.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> Returned and still using my old stand for the moment.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Happily surprised and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not art, but as a utilitarian piece, it&#x27;s not going to attract any negative attention while it stands on the vanity top.</li>
            <li> Very nice-looking, solid, weighted stand.  </li>
            <li> BTW I still use my old Trac II razor and it fits on the stand.</li>
            <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose well so far.</li>
            <li> This really pulls the entire set together.</li>
            <li> This has worked out very well for my Double edge razor and shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the fixtures and accessories in my bathroom are polished chrome and this stand only makes the bathroom look that much nicer.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it does not hold my straight razor</li>
            <li> This stand really shows up that you care for your state of the art razors such as Merkur, Feather, Edwin and Jagger etc and the brushes that you have.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone using an old razor, brush and shave cup.</li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> Holding up well so far.</li>
            <li> I have it on my vanity next to my Escali Stainless steel shaving soap bowl.</li>
            <li> and air dries the razor and brush to my complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Like as if the slightest nudge will send my razor flying and slicing off a near by appendage.</li>
            <li> Looks like it is very well made and should last for years and years.</li>
            <li> Keeps the razor and brush firmly off the ground and isn&#x27;t cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a razor and brush stand that would give off the classy 1920s/30s vibe that seemed to match with using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> purchased after seeing a similar one at the Art of Shaving store while purchasing a straight edged razor for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> It appears to be well made and offers sufficient heft to resist tipping over when the brush or razor are removed.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s shiny surface would require frequent cleaning/maintenance, but that has not been the case.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, I bought a standard-sized brush.</li>
            <li> Classy stand for razor &amp;  brush</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the quality.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how the chrome holds up, but so far it works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The stainless look goes with my brushed nickel fixtures well</li>
            <li> It is a solid stand and presents very well.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by its heft allowing the razor and brush to be displayed yet they weren&#x27;t in jeopardy of falling off or flipping the stand on its side.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this product far exceeded my highest expectations.  </li>
            <li> Recently purchased the Escali stainless razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift hubby loves it so far</li>
            <li> Purchased as a birthday gift for my 22 year old son.  </li>
            <li> soft bottom keeps it in place without scratching your counters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the modest price fool you.</li>
            <li> This is a very solid and functional stand at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It provides the complete &amp;#34;package-feel&amp;#34; to my brush and razor</li>
            <li> Transaction was completely without hassle.</li>
            <li> My shaving brush does not fit in the stand correctly but it is a cheap brush</li>
            <li> Its very solid as well and does not slip off of my very slippery sink.  </li>
            <li> Started straight razor shaving a few months back and stayed in limbo for a while as to buying additional accessories to see if I would enjoy and stick with it.</li>
            <li> Have had it so far for two months with no rusting.  </li>
            <li> Looks classy and it&#x27;s sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much heavier and solid feeling than what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy and solid feeling.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, solidly constructed, and fits my razor.  </li>
            <li> Classy stand.</li>
            <li> The initial investment to get into safety razor shaving is definitely worth it, especially when you can get 100 replacement blades for $8.</li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to write a full out report, but the product seems to be sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li> Of the four brushes I own, only one—my least favorite—fits within the holder as designed.</li>
            <li> He thinks it looks elegant, and loves that it&#x27;s heavy enough not to have to worry about tipping.</li>
            <li> This makes the thing top heavy, but it&#x27;s only a problem if you are trying to slide it or otherwise pick it up and move it with all the stuff hanging in it.</li>
            <li> More than heavy enough to hold my 3.2 oz (90g +) razor without tipping when the brush is out.</li>
            <li> Holds my horsehair bristle shave nation brush perfectly as well as my Parker 22R razor without it hitting the base of the stand.  </li>
            <li> This stand holds my shave brush perfectly and the base is weighted, so it won&#x27;t tip over.</li>
            <li> The stand it nice and heavy, not over bearing on the bling, and elicits the eye roll from my wife when I carefully remove it from the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> The base fits perfectly with my razor and brush.  </li>
            <li> I have a Merkur double edge razor that also fits nicely on the other side, though it can loosely hold disposable razors as well.</li>
            <li> A little class starts the day off right , I would say,and my wife agrees whole heartedly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the brush holder was not large enough to accomodate my Baxter of California best badger brush.</li>
            <li> My razor doesn&#x27;t fit in it (razor too large for the spacing) and my brush fits very loosely in the other side</li>
            <li> It is a lovely, I mean masculine, addition to my vanity.</li>
            <li> Over the last several months I&#x27;ve done a lot of searching for the right stand.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if brushes from other manufacturers would fit since I have no idea if the size of a brush handle is standard or not.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put a lot of thought into this product other than, price, will my razor and brush fit and will it last over time.  </li>
            <li> but I only gave it three because I was led to believe by other reviews that it would fit my husbands Art of Shaving brush-</li>
            <li> My Proraso brush was too big to fit, but I knew this from other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Its a nice stand, however, and probably due to my fault it did not fit the brush as designed.</li>
            <li> The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand is extremely sturdy and surprisingly heavy (it doesn&#x27;t look that way from the pictures.  </li>
            <li> a quick wipe down.  </li>
            <li> A quick wipe down</li>
            <li> I finally broke down getting a new shaving brush to replace my old one which I pretty much destroyed by storing it in my shaving mug.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it with other brush/razor combinations, and it amazingly adjusts automatically to the other various weights.</li>
            <li> The brush holder is a little small, but good quality make</li>
            <li> A few water spots on the finish that I can simply clean up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother, who wanted a simple, classic shaving stand.  </li>
            <li> Classic lines and totally functional.</li>
            <li> This is my first razor stand, having recently taken up the traditional art of shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Works well as it allows my brush to completely dry an be nice and fluffy the next day</li>
            <li> Does its job, looks decent enough.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re also pleased that it&#x27;s American made and sold by a small business.  </li>
            <li> THEN, I noticed the metal wasn&#x27;t too thick on the stand and was able to bend the opening open a little bit with a pair of pliers and it fit my brush just fine!&lt;br</li>
            <li> wish the stand was a little more stable, and would the screw that locks the stand to the base was more secure.</li>
            <li> Especially compared to the ridiculous high end stand that don&#x27;t look or work any better.</li>
            <li> High quality, no sign of corrosion after several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this stand</li>
            <li> and the product itself is well weighted and obviously built to a high quality.</li>
            <li> The brush handle is too wide to fit in the Escali stand, but it does fit well by placing the brush so the base of the handle rests on top of the prongs.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are in the market for a similar product.</li>
            <li> Other similar stands sell for far more and are probably made by the same manufacturer in China under a different brand name.  </li>
            <li> I do try and keep it free of splash, dry it off when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> It is heavy enough so as not to be knocked over easily.</li>
            <li> I had to return this because it was too small to fit my AoS badger brush.</li>
            <li> The Feather Razor blades have not yet arrived, apparently having to ship from Hong Kong, or somewhere in the far east.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it will resist water stains and such, but so far it feels solid, stable, and it looks very shiny.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ve seen a shaving brush it would fit</li>
            <li> This is my first attempt at wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> The product is heavy enough to work without tipping over, and sized appropriately for a standard razor and brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy enough so that it won&#x27;t knock down too easily, It&#x27;s very attractive looking, the knurling on the vertical post is well executed, the base and hanger tabs nicely mirror plated.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is that the brush holder is a tight fit on my &amp;#34;super large&amp;#34; boar bristle brush.  </li>
            <li> This stand has a stable base so it can securely hold my heavy Burt&#x27;s Bees brush &amp; long handled Merkur razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> The only maintenance required is wash it wit hand soap and it looks as new.</li>
            <li> This stand is something you can live without, but once you have it you can see a big difference.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after while back when I started shaving with a new razor.</li>
            <li> I added a well made razor, new brush and am trying out different shaving soaps.</li>
            <li> Does not take up much room and allows my razor and brush to dry like they should.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my brush and razor dry and readily within reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you see how much you could spend on shaving accoutrement without necessarily understanding what you get for the extra money, this product delights.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Certain brushes do not fit in the brush holder (if their handle is too wide) so make sure that your brush fits the dimensions of the opening.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bunch of stands on amazon, including a stainless steel version that was more expensive</li>
            <li> The handle is too thick and while it can be put in sideways it can easily fall out.  </li>
            <li> Very classy, I cannot recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> Highly polished chrome stand is classy and keeps my badger brush and  Merkur HD shaver dry.</li>
            <li> Keeps razor and brush together in a limited area and stainless steel seems to be holding up well</li>
            <li> Exactly what the other 5-star reviews have said</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well constructed and looks very rich and expensive.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it was made for and does it extremely well.</li>
            <li> I love this little stand, especially the knurled part in the middle, which gives it tactile and visual interest.</li>
            <li> I can offer no other information since this was given as a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and wanted a simple stand to hold my new razor and new brush.</li>
            <li> I have my Parker Badger brush and a Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; Long Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to shave his neck and watch him like my dad, when I was little, get close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also purchased 3 different blades - Wilkinson Sword Classic, Derby Extra ,and Feather Razor.  </li>
            <li> This is a solid piece of metal with a decent weight to it and will definitely not slip of of the counter (plus it is keeps things organized).</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit mine, and I am having a hard time bending it.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality and fits Escali brush perfectly, as expected.</li>
            <li> There are others more expensive, but this is high quality.  </li>
            <li> The brush holder gives my brush a tight fit, which is fine, but I&#x27;m not sure it would accommodate all other brushes.</li>
            <li> Seems very well built and should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The design is masculine and balance - no tipping - is solid.</li>
            <li> I just went back to the old school eat of shaving with a safety razor and brush.</li>
            <li> So far a very solid item.  </li>
            <li> A simple item, but to paraphrase an old saying, the devil could be in the details.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because my Parker Safety Razor brush barely fits.</li>
            <li> No regrets here.</li>
            <li> Bought it to go with an Escali shaving brush and was pleasantly surprised how well it matched the Merkur double edge razor.</li>
            <li> the prongs are horizontal with barely any upward lip at the end.</li>
            <li> Apparently, hanging a brush is too tempting.</li>
            <li> This product is stainless and shows no signs of rust, and I hang my wet razor and brush on it after shaving every day.  </li>
            <li> The stand was actually much nicer than I expected.</li>
            <li> The product is solidly made with masculine detailing.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was rather surprised by its sturdiness; do not let the pictures fool you - it has heft and feels very solid when standing on the counter or when held by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stand looks quite classy and simple.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say, really.</li>
            <li> So far, it gives me no reason to doubt that it will last for years.</li>
            <li> the upright seems to be a sold piece and not a hollow tube.  </li>
            <li> Also very durable and easy to clean water spots from the base.</li>
            <li> strong base, clean design, and very functional.</li>
            <li> but I settled on the Escali since the price was good, and there were only a few reviewers who complained about rusting.</li>
            <li> Nice anti-skid pad on the base, keeps your stand from slipping or marking your counter top.</li>
            <li> Shaving brushes come with their own totally lame stands.</li>
            <li> nice heavy base, nice finish</li>
            <li> Nice, heavy base, quality chrome plating, does  the job, and looks nice with an Escali brush.</li>
            <li> you need a good stand for your razor and brush at a reasonable price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality, very heavy and very shiiiiiny.</li>
            <li> The brush opening is just large enough to hold my Art of Shaving Pure Badger brush, but it sits just a little crooked.  </li>
            <li> The chrome plating looks to be very high quality and should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Keeps shaving equipment high and dry.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my shaving brush high and dry and the razor as well.  </li>
            <li> The stand has kept its shine over the past four months and holds up solidly, providing enough weight at the bottom to keep from being easily knocked over.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband&#x27;s new Merkur Classic Safety Razor (short 3\\&quot; handle model - I wanted to specify this as all the other reviews that reference the Merkur razor reference the long-handled version) and Tweezerman&#x27;s Shaving Brush.  </li>
            <li> Fits a brush in easily (and most of the drips will fall onto the base of the stand rather than your counter).</li>
            <li> Fits a brush in easily (and most of the drips will fall onto the base of the stand rather than your counter).</li>
            <li> I love that this stand looks expensive, but was very modestly priced.  </li>
            <li> My heavy shaving brush tips over and falls right off</li>
            <li> I also have another brush that is too narrow and slides right through.</li>
            <li> High quality, no faults.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, hard to get a bad review :D</li>
            <li> It certainly looks solidly made and should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Amazing quality, nice heavy base and it fits regular razors ( like fusion ) without a problem.</li>
            <li> It looks great and the base is heavy enough that it is secure.</li>
            <li> What wasn&#x27;t fine was being added to Perella&#x27;s mailing list and the multiple emails (at least 3 in 5 days) asking me to leave feedback.</li>
            <li> The base is good size not overly large but sturdy.</li>
            <li> Much much cheaper than other stands.  </li>
            <li> Low profile enough to fit on a small shelf.</li>
            <li> Like the other say, it&#x27;s sturdy and the finish is very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and it looks sharp.</li>
            <li> I originally had a Prorasso chrome handle brush and it was way too thick for the slim slot on this stand</li>
            <li> Pretty good stand, I would have like the base to have been heavier although it is weighted enough to keep from falling over when one side is in use.</li>
            <li> Classic and functional, this stand performs the basic task of allowing your brush and razor to dry without concern for deforming the brush or retaining moisture in the razor.</li>
            <li> Seller was fast, efficient, and arrived a day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> This stand will likely last until my grandkids are old.</li>
            <li> and i said take it back, there are just as nice stands on Amazon without  the silly prices</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, just does&#x27;t fit where I expected it too.</li>
            <li> My only complaints are that the size of the hole for the brush is too small for my brushes (which are very typical, run of the mill brushes) and that the &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; to keep the razor in place is too shallow, allowing my razor (both the standard Gillette Mach 3 and the nice metal one I got with the stand) to easily fall off.  </li>
            <li> Just a holder so not much else to comment on until it gets older....</li>
            <li> base has a nice thick non-skid type high density foam in it, but I wish it had a chunk of brass in it to give it a bit more bottom end</li>
            <li> My only observation was the razor didn&#x27;t sit evenly on stand, the left side for some reason was slightly fwd than the right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The weight is just right; just heavy enough to avoid toppling.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much nicer than I thought it would be, and, in fact, I ordered a second stand today to use with one of my other razor/brush sets.  </li>
            <li> Wish they would make this in a brushed stainless steel to prevent the water marks after drying, but other than that, holds product well.</li>
            <li> I have a normal razor and it won&#x27;t stay on the hook without carefully balancing it.</li>
            <li> The product was relatively inexpensive but has a weight and finish closer to far more expensive products (Art of Shaving, etc).  </li>
            <li> Pretty heavy duty.</li>
            <li> As a newbie to the world of classic DE and wet shaving I have been trying to assemble the products necessary.</li>
            <li> weighted base keeps it steady, good looking and holds the brush as recommended by manufacture for drying.1 2 3 4</li>
            <li> The base is just the right size to fit on my bathroom window sill, as real estate in there is at a premium.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected, feels and looks solid and high quality.</li>
            <li> I bought the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand not because I needed it but because I wanted to change what has become a tedious, boring task (shaving every day) into something more interesting.  </li>
            <li> That said, my only gripe with this razor and brush stand is that it doesn&#x27;t have like a rubber grommet to cross the span or something to hold up straight razors, but I can hardly fault the stand for my lack of readership and it manages to hold up my straight razor with relative ease regardless.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for the wet shavers!</li>
            <li> slight hooks keep the razor and brush in place very well even if bumped.</li>
            <li> The shaving brush I bought him is black with stainless steel trimmings so it goes well.</li>
            <li> It hold my brush so it can dry completely.  </li>
            <li> The stand is long enough to hold my long handle razor which was my main concern</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was expensive but after receiving it I see it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> milled sections match steel razor handles beautifully -- and the weighted base stands up to the heft of my solid steel</li>
            <li> Merkur razor fit perfectly in the smaller u-hook, however my Omega brush did not fit in the bigger u-hook when I tried to hang it by its base; the plastic handle of the brush is too thick even in</li>
            <li> I currently use a Gillette Mach 3 and it usually falls off right away.</li>
            <li> Instead, I hang it by the base of the bristles and while it works fine and dries just fine - some may perceive it as a bit of an eye</li>
            <li> You may find a slightly cheaper on but its worth the small difference from a small USA company that takes pride in a fine product.  </li>
            <li> The only slight down side is that the brush holder is just a wee bit of a snug fit, not a major issue.</li>
            <li> My brush handle is a bit wide, and is very snug against the teeth that support it-- was easily fixed by slightly bending them.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that I wish the razor holder had a slight angle to better hold razor in place.</li>
            <li> The handle of the brush is too large and would just not fit.  </li>
            <li> I can also hang a Weber classic handle in it upside down.</li>
            <li> The handle on the current shaving brush I have does not fit the stand, the handle is too large.  </li>
            <li> Both the brush and the razor fit nicely and the base is heavy enough that it won&#x27;t tip over.</li>
            <li> I got tired of the disposable razor blade model and shifted to buying a nice set with a few hundred razors replacements.</li>
            <li> very sturdy and the base has a nice grip on it.</li>
            <li> Merkur DE razor does tend to sit a little off center sometimes because the posts that secure the blade in the shaver head&lt;br /&gt;pushes the razor to one side or the other when in the stand.  </li>
            <li> At half the price of mast comparable stands I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> The opening for the brush is a bit narrow for a lot of brushes (someone posted that it is 24mm wide, it looks about right</li>
            <li> Just be aware that the brush holder side is very narrow so if you have a fat brush handle it wont accomodate the brush stand part.</li>
            <li> The stand isn&#x27;t anything special, but it holds my brush and safety razor, is nice and shiny, has a weighted base that keeps it stable, and the bottom of the base has some kind of felt covering to keep it from scratching surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The initial investment is a little high</li>
            <li> In those 6 months it has not had any affect on the stand and when wiped down, still has that brand new chrome finish</li>
            <li> The Edwin Jagger razor feels solid, but not heavy, and fits comfortably in my slightly above average size hands (I wear size XL dishwashing gloves, and can squeeze into size L when necessary).</li>
            <li> Looks really sharp and classy.  </li>
            <li> The satisfaction is a little like if I had found a way to extend one gallon of gas into 3 and drive a larger, better car for less in the long run than my little 4 cylinder.  </li>
            <li> G Merkur Long Handled Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome #180, 10 Double Edge Platinum Blades]] and my Art of shaving badger hair</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to say it&#x27;ll stay as I bought it after time and use.</li>
            <li> The main downside for me is that it does not fit the badger brush</li>
            <li> This was an anniversary gift to my boyfriend who is heavily into classic shaving.</li>
            <li> The brush I have seems pretty standard and does not fit without using extreme pressure.</li>
            <li> We definitely highly recommend this brand if you&#x27;re having trouble choosing.</li>
            <li> This limitation is relatively standard for shaving brush stands so if your brush is thicker, you likely will need to pass on using a stand to dry your brush.</li>
            <li> However it keeps the badger brush dry, fluffy and aerated very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for only a short time and this helps to keep my razor and brush dry.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that I wish the small tongs used to hold the razor were just a few mm longer, because if I&#x27;m not careful and set my razor too quickly, the edge of the DE razor can overhang the edge of the tong and the whole thing slips out of square - risking dropping the razor.</li>
            <li> Though, I&#x27;m not sure what all I was really expecting from a razor stand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tall enough to hold long handled safety razors.</li>
            <li> This stand feels like it is constructed well and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I am using a big Merkur adjustable razor with a long handle and had to learn the technique of keeping the razor on the stand.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Merkur long handled safety razor and a shaving soap brush.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this stand to hold a long handle Merkur double edge safety razor and a boar&#x27;s hair shave brush.  </li>
            <li> It sits flat on the counter and holds my razor and brush.</li>
            <li> It seems like it will last a long time</li>
            <li> I was not about to BEND the flat piece upward.</li>
            <li> Will last a long time if cared for correctly</li>
            <li> long handle fits with room to spare (Longer handled razors touch the counter with some stands) as does my cheapie badger brush I got from my local Target.</li>
            <li> The base is heavy and wide, which provides excellent stability.</li>
            <li> Before receiving the stand, I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t be sturdy enough to hold my shaving brush and razor, which is quite substantial, but the stand&#x27;s base is solid and has some good weight to it.</li>
            <li> The base has a good amount of heft to it, thus far after a month of use, I&#x27;ve had absolutely no stability issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the above stand will meet all of your brush and razor-holding needs just fine.  </li>
            <li> Two other advantages: the bottom has a little foam on it to keep it from getting damaged or damaging a counter, and it is the perfect height for drying the brush but not touch the base.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the brush holder is too large for my brush (I have a brush that I got from the Art of Shaving).</li>
            <li> Very heavy which means very stable.  </li>
            <li> This is relatively inexpensive compared to some other products I&#x27;ve seen that all do the same thing, if you&#x27;re not looking to spend a lot of money for aesthetics, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> The new Gillette Proglide POwer that tilts does not fit well.</li>
            <li> I new it would not fit before ordering.  </li>
            <li> Some of the razors do not fit in the holder like the new Gillette fusion proglide power razor,  </li>
            <li> Should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Alas, my razor handle is too wide and doesn&#x27;t fit into it</li>
            <li> My previous razor and brush stand had completely rusted over, so I needed a replacement.</li>
            <li> the way it should in order to dry properly and keep moisture from settling on the blades.</li>
            <li> Brushes need to dry properly and this item provides that.</li>
            <li> And leave Gillette mostly open on &#x27;Escali Stand&#x27; to dry out.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is with the width of the opening where you hang your brush to dry.  </li>
            <li> My understanding is that it also helps your brush last longer by allowing it to dry quicker.</li>
            <li> all three fit the stand perfectly (not at the same time).  </li>
            <li> The stand is essential if you want to properly dry a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> far less cost.  </li>
            <li> Allow your razors to dry in the open extend ends the life of the blades.</li>
            <li> It keeps my razor and brush elevated to air dry, so it works, but it also only fits my Art of Shaving brush at the knot and my Harry&#x27;s razor sideways.</li>
            <li> Allows the brush to dry properly and keep it&#x27;s shape.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my razor and brush up off the counter and ensures that they dry properly after each use.</li>
            <li> Looks like it will last a long long time.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how heavy it is which is critical to keep it from knocking over.</li>
            <li> Feels like it will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> The stand will NOT accept a regular sized shave brush, it&#x27;s far too narrow.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see how long it will hold up.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the product arrive and it was much more than expected.  </li>
            <li> Its sturdy, has a solid base, and is still looking good.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how long I can expect the $10 brush to last, but if I live long enough, I believe the savings in blades will show a profit over \\&quot;modern\\&quot; shaving.  </li>
            <li> brush slot is a little tight, but works very well!</li>
            <li> heavy base is stable, and the knurled grip in the middle and on the top are both really useful additions.</li>
            <li> I place it next to lesser items in the hopes that some class will transfer from this to other things</li>
            <li> Did some due diligence and bought a German safety razor, shaving cream in a tube, a styptic pencil, a hundred blades that last me about 2 weeks at a cost around 20 cents each, a badger brush and this stand.  </li>
            <li> Gave old razor and brush a little class.</li>
            <li> I recently went back to using a conventional razor and shaving cream requiring a brush to apply.</li>
            <li> After spending too much time trying to figure out what would fit my razor and brush, I took a chance on the Escali Stand and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my brush (on the cheaper side of quality) and my Mach 3 razor don&#x27;t fit on this stand.  </li>
            <li> My Fusion razor will work on stand but again not a perfect fit.  </li>
            <li> The stand firmly screws into the base and the chrome is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It holds my razor and my brush securely and is difficult to tip over.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my shaving brush doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> The base is solid and heavy, which is great for keeping it stable.</li>
            <li> I solve this problem by simple resting the brush &amp;#34;slanted&amp;#34; on the yoke with handle leaning toward center support.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor</li>
            <li> I have the semouge boars brush and murker long handled razor.</li>
            <li> It matches my Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gift for my husband who has a Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> It works well for my Escali brush and Merkur long handled safety razor.</li>
            <li> Will have this for a long time.</li>
            <li> bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I can see the stand going the long distance through the years.</li>
            <li> long handle razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this with a long handled Merkur and Parker brush.</li>
            <li> Fits my Merkur long handle and badger brush without any issues.  </li>
            <li> The opening is wide enough so as not to pinch or disturb the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor.  </li>
            <li> I wondered how long he&#x27;d be into</li>
            <li> Those who are into DE shaving know that how one feels to keep the tools properly and carefully.</li>
            <li> Works as it should, but not as chrome as I expected - has a bit of a yellow tint to it.</li>
            <li> have no complaints about this stand, but I do have one minor caveat: Your shaving brush may not nest in the forked hanger.</li>
            <li> Combine it with the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor &amp; Escali Badger Shaving Brush</li>
            <li> I bought the Tweezerman brush and the Merkur long</li>
            <li> I bought this stand to match the color and texture of my Merkur 180 Long razor (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_26).</li>
            <li> but I have found that in the long run these products save money.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to get this Razor and Brush Stand for a long time.</li>
            <li> (Merkur long handled razor and Escali brush).</li>
            <li> Went well with my Merkur 180 Long Handled Razor and Escali Badger Brush.  </li>
            <li> He had been wanting something like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> got the Merkur 180 Long handle and the Escali Brush.</li>
            <li> but it works as I expected and has held up to moderate use well.</li>
            <li> The razor holder is wide enough to hold all the safety razors I have seen.</li>
            <li> G Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor]].</li>
            <li> The quality of this stand was above what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised how heavy it was.</li>
            <li> G Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor]].  </li>
            <li> Listen, you can go flinging your razor (safety or multi-blade) and shaving brush around your bathroom like a monkey throwing feces.</li>
            <li> I use this stand with a Merkur Long Handle razor and the Escali Badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Holds my Escali brush and Merkur safety razor (long handle).</li>
            <li> only drawback I have found is that it will not readily accept the wider brush handles.</li>
            <li> Nice stand, heavy base which is appreciated.</li>
            <li> The base is nice and heavy, it really keeps it sturdy.</li>
            <li> Looks good with a stable base.</li>
            <li> This has a good amount of weight in the base for stability, so that is not an issue.  </li>
            <li> This is well made, with a good weight at the base.  </li>
            <li> The base has good weight to it so it doesn&#x27;t slip around the counter.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s good weight to the base</li>
            <li> The metal stand and stable base is a good upgrade over the Van Der Hagen acrylic stand I was using.</li>
            <li> (I also drilled a hole in a larger fabric bumper and mounted it above the disk to push the disk down.)    </li>
            <li> (brush not large enough).  </li>
            <li> Ok, I finally got to the point that I was sick of having my razor and brush laying on the counter next two the sink, so I decided to buy a stand.</li>
            <li> This chrome brush and razor stand was less expensive than many I looked at and seemed sturdy and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an Art of Shaving badger brush that is just ever so slightly too big around to hang properly on this stand (as you can tell from the photo</li>
            <li> Not yet fully embracing traditionalism, I commit the heresy of using plain old Barbasol instead of a brush and mug with my double-edge safety razor, a Merkur #34C.  </li>
            <li> In addition, apparently it extends the life of the brush to hang it upside down to dry</li>
            <li> The other stand I had, notice past tense, did not have this nice little touch.</li>
            <li> Solid and quality...but be careful as it did not fit one of my brushes at handle but luckily would fit at base of brissles.</li>
            <li> My shaving brush is too large at the handle to fit in the holder (Dr. Harris), but if fits at the base of the brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only razor stand I&#x27;ve owned, so I can&#x27;t compare it with any other products.</li>
            <li> Holds my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor on one end, and my Blue Beards Revenge badger brush on the other end.</li>
            <li> Solid and sharp looking on the counter of the bathroom, does not attract water spots.</li>
            <li> There are other Escali stands on Amazon that appear to be the same as this one, but they aren&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> This looks as if it were designed specifically to match that razor&#x27;s style, and doesn&#x27;t tip over without a brush on the other side acting as a counterbalance.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this stand because I also ordered an Escali brush and after reading some reviews of this and other stands I didn&#x27;t want to have the same issue.</li>
            <li> As compared to other similar brush and razor stands.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know what other material wouldn&#x27;t have the same issue.  </li>
            <li> Should have bought it long time ago!</li>
            <li> It’s small enough that I can keep it on a shelf in my medicine cabinet, yet big enough to handle my Merkur razor and Escali brush as designed.</li>
            <li> know that other fancy stores sell items similar to this for about $80.00, and that&#x27;s not even with a brush stand included!!!  </li>
            <li> Holds the razor and brush without issue.&lt;br /&gt;Coloring is sharp, and is low maintenance for cleaning.</li>
            <li> , that is a little on the smaller side, but still fits as comfortably as a larger brush would.</li>
            <li> I do like the extra height of the brush holder, some others that I looked at seemed to be a little too short.</li>
            <li> Compared to other stands I researched, you&#x27;ll save yourself about $100 for the same quality of stand.</li>
            <li> Allows the brush to dry.  </li>
            <li> Does the job Of letting my razor dry upright, works for me.</li>
            <li> It holds my DE razor and hangs my badger brush to gravity dry.</li>
            <li> This is needed to dry your equipment out.</li>
            <li> Allows brush to air dry and keep its shape and keeps bathroom organized.</li>
            <li> : hold your brush and razor in a vertical position so it can dry.</li>
            <li> Keeps the brush dry and out of the way on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> It holds my razor and brush well and allows them to drain and dry.</li>
            <li> It holds my razor and brush and allows them to dry.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my brush and razor dry in the shower until I need them.</li>
            <li> I was placing the razor and brush on the counter to dry.</li>
            <li> Also anyone using a shaving brush should have a stand it truly protect and allow for the brush to dry correctly.</li>
            <li> , the stand helps dry the brush and blade after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do however pat the stand dry from time to time.  </li>
            <li> Does not fit all razors, so maybe only buy razors that are the same brand, in which case...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a month or so, but no rust and very solid (heavy).</li>
            <li> The stand is solid and is heavy enough at the bottom to keep it from tumbling over.</li>
            <li> I use a few different Boar brushes, each of which have different diameter knots and/or handle styles.  </li>
            <li> Feels solid and weighted well, and the material feels solid too (not cheap metal).</li>
            <li> and I would eventually just buy another in disgust at how low manufacturing standards had fallen and how our grandparents wouldn&#x27;t have stood for this kind of crap,</li>
            <li> Nice, solid base.</li>
            <li> Has a nice weight to it and a sturdy, non-slip base, which overall adds to the stability of the piece.</li>
            <li> Weight is good and it has a rubber base to prevent slipping and scratching of surfaces.  </li>
            <li> If you are using a very small sink and have large manhands and an absent mind, be careful about smacking it.</li>
            <li> This stand works well for me because I have limited bathroom space</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not fit the handle on my Semogue 1800 brush, and presumably it won&#x27;t fit similar sized brushes.</li>
            <li> Even the inside you would never normally see is plated.  </li>
            <li> I spent a LONG time looking for creams, soaps, brushes, stands, scissors, combs, etc for a multiple-gift Christmas for the husband and his manly beard.</li>
            <li> I spent a LONG time looking for creams, soaps, brushes, stands, scissors, combs, etc for a multiple-gift Christmas for the husband and his manly beard.</li>
            <li> I only wish it would hang the razor upside down.</li>
            <li> It holds my van der hagen brush by setting the bush bristles down with the entire handle setting on the fork.</li>
            <li> Also, it forces you to store your shave brush properly (bristles down), which I had never done before because I didn&#x27;t have a convenient way of doing so.</li>
            <li> Solid construction, all metal, breaks down for traveling or storage, nothing feels cheep about it, and it holds my Escali brush and Merkur 180 razor</li>
            <li> I would recommend others to order one of these if they&#x27;re getting a brush because it holds your brush upside down and dries it the proper way</li>
            <li> The Escali Razor and Brush Stand holds the Jagger razor and Escali Badger shaving brush securely, and the unit is well-balanced, with a base heavy enough to be very stable as it sits on the edge of a soap shelf in the shower.  </li>
            <li> nice that the entire thing can be taken apart (unscrewed) for storage/traveling, but the base is heavy enough to prevent tipping.&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li> I order razors from Dollar Shave Club and the razor handle is a little &amp;#34;fatter&amp;#34; than other razors I have had so it takes a little effort to put the razor on the stand, but with a little twist and at the right angle it works.</li>
            <li> the fact it gets really dirty and stains with finger prints and soap scum real easily, since it is a shiny chrome-like finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a hair brush that had a slightly oval handle that would slide into the holder on its skinny side but not the larger side.  </li>
            <li> Having been a wet shaver for almost a year now I can tell you it is always a pain to figure out how to hang your badger brush to dry while traveling somewhere.  </li>
            <li> If only it had a tooth brush holder as well, then less clutter on sink, wishful thinking.</li>
            <li> Bottom weight makes it unlikely to accidentally tip over unless you deliver a pretty solid hit to it.</li>
            <li> I learned on the safety razor, so had no particular fear of it.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the price of this item, I honestly expected it to be a decent enough stand but not great.</li>
            <li> I guess my biggest complaint would be that it does´nt make coffee (very old joke).</li>
            <li> Tall enough to hold long handled razors and most brushes, base plates is well weighed.</li>
            <li> Brush prongs weren&#x27;t wide enough for the Parker Silvertip brush without widening slightly with a 22mm socket.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush side is a bit tight for some of the brushes, but totally usable.</li>
            <li> Also the base is solid enough so it won&#x27;t tip over easy.</li>
            <li> A little larger than I thought it would be, but no complaints there!</li>
            <li> My safety razor (Ikon OSS) is a little on the larger side</li>
            <li> and I especially like the bottom padding that lifts the stand up a little to prevent water from gathering there.</li>
            <li> wish my tap water wasn&#x27;t so hard - the chrome finish shows all of the mineral stains and requires frequent cleaning.</li>
            <li> It does the job for a lot less than what I have seen similar stands in other stores.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad rack but for me its either getting returned or shelved until i get a different brush that will fit on it.</li>
            <li> This is extremely important for the brush so that it does not get dirty.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not fit the brush I already owned, but did  fit the brush I ordered.</li>
            <li> Very well made, but the short handle makes it difficult to use as I would like.</li>
            <li> only complaint is it does not hold back my cat who likes to be closely involved with my morning shaving routine.</li>
            <li> The build is solid, not cheap or flimsy.  </li>
            <li> No buyer&#x27;s regrets.</li>
            <li> Heavy and solid.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it and it was as expected.</li>
            <li> Pity.</li>
            <li> Not much else</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t slide off a wet surface.</li>
            <li> I have purchased cheaper stands that the chrome came off almost immediately after getting wet</li>
            <li> Only problem is my brush handle does not fit.</li>
            <li> as expected</li>
            <li> Be careful buying this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much to look at</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and solid, so no tipping over.  </li>
            <li> It works as expected but you will see stains after a while.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting my husband started on wet shaving and included this in the &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34; I put together for him.</li>
            <li> The stand is sleek and tall with a heavy bottom to properly hold both brush and razor.</li>
            <li> (think I paid roughly $15).  </li>
            <li> Heavy, solid construction.</li>
            <li> Shaving brush, shaving cream and stand all satisfactory, as expected.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say here.</li>
            <li> I bought another to hold my second razor and heavy handled brush.</li>
            <li> It does what I expected it to: holds my Escali brush and my Merkur razor.  </li>
            <li> Having to be extremely careful to balance the razor on the stand is not what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Gillette Heavy SS Red Tip, and a Muhle R41 and</li>
            <li> My counter gets wet while I&#x27;m shaving, and the stand sits on the counter, rather than a shelf.  </li>
            <li> The pad on the bottom, when wet, is a bit slippery.  </li>
            <li> when wet, I have no idea.  </li>
            <li> I just started wet shaving</li>
            <li> Not much else to say, it does its job.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I took the plunge back in time.</li>
            <li> Fairly heavy and very solid.</li>
            <li> Not much to comment here, it seems to be a well made item.</li>
            <li> well recommended item for anyone looking to start or gift wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Heavy enough to not fall over when accidentally hit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy enough so that it does not tip over during use.</li>
            <li> I have only had this a few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and solid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> A larger brush might not fit.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t worry that it will be unstable or rust out in a wet environment.</li>

            <li> The bottom is heavy enough to keep the stand balanced while standing.</li>
            <li> Heavier than expected.</li>
            <li> it is heavy enough that it doesn&#x27;t tip over.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Better then I expected</li>
            <li> Not much else to be said.</li>
            <li> It was heavier than I expected it to be, and sturdier.</li>
            <li> now it is more annoying to keep putting back in the stand than it was to leave it in the draw.</li>
            <li> Over that goes a stamped (probably chrome plated brass) metal cover that is thickly chrome plated completely inside and out.  </li>
            <li> The base of the holder is weighted and does a nice job.</li>
            <li> The base has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> Well made, nice chrome and rubber on the bottom of the base</li>
            <li> Also, the base is nicely padded.</li>
            <li> It has a nicely weighted base and appears to be assembled well.</li>
            <li> The base is weighted and has a nice heft, so there&#x27;s no worry of the stand tipping.</li>
            <li> , LOOKS NICE ON THE COUNTER, BASE KEEPS THE STAND FROM TIPPING.  </li>
            <li> The base has a nice heft to it</li>
            <li> He liked for stable the base was, its looks, and its portability.</li>
            <li> Nice stand for the price,  chrome is well done and base is well weighted.  </li>
            <li> The base is nicely weighted, the chrome is shiny and hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of wear in over a year of use.</li>
            <li> It is well built with a good heavy base that won&#x27;t tip over.</li>
            <li> The weighted base is nice as I&#x27;m not worried about it falling over and damaging the razor.</li>
            <li> Base has nice weight, will not tip over.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy base, use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Base had nice weight.</li>
            <li> The water where I live is pretty bad</li>
            <li> It fits the standard safety razor (if you are puzzled, its the plain metal one that takes one razor blade, google safety razor and you&#x27;ll get the idea).</li>
            <li> Only thing appear other end does not fit some brushes.</li>
            <li> I use this to put my merkur long handle and my badger shaving brush that has a black handle with silver tip.</li>
            <li> Long handled razor with about an inch and a half to spare.  </li>
            <li> I would just shake the water out my brush after I finished shaving and set it down on the counter with the tips up to dry.</li>
            <li> It keeps my Merkur 180 and my brush elevated to dry and allows the brushes to hang upside down to avoid harming the bristles.  </li>
            <li> Brushes need to dry with the bristles down and exposed to the air.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brush hangs upside down letting it air dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;d read the other reviews on the possibility of rust, I&#x27;m careful to keep the stand away from standing water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But when wet, you could probably slide it down the counter like a frosty beer mug down a long bar top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this stand because I have a few razors that are bigger than the average safety razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very stylish product with a heavy base.</li>
            <li> base has a nice polished look, and the base is nice and heavy</li>
            <li> I accidentally hit it with my elbow on accident so hard it sent the razor halfway across the bathroom, but the stand barely moved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The base is strong and has enough weight to it that I have no concerns about it tipping over.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to its durability, other than that it feels well-made.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was that the stand wouldn&#x27;t hold the Parker silvertip brush I purchased by its handle as it was about a 1/16th of an inch too small.  </li>
            <li> A month in, no corrosion or other issues.</li>
            <li> I usually buy shaving cream and lotion at a Shaving Store in our local mall.  </li>
            <li> Some other people said it too, but I put it with the brush in so it fits.</li>
            <li> While I am away from my sink, it keeps my brush and my razor from fighting each other to the death.</li>
            <li> Other stands</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s universal for all brushes though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen similar model going for $100 which are no better.</li>
            <li> I settled on this one due to</li>
            <li> I do not have problems with it losing gloss or anything like some other reviewers.</li>
            <li> It holds the brush on one side and the shaver on the other.</li>
            <li> It looks sharp in the bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what some other people were complaining about.</li>
            <li> No rust or any other wear sign.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its that specific razor or the stand is off.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely well built.  </li>
            <li> It looks sharp when it is holding the razor and brush and reduces clutter.  </li>
            <li> It fits a safety razor on one end and a brush on the other.</li>
            <li> Looks like they were made for each other.</li>
            <li> (Escali brush bought on Amazon) on one side and my razor on the other.  </li>
            <li> The stand has a solid heavy base that stays put when you remove and replace your brush and razor, it doesn&#x27;t slide around, it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s glued in place on your counter top.</li>
            <li> I got him this stand (along with the other supplies) for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son&#x27;s graduation gift (along with the other requisite wet-shave swag) and then decided to get one for myself as well.  </li>
            <li> It will only hold a brush with a small handle.  </li>
            <li> however the brush holder is a mm too small to properly hold my tweezerman brush by the handle.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have said this item is sturdy, and I agree.</li>
            <li> This razor/brush stand is an extremely well built item.  </li>
            <li> This was everything the other reviews said it was.</li>
            <li> Neither too big nor too small.</li>
            <li> I will be looking into other products from this company.</li>
            <li> I would have no reservations about buying this or any other of their products.</li>
            <li> , It does not fit my brush and did not see the previous reviews stating that, The company should have  integrity and stated the brush holder is narrow and no other brush fits and or sell brush with it.</li>
            <li> This little tool has been a delight, allowing me to keep my brush dry and</li>
            <li> I expected the razor to be held upside down for drainage.</li>
            <li> My only issue with it is that the opening on the side that holds the shaving brush is a little narrow.  </li>
            <li> brush holder is a little limited in the brush sizes it supports.</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it would, was very excited, but when I got it I was disappointed....</li>
            <li> I love this base and as written in numerous other reviews this base is sturdy and well made and easy to disassemble.  </li>
            <li> I have a few stands, I have brushes ranging from 20-28 knots and a few razors of different lengths and weights.</li>
            <li> Heavy enough to stand firm and not wobble on the counter as I take the bush or razor on and off.  </li>
            <li> The vertical style air-dries your razor (and presumably brush) quickly and keeps them from getting dirty.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be slightly</li>
            <li> The base is heavy and it is nice and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Equal in quality to more expensive razor stands and less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The base is nice and heavy, and has never tipped over when trying to replace or take the razor or brush from it.</li>
            <li> A nice heavy base</li>
            <li> The base is nice and heavy, so tipping over is never a problem.  </li>
            <li> Nice heavy base.</li>
            <li> One of the nice things about this stand is the heavy base covered with rubber.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy base to keep the stand balanced well.</li>
            <li> The razor holder is only held down by it&#x27;s feeble weight, and in my compact bathroom a jostle has made my Mercer fall off twice so far into the sink.</li>
            <li> And it looks much more expensive than its price!!</li>
            <li> The base is heavy enough that it will not tip over easy.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it&#x27;ll hold up in the next months or years based on a few of the reviews by other owners here</li>
            <li> The brush I use is a little wide to clip on using the handle, so I use the brush part.</li>
            <li> For less than 1/3 of the price of other brands, this stand delivers on both aesthetics and functionality.</li>
            <li> The side for holding the brush was to small for my brush and the side to hold the razor was to just a little to big</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little expensive at first, but after realizing we had to hang up the DE razor and brush, we decided on this stand.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> However, I find that the brush side is just a little too small to properly accommodate my Van der Hagen badger brush by the curve of the handle.</li>
            <li> Sturdy with a big enough base to not tip but not too large that it takes up all the counter space.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really that bad and only someone that is really OCD would notice.</li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> For someone to manufacture a product to hold brushes, one would think they may consider the average size of a brush handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be lying if I said I wasn&#x27;t disappointed that the handle itself did not fit, but its not terrible either.  </li>
            <li> Also note that the shaft is knurled for a sure grip and the base has a non-slip rubber-like pad to prevent slippage.</li>
            <li> The heft of the base is more than sufficient to keep it upright with no feeling that it would tip over.</li>
            <li> I like that every part of the stand is detachable as I was able to engrave initials on the base plate.</li>
            <li> I bought him this to replace one that was old and broken.</li>
            <li> however, the items are not very secure.</li>
            <li> I like how the base is weighted and securely holds the razor and brush and allowing them to dry between shaves.</li>
            <li> My shaving brush hangs upside down</li>
            <li> I had one that stuck to the shower wall, but the suction cups gave out, down</li>
            <li> You can break it down for travel by unscrewing the components.</li>
            <li> It stands in there, but it will fall down at any movement.</li>
            <li> The razor hangs upside down by the handle which is (in my opinion)</li>
            <li> Plan on turning down the brush handle to fit.&lt;br /&gt;Small price to pay to extend the life of razor and brush by taking care of them.</li>
            <li> The nut went down the drain, but I managed to scoop it out.  </li>
            <li> Who knew that shaving brushes need to be stored upside down.  </li>
            <li> No rattles when I set my razor or brush down on it</li>
            <li> It will, however, allow a brush to be placed on the bottom of the handle, bristles down.</li>
            <li> I feel that the prongs on the razor&#x27;s side of the stand could be a little longer, but other than that it works well.</li>
            <li> This may be a problem with ALL razor stands, but, in the mean time I may search for a brush that does, WHEN necessary.</li>
            <li> in terms of appearance this stand is sharp!</li>
            <li> Only complaint is my badger brush fits too tightly on it&#x27;s side.</li>
            <li> You are not able to spread the tines of the &amp;#34;fork&amp;#34; so this product has a limited use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on other models.</li>
            <li> looks very sharp on the sink and my wife likes seeing it</li>
            <li> Not a significant amount, that&#x27;s why I mentioned the driving the extra miles to at least not hating the drive.</li>
            <li> Appears to be constructed of quality materials, weighted base with neoprene bottom for stability and the stainless also looks to be quality also, though I haven&#x27;t had long enough to see how it holds up against sink splash, etc.</li>
            <li> But I widened it slightly with some pliers</li>
            <li> Prime delivery in less than 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I believe it was made for the previous razors.</li>
            <li> Did however , have to bend the &amp;#34;forks&amp;#34; up slightly .</li>
            <li> The slight weight on the bottom helps keep it from shuffling around the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> I searched on Amazon and found this Escali stand for half the price that &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; store wanted for their stand.  </li>
            <li> Our bathroom counter is now much less cluttered.</li>
            <li> order arrived in less than a week, the stand was fully assembled and came in A-1 condition.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it was necessarily the cheapest stand on Amazon, but the prior reviews did not steer me wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom has a black non-slip pad ensuring you won&#x27;t damage counter tops, and it won&#x27;t move around on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ends of the holders are bent slightly up with prevents the razor and brush from falling off, if bumped.</li>
            <li> I just did not want to store them hidden in a bathroom drawer</li>
            <li> He has never shaved with a safety razor but has decided that the new razors are too expensive and not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> The only small problem was the brush holder side is a little small for the brush handle.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that this stand would be a quality stand - not a flimsy thing that would look cheap or tip over  - and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Minor complaint is from my wife, she doesn&#x27;t like the chrome bottom that she has to keep cleaning the water spots from sink splash that mar the looks, but I WILL BE TRAINED to wipe it off after every use.</li>
            <li> not sure how the bottom base(against sink surface) will do if it gets wet</li>
            <li> I only wish the company would offer an extra extension that adds an inch or so to the base so that my razor (from Harry&#x27;s) could completely hang.  </li>
            <li> Some may say the brush side is tight with some brushes</li>
            <li> Note: the Parker brush fits tight in this stand.</li>
            <li> My Art of Shave brush is a tight squeeze but I manage to get it in there.  </li>
            <li> but it is somewhat tight.</li>
            <li> This particular badger brush I ordered does NOT fit into the stand near the base of the handle where one would typically hang the brush.</li>
            <li> Hard to go wrong with a stand, but it is sturdy and looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> The brush end is a little tight.</li>
            <li> The brush holder was a little tight on my brush, but it works.</li>
            <li> The base is weighted so it won&#x27;t tip over easily.  </li>
            <li> The base is weighted, so it doesn&#x27;t tip over easily.</li>
            <li> The base is weighted so it doesn&#x27;t topple over easily.</li>
            <li> Sturdy little stand that fits my Escali brush and Edwin Jagger DE89 razor perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> This stand seems to work with anything and takes up little space.</li>
            <li> I waited a little while to write this review</li>
            <li> and that adds a little something to my day.</li>
            <li> Little hesitant because I had never ordered or even used a safety razor,</li>
            <li> Nifty little razor and shaving brush holder.</li>
            <li> Give yourself a little treat .</li>
            <li> After seeing the stand, thought it was a little over priced for what you get.</li>
            <li> Might try bending the stand prongs a little to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> If you want it shinier, a little household cleaner will do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I took mine to the garage, wrapped the brush end in a cloth, and with a hammer taped the prongs out a little bit.</li>
            <li> He loves this little stand, and he can keep his stuff inside the medicine cabinet now.</li>
            <li> I opened this article a couple of days ago, it looks pretty solid, and has a anti-slip base it grips firmly on my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> This little stand had all of those features.  </li>
            <li> The arms are a little curved at the end</li>
            <li> It could be a little heavier but for the price I paid, Im not complaining.</li>
            <li> The base is sufficiently heavy so as to avoid easily tipping over despite my use of a razor and brush well on the heavier side of things.</li>
            <li> The base is rather heavy and substantial so that I cannot see it toppling over easily.  </li>
            <li> The heavy base keeps it from tipping over easily.</li>
            <li> I previously used the Van Der Hagen shave kit stand and unlike the acrylic stand in the Van Der Hagen kit, the Escali stand is too narrow to hold the Van Der Hagen brush at the narrow section of the handle.</li>
            <li> Heavy base, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I looked perhaps ridiculously too long for the &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; stand...</li>
            <li> You have to very slowly place it in the hook and hold it a second.</li>
            <li> Eventually I will probably upgrade to another brush but for now I just wrap a couple of rubber bands around the base of the brush to make it large enough to be held by the stand.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find they came quicker than I expected in spite of the fact it was during the crazy holiday season.</li>
            <li> Heavy well made stand.</li>
            <li> The base is heavy and sturdy enough to keep the whole stand stable.</li>
            <li> My brush (art of shaving) does not fit as designed, however, the brush can still hang on stand where brisles meet handle.  </li>
            <li> My brush (Parker - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U6P0NW?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00) does not fit in this stand.  </li>
            <li> Had to return this stand as it did not fit the badger brush that came with The Art of Shaving Kit.  </li>
            <li> Heavy to hold razor and brush,</li>
            <li> My merkur futur does not fit on this stand.  </li>
            <li> Holds my stuff; no fit issue with the brush like some.</li>
            <li> As in I wasted a couple a hundred bucks in order to &amp;#34;save&amp;#34; 30 dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stand is well-built, heavy, and holds my razor and brush.</li>
            <li> The Gillett Razor does not fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly narrow slot for the brush, so I assume it was designed specifically for the Escali brush lines.</li>
            <li> A week after it arrived something was missing</li>
            <li> Heavily weighted at bottom.  </li>
            <li> Brush would not fit in the slot at the handle but fits at the bristle part.  </li>
            <li> Heavy and stays put.</li>
            <li> Heavy.</li>
            <li> Not cheap quality.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now without any issue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a brush and razor for a few years and had wanted a stand for them for some time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and sturdy.</li>
            <li> It is also heavy</li>
            <li> screw on base feels solid and of similar construction to the merkur short handle that sits on it, so they make a lot of sense together.</li>
            <li> well made heavy duty stand.</li>
            <li> Firm stand and well sized holders for the razor and the brush.</li>
            <li> It will not fit.</li>
            <li> The brushes I wanted this for do not fit in it.</li>
            <li> Heavy stand that won&#x27;t tip over when you touch it.  </li>
            <li> Heavy stand</li>
            <li> I was worried that my badger and razor (from Art of Shaving) would not fit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly heavy.</li>
            <li> Not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Will pay for itself in a few months of not buying overpriced multi-blades.</li>
            <li> The brush side was too narrow for my brush.</li>
            <li> it DOES NOT fit a Gilette Fusion Proglide razor.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a quality stand for my brush and razor for my everyday use.  </li>
            <li> The brush does not fit as well as I would like, but it still fits.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the brush might not fit</li>
            <li> It is heavy for it&#x27;s size</li>
            <li> Heavy weight, not flimsy stamped out plated steel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heavy, and durable.</li>
            <li> Been using it a few weeks and no complaints.</li>
            <li> 1) the weight at the bottom  (it isn&#x27;t visible unless you disassemble the stand) is iron, so it gets rusty if you leave water on it, and 2) the side for the brush is too narrow.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT FIT GILLETTE ART OF SHAVING BRUSH.</li>
            <li> This stand is quite heavily made.</li>
            <li> The brush that came with it was a marble handled one that was just a millimeter or two wide, so the brush had to be forced into the stand with 2 hands.  </li>
            <li> Feels heavy as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and feels sturdy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it with heavier brushes or razors, but I feel that if I stick to brushes that are NOT made of heavy stone-</li>
            <li> The bottom is heavy</li>
            <li> I received the stand in just a few days and gave it to my husband for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> This stand is weighty, shiny, with heavy duty metal.</li>
            <li> Shipped and arrived within a few days.  </li>
            <li> The articles said brushes and razors need to be dried.</li>
            <li> Had it for a few months now, no problems.  </li>
            <li> will not fit into the stand.  </li>
            <li> I did have to modify the razor holder with zip tie because my razor was too narrow but a zip tie did the job.  </li>
            <li> I like the rubberized base on the bottom for a cushiony and skid free surface.</li>
            <li> Heavy</li>
            <li> It holds my edwin brush and merkur heavy weight handle razor with no problem.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Heavy in weight</li>
            <li> Note the Omega 10049 does not fit in this stand</li>
            <li> The side that holds the shave brush was just a hair too narrow for my brush.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about the quality of this, but it&#x27;s heavy and well made.  </li>
            <li> I subtracted a star because the razor holding side wasn&#x27;t deep enough to casually place my razor head on the holder without it resting off-kilter unless one delicately places the razor on the holder.</li>
            <li> For those who were initially wondering about the base and rubber pad being released too much, I have some information.</li>
            <li> Very sharp looking!</li>
            <li> As a small business owner, it means a lot to me that I can work with other small business owners through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stand is solid, with a decent base to it wont tip over easily.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect</li>
            <li> I got it because the stand that came with my Gillete razor was too plain.  </li>
            <li> The stand is weighted, so it will not easily tip over.</li>
            <li> The merkur blades are less expensive and last longer than the cartridges I was using.</li>
            <li> The base is weighted well, and the &#x27;forks&#x27; are thick and strong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little annoying if you need to move the stand with everything on it because it has a base that sort of adheres to surfaces so if you try to slide it, it doesn&#x27;t go easy and instead tips, dumping the razor because the holder is open ended and the razor sort of sits in an open V on it.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hold my razor (merkur 34C) very tightly because it&#x27;s chrome on chrome and</li>
            <li> Not that this matters to me now, but it seems oddly tall by at least two inches.</li>
            <li> Soft rubber solid base.</li>
            <li> If I do, there&#x27;s very little stopping my razor from falling</li>
            <li> No major complaints so far and the base is sturdy with a non-slip pad on the bottom</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s HEAVY!...</li>
            <li> , I have a merker and a small sized brush</li>
            <li> The brush holder of this stand is too small.</li>
            <li> I still have to shave everyday but at least, for now, I look forward to it</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower, and the base keeps the center of gravity low and the rubber stops the stand from slipping.</li>
            <li> My husband had to file a small notch on either side of the brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else there is to say.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on our small space.</li>
            <li> Plenty solid and the base is heavy enough to stand upright with no worry of tipping over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more rot.</li>
            <li> No more shaving brush on the counter.</li>
            <li> One disclaimer -Discovered that my shaving brush that came in the &amp;#34;art of shaving&amp;#34; starter kit is too small to hang</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else to say about this stand.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a standard Gillette razor, neither does it hold baxter badger brush .. fairly useless.</li>
            <li> It is to small for all but one brush.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this could be improved upon.</li>
            <li> I would have given this stand a 5 star rating, however, it is made for the Escali shaving brush and that is small.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure what else to say.</li>
            <li> Not sure which brush this is supposed to work with.</li>
            <li> Perhaps an earthquake could dislodge things from this sturdy anchor-like stand, but anything short of that would surely fail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The biggest bummer for me is that the opening for the brush does NOT hold the Semogue 1305 brush, and I am not sure which Semogue it would hold, as the taper for the handles are quite similar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Solid enough metal with a heavy base that keeps the stand from being knocked over.  </li>
            <li> Space is a premium in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> The arm is just a tad but too small.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my husband and he enjoys it everyday!  </li>
            <li> I just need a small amount of the shaving cream for each shave.</li>
            <li> Had too place on small pedestle</li>
            <li> It has a small footprint on the vanity and keeps my razor at-hand when I am rinsing my face between passes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which razor the stand was designed for.</li>
            <li> Takes up a ridiculously small amount of room on the counter.</li>
            <li> It has a small footprint so it fits into our medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li> Fits Parker razor and brush well, base is heavy enough not to tip over when only one of them is hanging on it.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I will do with it.</li>
            <li> no more tidy-uppers dulling my blades by moving them around while I&#x27;m at work.</li>
            <li> Its weird but a shaving brush and razor almost look naked without a stand.</li>
            <li> too small to hold brush handle</li>
            <li> Gap too small for brush.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, he will be able to use this type of shaving system and not get a terrible rash on his face.  </li>
            <li> Very Heavy.  </li>
            <li> The base is also pretty heavy which makes it hard to accidentally knock over.</li>

            <li> Not surprisingly the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> If you splash water anywhere near it, the base will begin to rust.    </li>
            <li> I like the stand’s heavy base because I never have to worry that it’ll tip over when I’m hanging my brush and blade to dry.</li>
            <li> You will not go wrong with this item for your brush, but note that it may not fit brushes with very thick handles.</li>
            <li> stands and well let&#x27;s just say I felt really dumb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to read a number of reviews where this stand doesn&#x27;t do the job (brushes falling off or not fitting, etc).</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed in the smaller stature of the stand.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that the metal hook portion might be weak, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.</li>
            <li> This stand looks sharp and keeps the brush from resting on surfaces and harboring nasty bacteria and such!</li>
            <li> The stand has a solid base and sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> This game me</li>
            <li> The stand has a very solid and stable base, no wobble.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem porous enough that I&#x27;m worried about water soaking in and eroding the base.</li>
            <li> I started using a brush because I got tired of wasting the shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Rock solid craftsmanship with a sturdy base.</li>
            <li> Bought this stand as I was getting tired of having all of my things laying around.  </li>
            <li> That one would collapse if the razor itself was left alone on the stand because the base wasn&#x27;t weighted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Poor quality control.</li>
            <li> Base is of moderate weight; ensures no tipping over.</li>
            <li> I wish base was larger in diameter to catch any drips.</li>
            <li> the knot fits in the opening but the handle is to round and the brush rolls around awkwardly on the stand.</li>
            <li> The base is solid in addition to being weighted well.</li>
            <li> In addition, it&#x27;s really solidly built and has a non-slip base.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that it&#x27;s proximity to the messy items</li>
            <li> Base is solid with a well crafted cushioned bottom.</li>
            <li> The base is weighted enough to sit where I put and not move around when I&#x27;m removing/storing my razor and brush.</li>
            <li> There is also a rubber sole to the base which helps to keep the stand in one spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> The base is solid and seems well made.</li>
            <li> Seriously folks, don&#x27;t let your brush get weird, put it on a stand.</li>
            <li> If you have a long handled razor, the handle may hit the stand base, the post is not that tall.</li>
            <li> It holds my Merkur long handled razor with no problem and the anti-skid base prevents it from sliding.  </li>
            <li> The base plate came loose as soon as I opened the package.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s a little off-balance doing it that way, but it doesn&#x27;t look bad when its in there</li>
            <li> Disappointing, to say the least.</li>
            <li> The base also has a bit of felt on the bottom, no danger of marking your counters or slipping around.</li>
            <li> Heavier base than expected</li>
            <li> The base is hollow, stamped, but it has a lead weight in it that gives it heft and stability.  </li>
            <li> and the razor handle rest at a slight angle on the edge of the base.  </li>
            <li> This thing is built tough!</li>
            <li> The base is slightly heavy</li>
            <li> chrome finish looks like it will hold up well and the heavy base keeps it all upright.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The weighted, rubber base helps keep it in place without managing to be too heavy.  </li>
            <li> The razor holder is a bit difficult in holding my Gillette style but it is not the holders fault.</li>
            <li> Nostalgic look and feel.  </li>
            <li> Stand was useless for holding shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Heavy base.</li>
            <li> Not flimsy because of the heavy base.</li>
            <li> Heavy base keeps it stable.  </li>
            <li> -I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Heavy base, won&#x27;t tip over.</li>
            <li> The heavy base makes it tip-over proof.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sad</li>
            <li> This stand is useless to me.</li>
            <li> If simplicity is your thing, you won&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> Holds the shave brush and razor without fail.  </li>
            <li> This matches my expensive safety razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Nothing absurdly extravagant here - just a functional razor/brush stand.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stand.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the overly expensive products and is balances</li>
            <li> Sufficiently heavy so will not tip over on its rubber base.</li>
            <li> It seems well made and is not tippy or cheesy.</li>
            <li> The heavy base keeps it from falling over.  </li>
            <li> It has a heavy base with a non-slip pad that is truly non-slip.</li>
            <li> This stand has a heavy base and is well built.</li>
            <li> I was wrong -</li>
            <li> ; they are way too expensive.</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re not using a shaving brush before you shave, you&#x27;re doing something wrong..</li>
            <li> Holds an Escali brush well, but is a bit weird sometimes putting my Merkur razor on.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Basically useless.</li>
            <li> Silly</li>
            <li> The base is very heavy and stays put.</li>
            <li> Works well, weighted base is hard to tip over, holds shaving stuff like a brush stand should.</li>
            <li> The base has a non slip thick pad that sits well on sink countertop.</li>
            <li> a bad sign if you have the wrong brush size.</li>
            <li> Nothing crazy about it</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t imagine what would be disappointing about it.</li>
            <li> Base has a thin foam bottom for grip.  </li>
            <li> what the effect of the washer is, it raises the height of the chrome base up just a small amount so that the skirt of the base won&#x27;t come in contact with your countertop.</li>
            <li> hasnt failed me yet!</li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s nearly impossible to test the stand with every brush make and model out there</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about this stand, don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> I started to research stands for the safety razor and brush at &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; and was shocked to find out that they wanted to charge upwards of $50+ for a stand.  </li>
            <li> If you want a stand, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I guarantee you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> For the price you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed by going with this one.</li>
            <li> If you are considering a stand for your razor and brush, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed with this unit.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t touch the base.</li>
            <li> That brings the metal base level with the counter.</li>
            <li> The solution is to pull off and discard the foam, exposing a lead (?) disk that weights the base.</li>
            <li> Weighted, padded base won&#x27;t scuff or otherwise mar my sink, and my Merkur razor &amp; badger brush can now sit out instead of being stuffed into my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tip over because of the weight of the base.</li>
            <li> Base is non-slip and durable.</li>
            <li> Stand is worthless.</li>
            <li> I unscrewed the stem from the base and turned the holders upside-down</li>
            <li> The base is well weighted and the rubber bottom keeps it from sliding around.</li>
            <li> Base has a foam bottom</li>
            <li> so wont tip over, could use one piece instead of 2 for base</li>
            <li> The bottom of the base is slip resistant and stays in place.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s quite compact with a rubber/foam grip on the base.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping that the brush stand would hold it at the handle vs at the base of the bristles but it does not.</li>
            <li> so it resists movement and stays in place even when the base is soaked.</li>
            <li> Being in a humid environment, I removed the base and put WD-40 on the threads before reassembling it.</li>
            <li> Substantial base.  </li>
            <li> The base is sturdy as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The base is weighted which helps stabilize the stand.</li>
            <li> There is a 1\\&quot; piece of all-thread that screws into the cast iron base, through the stamped metal cover into the upright shaft.  </li>
            <li> This is not Wal-Mart/3rd World crap.</li>
            <li> The base of the stand is weighted and lined with what appears to be neoprene on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Weighted base keeps it from tipping.</li>
            <li> Well made with a sturdy base.</li>
            <li> The base prevents the razor or brush from tipping over or even wobbling when you are using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Shiny finish and a solid/heavy base</li>
            <li> But perhaps the biggest surprise was the heft of the base.  </li>
            <li> This has a weighted base that won&#x27;t allow your brush and razor to fall over.</li>
            <li> I took mine apart to give it a wax job and noticed that there is a washer placed between the chrome base and weight.</li>
            <li> Anti-skid base.</li>
            <li> The weighted base keeps it</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Yeah, nothing really shocking here.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this stand. It looks great next to my sink and is a perfect complement to my high end shave brush and DE razor. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I have received this stand in perfect condition (new) from Perella. It fits all sorts of razors, including battery powered ones. It also accommodates to most brushes.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this razor and shaving brush stand and I am very pleased with my purchase.  The stand is very solid, sturdy and looks great in my bathroom.  My razor and new shaving brush fit perfectly on it.  I highly recommend this to anyone who uses a shaving brush and &amp;#34;old timey&amp;#34; shave soap.  Well worth the price.  The packaging in which it arrived was also very sturdy and professional looking.  Great value!!</li>
            <li> I have a few stands, I have brushes ranging from 20-28 knots and a few razors of different lengths and weights. I want the stand to be balanced, I want my brush or razor not to fall off the stand if bumped. I want the stand to be easy to clean and look good on my bathroom counter. I enjoy the quite time of grooming with my favorite music, the Escali stand is an excellent choice for my shaving equipment.</li>
            <li> great design and made to last a lifetime.  love it</li>
            <li> This is just the right kind of stand for the newer Gillette battery powered razors. It has a wider shaft and wouldn&#x27;t fit my old stand. The design is masculine and balance - no tipping - is solid.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother, who wanted a simple, classic shaving stand.  He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a great razor and brush stand, looks superb and well made. The base is slightly heavy so it balances well, and is padded for the premium feel. The chrome finish looks great and I think it looks better than a lot of expensive stands out there. I currently need to buy a brush so can&#x27;t comment on how it would fit. I am using Gillette Sensor Excel and fits perfectly on the stand.</li>
            <li> This stand is perfect for my new razor and brush.  It&#x27;s much nicer than I thought it would be, and, in fact, I ordered a second stand today to use with one of my other razor/brush sets.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this-it&#x27;s a nice heavy stand with excellent chrome plating and appears to be very durable.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Good brush stand, however the yoke for the brush does not accomodate larger diameter brushes. I solve this problem by simple resting the brush &amp;#34;slanted&amp;#34; on the yoke with handle leaning toward center support. Stand is made very well, strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Great stand I own a Merkur Long Handle 23c(180) has plenty of room under it so it doesn&#x27;t touch the base. As for the picture I took it on an angle it doesn&#x27;t tilt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great stand! Seems very well made at a most reasonable price. I am very happy with it! The base is sufficiently heavy so as to avoid easily tipping over despite my use of a razor and brush well on the heavier side of things. If you want a stand, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> straightforward quality built. It is exactly what it looks like. I like the knurled portion in the middle since it matches my razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stand for a couple weeks and so far it seems like a very sturdy and quality product.  The chrome finish appears to very high quality, and the bottom has a nice rubberized pad to keep it from slipping around on the counter.  The shipping was very prompt.  In short, I can recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Solid. Holds the razor well. Holds the brush well. Solid piece.</li>
            <li> Sturdy little stand that fits my Escali brush and Edwin Jagger DE89 razor perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Nice chrome finish looks like it will hold up well and the heavy base keeps it all upright.</li>
            <li> This stand is well made and well balanced. It has already made a difference in keeping my blades dry and clean. Recommended.</li>
            <li> A substantial stand that&#x27;s well crafted and seems like it will last for years.  Fits my parker brush and futur razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for my long handle Merkur, very happy thus far for the price!</li>
            <li> First point of note: this, the Colonel Conk, and a half-dozen others like this are all the same model. There&#x27;s no point paying more for one than another other.    The finish is a nice chrome. Doesn&#x27;t seem to scratch easily. Looks nice on the counter, fairly classy with a Merkur razor and Escali brush. Nothing falls out. No complaints about usability.    The problem, though, is that the bottom is a stick-on piece of foam that compresses after a week or two. That brings the metal base level with the counter. If you splash water anywhere near it, the base will begin to rust.    The solution is to pull off and discard the foam, exposing a lead (?) disk that weights the base. Then you stick a couple of rubber bumpers (the kind you&#x27;d attach to the inside of cabinet doors) to the disk to elevate the assembly a few millimeters higher. (I also drilled a hole in a larger fabric bumper and mounted it above the disk to push the disk down.)    The short elevation actually makes the thing look better. Hasn&#x27;t rusted at all in two months.</li>
            <li> This was a gift. It works well to hold razor and brush. It is easy to clean. It is a way to make the chore of shaving more enjoyable, handier and more pleasing to eye.</li>
            <li> The quality of the stand is good but I bought it with idea to use for the brush and for the razor but the razor Gillette Fusion Power Proglide razor does not feet into the stand slot. That&#x27;s why I give 3 stars rating to the stand.</li>
            <li> Great stand, high quality, and durable. Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Nice product and very nicely fit for purpose combined with a timely delivery. I have no hesitation in recommending this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. High quality, no sign of corrosion after several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish my tap water wasn&#x27;t so hard - the chrome finish shows all of the mineral stains and requires frequent cleaning. Not the product&#x27;s problem, shiny and bright when it&#x27;s kept up.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, solid product. Does exactly what it should and looks great doing it!</li>
            <li> The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand does the trick! It makes my straight razor easy to grab and my brush upside down, which is crucial for drying. Plus, it looks great. One slight issue, however, was my brush didn&#x27;t fit at first. But I widened it slightly with some pliers and it now fits perfect. Easy fix.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, easy to assemble, looks great. Well done.</li>
            <li> nice heavy base, nice finish</li>
            <li> Solid product, performs as advertised. The razor hanger side could use more depth. Just barely fits my Merkur long handled razor. If I&#x27;m not careful in placing it precisely the razor falls of when I put the brush on.</li>
            <li> This is a great stand.  It will hold a full size razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Holds razor and brush very nicely. Looks great. Very stable.</li>
            <li> Affordable and high quality</li>
            <li> Stand has a nice finish,its sturdy and accompdates my brush and safety razor well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 2 weeks now and have been fully satisfied. I&#x27;m using it with the Tweezerman&#x27;s brush and the Merkur Long-Handled Safety Razor and have had no issues with fit or support of either. The product performs as desired and feels solid and well-made.</li>
            <li> The stand has a solid base and sturdy construction. It holds my Escali brush and Merkur razor without issue.</li>
            <li> My shaving brush hangs upside down so it actually dries overnight &amp; doesn&#x27;t develop a musty odor. It looks nice as well. my razor doesn&#x27;t hang well on the stand but that&#x27;s no issue for me. It&#x27;s ss so presumably wont rust. My spouse likes the look as well..</li>
            <li> Cheap and yet very effective. A great beginners brush!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for the merkur 180 razor and escali brush and both fit perfect. Pretty sturdy as well. My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality and most useful product.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This stand is perfect.  Well contruscted, holds my brush and razor well.  I was worried about it holding my new Kent BK8, but the brush fits fine without the bristles being pushed by the bar.</li>
            <li> I got this stand to go along with a new Escali brush because I knew it would fit. The stand is comfortably heavy and has a nice chrome finish. I can&#x27;t speak to its durability, other than that it feels well-made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a stand and can be sure that your brush and razor will fit, this is a good option.</li>
            <li> It has a heavy solid base. It is well made and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a really great looking, shiny stand.  It doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.  The only issue I had was that the stand wouldn&#x27;t hold the Parker silvertip brush I purchased by its handle as it was about a 1/16th of an inch too small.  You could however hold it by the brushes knot which works pretty well, but causes the brush to tip over.  I got tired of the balancing act, and I was able to spread the holders out enough to comfortably hold the brush without damaging the stand.  I am not recommending you try this, but it did work for me.  I had a hair brush that had a slightly oval handle that would slide into the holder on its skinny side but not the larger side.  I put the handle between the brush holder on the skinny side of the brush and turned the brush basically forcing the stand holder &amp;#34;tines&amp;#34; outward about 1/8th of an inch. This game me just enough room and you can&#x27;t even tell that the tines were bent.  If you try this, know that you may damage the stand and void any warranty.</li>
            <li> Product was just as described. Is great quality with good weight so won&#x27;t tip over. Looks very nice on counter. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The product works - holds my brush and razor well.  It nice bright and clean chrome finish, and is sturdily made.</li>
            <li> It fits my Merkur Model 180 and the Excali Badger Brush, which was my biggest concern in ordering.  It&#x27;s like they were made to go together.  the bottom has a neoprene pad so it&#x27;s non-stick and fine around water.  The build is solid, not cheap or flimsy.  Looks really nice (see picture), and it just works.  I&#x27;ll post again in a few months about the durability, but for now, I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> What can you really say about a shaving brush stand? It&#x27;s well made, it looks good, it does what it is supposed to. It&#x27;s HEAVY!... solid metal with a rubber pad under the bottom that won&#x27;t scratch or leave stains on the surface underneath. Holds my Escali brush perfectly and would probably work well with most brushes... I use an old Gillette double edge razor and the stand holds that well also and would probably work with pretty much any razor. This would make a nice gift for anybody who shaves with the old school shaving brush, regardless of the razor they use. I think this is an excellent product at an excellent price. Nothing flimsy or cheap about it at all. Looks like it will last a long long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband&#x27;s new Merkur Classic Safety Razor (short 3\\&quot; handle model - I wanted to specify this as all the other reviews that reference the Merkur razor reference the long-handled version) and Tweezerman&#x27;s Shaving Brush.  Both items fit perfectly!  This stand certainly beats laying his shaving items on the counter top or in a bowl.  It&#x27;s very nice, shiny, sturdy, and takes up little room.  We&#x27;ve been using this item for over a month now with no problems and are both very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> The product is very well made - it looks good on the bathroom shelf. I would give it five stars but for one thing - my razor slides off the hook.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t accommodate a razor with a flange at the top. I can&#x27;t figure out how to solve the problem - so I just use it to hold my brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, and very quick shipping. Needed this for years.</li>
            <li> Elegant!  Love this stand!  Quality-made!</li>
            <li> The stand looks great and does exactly what I need.  Holds my brush, my razor, and looks great!  Definitely recommended, especially for the price</li>
            <li> Looks great on the bathroom sink/counter.  Holds the razor firmly and the brush is held high enough to not touch the counter top.  Allows the brush to dry.  The base of the holder is weighted and does a nice job.</li>
            <li> Just right size for the tall/long razor</li>
            <li> Handsome product. Well made.  Expect it to last many years. My wife doesn&#x27;t even mind having it on the vanity.</li>
            <li> Nice looking and seems to be well made.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good quality and goes well with my Merkur HD.</li>
            <li> Weighted, padded base won&#x27;t scuff or otherwise mar my sink, and my Merkur razor &amp; badger brush can now sit out instead of being stuffed into my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> This thing is MANLY. I loved it as an addition to my pawpaw&#x27;s old double edge razor I use today. Really seems like good quality as well.</li>
            <li> Great stand- solid and very attractive and functional</li>
            <li> This Chrome Razor and Brush Stand is of first rate quality. I was looking for something to hold my Double Edge Safety Razor and recently purchased Badger Hair Shaving brush. I had one that stuck to the shower wall, but the suction cups gave out, down it went, and snapped the head right off my otherwise perfect DE Razor.&lt;br /&gt;This base has a nice polished look, and the base is nice and heavy so it isn&#x27;t prone to falling over. It really is a nice piece that you can proudly display in your bathroom. If you are looking for a handy way to store your brush and razor so they&#x27;ll dry out properly, this piece is certainly worthy of your consideration.</li>
            <li> This is my first attempt at wet shaving.  I knew I would need a stand for my brush and razor.  I purchased the Escali stand and it works perfectly!  I would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> A great, good-looking value-priced stand for your brush and razor!  Fits my Merkur 38c perfectly, as I hand the razor upside down, but it would fit right-side up, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weighted, rubber base helps keep it in place without managing to be too heavy.  The bright chrome matches my razor finish well, and the faux ivory looks good on our counter.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this solid choice for a good stand!  Fast delivery, good seller.</li>
            <li> The Escali exceeded my expectations when I received this stand. It is very solid and heavy for its size, and has a nice polished look. If I ever need a replacement, I would definitely reorder one, though I don&#x27;t think that will be very soon.</li>
            <li> I have a normal razor and it won&#x27;t stay on the hook without carefully balancing it. Everything else is great.</li>
            <li> I like it. Looks great on my bathroom counter. Well made</li>
            <li> So far so good on this. It matches my Merkur pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t allow some of the larger handle brushes (Van Der Hagen) but works well with the Tweazerman and Escali. I didn&#x27;t seem to have the issues with lopsidedness or bulge in the padding on the bottom. I have a smaller sink so this is kept in the medicine cabinet so I don&#x27;t see having issues with water and pad like some have commented on these types of stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update if anything changes.</li>
            <li> I like the holder for my razor it is tuff and the design matches perfectly with my \\&quot;German made\\&quot;razor.&lt;br /&gt;I also own a vintage shaving cream brush that had longer bristles that happened to be too long&lt;br /&gt;for the holder so I cut the bristles to fit the (holder to the base)length. So the cream brush part of the holder is for smaller brushes only.&lt;br /&gt;Nice finishing touch to my shaving accessories.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality razor stand, works as advertised. A lower price would always be nice, but I guess demand isn&#x27;t so high for old school shaving stuff.</li>
            <li> looks nice on my counter, holds my Merkur razor and AoS brush with no problems.  its a sturdy piece.  nice and heavy and stand there well.  would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of stands out there, but the price and style made this an easy choice. The package arrived on time and when promised.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and it&#x27;s heavy, sturdy, and attractive!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I just went back to the old school eat of shaving with a safety razor and brush. I received a gift certificate for a straight razor shave and really liked the result. I really like this stand as it keeps my razor and brush handy and out of the way. It looks great and adds a nice touch to the look of the sink area. I would recommend this to anyone who uses the safety razor and  brush as it is a good looking functional addition to the shaving ritual.</li>
            <li> Looks great on the counter in my bathroom. Holds my razor and brush perfectly. No buyer&#x27;s regrets.</li>
            <li> Looks and works great</li>
            <li> My Escali 100% Pure badger shaving brush and Parker 96R razor fit perfectly on this.  It is does not seem cheaply made it.  Solid construction and everything fits perfectly on this.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> It looks great and does the job. Holds my nice Chrome razor and brush and makes me happy.</li>
            <li> Heavy well made stand. Holds my Mekur razor and NM brush well. Really like the products quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my Edwin Jagger DE89LBl razor and Escali shaving brush.  Exactly the right fit and it looks great on the shelf.</li>
            <li> It does what it was designed for, holds a brush and razor.</li>
            <li> Fits my brush and Merkur razor perfectly. Seems to be made of high quality materials. Heavy and solid.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and attractive. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> I am very very happy with the razor stand I purchased for my husband for Christmas.  It arrived in time and well packaged. It is well made with some heft to it. My husband is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> sweet multi use shaving tool</li>
            <li> This is a good stand for the price.  I have been using it for over 6 weeks and there are no signs of tarnish.</li>
            <li> Top quality!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed. For the price, this is a really nice stand. Shipped tightly wrapped in bubble wrap so the finish was flawless with no scratches or machine marks other than the knurling. The base has a nice weight to it. Holds my parker brush and 99R long handle with no problems, and it looks nice sitting next to my sink. The initial investment to get into safety razor shaving is definitely worth it, especially when you can get 100 replacement blades for $8. Never going back to the overpriced Gillette fusion cartridges.</li>
            <li> Nice stand; looks and feels well-built. Holds my Parker badger-bristle brush and Edwin Jagger DE89 perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great quality and fits my brush perfectly. The razor holder is a bit difficult in holding my Gillette style but it is not the holders fault. I will just buy a new razor. I bought one for me and one for my son and he is very happy with his as well.</li>
            <li> This stand was purchased as a gift for my husband for Christmas. We love that the detail matched the handle on the safety razor I purchased and his brush and razor set have become a functional decorative piece in the bathroom. Also very durable and easy to clean water spots from the base.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this convenient stand</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job holding my razor and brush.  Very sturdy and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> yes... well made and strong... great with my new razor and brush... good value for the price</li>
            <li> Item was solid, fit the brush and razor perfectly - completed the look</li>
            <li> Nice product. uncluttered my bathroom with style.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent stand, and a beautiful match for the new razor my daughter gave me. It holds the razor &amp; my brush in excellent position.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping exactly what I want very heavy not to mention it looks good holding my razor and brush next to the sink.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it and it was as expected. Very happy!</li>
            <li> Decent quality but doesn&#x27;t work with Gillette Mach3 razors.</li>
            <li> I bought the razor and brush stand for my  husband for Christmas and he loves it!</li>
            <li> A beautiful addition to the vanity counter top. Solid construction. Great look and feel. Works as it should.</li>
            <li> Great stand (sturdy as can be) without the expensive price. Chrome is perfect, holds most of my brushes and all my razors without a problem. My kids bought me a stand from AOS for like 90.00 dollars for Christmas and i said take it back, there are just as nice stands on Amazon without  the silly prices plus i can get some soap and a EJ pure badger brush for that price. The small company working thru Amazon was wonderful with very nice pakaging and super fast delivery....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trevor</li>
            <li> These stands rock.  Well made and well balanced.  I&#x27;ve had mine a year and no problems with any corrosion or rust.  Some may say the brush side is tight with some brushes but I believe it&#x27;s intended to be that way.  My brush was a tight fit at first but now it has a groove worn in it and fits like a glove.  Still snug on the brush side so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling off.  The razor side is a much looser fit but works fine.</li>
            <li> very nicely made. has a good feel and weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;fits perfectly for escali brush obviously and my mercur razor. in fact it matches razor so well that it looks as if it was a set.</li>
            <li> As advertised-looks good on vanity top.</li>
            <li> perfect to hold a razor and brush, easy to clean</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for his razor and brush. Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> very sturdy and the base has a nice grip on it. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It holds my Escali brush and my Edwin Jagger razor excellently.  So far a very solid item.  I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Have used it for a year. Bought another one as a gift.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my husband. He was thrilled to receive it, and says it delivers one of the &amp;#34;best shaves&amp;#34; he has experienced. He loves it.</li>
            <li> Well.......it does a great job showing off my manly grooming tools.</li>
            <li> Works just fine - it&#x27;s just not good for heavy brushes.  My heavy shaving brush tips over and falls right off, so I can&#x27;t use it.  I have no idea how it holds up in the shower because I got rid of it before I ever used it.</li>
            <li> My experience with this product has been great since it arrived in the mail.  In general, my switch to using a safety razor and accompanying accessories like this razor and brush stand has been excellent.  There is a cost associated with getting started using a safety razor, but I&#x27;m certain it will pay for itself over the course of the year as I&#x27;m not buying overprice cartridges with 16 blades.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Reasonably priced. Very sturdy and stable on the bathroom counter. The finish looks good as well.</li>
            <li> Great Stand for a great price, I have a merker and a small sized brush so everything works out</li>
            <li> Good stand for the money. Attractive and well-made and about  a half the price of some similar ones I have seen.</li>
            <li> After weeks of looking, I finally convinced myself that I needed a razor and brush stand.&lt;br /&gt;What a great choice I made when I finally landed on the Escali stand.&lt;br /&gt;For $20 you&#x27;re going to get an amazing stand that looks great and 3 months in still looks like it did when it came out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend to anyone on the fence about buying!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to get into the world of manly shaving! It saves a lot of space in my cramped apartment sink and looks stylish! Even the ladies are impressed when they see that I have a stand for my badger-hair lather brush and chrome-plated double edged safety razor.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping this merchant is a straight shooter, what you see is what you get!</li>
            <li> Very nice, I looked at several stands before deciding on this one. Well made, nice chrome and rubber on the bottom of the base so it won&#x27;t scratch. Holds my de razor and brush perfectly. I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice stand.</li>
            <li> So great! Keeps my shaving brush clean and my razor nice and dry. Not to mention looks stylish as hell! What are you waiting for? Buy one! Also, old fashioned shaving is the way to go (old fashioned safety razor all the way). Mach 3? Naw.</li>
            <li> It was great nicer then I expected.</li>
            <li> This stand is very nice and heavy. No tipping issues and it makes the razor and brush look great.</li>
            <li> This is a nice heavy stand. I bought it for the niche in my shower. It is functional and beautiful there.</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition and is exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I had to return this because it was too small to fit my AoS badger brush. It looked nice and seemed to be a good quality product.</li>
            <li> Nice stand and fits the Merkur 34C with room and the Escali Badger brush perfectly.  No tarnishing.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted  and expected made to last  doses a great job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great looking and holds my razor and brush with ease. It doesn&#x27;t tip over because of the weight of the base. It matches my stainless steel razor and accessories in my bathroom. Great price for a great product!</li>
            <li> Good quality. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Got it fast just as described holds up both razor and brush or one or the other without tipping half the price if the shave stores happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Looks great, great price, be sure to check your brush to see if it will fit.</li>
            <li> Perfect stand for my mach 2 razor and brush</li>
            <li> This stand fit my Escali Pure Badger brush perfectly. The base is heavy and sturdy enough to keep the whole stand stable. The chrome stand is attractive but plain enough that it doesn&#x27;t draw a lot of attention; because who wants a brush/razor stand to draw attention to it. Prime delivery in less than 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a Christmas gift for my boyfriend this year. He really liked the finish. It snuggle fit his brush and fit his razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> This stand looks great and has a great solid construction.  Unfortunately my brush (on the cheaper side of quality) and my Mach 3 razor don&#x27;t fit on this stand.  The razor spins and falls right out of the prongs and my brush knot is to broad.</li>
            <li> Perfect! My razor and brush both fit perfectly. The stand is a good weight, so it stays put. I love it.</li>
            <li> This was just what my husband needed!</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> arrived in perfect shape, works great with the Escali brush.  Very sturdy and has a good solid weight to it.</li>
            <li> Great looking stand with heft. Seems to be nicely weighted and stable. Alas, my razor handle is too wide and doesn&#x27;t fit into it so I can&#x27;t use it. No one in my family shaves the old-fashioned way so into recycling it goes. Pity. Didn&#x27;t occur to me to measure my razor and brush ... now I&#x27;m gunshy to buy another. Packaged well &amp; on time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it! He&#x27;s been using it for two months now and it works great and looks really nice on the bathroom counter. It&#x27;s a quality material that doesn&#x27;t rust and very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;He uses a Merkur long handle and an Edwin Jagger best badger brush and it looks like it was designed for them which is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints!</li>
            <li> My razor and brush fit perfectly on this stand.  The base is heavy and wide, which provides excellent stability.</li>
            <li> makes life easier very happy</li>
            <li> This product has solved a problem! The stand that came with my husband&#x27;s badger hair shaving brush was flimsy and rusted very quickly. Every time I cleaned the bathroom I would clean the stand, spending more time on the old stand than the whole counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got fed up and bought this one. It is a great upgrade to my husband&#x27;s shaving set up. It has been in daily use for about one year now and doesn&#x27;t have a speck of rust. As an added bonus, this one is heavier and thus, sturdier than the last. It is no longer a hassle using because the old one would topple over at the slightest touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works exactly as I expected.  The quality is evident in the heft and finish.  A good value, and it even looks nice on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand arrived promptly. I was quite surprised at the good looks, high build quality and the solid weight  of the stand. The product picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice.It&#x27;s now the prettiest thing on my bathroom sink and helps to neaten up the area which is pretty much covered with bowls of shaving soap and creams and after-shave balms. I can recommend the stand and the seller without reservation.</li>
            <li> The stand matches my great-grandfather&#x27;s safety razor from the 20s perfectly. Great-looking. Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband to use with his merkur razor and brush.  Very happy with the quality and very fast shipping .</li>
            <li> Well made &amp; looks good.  My brush (art of shaving) does not fit as designed, however, the brush can still hang on stand where brisles meet handle.  My Fusion razor will work on stand but again not a perfect fit.  For the cost &amp; function I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Classic lines and totally functional.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor stand. It&#x27;s beautiful, functional, and just the right height. The brush holder is perfect; the razor holder is just a teensy bit too tight to *easily* insert a Gilette ProGlide (but with a tiny bit of maneuvering, the ProGlide does go right in and stays perfectly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, the price is right. It&#x27;s a beautiful razor holder, visually nearly identical to several from The Art of Shaving, but literally at 1/10th of the price. Yes, that&#x27;s the same thing for 10% of the price! Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good product ! Not had it long but very pleased !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I made this purchase to accompany my blade and brush purchase.  Sturdy to say the least, and I love how it complements my razor.  It adds a nice decorative to my bathroom countertop.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Much much cheaper than other stands.  The stand is sturdy and the construction and materials are great.  No complaints after a month.</li>
            <li> Does the job Of letting my razor dry upright, works for me.</li>
            <li> Solid construction, keeps your shaving kit in order.  Good to have on vacation.</li>
            <li> Solid product.  Looks sexy/slick in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is a nice addition to a classic razor set. It fits my Merker razor and my off brand badger brush well. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month. The shine is still strong. I was surprised at how heavy it is which is critical to keep it from knocking over. Several in my family have this model.</li>
            <li> This stand is well built I&#x27;ve had for over month no problems whatsoever. Looks great and has padding underneath.</li>
            <li> Very nice stand. It matches the Merkur razor so well they look like they were made to be a set. Nice weight, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I will have to worry about the stand/razor/brush might tip over. Time will tell if the chrome finish is as durable as it is nice looking. I&#x27;ll update this review if I run into problems.</li>
            <li> My brush (Parker - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U6P0NW?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00) does not fit in this stand.  Will be returning it.</li>
            <li> solid, heavy base. fits a majority of brushes (using my craptastic escali 10 dollar brush right now). also fits my vanderhaagen DE razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stand for my husband as a Christmas gift he was quite surprised but totally loved it. It has a very nice finish on the holders and the base looks great on the sink in his bathroom. He has now become a total user of the straight razor (been a disposable guy for years). I looked at many brushes and stands before I purchased and I&#x27;m very glad I went with this company, quality, price, and quick delivery that says a lot in todays market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s classily and sleek. Adds a nice touvh to a bachelor&amp;#34;s bathroom. Preforms it functions as well.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does.  Love these guys!</li>
            <li> High quality.  Keeps shaving equipment high and dry.  Nostalgic look and feel.  Great for badger hair brush drying and airing out the safety razor.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome working with Perella.  The stand is a great organizer for my brush and razor.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Bought this with the escali badger brush.  Price performance is spot on.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent stand for holding my Edwin Jagger badger brush and my Harry&#x27;s razor. The stand holds these two items perfectly. &amp;#34;Deluxe&amp;#34; is an apt description for this well built product.</li>
            <li> This seems high quality and meets of my goal of both holding the razor and brush while also looking non-cheap.</li>
            <li> My previous razor and brush stand had completely rusted over, so I needed a replacement. I used some Christmas money to purchase this one and so far it has lived up to my expectations with no rust or blemishes. Not much else I can say about it, it seems like a great product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan! It&#x27;s a very stylish product with a heavy base. No need to worry about it tipping over! It holds my Gillette Slim Adjustable and Simpsons Duke 2 with no issues. A month in, no corrosion or other issues.</li>
            <li> Looks great and the price was right.</li>
            <li> A simple item, but to paraphrase an old saying, the devil could be in the details. In this case the devil is missing entirely because the details have all been accomplished flawlessly. The finish is high quality, the base is weighted so that the stand has the stability that you would expect. Also note that the shaft is knurled for a sure grip and the base has a non-slip rubber-like pad to prevent slippage. My only cautionary note is that some shaving brush handles may be too wide for this (or for most shaving brush stands). The part of your shaving brush that you will use to hang from this stand should be narrower than 1&amp;#34;. This limitation is relatively standard for shaving brush stands so if your brush is thicker, you likely will need to pass on using a stand to dry your brush. Overall, I highly recommend this stand and I would buy it again or give it to a friend without reservation.</li>
            <li> I was planning to buy the stand from art of shaving but it&#x27;s was over $100.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  This item looks just as good and is great quality.  Very glad I checked amazon first.</li>
            <li> Much larger than I expected, very nice quality. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this and a safety razor for my husband as a Christmas gift. He loves his new stand.  It holds his safety razor nicely.  The chrome finish is of a good quality too.  The stand was shipped very quickly and packed very well.</li>
            <li> Looks great, fits the Escali 100% Badger Shaving Brush I also purchased and provides enough clearance for the&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor! Fast shipping, very happy and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This fits great on my counter.  It if of very good quality and functions very well.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Looks just like the picture</li>
            <li> Looks great and works perfect. Some reviewers noted that it doesn&#x27;t hold art of shaving brushes, but I had no problem. The stand fits perfectly inside our shallow medicine cabinet when I want it off the counter.</li>
            <li> Very nice craftsmanship.  Well designed, sturdy and a very nice finish.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Nice and perfect, thank you</li>
            <li> Looks Good, Well Made</li>
            <li> Looks great. Bought this along with a Merkur safety razor. It is a perfect match. Also, the base is nicely padded. This should last.</li>
            <li> Works great! It&#x27;s simple and does the trick. It is Good quality and does not  take up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> This is a solid stand. Has a nice weight to it. Very functional and straightforward, but definitely not cheap looking. It arrived very promptly, well packaged.</li>
            <li> Great quality, very nice chrome finish; looks great with my badger brush and safety razor.</li>
            <li> Had to return this stand as it did not fit the badger brush that came with The Art of Shaving Kit.  The brush holder of this stand is too small.</li>
            <li> Well made piece - Both my DE razor and brush fit perfectly in the arms of the holders.</li>
            <li> This is a excellent stand for the money, Looks good on the counter (wife-acceptance-factor was very positive), perfect for the brush and razor. Cleaning is also pretty easy, a damp cloth does all the work.</li>
            <li> Works perfect and looks great doing it. 100% happy with this stand</li>
            <li> It hold both my razor and my brush, and its pretty. Bam it does it all. The only slight down side is that the brush holder is just a wee bit of a snug fit, not a major issue.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!  its sturdy and fits his razor and brush perfectly.  Its nicer than i thought it be.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice stand. It matches so well with my safety razor. This stand has some weight to it which I prefer. You&#x27;re not going to knock it over  if it get&#x27;s bumped. It really sets off the brush and razor. I&#x27;ve had many compliments. I&#x27;m very proud of this stand. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a stand. Under priced if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Perfect product. Heavy to hold razor and brush,</li>
            <li> Its a nice stand, however, and probably due to my fault it did not fit the brush as designed. I will say, trying to find a stand for the brush I purchased was a challenge. I was able to make it work none the less.</li>
            <li> Great stand! Sturdy and good looking!</li>
            <li> Great stand. Perfect for my badger brush and razor.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected, great product that looks good and is functional. It works great for my razor and brush</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. A fraction of the cost of similar ones - read brand name ones that charge you for the name - but just as good. Solid, elegant, and very functional. I have now used it for three different razor sizes and two different brushes. Excellent.</li>
            <li> This is a great stand for the money.  I have an Escali Pure Badger Hair Brush and Merkur 34C razor and they look great on this stand.  I would recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> Does not quite fit my custom razor.  But I think I would give it a 5 star if I had a normal razor.</li>
            <li> Does the job without flaw.</li>
            <li> Nice quality chrome stand. Heavier and more solid feeling than you would expect from the pictures. You can break it down for travel by unscrewing the components. My brush and DE razor fit well. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Very clean and classy look. Great product.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast and in perfect condition as promised by the seller. Well packaged, not even a ding on the box, and it compliments my razor and brush with a beautiful simplicity. Thank you for such a smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> The stand does its job.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  I have an escali brush and a tweezerman brush. Either one fits fine on the stand.  My merkur HD fits nicely as does my merkur 1904 with plenty of room underneath.  I don&#x27;t own a long handled razor, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this stand would work fine for one.  My merkur futur does not fit on this stand.  The futur is too  thick around its neck.  The stand looks nice, feels sturdy.  I feel that it&#x27;s a very good price for the quality.</li>
            <li> Hard to go wrong with a stand, but it is sturdy and looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful, arrived in good shape, holds a Merkur Classic and separate brush without issues. Glad I went with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent gift for Father&#x27;s Day.  Beautiful,sturdy, and just right for my husband&#x27;s long-handled safety razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and perfect for its purpose.</li>
            <li> This stand is great! Reliable.</li>
            <li> I usually buy shaving cream and lotion at a Shaving Store in our local mall.  There I saw a similar stand with brush and razor, although it was prices more than twice as high and the shaving soap, razor and this stand combined.  Excellent weight to stand, steady and holds brush and razor securely.</li>
            <li> very nicely weighted.  Stays in place and nicely displays razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Well made, weighty enough to handle almost any size razor/brush combination.  Serves its purpose beautifully.  Base is non-slip and durable.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking, solid and stable even with a heavy brush on one side and a light (plastic) razor in balance. Comes apart nicely for transport. The reason for subtracting one star is that the brush holding fork is somewhat small and needs some convincing to fit the brush handle (Parker Safety Razor 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Chrome Handle), bought on Amazon)</li>
            <li> NIce! What else can you say about this beautiful brush and razor stand.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: NOT stamped &amp;#34;Made in cHINA&amp;#34;, heavy, beautiful prepwork before chroming, the only item that I can leave out on the bathroom counter that my wife doesn&#x27;t complain about.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: none&lt;br /&gt;USED WITH:&lt;br /&gt;Parker Safety Razor 100% Pure Badger Bristle&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my razor stand, shipped as advertised, will packaged thanks</li>
            <li> Nice looking and has a good weight to it so the razor stand feels secure. The finish was perfectly shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little razor/brush stand! Looks great next to my sink and holds my Weber razor and WSP &amp;#34;Prince&amp;#34; brush perfectly. The chrome is perfect and the weighted base is enough to hold the SS razor (generally heavier than most). I really love the mirror finish and its simple elegance. After several months now it is rust free (as chrome should be) and spotless. The water where I live is pretty bad and it&#x27;s never been any sort of issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly a great buy and I highly recommend it to novice and veteran wet shavers that want a solid stand for their more precious shaving equipment.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I need. Good quality, and I like its style.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty. Holds my stuff; no fit issue with the brush like some. Form and use in one.</li>
            <li> Nice chrome finish, matching my Merkur razor, and my brush fits perfectly into it. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s classy and clean and an excellent display of bathroom manliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, I went through 10 brushes in about 4 years  because I was too darned cheap to buy one of these. I would just shake the water out my brush after I finished shaving and set it down on the counter with the tips up to dry. The the brush would rot out in a couple of months and all the bristles would fall out and I would eventually just buy another in disgust at how low manufacturing standards had fallen and how our grandparents wouldn&#x27;t have stood for this kind of crap, blah blah blah you get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day as I was buying my umpteenth brush I read a review on Amazon where a guy was saying that your stuff will rot if you don&#x27;t have one of these brush stands and well let&#x27;s just say I felt really dumb. As in I wasted a couple a hundred bucks in order to &amp;#34;save&amp;#34; 30 dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the same brush for a year now (a 12 dollar tweezerman) which has lost NO bristles, yet.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and packaged well. Fits both my DE razors and brush well.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.</li>
            <li> this stand holds my shaving brush and razor perfect, adds class to the bathroom!!!  so much better then laying old razor all over the shelves in the cabinet</li>
            <li> what a great buy! Looks and works great. I have the semouge boars brush and murker long handled razor.</li>
            <li> Great stand. It&#x27;s as heavy as you would expect, and my safety razor fits nicely. My brush handle is a bit wide, and is very snug against the teeth that support it-- was easily fixed by slightly bending them. Good product, appropriately priced.</li>
            <li> Excellent safety razor and brush stand. The prongs that have a slight upward curve at the end is nice. The other stand I had, notice past tense, did not have this nice little touch.</li>
            <li> Simple, functional stand that works great with my brush and razor.</li>
            <li> Matches my vintage Gillette razor perfectly!</li>
            <li> The stand is well-built, heavy, and holds my razor and brush. Mine arrived with a couple of surface scratches. Nothing worth returning it over, but hence the reason for my four-star rating. It&#x27;s the only razor stand I&#x27;ve owned, so I can&#x27;t compare it with any other products. It is a good quality product that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The stand is made very well and looks nice with my razor and brush. I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because my Parker Safety Razor brush barely fits. In fact it will only slide into the slot when the brush is turned just right. Other reviews said my brush would fit, maybe I got a misshapen brush?</li>
            <li> Stand looks nice, fits my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor and Perfecto 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush perfectly.  It has a solid and heavy base so I don&#x27;t worry about tipping it over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of the razor and brush stands and both recipients  have loved them!</li>
            <li> Based on the price of this product, I was expecting something pretty light-weight and perhaps a bit flimsy. Imagine my happy surprise when I opened the box and was immediately impressed by the weight and solid feel. It holds my razor and brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> Nice stand and it has held up for over a year.</li>
            <li> Excellent stand. My Escali brush and razor fit it perfectly and the weighted base keeps it stable.</li>
            <li> Basic stand. Does the job just fine and the chrome finish looks nice as long as its kept clean.</li>
            <li> Great build quality. This is not your thin and light piece. This is a sturdy, well build stand that will keep your razor and brush safe when they are laid to rest after your daily routine.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Look expensive, but it&#x27;s a little small for &amp;#34;Art of shaving brush&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality and excellent service.</li>
            <li> Great product, accomplishes what I needed to do for my safety razor and brush!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, good looking product and fits my razor perfectly. The only reason I gave it three stars was because my brush didn&#x27;t fit by the handle. I turned it around (bristles up) and it&#x27;s fine. My only suggestion would be to make the brush side adjustable, somehow, so that various size brush handles could fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li> Very nice stand. Good weight to it. Bought it for my husband and he was very impressed with it.</li>
            <li> This fits my escali shaving brush perfectly. I have a Mach 3 style razor from an online retailer that sells the generic versions and it fits great in the razor side. It&#x27;s versatile enough that I think most of my razors would fit. It fits my DE safety razor well too. Looks good on the counter.</li>
            <li> The Gillett Razor does not fit. Stand is worthless.</li>
            <li> Looks great and holds a Tweezerman brush and Merkur razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - much nicer for the price than anticipated.</li>
            <li> great looking stand, well made, But....  the opening for the brush is only 25-26 mm as best I can figure and my brush (&lt;br /&gt;High Density Premium Silvertip Badger Shaving brush, WSP has a handle that needs a 30mm opening.  had to send the stand back.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on other models. This one is just right and priced right. I ordered one for my son for Christmas, and after seeing it, ordered one for myself. strong base, clean design, and very functional. Happy to recommend it. db</li>
            <li> The new Gillette Proglide POwer that tilts does not fit well. It stands in there, but it will fall down at any movement. I believe it was made for the previous razors. The new ones are wider.</li>
            <li> As described. Looks nice and does the job. Holds the brush and razor nicely.</li>
            <li> A fine piece of equipment to hold my razor and brush.  Exactly as described.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for someone and I was very pleased when I opened the package. This is well made and substantial, no need to worry about it falling over when razor and brush are hung. The finish looks as good as the finish on my bathroom faucets. The recipient of this gift loved it. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this base and as written in numerous other reviews this base is sturdy and well made and easy to disassemble.  I only wish the company would offer an extra extension that adds an inch or so to the base so that my razor (from Harry&#x27;s) could completely hang.  It does the job fine and the razor handle rest at a slight angle on the edge of the base.  And I like the fact that I&#x27;m supporting a small American company making quality products for a good price.</li>
            <li> Nice, heavy base, quality chrome plating, does  the job, and looks nice with an Escali brush.</li>
            <li> It holds my razor and brush and looks good doing it. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Works great looks nice was a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it!</li>
            <li> Very nice stand. Nice chrome finish. Didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because my brush didn&#x27;t fit. Some other people said it too, but I put it with the brush in so it fits. The bottom was nice and soft keeps it in place and doesn&#x27;t scratch counter.</li>
            <li> Looks great and works great.</li>
            <li> My Husband enjoyed his gift!! He loves it!!!</li>
            <li> Stand was useless for holding shaving brush.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it.  Nice to know it is made by a US company.  Would be great in brushed nickel too.</li>
            <li> Nice stand. Matches a razor that I already had. Made well and feels substantial. Arrived on time and was packed well too.</li>
            <li> I really like this stand.  I use an &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; brush and the newer Gillette Proglde razor. It all fits great.  The razor hangs upside down by the handle which is (in my opinion) the way it should in order to dry properly and keep moisture from settling on the blades.</li>
            <li> Stylish, well constructed, looks great on the vanity and holds my shaving brush and Harry&#x27;s razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> Nicely weighted and looks nice. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The stand looks good, and works perfectly. Seriously folks, don&#x27;t let your brush get weird, put it on a stand.</li>
            <li> Very nice stand.  Strong, high quality.  Looks very regal sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li> Looks good and gets the job done.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> this works ok to hold brush and razor.  however, the items are not very secure. They tend to slip off if any pressure is exerted.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery A+</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything negative about this stand. I see that some previous reviewers found that the size wasn&#x27;t appropriate for their razor, but I didn&#x27;t experience this problem with my Edwin Jagger. The stand holds both razor and brush firmly, is solidly constructed, and has a nice grip on the bottom so it doesn&#x27;t slide off a wet surface. At the price, definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> This a great product and helps keep my razor and brush from sitting on the sink counter top.</li>
            <li> Great Stand! I&#x27;ll only buy from you guys from now on!</li>
            <li> Beautiful stand, just what I wanted. Weighted bottom and nice chrome finish.Thank you for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I recently went back to using a conventional razor and shaving cream requiring a brush to apply. This stand makes my razor and brush easily accessible, allows the razor and brush to dry and keeps the vanity neat and tidy.</li>
            <li> This stand seems to work with anything and takes up little space. With its sleek and textured chrome, it will match anything you have in your shaving corner.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my new son in law and he loves it. He is so glad that he will not be buying those additional blades.</li>
            <li> The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush stand meets all my expectations.  The chrome finish is more than satisfactory considering the price point for this item.  Other similar stands sell for far more and are probably made by the same manufacturer in China under a different brand name.  Highly recommend this stand if you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money but this want a decent razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li> The product is fine. What wasn&#x27;t fine was being added to Perella&#x27;s mailing list and the multiple emails (at least 3 in 5 days) asking me to leave feedback.</li>
            <li> The perfect stand at the right price. Many out there the same but for biger bucks.  This also&lt;br /&gt; Matches my razor and brush set.</li>
            <li> Looks very nice on my counter next to my sink.</li>
            <li> great item, my shave brush and my razor organized !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a razor/brush stand but I was flabergasted by the prices for the nice sets. I didn&#x27;t want to spend +$100. The quality of this stand is great, it&#x27;s not too heavy, but heavy enough to stay upright on my sink. Brushes need to dry properly and this item provides that. It makes for a neat look as well. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Holds brush and razor, what more can I ask?  I understand from some reviewers that brush side doesn&#x27;t hold all types.  It holds my Tweezerman brush just fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Merkur Futur adjustable razor and a shaving brush.  I was really surprised how nice it was for the price. The razor fits perfectly on the stand.  I wish that there was something on it so it would not be metal on metal.  My Futur is gold plated and I worry about the finish being marred.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancé for Valentine&#x27;s day so he can fit his razor and Art of Shaving brush and it fit perfectly! Looks fancy sitting in the bathroom counter. The packaging was right in point, no damage to the box nor item and it arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> I am using it with the Escali brush and Edwin Jagger Ebony Gillette Mach 3 razor. Looks good and works great.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised.  I use it to store my Tweezerman&#x27;s shaving brush and Merkur 180 safety razor. Nice chrome finish. Heavy base. Great price. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stand to accompany a Merkur safety razor and the simplicity and pattern on the pole matches perfectly.  It can tip on occasion, but for the price, it does the job efficiently.</li>
            <li> This stand works great and cleans easily.  It fits my Merkur #180 Safety Razor and Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always Amazon shipped product quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002FC7B2G B002FC7B2G]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000G647Y8 B000G647Y8]]</li>
            <li> Good looking piece enhances the look of my bathroom and holds my safety razor in an optimal position.  Item was delivered quickly and is a good value.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast service!</li>
            <li> I had quick shipping and once the stand got here I can say I have no complaints whatsoever. Solid, seems to have a very good finish, and fits everything perfectly. Overall great buy.</li>
            <li> Bought this to go with the razor and brush I bought my dad for Father&#x27;s Day. This thing looks great and my dad loves it. Now I want one.&lt;br /&gt;pictured with the Escali brush and Weishi razor.</li>
            <li> Not a bad stand but I can&#x27;t get my Omega Proraso and Semogue 2000 brushes to fit on the stand. It&#x27;s a fairly narrow slot for the brush, so I assume it was designed specifically for the Escali brush lines. Can&#x27;t fault it for that, but I wish I would have known before purchasing. Price point is pretty good. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that this purchase was a gift for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day.  The good news is, I actually own one of these as well.&lt;br /&gt;The construction is very sturdy but you can also unscrew and disassemble it for travel or storage. Having been a wet shaver for almost a year now I can tell you it is always a pain to figure out how to hang your badger brush to dry while traveling somewhere.  With this incredibly sturdy and well-made stand you can very easily take it apart and bring it with you.  The fit and finish of all the parts are perfect and it even sits perfectly level on my countertop with no trouble.  I have purchased cheaper stands that the chrome came off almost immediately after getting wet but it is not the case with the stand.&lt;br /&gt;This stand is a very sound investment for anyway shape or so you can hang your brush and your razor of choice on it out-of-the-way and not have to worry about anything coming off or coming undone.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, for my husband. It is sturdy and does the job well. Price is right and shipping was speedy.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Only problem is my brush handle does not fit. I have to hang it where the handle and the knot meet.</li>
            <li> It matches my Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor. Looks good for the price. Its a nice basic stand that will work.</li>
            <li> Nice looking stand that holds your razor and brush. I was VERY disappointed when it didn&#x27;t fit my Parker best badger brush. THEN, I noticed the metal wasn&#x27;t too thick on the stand and was able to bend the opening open a little bit with a pair of pliers and it fit my brush just fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 stars because it&#x27;s not a one size fits all, but with a little love, you can make it fit your shaving supplies. Definitely would buy it again because of how nice it looks and the quality.</li>
            <li> Well made, does its job. I don&#x27;t know why i didn&#x27;t give it a 5.</li>
            <li> Classy design. Anyone that has invested money in a real &#x27;man&#x27; double-edge shaver should get one of this. It keeps your shaver off the counter and keep it dry and clean.</li>
            <li> This stand has a beautiful chrome finish and fits the brush perfectly.  However not all razors fit without sliding off.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he loves it. He also mentioned that it&#x27;s stable which is nice - having some weight to it keeps it from knocking over when you put the blade &amp;/or brush on or take them off.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I bought it for a Christmas present and the person who received it could not have been happier.</li>
            <li> My Merkur razor and Vulfix badger brush fit perfectly and elegantly on it!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;J.S. Fort Worth, Texas</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  It keeps my razor and brush together, clean, dry and neat looking.  My shaving mug fits right under the brush too.  I will likely buy my sons each one of these for a christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The Escali Razor &amp; Brush stand is an overall great purchase.  I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now, and I can already tell that it is good quality and will be with me for long time.  For the price, it is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Very nice and helps keep the brush in good condition.</li>
            <li> This is a great stand.  Simple and elegant.  Love the rubberized bottom.</li>
            <li> Well Made.. Nice addition to the shaving set..</li>
            <li> This was exactly as described, Have not noticed any pitting as of yet,will update if this happens. Did however , have to bend the &amp;#34;forks&amp;#34; up slightly . I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Stand is good quality. Slim design fits well in between space on my bathroom sink. Only complaint is my badger brush fits too tightly on it&#x27;s side. I had to bend out the clamps a bit to let it slide on. Otherwise I had to hold the stand to push the brush handle in.</li>
            <li> I waited a little while to write this review so I could live with the stand a bit and see what time would reveal of its true character. I&#x27;m happy to report that the chrome stand has held up very nicely. It accommodates my long handled Merkur razor very well, and my B&amp;B brush fits in the brush cradle perfectly. As I&#x27;m not a morning person, my shaving routine is, well, not graceful. Water and lather tend to find the recesses of my vanity often, and with ease. Knowing this, I can report that the chrome finish is even, bright, and without pitting or showing any negative signs of frequent contact with water. Water spots polish right off with a dry cloth though I use NeverDull on the stand and my very old chrome Oster hot lather machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon retailer I bought it from offered the stand at what I believe to be a very fair price and the stand was well packaged when delivered. No complaints in the least with this experience. I would recommend this item and the retailer to my friends. I&#x27;ll look to this place when I need more shaving accoutrement.</li>
            <li> Great product. Useful. Looks so nice</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my nephew, a recent college grad, and he said it was great! He loved the way his face felt after using the razor!</li>
            <li> Good value, good quality. Nice and heavy and never tips over. It even ended up matching my new razor handle by coincidence. Look forward to having this for years to come.</li>
            <li> A great stand for my brush and safety razor. I was a little sceptical that it would be able to support both, given the weight of a safety razor, but this stand is sturdy and does the job well. Two other advantages: the bottom has a little foam on it to keep it from getting damaged or damaging a counter, and it is the perfect height for drying the brush but not touch the base. All around good product.</li>
            <li> The order arrived right on time, and packaged securely,  The item was a (specifically requested) Christmas gift, and the recipient was excited about it. I have not heard of any problem with it, and from that particular recipient, no news is actually very good news!</li>
            <li> good shipping works great</li>
            <li> Solid construction, fits my escali badger hair brush perfectly. Nice shiny classy finish</li>
            <li> After shaving for over 50 years the thoughts of doing it anymore was nothing I enjoyed thinking about, it had become work.  I decided to treat myself and bought a brush, some sandalwood lather and a new chrome razor.  A week after it arrived something was missing and I added this stand. I still have to shave everyday but at least, for now, I look forward to it and that adds a little something to my day.</li>
            <li> Awesome, fits my Merkur HD 34C and VDH brush perfectly</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband and was very pleased with the product. The stand is very sturdy and sleek. He loved it!</li>
            <li> just perfect! nice stand to hold my brush and razor. Heavy base makes it very sturdy and looks great.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the shaver, stand, shave cream and brush!  The closest shave I&#x27;ve seen on him in 38 years.</li>
            <li> Great vendor. Product exactly as advertised. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Nice stand and American made!</li>
            <li> Holds my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor on one end, and my Blue Beards Revenge badger brush on the other end. Looks good with a stable base. Keeps both elevated off the counter.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done stylishly.</li>
            <li> good quality.  as expected</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gift for my husband who has a Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor. I&#x27;m very pleased. The price was lower than I anticipated, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but the stand has some weight to it and the finish is lovely. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if it will tarnish easily. The Merkur razor fits nicely, as does his badger hair brush (don&#x27;t remember the brand, but it has the characteristic chunky handle). Shipping was quick. Would recommend product and distributor.</li>
            <li> This is very well made and has a classic look. This is a must have.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I would expect for the asking price.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for my razor and brush.  Not flimsy because of the heavy base.</li>
            <li> I love my stand. It also match the Merker razor. Very happy. It is very strong and holds the brush and the razor very strongly</li>
            <li> For the first time in my 69 years I can honestly say I look forward to shaving now.  Having never used this type of razor before I was hesitant when I received it as a gift but was pleasantly surprised.  I will never shave w/anythin else.</li>
            <li> I bought this stand along with the Merkur Long-Handled Double Edge Safety Razor #180 and the SimplyBeautiful 100% Basic Badger Brush. This stand is a nice quality chrome and feels solid and heavy. The razor fits great. This particular badger brush I ordered does NOT fit into the stand near the base of the handle where one would typically hang the brush. Instead, I have to insert the brush into the stand where the brush hairs and handle meet. Not a huge deal, just does&#x27;t fit where I expected it too. Don&#x27;t hesitate to order the stand. It&#x27;s sweet!</li>
            <li> A simple and elegant holder for my Merkur razor and boar hair Parker brush. Chrome finish. Easily clean.  Soft rubber solid base.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent stand.  Bright chrome, weighted bottom, looks great, and lends an organization to my shaving stuff.  What more could you ask for???</li>
            <li> This is a good stand and would recommend it to everyone. Very Heavy.  Doesn&#x27;t even come close to falling over.</li>
            <li> After one month.....It has a nicely weighted base and appears to be assembled well. My Edwin Jagger De89lbl Chome Plated Lined fit perfectly on the stand by either hanging by the head or by the handle (between raised rings on the handle) which fits perfectly into the slot. It is like it was perfectly designed as a match set. The Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush also fits nicely on the other side. I have no reservations about recommending this stand.</li>
            <li> Looks like the picture and seems to be of a pretty good quality.  My Escali brush and Merkur razor fit on it just fine.  Product arrived on time and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor/brsh stand.  This stand is super solid and beautifully chromed.  My old fashioned razor and brush fit perfectly.  I highly recommend this product for those who are into old fashioned shaving kits.</li>
            <li> My husband actually ordered these products and he loves them.  The stand is well constructed and weighted at the bottom, and the long handled razor he ordered fits just fine.  His particular style of shaving brush does fit this stand; but, larger circumference brushes might be a problem.  Perhaps adding the inside dimension of the brush side could prove helpful.  He also seems please with his new razor.  He said the weight seemed right for him.</li>
            <li> Got rid of the can and started using a brush (Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush) and this is the perfect way to store brushes. Have not yet tried a straight razor, but will soon. NO GUTS NO GLORY!</li>
            <li> Stand does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  And looks good doin&#x27; it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, was packaged nicely and everything I expected! Great job!</li>
            <li> It holds my DE razor and hangs my badger brush to gravity dry. For cheap. So far, haven&#x27;t noticed any rust.</li>
            <li> Solid. Nicely finished. Priced right.</li>
            <li> Great construction and classic styling.  The base is just the right size to fit on my bathroom window sill, as real estate in there is at a premium.  The heft of the base is more than sufficient to keep it upright with no feeling that it would tip over.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a birthday gift and love it.  Fits my brush and razor perfectly while looking great.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got the stand and brush with old school shaving cream for Dad&#x27;s day and am wicked happy with all products. The shaving cream reminds me of my grandpa from the smell and the whole set up looks really cool on my counter. I am just getting used to the old school method of shaving now and Love it, always a close shave and it just seems like fun breaking a monotonous morning routine. I will now do this always going forward and will teach my pre-teenage boys the same. Recommend it-Love it, try it out today!</li>
            <li> Holds a brush and a safety razor just fine. It looks great. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be unstable and not too much for water marks on the metal.</li>
            <li> I unscrewed the stem from the base and turned the holders upside-down so it can hang from a wire rack in my shower. After 6 months, the item still works like a charm, and has not rusted or peeled in any way. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I can be picky, or as my girlfriend says &amp;#34;snobby&amp;#34; when it comes to certain things and I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this stand. The feel, weight and finish of this stand is very nice. As far as stands go I almost bought another but changed to this one last minute, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  This is a good value for the money.  Works well with my razor (Edwin Yagger DE89bl) and also my brush.   Finish is still holding up fine and still looks like new after a few months of use.  Still very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Quality stuff at a good price.  Get the razor, too!</li>
            <li> The stand seems very well made, sturdy, and well finished. However it is not tall enought to hold my razor. It should be taller.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Little hesitant because I had never ordered or even used a safety razor, but so happy I did. Both the razor and badger brush sit perfectly in the escali holder. Thx escali!</li>
            <li> Attractive, quality materials, beautiful finish, but the design needs improvement.  The forks should curve up at the ends to securely hold razor and brush.  Because they do not, the razor and brush are precariously supported and can easily fall off.</li>
            <li> I love the look of this brush stand. I know my husband will be happy opening it on Christmas morning.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, holds both my razor and brush and keeps the brush dry until next use.  I received the item in two days and is a quality product.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Heavily weighted at bottom.  Probably fits most brushes and razors.</li>
            <li> Be careful buying this. Does not fit all razors, so maybe only buy razors that are the same brand, in which case...Great looking stand</li>
            <li> Perfect stand. It is heavily weighted so it won&#x27;t fall over easily when putting items on it. Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> Looks great in my bathroom. The finish is identical to my razor and matched perfectly.  A must buy if you use a brush/Razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my husbands morning easier well it does not hold ALL types of razors, my husbands razor falls off ALL THE TIME! now it is more annoying to keep putting back in the stand than it was to leave it in the draw.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son for Christmas.  It fits perfectly on his counter in his RV bathroom.  He is very happy with it as it allows him to organize his space and it also looks good.</li>
            <li> This stand does a great job. While I am away from my sink, it keeps my brush and my razor from fighting each other to the death. Though, we clearly know who would come out on top of that cage match. No bloodshed on my counters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In seriousness, this stand is sturdy and does its job well for my Merkur and brush. Seems to stay clean and put very well on a porcelain counter top.</li>
            <li> Product is great. The base is very heavy and stays put. I accidentally hit it with my elbow on accident so hard it sent the razor halfway across the bathroom, but the stand barely moved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is superb. This is NOT some chintzy plastic/metal hybrid with a cheap chrome-colored paint over it. I probably couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between chrome, stainless steel, platinum, or white gold, but I can tell its not cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assume it&#x27;s made out of whatever it says in the description, because it just feels/looks/seems like good quality. It shines brilliantly when clean, and it fits my Merkur 34C razor perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It holds things above the table surface with 100% effectiveness. It&#x27;s shiny and looks good too. I place it next to lesser items in the hopes that some class will transfer from this to other things</li>
            <li> This stand is nice looking and functional.  It holds the razor well but not the brush my husband currently has.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my husband.  Clean, sharp looking and doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space.</li>
            <li> Great stand at a great price, very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Looks nice, feels like it&#x27;s good quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly what the other 5-star reviews have said</li>
            <li> This stand is the perfect accompaniment to my escali badger brush!! Great quality and very nice looking!!!</li>
            <li> A great way to display your shaving tools. It&#x27;s solid and will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Nifty little razor and shaving brush holder.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent well-made product. I would recommend the stand to everyone. It is nice and heavy so there is no fear of it tipping over.</li>
            <li> Nice looking and sturdy stand! Great value!</li>
            <li> Product as described, looks good!</li>
            <li> Was a gift that was so well received and in use immediately.  Well made, good looking, and not to busy looking.  Love the sturdiness of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a razor and brush stand with a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> fast shipment, simple steady and efficient product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but not at all cheap-looking. The base is heavy enough so it&#x27;s not tippy.</li>
            <li> I mostly got this for the badger brush. It works great for that. The razor holder is only held down by it&#x27;s feeble weight, and in my compact bathroom a jostle has made my Mercer fall off twice so far into the sink. If you are using a very small sink and have large manhands and an absent mind, be careful about smacking it. If the razor was more secure, for the price this would be perfect. Since the fault is me (If you don&#x27;t bump it it works perfect), it&#x27;s still easily four stars.</li>
            <li> this was given to a &amp;#34;first time double blade razor man&amp;#34;....he absolutely loved it!!! all set up for his morning shave!!! great product...happy customer...</li>
            <li> Great product... Fast delivery as well. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Beautiful quality and very sturdy.  Love this stand!  The base is weighted and has a nice heft, so there&#x27;s no worry of the stand tipping.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my husband for Father&#x27;s Day.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> GOOD STUFF , The appearance is striking .  The stand is funtional and Practical . I have other stands and cheaper stands but this is the best ! Give yourself a little treat . Get this one !</li>
            <li> This is a very attractive and functional stand for my brush and razor. It was very reasonably priced. And even my wife loves it! She says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;pretty.&amp;#34; What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I purchased this stand for my husband who recently took up straight edge shaving. It fits his brush perfectly and he can either support his safety razor or straight edge razor on the other side. The stand is sturdy and very well balanced and looks great in our bathroom.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for badger brush and razor</li>
            <li> This stand is perfect for my brush and DE razor. I shave in the shower, and the base keeps the center of gravity low and the rubber stops the stand from slipping. Beautiful chrome finish. Order with confidence.</li>
            <li> Great finish and looking.</li>
            <li> Works great looks great and is cheap what else can you ask for?</li>
            <li> As a long time non-electric shaver, I&#x27;ve found this product very helpful, convenient and comfortable to use.  Would recommend to any non electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to go with a brush I bought at the Art of Shaving store.  This stand cost MUCH less and is just as nice.  The only small problem was the brush holder side is a little small for the brush handle.  My husband had to file a small notch on either side of the brush handle so that it would fit in the holder.  That was ok with him and now it fits nicely.</li>
            <li> This comes in a high polish chrome and is durable.  Other stands I looked at in this caliber were easily $20 more than this.</li>
            <li> Very heavy which means very stable.  Brush would not fit in the slot at the handle but fits at the bristle part.  I new it would not fit before ordering.  Plan on turning down the brush handle to fit.&lt;br /&gt;Small price to pay to extend the life of razor and brush by taking care of them.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what I was looking for.  I use it with my Escali badger brush and Mercur or Gillette DE Razors and it functions perfectly while looking beautiful. Good size, doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space. I have not noticed any corrosion at all during the 2 months that I&#x27;ve owned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can think of is that since I&#x27;m OCD about keeping everything clean in my bathroom, the chrome base gets water spots over time, but is easily wiped off.  To be fair, I can&#x27;t think of many chrome plated items that don&#x27;t show water spots (other than some Moen and Delta faucets).</li>
            <li> Goes perfect with my Merkur razor and Escali Badger shaver brush! No regrets here. Sort of pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much to look at but it&#x27;s well made good price and my merkur model 180 pretty perfect. The base is good size not overly large but sturdy.</li>
            <li> When I saw the price of this item, I honestly expected it to be a decent enough stand but not great. In fact it is an incredibly solid, sturdy, and beautiful item that I am thoroughly pleased with. Well packaged and came very quickly.</li>
            <li> make sure your brush fits cause mine doesn&#x27;t. I guess theres no standard size. I had to bend it to make it fit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed that this razor and brush stand looks as good as it does for the price. I&#x27;ve had it for about a week and I&#x27;m liking the way it looks with my budget but nice looking Escali shaving brush and Merkur #34c heavy duty DE razor. It&#x27;s chrome finish matches the Merkur&#x27;s and it feels really sturdy in the hand. Not sure how it&#x27;ll hold up in the next months or years based on a few of the reviews by other owners here but so far I&#x27;m pretty happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So do yourself a favor and get a stand to keep your expensive razor and brush off your wet and germy counter. If you don&#x27;t need to have top of the line in everything you buy but want something that looks and feels like it&#x27;s well made then this would be my recommendation.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Great product.</li>
            <li> Fit my needs perfectly. Exactly as described. Great product! Sipped and received on time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what they said it would be, works great.</li>
            <li> Just what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> This unit is heavy enough and works perfectly with my Escali 100% Badger Shaving Brush ( ASIN BOO3WR3QS6) and my Parker 99R Super Heavyweight Safety Razor (ASINB003NTHWLU)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my brush.... Very disappointing. I bought it thinking it would, was very excited, but when I got it I was disappointed....</li>
            <li> Not surprisingly, the stand fits perfectly with the Escali shaving brush. I have a Merkur double edge razor that also fits nicely on the other side, though it can loosely hold disposable razors as well. The stand has kept its shine over the past four months and holds up solidly, providing enough weight at the bottom to keep from being easily knocked over. The stand does disassemble to some extent, better enabling it to be packed for travel.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT VALUE! EXCELLENT PRODUCT! EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE MORE EXPENSIVE STANDS! GO FOR IT... YOU WON&#x27;T EXPERIENCE BUYER&#x27;S REMORSE!</li>
            <li> Fits my Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> What can you say seems to be working well. Mine has held up for a year and i bought my dad one this Christmas so i guess i am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I really like the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand that I got for Christmas.  I use it to hold an Art of Shaving Badger Brush and a MicroTouch One DE Razor.  The Chrome matches Razor close enough, and the &amp;#34;serrated&amp;#34; detailing on the column closely matches the grip on the razor.  It&#x27;s solid and well built.  Heavy enough to stand firm and not wobble on the counter as I take the bush or razor on and off.  A bargain for the price, especially when you look at the stands pushed by AoS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish the small tongs used to hold the razor were just a few mm longer, because if I&#x27;m not careful and set my razor too quickly, the edge of the DE razor can overhang the edge of the tong and the whole thing slips out of square - risking dropping the razor.</li>
            <li> Stand is easy to clean with an attractive look. Although: buyer beware.. It will be a tight fit for an Art of Shaving brush but I made it work.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stand as a gift for my husband.  He loves it and it matches the razor handle I also purchased perfectly.  It doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of counter space and overall has a nice look and feel to it.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, and I know this is how most stands are, is I wish the brush holder was a little wider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to others who are looking for a razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect stand for shaving brush and razor.  It&#x27;s heavy and solid, so no tipping over.  I&#x27;ve tried two different razors, the Gillette Fusion and Harry&#x27;s Truman.  Both fit just fine.  I&#x27;ve only tried one shaving brush - a badger hair from Escali as well, and it fits. However, it fits perfectly on the narrow &amp;#34;waist&amp;#34; of the handle. Don&#x27;t know if brushes from other manufacturers would fit since I have no idea if the size of a brush handle is standard or not.  That&#x27;s the only thing I would caution against.</li>
            <li> Nice item to have to hold my razor and brush. Gets the job done and looks nice too. Don&#x27;t really know how people would rate this a 1-star. What do they expect from this, miracles? It does what it&#x27;s designed to do. Not sure if it&#x27;s universal for all brushes though.</li>
            <li> Looks good.  Solid construction, though the top nut came off one day when I grabbed it while moving the entire stand and it all fell apart.  The nut went down the drain, but I managed to scoop it out.  I would chalk this up to my clumsiness more than anything -- just don&#x27;t move the stand by grabbing the nut.</li>
            <li> I received a Parker 99R razor as a gift a few months ago and I am really enjoying it.  I&#x27;ve also had an Art of Shaving brush for many years so it only made sense for me to buy a stand for both of these.  The Parker razor&#x27;s handle is a bit longer than an average DE razor handle but the stand holds both it and the Art of Shaving brush perfectly.  The stand also matches the razor quite nicely.  It is very well constructed and has a nice weight to it.  I like that it has a skid proof bottom so it stays in place on my bathroom counter.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone that is interested in purchasing a razor stand.</li>
            <li> This razor and brush stand is so nice and convenient to use and look at. My husband really likes it and uses it daily. He has told me more than once how much he likes it.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly.  It is sturdy, shiny and attractive.  It&#x27;s a Christmas gift for my husband, so it hasn&#x27;t been used yet.  I think he&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Works Great. Nice, solid base. Feels like it will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, Great item, A+++++</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little razor and brush stand, easy to tuck away, weighted and balanced just right.</li>
            <li> This is a solid, welll made stand. It works well for my Escali brush and Merkur long handled safety razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent item. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Good quality product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else there is to say. It&#x27;s high quality steel with no problems at all. holds a brush and razor nicely. I&#x27;m glad I bought this exact one, but I&#x27;m sure that all the others work just as well.</li>
            <li> The stand is nice and heavy and does the job you want it to do, and it looks good while doing it.  It certainly looks solidly made and should last a long time.  Update on 7/6/2016:  I bought a second stand for a vacation house and I&#x27;m happy to report the quality of the stand is still outstanding. As I thought, the first stand is still looking good. No staining at all and still solid after 3+ years.</li>
            <li> This is a great little stand and the quality is far better than I expected or even needed.  For the price, it cannot be beaten.</li>
            <li> The stand arrived on time. My son got a new safety razor for Xmas. I realized he needed a stand. I am glad I chose this one. We were very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> Good quality and price for a beginner set up. Very satisfied with the weight of it as well. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Stand looks and feels great, it doesn&#x27;t appear cheap.  Heavy base keeps it stable.  It holds my &#x27;art of shaving&#x27; badger brush and &#x27;Gillette fusion&#x27; razor.</li>
            <li> looks great and fits my razor and brush perfectly.  This is just what i was looking for a very well made item at a resonable price and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great product. Serves it&#x27;s very simple purpose well and the product itself is well weighted and obviously built to a high quality. Looks great in my medicine cabinet and saves room too!</li>
            <li> Sturdy and attractive design. Bought it to go with an Escali shaving brush and was pleasantly surprised how well it matched the Merkur double edge razor.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good product but it was bent out of the box.  Returned and still using my old stand for the moment.</li>
            <li> Great stand, solid build and sturdy. Will have this for a long time. I got all this safety razor shaving equipment but thought I could cheap out here-I was wrong. This is needed to dry your equipment out.</li>
            <li> The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand is a quality product at a great price. Very quick delivery. I would order from this company again in the future. The stand fits my Art of Shaving brush and my single blade safety razor perfectly. The stand has a very solid and stable base, no wobble.</li>
            <li> Works good for most DE razor, including long handle Merkur, Escali Badger brush fits nice, however, the Omega Boar brush handle is larger than the brush opening so have to secure where brush meets the handle.</li>
            <li> This stand is well made and looks great. I use it for my Parker 99R safety razor and Tweezermen&#x27;s shaving brush and it works perfectly. It also holds the Edwin Jagger De89lbl safety razor perfect. It&#x27;s easy to wipe down so it can stay looking shiny. I recommend this stand to anybody who uses or is looking to buy the safety razors and brush I mentioned. I&#x27;m sure it works for many other safety razors and brushes also but I can only write about my experience.</li>
            <li> Good. Heavy and stays put. Does it&#x27;s job. No complaints so far. Appropriate height and weight. Nice chrome. Like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect! I got it as a gift for my husband and he loves it. He already had a brush and razor. It&#x27;s great quality and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Holds brush and razor perfectly well with no issues.  Simple and does the job.  It feels durable and is definitely a solid stand.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me a shaving kit from Art of Shaving for a gift.  Great gift, but it didn&#x27;t have a stand for the brush or razor.  After checking out their prices for a similar product, I was floored.  No way was I spending that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stand fit everything perfectly and is decent quality.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a month or so, but no rust and very solid (heavy).</li>
            <li> Works well! Holds your razor and brush at the same time. What more can I say? Buy on, you&#x27;ll like it</li>
            <li> Fits my Merkur razor and brush perfect. Of course with the metal it will spot and needs cleaning to look presentable.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li> The brush end is a little tight. I&#x27;d prefer it hold your brush on the handle somewhere but my Semogue Hog Brush has to be held right where the hairs start. Other than that it&#x27;s got a good weight. But I can&#x27;t tell you how well it holds on ware and tare, i&#x27;ll update if the chrome comes off or anything.</li>
            <li> Excellent delivery at a very fair price. This quality item appears as a display on my bathroom counter; it is very handy for holding my shaving brush and my razor.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband and he thinks it&#x27;s great. Works well with his new safety razor and boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and exactly as described. It works great for holding my brush and razor.</li>
            <li> Stand is very high quality, especially for the price.  It is sturdy, healthy weight so it won&#x27;t tip over.  The chrome finish is very high quality as well.  It is all that I would expect in a stand at any price.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.  High quality, as good as stands that cost 4-5 time as much.  Matches the design on  my German saver.</li>
            <li> This was a real pleasant surprise. It looks good and is well made. The base is heavy enough that everything stays put.</li>
            <li> Better than resting your razor on the sink or in the medicine cabinet. Heavy base, won&#x27;t tip over. That&#x27;s it, simple product, serves its purpose. People see it in my bathroom and they think I&#x27;m more sophisticated than I really am.</li>
            <li> Great looking stand. I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t fit my razor or brush, but both fit perfectly. Has a nice weight to it and a sturdy, non-slip base, which overall adds to the stability of the piece.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s quality is superb. It is nice heavy stainless steel that will last for years. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and recommend anyone else who is interested to do the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great stand for my razor and shave brush. Looks great and has a solid build quality.</li>
            <li> Great stand! Very aesthetically pleasing and the chrome exterior really compliments the Merkur safety razor and Parker brush. Note: the Parker brush fits tight in this stand.</li>
            <li> Works well and looks elegant with the beautiful brush and shaver set of chrome and wood.</li>
            <li> just as advertised, nothing fancy but it has a nice shiny finish and it holds my brush and Parker 99R razor and looks good doing it</li>
            <li> I have ordered this last year for my husband, this one is for my son.  Very durable and well worth the price, plus it shipped on time.</li>
            <li> My husband really like receiving this as a gift for his birthday. Afer 6 weeks, it still seems to be holding up well.</li>
            <li> Top nut will not secure the handle mechanism no mater how much pressure is applied. Will need a replacement or return the item for something else.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Better quality than I expected. bigger than I expected. Heavy. Not cheap quality. Received fast. Pleased in every way.</li>
            <li> Great razor stand, has great weight and build is perfect. Looks great on my counter with my razor and brush hanging on it! Great product, great price!!</li>
            <li> Classic and we&#x27;ll constructed. Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Great stand! Very sturdy and has some weight to it. Looks great on my bathroom counter!</li>
            <li> The stand works great. It holds the razor and brush in perfect balance and looks very classy on the counter. It makes the area clean and attractive. The stand arrived on time as advertised so it was a great gift. I will definitely shop with Perella&#x27;s again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sturdy stand for my razor and shaving brush.  Shipping and handling was prompt, and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. It came exactly as advertised. I have been using it for a few weeks now without any issue</li>
            <li> Nice looking stand, but shorter than expected.  After seeing the stand, thought it was a little over priced for what you get.</li>
            <li> Looks and works great. It fits my escali brush and all of my razors (an old Gillette and a new modern merkur)</li>
            <li> Quality is fantastic.  Everything arrived exactly as described and promptly.  I recommend measuring your shaver &amp; brush first, because mine didn&#x27;t fit, but that&#x27;s my own fault.  Everything about the product was great.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I ordered the Escali razor stand but received the Col Conk stand! I guess they must be the same product! They should have advertised it correctly on Amazon though......the reviews for the Escali seem more positive than the reviews of the Col Conk; time will tell I guess.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but upon first receiving it, it is as described, shiny and good looking and has a nice heft to it.  Happy with the item so far as it is what I expected.</li>
            <li> This stand absolutely just gets the job done.  Its a little expensive, but  it looks very good and has great heft, it just feels like a quality product.  Very solid investment, keeps my brush and razor well-situated.</li>
            <li> Seems to be pretty good product, but right off the bat it doesn&#x27;t fit the SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush that I bought at the same time. I gave this one star more than the brush, but it is much easier to make the brush more narrow rather than this larger.</li>
            <li> I have two brushed and neither handle will fit in the slot for same. The razor fits, but the shiny chrome look is not for this use as it is constantly in need of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Just what the title says. Nice and sturdy holds my razor and brush...Really nice especially for the price. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Brush and razor have to be set carefully in the appropriate place otherwise one or both will fall off. Might try bending the stand prongs a little to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold my Parker 99R razor and my brush. I didn&#x27;t know if it would fit but it fits both the brush and razor just fine. Looks good sitting on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I purchased the Escali brush and stand. The only item I need now to complete the set is the perfect Razor. The products shipped quickly and are of good quality. I would use this company again.</li>
            <li> The perfect stand for the Escali brush and Merkur razor.You must buy this stand to organize and keep your razor and brush in good shape.The Perella team has it and it&#x27;s a great buy for us guys that understand shaving.Thanks Brian and Hanna Kay for the pride you take in shipping your products as well.I would recommend you without any hesitation.The products are great and the price is much better than those mall prices.</li>
            <li> The chrome is quality, it has a nice shine that it does not loose. It holds my razor and brush perfectly without falling out. Just make sure you check out the measurements of your brush before you order this.</li>
            <li> Simple, elegant, reasonably priced.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few months and it is easy to keep clean and resists and crud build up quite well.  Also the base is solid enough so it won&#x27;t tip over easy.</li>
            <li> I needed a stand for a safety razor and the shaving cream brush.  Shipped quick, arrived with no issue, I&#x27;d buy this again if I needed to.</li>
            <li> It does the job, looks nice and appears to be well made.  The stand is long enough to hold my long handle razor which was my main concern so I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very well made, but the short handle makes it difficult to use as I would like. I may order another with a longer handle</li>
            <li> Gave this to my dad as a birthday present because he&#x27;s already using the nice badger fur brush. He LOVED it. He displays it with pride now. Well made and very shiny. Truly a classic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a brush and razor for a few years and had wanted a stand for them for some time.  My wife purchased one for my birthday and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It&#x27;s minimal design is perfect for someone that doesn&#x27;t want a lot of fussy bathroom décor; it&#x27;s solidly built and despite the chrome, I&#x27;ve had no problem with water spots or the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand probably isn&#x27;t a product to get excited over, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Stand was as described and very high quality.  Was more than I wanted to spend, but it&#x27;s certainly worth every dollar and will last years to come!</li>
            <li> Very stylish, clean and classic!</li>
            <li> Love it. Good for the price. Note to buyers: not all brushes fit, you need brushes with smaller handle which I have.</li>
            <li> It works as expected but you will see stains after a while.</li>
            <li> The Razor stand is very attractive, sturdy and functional.  Listed at a fair price with a quick delivery.  A great value.</li>
            <li> I really like this stand. It is quite sharp and is is a good quality product. My wife is somewhat particular and she also thinks it looks great and is a nice way to display the brush and razor on the counter. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This stand is great. Has a place for your razor and badger brush, and is very sleek and stylish. I was very impressed out of the box with the weight and quality of this stand.</li>
            <li> Holds my Edwin Jagger and Brush.  Looks good on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  It fits my Escali brush and Edwin Jagger razor perfectly and is very stable.  Its well made and has a flawless finish.  Item from this vendor arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Product looks good and fits my Merkur razor and brush. Great value. I&#x27;ve heard of plating issues with other stands, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It holds my old Gillette razor comfortably keeping it away from bacteria on the surface. My Escali badger hair brush fits like a glove in its holder as well.</li>
            <li> It is a well built and sturdy stand that does what it is suppose to do. It sits there and holds my brush and razor and looks pretty doing it.</li>
            <li> Well, it stands there. Very well. It accommodates the razor and brush, as it said it would. Its attractive, and so far (its new) has not loosened or in any other way done poorly.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush and razor stand. It is well made, the plating is good and should provide many years of service.</li>
            <li> Your stand and razor set is outstanding well built its a great edition to my bath  I am very pleased to have it.  Its perfect thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a good solid stand with a high quality chrome finish. The brush and razor fit well and it holds both.</li>
            <li> Not to bulky and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the bathroom. If you need something that&#x27;s just simple and does the job, this stand is it.</li>
            <li> Very practical. Helps organize the sink area.</li>
            <li> Solid stand that looks good also ... fits both my brush and razor and keeps both aired out and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Great addition to my bathroom sink!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I have not had it long enough to write a full out report, but the product seems to be sturdy and durable. We will see if it holds the test of time and rusts away or not.  Hopefully I have it forever!!&lt;br /&gt; :)</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant in purchasing a stand with out actually seeing it and verify its construction. Upon receiving this item I noticed the stand is actually very solid an has great weight distribution. The size was also a concern as I wanted to put this in my cabinet in the main bathroom and was concerned about the height, it fit perfectly. The majority of the weight is where it should be at the bottom of the stand and contains a felt piece at the bottom so to not cause damage to the surface it sits on. I can safely remove the blade or brush and leave one on their with out fear of the stand moving. Happily surprised and I can see the stand going the long distance through the years.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and in good shape. It&#x27;s got a good weight to it, so it doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap. Nice, sturdy construction. Fits a brush in easily (and most of the drips will fall onto the base of the stand rather than your counter). Husband doesn&#x27;t have a safety razor yet, but it holds the plastic guys just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. I spent a LONG time looking for creams, soaps, brushes, stands, scissors, combs, etc for a multiple-gift Christmas for the husband and his manly beard. This stand does the job and does it well without breaking the wallet. He won&#x27;t need to replace this.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy chrome stand and is a beautiful addition to my shaving kit! I highly recommend it to anyone wanting chrome accessories. It&#x27;s tall enough to hold long handled safety razors.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect as I&#x27;d just gotten into this whole &#x27;wet shaving&#x27; thing. The stand isn&#x27;t anything special, but it holds my brush and safety razor, is nice and shiny, has a weighted base that keeps it stable, and the bottom of the base has some kind of felt covering to keep it from scratching surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My roommate ordered the same one after seeing mine. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a stand for their razor/brush.</li>
            <li> Though, I&#x27;m not sure what all I was really expecting from a razor stand. I&#x27;m getting my husband started on wet shaving and included this in the &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34; I put together for him. This stand is nice and heavy. It fits the Escali badger hair brush and Merkur DE razor I bought very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stand to hold a Mercur DE Razor and an Escali Badger Brush. The stand fulfills my needs and looks pretty stylish as it does. My opinion is based upon a month of ownership, so I can&#x27;t speak to longevity. I will definitely be back to update my review if something unexpected or catastrophic changes my opinion of the product, so if you don&#x27;t see an &#x27;update&#x27; section of my review, I&#x27;m still pleased with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid - The stand has a substantial feel. There isn&#x27;t anything about it that makes me think &#x27;cheap&#x27; even though it is relatively inexpensive. I even threw it in my toiletries bag over Christmas, and it bounced its way through the trip without showing any sign of damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shiny - It is chrome, so it matches a chrome-handled Razor well. It&#x27;s not art, but as a utilitarian piece, it&#x27;s not going to attract any negative attention while it stands on the vanity top. You will have to keep it clean because drying water is likely to leave spots, but there isn&#x27;t much work required in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well Weighted - It is sturdy enough to hold one or both pieces its designed for. I&#x27;ve never had it tip, and I don&#x27;t have much concern of knocking it over even if it sits near the edge of the surface. That said, bear in mind the price - you&#x27;re not going to get anything miraculous, especially at this price point - but know that you don&#x27;t have to spend more to have confidence in your stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus! - The bottom of the base is covered in a nice finish that makes me think it&#x27;s soft enough to not scratch quality vanities (I can&#x27;t be sure, because I certainly don&#x27;t have a great one!) but it doesn&#x27;t seem porous enough that I&#x27;m worried about water soaking in and eroding the base. Only time will tell how it holds up, but it seems great!</li>
            <li> Yes.&lt;br /&gt;I own this.&lt;br /&gt;And it is good. Shiny. It holds my razor and brush like a pro. The bottom has a nice weight to it so it won&#x27;t wimp out on you when you need it most.&lt;br /&gt;It got to me super quickly too.</li>
            <li> The stand is sleek and tall with a heavy bottom to properly hold both brush and razor. It fits his brush perfectly, but I read the other reviews to see which size fit best. Perfect for keeping things organized and keeping the brush in good condition by properly drying.</li>
            <li> The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand is a very nice way to store your shaving tools. The stand is nice and sturdy, and it was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> 👍excellent product and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> While this is a beautiful brush and razor stand, it is designed specifically for the Escali brushes.  I was dismayed that it would not accept the brush I am currently using.  Buyer be ware...this is a good product, but not a universal product.</li>
            <li> Works reasonably well, no faults, chrome plating is good. gets the job done Holds my Gillette 1960 Super Speed very well and Brush, If only it had a tooth brush holder as well, then less clutter on sink, wishful thinking. Great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what its worth, I use &#x27;feather blades&#x27;, excellent. And leave Gillette mostly open on &#x27;Escali Stand&#x27; to dry out.</li>
            <li> Keeps my shaving brush high and dry and the razor as well.  It&#x27;s important to let the brush drip dry to prevent the brissles from falling out.  This works perfectly.  Sure, it&#x27;s not fancy but it does the job and that&#x27;s all that I needed.  Smudges clean off easily with a paper towel.  If you want it shinier, a little household cleaner will do the trick.  Unless you got an unusual or oversized brush or razor it will fit it this stand.</li>
            <li> It is a great stand!  Holds my horsehair bristle shave nation brush perfectly as well as my Parker 22R razor without it hitting the base of the stand.  Highly recommend for both the quality and the price point (think I paid roughly $15).  My attempt at a wire coat hanger do it yourself stand, did not work ;)</li>
            <li> A great stand. Sturdy enough. Holds razor and brush beautifully. Manufacturing quality is great and finishes are neatly done. You definitely get more than you pay for.</li>
            <li> After 5 years using an electric razor, and more than 30 years using multi-edged blades that cost so much, I decided to go back to the double edge safety razors of my youth.  A month ago I bought an Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand, to go with a new Edwin Jagger razor (De89lbl Double Edge Safey Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, $34.00), Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush ($12.95), Proraso Shaving Soap, and a Cassani Fogless Shower Mirror.  So far, they have all been worth 5 stars.  The Edwin Jagger razor feels solid, but not heavy, and fits comfortably in my slightly above average size hands (I wear size XL dishwashing gloves, and can squeeze into size L when necessary). The Escali Razor and Brush Stand holds the Jagger razor and Escali Badger shaving brush securely, and the unit is well-balanced, with a base heavy enough to be very stable as it sits on the edge of a soap shelf in the shower.  The Badger Shaving Brush easily works up a good lather with a very small amount of Proraso Shaving Soap (just a brief swill of the wet brush in the soap tub is more than sufficient).  The Cassani mirror is truly fogless, as promised, and hangs lightly from the Cassani hook which I have attached beneath my shower head.  (There is also a hook to hold a razor, which I use to support the Jagger razor as necessary while I&#x27;m shaving, before returning it so hand in the Escali Razor and Brush Stand.  All in all, I am very pleased with all of the purchases.  I also purchased 3 different blades - Wilkinson Sword Classic, Derby Extra ,and Feather Razor.  Two weeks with the Wilkinson was more than enough.  Actually, after 2 days my daughter asked if I had a rash on the lower part of my neck, so I went back to using an electric razor on my neck until I finished with the Wilkinson.  I thought I might be reacting to the Proraso Shaving Soap, but I had no problem using Proraso with the Derby Blade.  The Derby Blade has been great, and after nearly 3 weeks with 1 blade, I am shaving with less nicks and more comfort than I did with the Wilkinson at any time.  The Feather Razor blades have not yet arrived, apparently having to ship from Hong Kong, or somewhere in the far east.</li>
            <li> Just right.  Very nice-looking, solid, weighted stand.  Worth the price; should keep for years.  Fits Tweezerman shaving brush and probably most, if not all, double-edged razors.</li>
            <li> Wonderful modern looking stand at a great value...</li>
            <li> Stand has some weight to it,  fits my brush and razor handle perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a second one for my son..&lt;br /&gt;Would recomend.</li>
            <li> Stand has a nice weighted bottom that&#x27;s great for being in an area where it might get knocked over. Would recommend</li>
            <li> Well made and matches my merkur razor and badger brush.</li>
            <li> The stand is soldily built and looks nice. The one drawback is it doesn&#x27;t hold my razor very well. I currently use a Gillette Mach 3 and it usually falls off right away. My shave brush fits on the stand perfectly. Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> This is a great stand for my razor and shaving brush.  Organizes things well and is very smart looking.</li>
            <li> As some other reviews have mentioned not all brushes fit perfectly but most should at the bristles if not by the base. I took mine to the garage, wrapped the brush end in a cloth, and with a hammer taped the prongs out a little bit. My brush ([[ASIN:B00B1TKY8C B00B1TKY8C]] now fits on the stand hanging by the base as I only needed 1mm or so extra width. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Does what you would think. After a couple of weeks of daily use I feel that the prongs on the razor&#x27;s side of the stand could be a little longer, but other than that it works well.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new brush and razor stand. We could not be more pleased. We definitely highly recommend this brand if you&#x27;re having trouble choosing.</li>
            <li> The stand is well made but the design needs improvement, big-time. Why it isn&#x27;t made with adjustable openings so it can accommodate ALL razors &amp; brushes is beyond me!!!</li>
            <li> This product is well designed, well made, and well packaged. It hold my razor and brush perfectly, keeping them out of the way as I clean up after shaving. I recommend this product wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li> The chrome keeps it looking nice.  It also keeps me organized.  After each shave I rinse and dry best I can then hang it on the stand.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Item came on time. Assembled and in excellent working condition. You cannot ask for anything more. It fits perfectly in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Looks and works great with a multi blade handle. Glade I bought it.</li>
            <li> this stand is very sturdy and looks awesome holding my brush and safety razor.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described. Feels weighted, balanced and durable. The transaction was superb and it&lt;br /&gt;would be a pleasure to do business again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a present and it looks great. looks well done and very shiny and stylish. My only recommendation is to get the Escali brush to match with it or make sure your brush dimensions will fit in the holder cause it seems it may be different.</li>
            <li> This product is great, sturdy, and adds a level of organization to my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This stand feels like it is constructed well and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Looks great with the Mercure safety razor as the textured chrome matches. It&#x27;s heavy and sturdy. I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Very nice stand looks great</li>
            <li> I love it my Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush holder.  It came packaged well and looks great. I started using a brush because I got tired of wasting the shaving gel. Needed a brush stand.</li>
            <li> Just started with a DE Razor and a stand was next on the list of purchases. I was looking for something that looked nice and didn&#x27;t cost me an arm and a leg and boy did I find it with the Escali Deluxe! It has a nice weight to it and looks really nice on the counter, I haven&#x27;t had it for very long but the chrome looks like its decent quality and not likely to chip or flake off.</li>
            <li> This stand is well made and attractive with the chrome finish. It holds my razor and brush nicely, keeping it organized and dry for the next use. As razors become more and more ridiculous with up to 5 blades to gum up at a cost of $20 for 4 blade replacements, I think a lot of men will look at the simplicity of a single blade for only pennies each, and actually learn that shaving with a brush, shaving soap, and a single blade can be an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li> This stand is awesome!  First off it looks really good!  Great chrome finish and fits my DE razor and brush perfectly.  The biggest issue with stands is the weight of the stand and tipping over.  This has a good amount of weight in the base for stability, so that is not an issue.  I highly recommend this product!  Great price also!</li>
            <li> Solid construction.  Very satisfied with this stand.</li>
            <li> After being convinced to move from the skin irritation of shaving with an electric razor, I bought some top quality shaving cream along with Escali&#x27;s Pure Badger shaving brush.  Now my skin feels much better while my razor and shaving brush look stylish on this stand sitting on my bathroom counter.  I was hoping that this stand would be a quality stand - not a flimsy thing that would look cheap or tip over  - and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It&#x27;s not only functional, but looks amazing!</li>
            <li> As shown &amp; advertised. Could not be happier</li>
            <li> This stand is perfect for my husband&#x27;s razor and shaving brush. It is also heavy so it doesn&#x27;t get knocked over easily, nice and shiny so it looks clean, and not big and bulky so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on our small space. It was boxed nicely for wrapping and arrived pretty promptly.</li>
            <li> Nice piece and sturdy but my husband&#x27;s Art of Shaving Brush didn&#x27;t fit on this. We had to return it.</li>
            <li> First time Brush Shaver, ordered this stand for my brush and razor. It seems well made and looks and feels like its going to last. The base is well weighted and the rubber bottom keeps it from sliding around. Minor complaint is from my wife, she doesn&#x27;t like the chrome bottom that she has to keep cleaning the water spots from sink splash that mar the looks, but I WILL BE TRAINED to wipe it off after every use. Oh well what we males have to endure to keep peace...HA HA. I am satisfied with the purchase and would not hesitate to recommend it. BTW I still use my old Trac II razor and it fits on the stand.</li>
            <li> Works great. Plenty solid and the base is heavy enough to stand upright with no worry of tipping over.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m perfectly happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I could never store my brush properly between uses.  The same for the razor.  This item solved the problem neatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much so that I bought three of them - one for home, one for a boat, and one for another home often visited.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and well balanced for a brush and multiblade razor. Not so much for a DE blade. Looks great and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> First time I have had one of these.  It works great.  Allows brush to air dry and keep its shape and keeps bathroom organized.</li>
            <li> Came the way I was expecting it to look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;Lived up the the advertising. Pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Update: Stand continues to look really great with my chrome Merkur razor and wood Badger Brush. The stand is solid and is heavy enough at the bottom to keep it from tumbling over. Finnish has remained true, no rust or flaking of the chrome. and it Really adds to the bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> Has performed very well and seems sturdy.  Would give 5 stars but have not had a chance to see how well it stands up to time. I would recommend this to all looking for a good affordable stand.</li>
            <li> Strong, sturdy stand with a good look and balance. I&#x27;ve seen similar model going for $100 which are no better. Note that the razor handle is made for a Mach 3 or higher. I use a Sensor Excel and without propwer placement it will fall off. Not a short coming of the product as these are made for the larger razors.</li>
            <li> Still shiny after a year in the bathroom. Holds my razor and brush well. Looks great.</li>
            <li> For someone to manufacture a product to hold brushes, one would think they may consider the average size of a brush handle. Someone didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Well constructed and does what it says it will do. Wish they would make this in a brushed stainless steel to prevent the water marks after drying, but other than that, holds product well.</li>
            <li> Very nice stand. It has a good solid weight with a rubber grip pad underneath. It does not tip over. It polishes up very nicely and fits my razor and brush perfectly. I bought the brush from the same company, but the shaver from somewhere else. It is well constructed with solid metal pieces. The two-prong hanger metal is not thin and it would take some force to bend it. Very nice stand indeed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this stand.  Very solid...exceeded my expectations.  It&#x27;s a classic look and is functionally perfect at a great price.</li>
            <li> My husband was very impressed with this chrome stand.&lt;br /&gt;It is well made, strong and will not slip and slide on the counter&lt;br /&gt;at the bathroom sink.  Also, his shaving tools are convenient  now.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy stand. Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I have a Merkur Long Handled and a Parker Brush and fit perfect. Really good quality, the shipment fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a great price.  Impossible to find locally.</li>
            <li> Works great - looks stylish.  Would definitely buy again and recommend to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive and nice looking razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li> Quickly received what I expected. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Tall enough to hold long handled razors and most brushes, base plates is well weighed.</li>
            <li> strong stand and balanced.  It&#x27;s actually bigger than what is depicted.</li>
            <li> Really good stand. Would recommend it to anyone looking for sturdy and elegant razor stand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my product</li>
            <li> Beautiful stainless steel. Heavy, solid construction. Perfect stand for my safety razor and brush. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It arrived exactly as presented!</li>
            <li> I wanted something to hold my brush and shaver, and look good too.  This handy item did the trick!  Sturdy and elegant looking.  Adds a little &#x27;class&#x27; to my bathroom :)</li>
            <li> Great stand. Looks nice and it beats the higher priced version. I bought it for my muhle razor and it fits perfect.</li>
            <li> Great price on a well made stand. Seems to be solidly built and fits my Edwin Jagger perfectly. After switching to a safety razor, I have been loving my morning routine and the results I&#x27;ve been getting compared with how I used to shave (combination of electric razor and Gillette Mach 3). Closer shave and noticeable reduction in razor burn and skin irritation.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is second to none. After several searches I was able to locate exactly what I was looking for.If you are looking for a quality product, dont look any futher.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely stable and won&#x27;t fall over but it doesn&#x27;t hold my razor (merkur 34C) very tightly because it&#x27;s chrome on chrome and the prongs are horizontal with barely any upward lip at the end. So if I don&#x27;t knock it, my razor won&#x27;t go anywhere. If I do, there&#x27;s very little stopping my razor from falling</li>
            <li> Great stand. The knurling on the stand part matches my Feather razor perfectly. They look like they came as a set. The base is nice and heavy, and has never tipped over when trying to replace or take the razor or brush from it. The chrome finish is super shiny and seems well built overall. Great price. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works well, weighted base is hard to tip over, holds shaving stuff like a brush stand should.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to hold my DE razor and brush.  Works very nicely, looks great and easy to keep clean.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve a man is in you home, then this &amp;#34;Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand&amp;#34; the best thing he could find in his toilet arsenal. I bought a set for Father&#x27;s Day. But prices for razor and a brush stand were very high in specialty stores. But here I bought almost free. Although I did not find a difference in quality between the stand from the store and stand from the Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to hang my Merkur 34c and Escali shaving brush from to keep them in good condition.  This Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush stand fits the bill exactly.&lt;br /&gt; Heavy base, nice finish and my razor and brush fit perfectly.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Got it for just under $17. Great deal. Very, very happy with this purchase. Sleek and functional</li>
            <li> Ideal for my merkur safety razor and cheap badger brush combo. Low profile enough to fit on a small shelf. screw on base feels solid and of similar construction to the merkur short handle that sits on it, so they make a lot of sense together. Quality item.</li>
            <li> hasnt failed me yet! Looks clean. Does the job well.</li>
            <li> Functional an beautiful us how I would describe this stand.  The bright chrome finish is flawless and my razor and brush fit perfectly. Delivered on time at very affordable price. I highly recommend this stand to anyone who uses a safety razor and brush.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent, sturdy Razor and Brush stand.  The only problem I have is with the width of the opening where you hang your brush to dry.  I use a few different Boar brushes, each of which have different diameter knots and/or handle styles.  Of the five brushes I have, only two fit this product.  It would be better if the opening was larger to accommodate different brush widths.  You are not able to spread the tines of the &amp;#34;fork&amp;#34; so this product has a limited use. I have since purchased another stand where the tine is &amp;#34;spreadable&amp;#34; which accommodates all of my different brush sizes.</li>
            <li> Very high quality stand, I was surprised by the weight of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain brushes do not fit in the brush holder (if their handle is too wide) so make sure that your brush fits the dimensions of the opening.</li>
            <li> Great product. Sturdy material, definitely didnt skimp on quality</li>
            <li> Keeps my brush and razor off the counter.</li>
            <li> Looks good and steady.  Quick shipped.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, as described.  Good, solid weight, tall enough to hold a long-handled safety razor, and nice and shiny. No complaints from me.</li>
            <li> I purchased  my chrome deluxe razor about 2 months ago along with the chrome brush stand.  Every man should experience the luxury of a &amp;#34;Badger Hair&amp;#34; brush applied lather and the crispness of a double blade shave.  The stand makes for a convenient storage of both the brush and razor...very nice...good quality.</li>
            <li> GREAT!  EASY TO CLEAN, LOOKS NICE ON THE COUNTER, BASE KEEPS THE STAND FROM TIPPING.  I WOULD ORDER THREE IF I HAD 2 MORE FACES :-)</li>
            <li> This stand is inexpensive, but is quality built.  The base is weighted so it won&#x27;t tip over easily.  The knurled shaft adds a touch of class, and of course the stand does its job of holding your razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Could be a smidgeon more base-heavy, and it would be nice if the razor side worked with different razor brands.  All the normal store-brand ones we&#x27;ve tried (haven&#x27;t tried Escali) slip right out.  However it keeps the badger brush dry, fluffy and aerated very well.  No more rot.</li>
            <li> I bouth this razor and brush stand after reading many reviews and looking at several different kinds. I settled on this one due to it&#x27;s simplicity, clean looks and good ratings. I was not disappointed. The bottom is weighted to keep it from tipping over and the height is perfect for holding a badger shaving brush and pretty much any quality shaving razor. I also like the fact that it is stainless steel and is easy to clean. My badger shaving brush fits perfectly in the holder and my Merkur razor hangs just at the right height. make the purchase if you want a great quality stand and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> I have owned one for almost two years. I am very pleased with the quality and bought 4 more as gifts to the groomsmen in my wedding. I like that every part of the stand is detachable as I was able to engrave initials on the base plate.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as described so no question on giving a full rating. Compact nice design fits my brush and razor properly..I feel its a good choice and recommend</li>
            <li> I ordered this Chrome Razor and Brush Stand for my son and I was looking for a quality product. This product exceeded my expectations.  It is solid, nice look, well made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice little piece of hardware that helps keep my shaving gear organized.  Well built and looks good.  &#x27;Twas a smart purchase!</li>
            <li> Great  product good quality would recommend this product. Works well does not take up a lot of space easy to maintain</li>
            <li> well made heavy duty stand. Base is heavy enough it stays put, which is all you can ask of an item like this.</li>
            <li> great stand for razor and brush, looks nice and water doesn&#x27;t really stain on the surface, very cool.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put a lot of thought into this product other than, price, will my razor and brush fit and will it last over time.  It has a solid enough weight to it and maintains balance when brush and razor or just one are hanging.  Both fit perfectly in the slots (Merkur DE and Escali Basic Brush).  If any discoloration or rusting occurs, I&#x27;ll be back to update this.</li>
            <li> This is one nice stand.  The heavy base makes it tip-over proof.  Nice bright finish and it fits quite nicely in the med cabinet.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son-in-law and he was very pleased with it.  I can&#x27;t say a lot more as I have not seen the item.  But, if he is happy, I am happy</li>
            <li> Received on schedule.  Quality product, the materials are solid and have heft.  The brush holder held the two size handles I had, and my single blade safety razor fits nicely.</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase, was as described, promptly shipped, would buy again. Item is well designed, sturdy and works well.</li>
            <li> Shaving brush, shaving cream and stand all satisfactory, as expected.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, very happy with my purchase. Looks sweet on the sink.</li>
            <li> Works well with my merkur and eShave brush. I do not have problems with it losing gloss or anything like some other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Very nice stand for the price.. well constructed and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Bought this to have a place to hold my Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Merkur long handle razor. Nice weighting, does not tip over when you remove one or the other. The knurled center piece is knurled just like the razor, looks nice.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Just as advertised. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This thing is built tough! It holds my Merkur razor and badger-hair brush and is steady as a rock. The heavy-metal construction leads me to believe I&#x27;ll have this piece for quite a while. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is solidly constructed, looks good on my sink and holds my Edwin Jagger Safety Razor and Escali Brush well. It has not rusted at all and with a quick wipe any water marks disappear. What more can I ask for?</li>
            <li> I had to bend it a bit to fit my art of shaving brush but once that&#x27;s done its just fine.</li>
            <li> Like the quality of the product, however it could be priced cheaper than it actually is. Would recommend it anyways.</li>
            <li> My husband is starting to use his brush and shave cream more and this is just what we needed.It holds the brush on one side and the shaver on the other. It looks exactly like the picture and the plating is well done. Shipment came very quickly.Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Have been using this stand for about a month now.  Like the other say, it&#x27;s sturdy and the finish is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;My Merkur DE razor does tend to sit a little off center sometimes because the posts that secure the blade in the shaver head&lt;br /&gt;pushes the razor to one side or the other when in the stand.  It&#x27;s no problem, unless you have OCD.  The brush fits perfectly though (a Parker).  Quite satisfied, especially since it&#x27;s priced nicely.</li>
            <li> A great addition to the bathroom decor. Loving it.</li>
            <li> The stand came as described and fits the escali brush very well.  It looks sharp in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived a day before it was supposed to, which is always a plus!!</li>
            <li> I originally thought that having a stand like this for my safety razor and brush was a luxury. However, it soon dawned on me that it is a necessity. After perusing several options, I settle on this relatively inexpensive one ($18.00). It serves it&#x27;s purpose well so far. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have a shaving brush and safety razor that fit perfectly on the Escali Deluxe Stand.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, classy, and does the job right. My brush and safety razor fit into it perfectly. Well done.&lt;br /&gt;Literally I opened the box, felt the weight, and was like hells yeah, awesome.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful and functions exactly as expected. Shipping was quick, no problems at all. My roommates were all jealous and now I feel like a gentleman when my brush is hanging off of it rather than a rubber band.</li>
            <li> Fits my Dorco DE Safety Razor and my Omega brush perfectly. Looks amazing on my counter. Nice weight and construction quality. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It has just been perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand. I put it deserved 5 stars and would recommend it others. Brushes and razors fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> The stand looks great, is easy to clean and fits the Merkur Long Handle DE perfectly- what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> It is &amp;#34;fantabulous.&amp;#34;  Works great.</li>
            <li> This stand must have been made from the same stone that held Excalibur. Rock solid craftsmanship with a sturdy base. If for some reason I&#x27;d grow so manly to require two razors to shave at once, I would buy another Escali stand without even blinking. I would feel confident in tying up a horse to this stand and it would not tumble.</li>
            <li> I wanted to take some time to learn how to use this stand. It is attractive and sturdily built, but the base, although adequate, is on the light side. I am using a big Merkur adjustable razor with a long handle and had to learn the technique of keeping the razor on the stand. It is just big enough, and I have handled it enough so that it is no longer a problem. The brush side is perfect for my brush and allows for good drying and retrieval.&lt;br /&gt;This item is an excellent product at the price. Looks good and with practice handles the chore of holding a razor and brush where they can dry and be available very well.</li>
            <li> simple, attractive, shaving system stand. does exactly what it is suppose to do.brush and merkur long handle fits very nicely.</li>
            <li> Great product... well made, fast shipping.  A minor joy to look at !</li>
            <li> Very good quality stand to hold a razor and brush. Feels solid and weighted well, and the material feels solid too (not cheap metal). Used it with the Seki Feather safety razor and the Escali Shaving Brush. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Solid construction and a perfect aesthetic match with my Merkur 34/178.  Snugly nestles a Omega 13109 Badger Brush in either vertical orientation.</li>
            <li> awesome little stand! has a great weight to the base and my Edwin Jagger fits perfect on it</li>
            <li> No more shaving brush on the counter. No more of my Husband yelling that we used his razor instead of our own. He loves this little stand, and he can keep his stuff inside the medicine cabinet now.</li>
            <li> This really pulls the entire set together. You won&#x27;t be sad you purchased this. The chrome works really well. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking.  Received it and very pleased.  Nice chrome finish to match razor and bowl.  Highly recommend this for the wet shavers!</li>
            <li> Fit my Merkur HD blade and my boar hair brush perfectly. Was well packaged and it looks very class as well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Only 4. Stars because I had to buy a new badger brush with a smaller handle that would fit. I originally had a Prorasso chrome handle brush and it was way too thick for the slim slot on this stand</li>
            <li> Adds a classic yet contemporary look to my bathroom while being very functional. Should last many years paired up with my Merkur Barber Pole razor and badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> solid product, fits escali brush and merkur long handle perfectly.  no wear or rust issues after 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I like this stand very much.  It is simple in design, not too large, and it is functional.  It seems to be made well and I think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Okay got this 2 days ago as a gift, so far I love it. It&#x27;s much sturdier than it looks online. The base has a nice heft to it so you don&#x27;t have to be concerned about it being top heavy.  One disclaimer -Discovered that my shaving brush that came in the &amp;#34;art of shaving&amp;#34; starter kit is too small to hang (Oh darn so now I have go and look for a new brush! I found one that was reviewed by another Amazon customer who said the brush fit perfectly in this razor/brush holder). I&#x27;ll come back and let you know if my first assessment was correct.  The brush is supposed to arrive in 2 days.  Thanks sweetheart for this wonderful gift!</li>
            <li> Just started to get into shaving using a brush and razor after years of going it electric.  Bought this stand as I was getting tired of having all of my things laying around.  The stand actually has a nice weight to it, which is nice since you don&#x27;t have to worry about tipping it over.  I was really surprised that the stand came as one unit (no assembly required) and no noticeable screws of any kind.  I was a little concerned that the unit would twist and unscrew itself after so many uses, but its sturdy and secure.  The only downside is that my brush didn&#x27;t easily fit into it, though I&#x27;m pretty sure my brush is oversized and probably wouldn&#x27;t fit in any stand.  Overall a well-made, stylish stand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else to say about this stand. It holds my razor and my brush just fine. That&#x27;s all. :)</li>
            <li> The stand looks and feels of high quality. It is well-balanced and holds razor and brush without tipping or wobbling. Also, racking and removing the razor and brush is easy to do. It looks nice on the counter. It is an excellent value for the price. I bought one for myself and, after using it for a while, I bought three more as gifts.</li>
            <li> The product lived up to my expectations. It&#x27;s a good value for its price. Base is heavy enough so it doesn&#x27;t tip. The chrome finish looks decorative and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The stainless steel is beautiful and rugged.  Holds my Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush (that I purchased on amazon) perfectly as well as the Parker 99R Long Handle Super Heavyweight razor also purchased on amazon.  The slight weight on the bottom helps keep it from shuffling around the bathroom sink.  I am extremely satisfied with the stand.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, the razor side may not hold your razor and prevent it from falling out.  However, this holds my Tweezerman brush and Parker 22R razor perfectly.  I&#x27;ve tried putting my Gillette Mach 3 in the holder and it won&#x27;t hold the razor though because of the shape of the razor cartridge.  My only regret is not realizing that my Van Der Hagen Luxury Shave set came with a perfectly adequate (and very space efficient) razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li> Great for safety razors and brushes. Solid and steady, nice finish.. Not much more to say but there is a minimum word count for reviews</li>
            <li> Overall, I like it - it looks great and and is solid and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush side is a bit tight for some of the brushes, but totally usable.</li>
            <li> Holds my Escali brush and my mach 3 razor! Base has a foam bottom so it won&#x27;t rust or slip on your counter. (can&#x27;t tell that from the picture).</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Merkur long handled safety razor and a shaving soap brush.  I started to research stands for the safety razor and brush at &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; and was shocked to find out that they wanted to charge upwards of $50+ for a stand.  I searched on Amazon and found this Escali stand for half the price that &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; store wanted for their stand.  With my Amazon Prime account I received this item with 2 day shipping.  I can honestly say that the quality of the Escali stand is right on par with the overpriced one at &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34;.  It is easy to clean and holds both the razor and the brush securely.  This was definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful stand indeed.  The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t accommodate my favorite brush... :-(&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the shaving community could get together and standardize brush handle size.</li>
            <li> Good finishing. Beautiful chrome and sturdy look. Firm stand and well sized holders for the razor and the brush. A must have for gents who enjoy a morning shave.</li>
            <li> As advertised very satisfied with the quality of the product</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected - high quality, razor and brush fit perfectly, looks good in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> A quality product that works.  This same product is used by a vendor at our Farmer&#x27;s Market to sell his hand made brushes.  Fast service.  No concerns.</li>
            <li> Built really well. My shaving brush is too large at the handle to fit in the holder (Dr. Harris), but if fits at the base of the brush. This holder should probably be priced higher for the quality, but to our benefit, its under $25.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice stand and does the job, but WAAYYYY overpriced.  Very utilitarian.  Seems like a nice chrome plating...time will tell</li>
            <li> This stand looks good.  It matched my already owned razar well.  The brush fits a little snug, but it does fit.  I like this stand.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome razor stand that holds my badger brush and razor. It keeps clean and shines up really nicely with just a damp cloth. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> very well built, heavy duty.</li>
            <li> made of heavy metal although it picks up grind quick it shines and does the job great although it doesn quite let your tools sit flat as the fork like prongs flare up a tad bit</li>
            <li> Just received the stand today. It is much more sturdy and heavy than I expected, in a good way. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it four stars is because my Parker razor doesn&#x27;t hang properly. The razor side needs to be about an 1/8&amp;#34; longer. My Merkur long handle fits perfectly. Otherwise quality is great.</li>
            <li> Construction is fine.  It doesn&#x27;t hold a standard Gillette razor, neither does it hold baxter badger brush .. fairly useless.</li>
            <li> Works great with my razor and badger. I use the Art of shaving standard badger and dollar shave club mid range razor.</li>
            <li> it is smaller that I thought.</li>
            <li> The stand came as advertised. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> A terrific razor and brush storage stand. Classic and functional, this stand performs the basic task of allowing your brush and razor to dry without concern for deforming the brush or retaining moisture in the razor. Properly weighted to be a stable platform. Great look. Well done.</li>
            <li> Works like it is suppose to.  Good weight to it.  Holds my Merkur 33C fine.  Could use a little more length on the razor side to hold the razor better, but the Merkur 33C stays fine.  Holds the Escali brush I bought from amazon fine as well.</li>
            <li> This stand is really beautiful and has a nice padded foam bottom. It&#x27;s easy to clean and nicely weighted at the bottom.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely stand. The chrome is sleek and matches any modern decor and it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do: hold your brush and razor in a vertical position so it can dry. This is extremely important for the brush so that it does not get dirty.</li>
            <li> this was bought for my son-in-law and he did a lot of research before having me order it, he is very pleased with it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this stand if you have a Van Der Hagen brush. It will not fit. It also will not fit Mach3 razors or similar razors very well. They fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is nice and sturdy and classy looking though, so if you plan to use it with a different brush and a straight razor it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand for about two weeks now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with them. The brush makes plenty of lather and hold its shape while drying in the attractive stand. I know they are attractive because my wife hasn&#x27;t complained about them detracting from the bath decor. Great combination.</li>
            <li> It makes my bathroom counter much neater, and I don&#x27;t worry so much about my razor getting knocked around. It has a simple and attractive design, and the construction is solid.</li>
            <li> The service was prompt, and the stand is exactly as advertised -- sturdy stainless, simple, clean design. Our bathroom counter is now much less cluttered.</li>
            <li> Great stand, exactly what I needed it to be. Holds my safety razor and brush very well. A little larger than I thought it would be, but no complaints there!</li>
            <li> Very nice finish, stable base, looks great. The main downside for me is that it does not fit the badger brush I was gifted from The Art of Shaving. I should have paid closer attention to the measurements others had posted.</li>
            <li> Works fine and hold the brush and razior.  Good quailty</li>
            <li> Very simple design.  Keeps my shaving gear organized and under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slight hooks keep the razor and brush in place very well even if bumped.</li>
            <li> So nice to find an American made product.  Let&#x27;s keep the jobs at home.  This has worked out very well for my Double edge razor and shaving brush.  Simple yet elegant and priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> This stand is useless to me. It is to small for all but one brush. This stand is made for very small brushes. The brushes I wanted this for do not fit in it.</li>
            <li> Looks great and works well as a matching set. Very reasonably priced and was a great gift set for my picky husband.</li>
            <li> A quality product. It&#x27;s attractive, well built and sturdy. The base is weighted, so the stand is very stable. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Amazing stand!!! It&#x27;s heavy and hold my brush and razor very nicely. I don&#x27;t see what some other people were complaining about. Just as good or better then an AOS stand.</li>
            <li> Got this stand with my new shaver. Works well and looks good. Only thing appear other end does not fit some brushes.</li>
            <li> The stand looks nice and holds both my brush and razor without issue. I would recommend this stand for anyone.</li>
            <li> It provides precisely the correct upward force necessary to counteract gravity&#x27;s pull on my razor and brush. I&#x27;ve tried using it with other brush/razor combinations, and it amazingly adjusts automatically to the other various weights. I&#x27;ve stared at it for hours at a time, and there&#x27;s truly no upward or downward movement at all! Truly a magical engineering feat.</li>
            <li> Looks great, sturdy &amp; heavy so it stays put, easy to clean, and my Escali badger hair brush fits perfectly!</li>
            <li> Solid and quality...but be careful as it did not fit one of my brushes at handle but luckily would fit at base of brissles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and wanted a simple stand to hold my new razor and new brush. I had read a bunch of reviews and was worried that the stand I end up with might not be sturdy. I&#x27;m happy to report that this stand stays stable through the use of my brush and razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush holder is a little limited in the brush sizes it supports. The first brush I got didn&#x27;t fit. I had read other reviews of stands where owners were able to &#x27;bend&#x27; the fork to accommodate larger brush sizes. Pro or Con, I could not bend the fork on this stand. That&#x27;s a good sign if you&#x27;re looking for quality, a bad sign if you have the wrong brush size.</li>
            <li> This is one nice stand! The workmanship and the chrome finish are superior and it is heavy enough not to topple over. My long handle Parker razor and Escali brush fit perfectly. You will be proud to display this on your vanity!</li>
            <li> My first shaving stand. I have the Merkur 180, and the Escali wooden handled badger hair brush, and they both fit it just fine. Not sure how this could be improved upon. Pretty straight forward product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Perfect fit for a Parker 99R. Arrived fast and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The chrome brush stand and razor stand is perfect for use. I&#x27;ll use it often.</li>
            <li> Solid product for price. Make sure to find out what size your badger/boar brush is so it actually fits on the stand though.</li>
            <li> How can one be excited over a razor/brush stand you ask?  Easy.  This product does exactly what it is designed to do.  It holds both the razor and the brush for proper drying and does so in an easily cleaned and beautiful fashion.  I no longer have to hide my razor and brush because of appearance.  The chrome surface is a great compliment to both the razor and the brush.  If simplicity is your thing, you won&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> What more can I say. The stand is good looking and is quality. It makes my bathroom counter look a bit more classy.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little stand that is well made.  Not much to say except I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This stand is sturdily made and well finished.  It&#x27;s a perfect fit for my Gillette Fusion razor and the Italian shaving brush I&#x27;ve had for a while.  The price was a good one for a high quality product. The stand was well packaged too and I&#x27;m glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> The stand is far more solidly built than I expected it would be. The metal is heavy and of good quality. The entire thing can be disassembled for travel, yet when assembled and tightened fully, there is no movement whatsoever between the various parts. A good buy.</li>
            <li> The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush stand looks beautiful. Nice fit and finish, gleaming chrome and works as promised. Holds razor and brush and balances well. A great value for a great stand! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The brush side is much smaller than you might think, and does not hold Omega brushes.&lt;br /&gt;the metal is fairly soft and damages easy.  It would be a great product, if the price was half as much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I expected the razor to be held upside down for drainage. It does the job it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for, made well and holds brush and razor easily. Would easily recommend to anyone with a brush and razor.</li>
            <li> I opened this article a couple of days ago, it looks pretty solid, and has a anti-slip base it grips firmly on my bathroom.  I bought and Edwin Jagger 89 dbl razor and an EJ brush and both fits perfectly. Highly recommended.  After 2 years looks like new. The only maintenance required is wash it wit hand soap and it looks as new. No rust or any other wear sign.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this with a long handled Merkur and Parker brush. They both rest perfectly on the stand. The finish is great.</li>
            <li> 1st father&#x27;s day gift for my husband.  It&#x27;s a great stand that complements the Merkur razor I purchased for him.  The stand has a good solid weight to it.  Nothing bad to say about this stand, don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase.</li>
            <li> Holds my EJ DE89BA11 &amp; Parker brush perfectly, with a nice solid base that&#x27;s not tipping over or getting knocked around.</li>
            <li> Got this stand after a year with my wobbly razor stand from China. That one would collapse if the razor itself was left alone on the stand because the base wasn&#x27;t weighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Escali stand - nice and polished, h-e-a-v-y and well built. Fits my Edwin Jagger razor well and custom brush. Note that the opening for the brush is quite narrow and won&#x27;t fit around my brush&#x27;s handle, but my brush sits nicely when the handle is inserted around the brush&#x27;s knot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good stand but let&#x27;s see how it holds up to moisture and rust resistance. But looking at the nice chrome plating I&#x27;m quite sure it will be good!</li>
            <li> well worth the money and nice build quality</li>
            <li> This stand is excellent. It is solid and has some heft to it. Definitely well made and can disassemble easily.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what was expected and quickly shipped. I recommed this razor/shaving brush stand to anyone who is looking for this kind of item.</li>
            <li> Great stand, holds my EJ de89 and Escali brush perfectly.  Nice finish, sturdy and looks great on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Does not take up much room and allows my razor and brush to dry like they should.  The chrome finish is good quality and I expect years of use out of it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need much from a razor/brush stand, but this delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000NL0T1G B000NL0T1G]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being the long-handle razor, it fits fine on this stand with room to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important note if you have cats: you might want to put this in a cabinet instead of out on a countertop. Apparently, hanging a brush is too tempting.</li>
            <li> The stand is very heavy and of nice quality. The original brush I bought for it (Brush with a wood handle from the Body Shop) didn&#x27;t fit as nicely as thought, just something to consider.</li>
            <li> Nice stand, heavy base which is appreciated. My safety razor (Ikon OSS) is a little on the larger side so it barely fits in the holder but still works out just fine. Great stand for the price and looks really good in the bathroom</li>
            <li> Perfect razor and brush stand with function and good looks to match.  Impressed with the quality.  Good value, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like about this one is that the brush opening is too narrow for the traditional fat shaving brush, but otherwise, it keeps the vanity area organized and looks very good. No deterioration in the chrome-like surface yet as some others had mentioned.</li>
            <li> Heading says it all.  Looks nice on our counter top.  I would gladly recommend this item to my friends. Buy it if you&#x27;re in the market.</li>
            <li> Love this stand looks good next to the sink wish I had bought one years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have one you need to purchase this one of one like it.</li>
            <li> The chrome is flawless this is a solid made stand. It will last for generations. I&#x27;m completly happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the stand. I&#x27;m very fed up with what Gillette has to offer (or doesn&#x27;t offer)  me. And so I am looking for select replacement items of durable quality - such as the Escali Stand: Things our grandfathers or fathers may have once used, but were discarded as the years passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  James McReavey</li>
            <li> Fits Escali shaving brush and Edwin Jagger Razor (with some height to spare, could probably fit a longer razor). Appears durable and lasting.</li>
            <li> Looks very nice and seems very durable.  Bottom weight makes it unlikely to accidentally tip over unless you deliver a pretty solid hit to it.</li>
            <li> It looks amazing on our bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I would have given this stand a 5 star rating, however, it is made for the Escali shaving brush and that is small. The stand will NOT accept a regular sized shave brush, it&#x27;s far too narrow. It does hold my Feather OR Van Der Hagen safety razor ok.If you have a long handled razor, the handle may hit the stand base, the post is not that tall. Well packaged good delivery time.</li>
            <li> Great product with nice weight to hold heavy DE razors without balance issues. The chrome finish is nicely done and matches my razor and brush perfectly. Thanks for a quality product.</li>
            <li> Decent product, can be broken down for transport or storage, heavy base so wont tip over, could use one piece instead of 2 for base</li>
            <li> Bought this stand for my son who just started shaving. It&#x27;s sturdy enough to be abused by a teenager, and looks nice as well. Great price for the quality.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not fit the brush I already owned, but did  fit the brush I ordered. Works fine otherwise...</li>
            <li> This looks great in my bathroom it makes my kit complete! My understanding is that it also helps your brush last longer by allowing it to dry quicker.</li>
            <li> This is a great stand. It&#x27;s solidly built, holds the razor and brush securely, and looks great. Not really much more to say about it!</li>
            <li> For me, there was not very much to know about choosing a stand for my double edge razor and shaving brush - perhaps most important is how it will look on the sink counter.  This stand looks sleek, is sturdy, and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space (which also makes my wife happy).</li>
            <li> Stands up very well and sturdy. Goes great with my razor and brush. Chrome finish makes me feel like I&#x27;m rich and important.</li>
            <li> Excellent stand. High quality chrome finish, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Super solid, feels a lot heavier than it looks in the photos. There is a rubber pad on the bottom so there is no metal in contact with your sink/counter. Fits my Merkur 34C razor perfectly as well. This stand is a great value!</li>
            <li> well worth the price, i was going to spend 5 times at much at the Mall.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase, sometimes hard to tell when your just shopping online, but quality is there. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, very useful. Perfect fit for the butterfly razor &amp; really recommend this product. Thank you &amp; keep up the good work</li>
            <li> Nice chrome finish. Holds brush and razor with no problem. Steady base. Good price. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stand to hold a long handle Merkur double edge safety razor and a boar&#x27;s hair shave brush.  The stands holds both items perfectly.  I was concerned before ordering if it would fit my razor as well as the handle of my brush.  After receiving the brush all concerns were forgotten.  The design is such that it should fit most razors and brushes on the market today.  This stand looks great and has a durable chrome finish!  It is has the perfect weight and has never tipped over.  The bottom of the base is slip resistant and stays in place.  One really nice feature is this stand does easily unscrew for travel purposes.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this stand to anybody who owns an old school razor and shave brush.</li>
            <li> Heavy stand that won&#x27;t tip over when you touch it.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the Escali badger hair shave brush and a double edge razor of your choice. Goes especially well with Edwin Jagger chrome plated razor.</li>
            <li> This stand is sturdy and nice looking. It does the job for a lot less than what I have seen similar stands in other stores.</li>
            <li> Looks good, and it works well. It seems to be stable and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it falling over.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. Very sturdy, well built, it does hold my razor (Harry&#x27;s Blades razor) I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product worked BEAUTIFULLY with my Art of Shaving badger brush and R89 Grande safety razor. The stand is built of the highest quality and definitely compliments any safety razor and brush combination while providing great stability. For less than 1/3 of the price of other brands, this stand delivers on both aesthetics and functionality. Get it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stand for about two month&#x27;s now and its doing its job perfectly.  Its sturdy, has a solid base, and is still looking good.  Never going to need a another stand, so i&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised.  Holds the shave brush and razor without fail.  Sits solidly on the bathroom counter.  Not much else to say here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the cheapest stand, but  it keeps your razor and brush dry and is easy to clean. It&#x27;s stable and has no quality concerns. The stand firmly screws into the base and the chrome is easy to clean. Buy this once and you&#x27;ll never need another one.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do! Sturdy enough and yet compact so that it can fit anywhere without seeming too bulky. Easy to clean, and has a nice chrome finish to it which makes it a nice addition to any style bathroom. I am more than pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice weight to it and a very nice chrome finish. Shipping was fast. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This definitely cleaned up my side of the sink. My wife even made a comment on how much she appreciates the look of the stand.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, fits my Merkur long-handle safety razor and Escali badger hair brush. It&#x27;s understated but classy looking and looks great in my bathroom. Practical, affordable, great looking, solid construction, what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Good quality stand and the brush is soft and high quality also.</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy, actually much better quality than I expected. Thanks for making a product that isn&#x27;t going to fall apart in a month.</li>
            <li> Works as it should.  Fits my Merkur long handle and badger brush without any issues.  Also looks good sitting on my counter.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, VERY FAST and reasonable shipping.</li>
            <li> Works great and looks nice</li>
            <li> As soon as I took the item out of the package, it fell apart!  The nut on top is stripped, and won&#x27;t tighten up.  I&#x27;m returning this for a refund.  The Shaving Brush looks ok though, so I will keep that.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product, very timely shipping</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the quality of the razor &amp; brush stand. The base is weighted, so it doesn&#x27;t tip over easily.</li>
            <li> Nice and simple, matches my safety razor</li>
            <li> Stand works great. The base is weighted so it doesn&#x27;t topple over easily. I have a Merkur #34C which fits very nicely. I am using the brush that came with the Omega 46065 Shaving Set. The brush handle is too wide to fit in the Escali stand, but it does fit well by placing the brush so the base of the handle rests on top of the prongs. The opening is wide enough so as not to pinch or disturb the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what it needs to do, which is hold my razor and brush without adding a bunch of clutter to my counter top.</li>
            <li> Awesome !  Very good product with quality craftsmanship...would highly recommend this item to you !</li>
            <li> This matches my expensive safety razor and brush. Looks great and does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Great stand, well made..easily holds my brush &amp; razor</li>
            <li> my son said this is great!</li>
            <li> Bought a  Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; Long Safety Razor and this stand works perfectly.  Also bought an Escali 100% pure badger shaving brush and that also fits perfectly.  Hope this helps someone shopping for a quality Safety Razor kit.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and in good shape. It&#x27;s got a good weight to it, so it doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap. Nice, sturdy construction. Fits a brush in easily (and most of the drips will fall onto the base of the stand rather than your counter). Husband doesn&#x27;t have a safety razor yet, but it holds the plastic guys just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. I spent a LONG time looking for creams, soaps, brushes, stands, scissors, combs, etc for a multiple-gift Christmas for the husband and his manly beard. This stand does the job and does it well without breaking the wallet. He won&#x27;t need to replace this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Note that the brush I got him was the Tweezerman&#x27;s. I&#x27;m sorry to read a number of reviews where this stand doesn&#x27;t do the job (brushes falling off or not fitting, etc). It worked well in our case. Remember folks, grains of salt.</li>
            <li> Feels very solid, well built, and from good quality materials. This stand works well for me because I have limited bathroom space and it&#x27;s quite compact with a rubber/foam grip on the base. Very good.</li>
            <li> Good material and quality.  Heavy stand so it will not tip over easily.</li>
            <li> well built stand for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shave stand; fits the razor and brush perfect. Razor is: Merkur barber pole, and the brush is tweezerman.</li>
            <li> This stand does exactly what it is designed to do and looks good doing it.  I purchased this with a Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor.  I am very happy with all three!</li>
            <li> Solid and sturdy. Great for a heavy safety razor.</li>
            <li> This was given to my husband as a Christmas gift!!!!  He loved it!!!!  Wonderful item and I highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband so he&#x27;d quit putting his wet shaving brush in the drawer; it worked and he loved it</li>
            <li> Decided to start using safety razor because of the cost. This stand is perfect for holding my brush and razor. Looks good and functional. Would recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor stand.  The base is rather heavy and substantial so that I cannot see it toppling over easily.  Looks are terrific and beautifully displays my DE razor and brush.  It is also a very good value.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice stand for my razor and brush. I should have bought this years ago.</li>
            <li> Holds my badger hair brush and titanium razor (purchased separately) in concert beautifully.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son, and he loves it! He was very impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> Seems fine.  Doesn&#x27;t fall over.</li>
            <li> A great stand for those needing a simple yet classy accessory.  Recommended for anyone using safety razors and shave brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought my husband a high end shaving brush and soap for Christmas, and quickly realized we needed one of these to properly store and dry the brush. Did a bunch of research, and settled on this one - and I&#x27;m so glad I did! It has a weighted base, so it&#x27;s very sturdy, and it&#x27;s compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of counter space. It looks very clean and professional, and works extremely well to keep all of his shaving stuff clean, orderly and easily at hand. Definitely worth every penny - highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Stable, doesn&#x27;t rust, fits well into my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is a quality stand, looks good &amp; is inexpensive. I spent $80 at a local store for a stand and the quality isn&#x27;t much better than this one, although it cost 4x the price! I bought two of these for gifts during holidays &amp; I am very pleased. I was surprised to find they came quicker than I expected in spite of the fact it was during the crazy holiday season. Good product and good service from the supplier.</li>
            <li> This stand compliments my 1953 Gillette Super Speed perfectly and holds my Parker Badger Bristle Brush just right. It is sturdy and weighted nicely so that there is no anxiety about it falling over. I highly recommend this stand.</li>
            <li> Simple, elegant, functional way to hold your razor and brush. I like how it helps keep my bathroom counter tidy, and it looks good too.</li>
            <li> It fit my brush and razor, it looks snazzy and it fits in every place I&#x27;ve moved. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted to razor and stand to save money and look cool I think.&lt;br /&gt;I got it all for his bday, badger hair brush included. I wondered how long he&#x27;d be into it.&lt;br /&gt;We love it. It&#x27;s fun to shave his neck and watch him like my dad, when I was little, get close.&lt;br /&gt;The stand is perfect addition!</li>
            <li> When my teenage son started shaving, I thought, &amp;#34;what better way for him to develop a life-long habit for high quality products&amp;#34;.  He proudly displays his stand and chrome razor on the bathroom vanity.  Amazingly, he keeps everything clean and polished.</li>
            <li> Nothing absurdly extravagant here - just a functional razor/brush stand. Good price, and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> nice looking stand.  wish the stand was a little more stable, and would the screw that locks the stand to the base was more secure. I might try using loc-tite on this...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid, and looks great.</li>
            <li> Solid and sharp looking on the counter of the bathroom, does not attract water spots.</li>
            <li> It is stainless and does not tip over when used. What more can you say? It is a quality item and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d care much for this but it&#x27;s a great way to store the razor and brush post-shave. Much neater and easier to manage with the stand</li>
            <li> Works great for my Merkur Long-Handled Safety Razor and my Parker Brush. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The quality of this holder is excellent and it does a superb job of holding your brush &amp; razor!!  No negatives at all and will last for years and years! And it looks much more expensive than its price!!</li>
            <li> It is the perfect accessory for my brush and razor. Allows them to dry properly in a convenient accessible location.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect! The chrome finish is brilliant and you can tell that it&#x27;s going to &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; the test of time. Before receiving the stand, I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t be sturdy enough to hold my shaving brush and razor, which is quite substantial, but the stand&#x27;s base is solid and has some good weight to it. The rest of the fixtures and accessories in my bathroom are polished chrome and this stand only makes the bathroom look that much nicer. I&#x27;d highly recommend this stand to anyone who is looking to safely store their brush and razor, as well as show them off and add a little class to their bathroom!</li>
            <li> i love the chrome finish.</li>
            <li> What a great product, wonderful quality looks great work great with my Parker 60R and Burma Shaving brush I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;to everyone.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my husband and he loves it... he&#x27;s very picky about his razors and this one is definitely a keeper, so he needed a nice stand to go for it and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> My wife got me the stand from Art of Shaving.  After doing some research, i found the Escali.  I was worried that my badger and razor (from Art of Shaving) would not fit.  It fits perfectly.  It was well worth the purchase, glad i was able to save money.</li>
            <li> At the $20 price point I was expecting something flimsy and cheap. This stand is well made made, with a nice finish, and a nice weight. It holds my razor and my brush securely and is difficult to tip over. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stand.</li>
            <li> He liked that it matched his vintage strait razor perfectly.  It is very sturdy. I purchased the escali brush to go along with it and he loves that too!</li>
            <li> loved it and it is really nice quality and well worth the price. would recommend to anyone to buy this</li>
            <li> Satisfactory and serves its purpose, so that is all that I have to, or want to, say about the product.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Fits brush and razor perfectly, and weighted evenly. Gives a more mature look than the plastic holder that came with the brush.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bunch of stands on amazon, including a stainless steel version that was more expensive but I settled on the Escali since the price was good, and there were only a few reviewers who complained about rusting. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months, and haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with rusting, though the stains from the razor and brush make the chrome finish pretty nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the Art of Shaving Pure Badger brush and I was hoping that the brush stand would hold it at the handle vs at the base of the bristles but it does not. It&#x27;s made for holding a 20mm brush at the knot. Which is fine, but I know I didn&#x27;t find the answer going through the reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d write my own to clarify in case someone else was wondering. I&#x27;d probably buy the stainless steel one and fabricate my own shaver and brush stand if this one rusts on me.</li>
            <li> This was a very nice replacement for my plastic brush holder that I have had for the last year.  The only downside is that it does not hold my straight razor (but it was not designed for that).  The stand has a very nice chrome finish and good weight so that there is not a chance of it tipping over.</li>
            <li> I am truly impressed at how awesome this product is for the price point they are selling it at.  The finish looks awesome and is nice and study. Don&#x27;t think twice just buy it!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, item as described, heavy and stable, not suitable as a holder for a Gillette razor, though. Good vaue</li>
            <li> Fits my Merkur 34c and my TAOS brush perfectly. A nice heavy base so I have no concerns about it ever tipping over. The chrome matches the razor perfectly for a nice look.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and it looks great.  It hold my razor and brush perfectly. It is sturdy and does not feel flimsy. The grip on the bottom keep it in place on my sink. Overall a great purchase and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son as a present.  He loves it.  The company was fast in getting it to me and it looks great and works with his razor and brush.  Highly recommend this company.  They are an American company!!</li>
            <li> Well made and excellent design. Definitely fits my brush and razor and looks great in the bathroom. Fast shipping which ensured I get the product before my flight out of the US</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product.  Nice and heavy.  Stays upright well, and the razor and brush fit just right.  Well pleased with this stand, and it looks great too.</li>
            <li> Liked my first one so much I bought another to hold my second razor and heavy handled brush. Shipping time has been fantasic each time, and the stand itself is nicely made. I do try and keep it free of splash, dry it off when it gets wet. I try and minimize any chance of rust. That said, I haven&#x27;t had rust on the first one ordered, it still looks new. I shouldn&#x27;t need to order another, but I woulnt hesitate if needed...</li>
            <li> My husband purchase this and loves it. A must have if you love shaving. A plus for our bathroom counter</li>
            <li> Matched the Merker DE razor perfectly!! There are other Escali stands on Amazon that appear to be the same as this one, but they aren&#x27;t! Many others are a yellow-ish color and not the polished chrome that matches the razor. Reviews on other Escali stands stated that they were the yellowish chrome color and not the real correct chrome color as this one is, so I&#x27;m glad I chose this one! It looks so nice on the vanity with the razor and tweezerman brush!</li>
            <li> The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand is extremely sturdy and surprisingly heavy (it doesn&#x27;t look that way from the pictures.  Looks great on the counter and fits most brush heads/safety razors.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice stand for your razor and brush. Those who are into DE shaving know that how one feels to keep the tools properly and carefully. This stand really shows up that you care for your state of the art razors such as Merkur, Feather, Edwin and Jagger etc and the brushes that you have. I am glad that I purchased this!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. It arrived before the estimated arrival date and in the condition that was listed. Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Closest shave ever.  Handles good.  Saves money in blades.  I was really impressed and have recommended this razor to friends and coworkers.</li>
            <li> Good finish. Gets the job done and holds my brush just fine. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> very nice stand, no signs or rust, feels very solid</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised. Dries the Escali badger brush and lets the razor breath accordingly. Is aesthetically pleasing in any bathroom. Sent on time and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Great fit for the Escali brush (natrually) and holds my Merkur razor. Looks great and keeps everything high and dry. I love it.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE PRODUCT,HOLDS MY MERKUR RAZOR AND MY SIMPSONS COLONEL BRUSH.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and fits Escali brush perfectly, as expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to get my brush &amp; razor out of the way, yet easy to get to in a quality product.</li>
            <li> Great quality product. Fits my Edwin Jagger DE89 Barley handle razor perfectly. Unfortunately, it does not fit the handle on my Semogue 1800 brush, and presumably it won&#x27;t fit similar sized brushes. However, it does fit at the bristles.</li>
            <li> Works as it should, but not as chrome as I expected - has a bit of a yellow tint to it.</li>
            <li> The stand fits my razor and brush perfectly. It also looks classier than having a razor just sitting on the sink or in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Stand was packaged well and no defects. Pricing was good and fits my merker and badger brush, however the brush only barely fits, so if it was just a bit wider, it would be perfect</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase -- just as advertised.</li>
            <li> The Escali Stand is a sturdy balanced stand for holding brush and razor.  It doesn&#x27;t tip and the holders do not bend.  Perfectly sized and balanced for its purpose and its clean stainless steel finish is perfect in any bathroom.  Keeps my brush and razor dry and readily within reach.&lt;br /&gt;The stand is sold through Amazon by Parella&#x27;s, a small American from the ground up business, supplying a good product with good customer service.  As a small business owner, it means a lot to me that I can work with other small business owners through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice. It seems sturdy. It is simple and clean looking. Love that it is an American company too!</li>
            <li> I have been making do with a plastic cup for my DE Razor and brush for a while and decided that it was time to get something more useful and better looking. This chrome brush and razor stand was less expensive than many I looked at and seemed sturdy and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived in less than a week, the stand was fully assembled and came in A-1 condition. I have it this stand to be quite nice looking, sturdy and also space saving. It is a quality product and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my brush and razor. It looks super classy and helps to organize the area around my sink. The material on the bottom acts almost like a suction cup so it resists movement and stays in place even when the base is soaked. Really quality product.</li>
            <li> Poor quality control. I&#x27;d be embarrassed to sell such a lopsided POS.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my new Parker Safety Razor 100% Best Badger Bristle Shaving Brush -- White &amp; Chrome Handle AND Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor.  At first I was pissed because I thought the brush just didn&#x27;t fit at all.  The handle of the brush is too large and would just not fit.  That being said I ended up putting the part of the brush where the bristles meed the handle in the holder and that works, It&#x27;s a little off-balance doing it that way, but it doesn&#x27;t look bad when its in there so I decided to keep it.  I&#x27;d be lying if I said I wasn&#x27;t disappointed that the handle itself did not fit, but its not terrible either.  The Brush did come with its own stand, but I use this one instead because it looks nicer and I don&#x27;t want to bother returning it. The razor fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> I switched to using a brush and double edge razor and as an afterthought I realized I needed something to hold them both. The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand is well made, easy to keep clean and sells for reasonable price. It gets five stars from me.</li>
            <li> Great stand for the money!  Very sturdy and looks great too.  Holds my shaving brush and Fusion razor perfect.  Looks good sitting out and its also small enough to store away in the medicine cabinet.  Very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> It does what I expected it to: holds my Escali brush and my Merkur razor.  Nice finish too, to boot.</li>
            <li> This razor stand is a very convenient addition to my new safety razor and shaving kit.  It allows the brush to properly drain and dry in a timely manner and additionally, it is very nice looking.</li>
            <li> It looks good and it works well, I&#x27;m not sure what else to say.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, simple, and very sturdy stand for your double edge and brush.  it looks amazing with my Merkur razor and was beautiful out of the box.  No major complaints so far and the base is sturdy with a non-slip pad on the bottom</li>
            <li> Great quality! Heavy duty razor and brush stand for a good price.</li>
            <li> Looks great.  Price is awsome for this solid and stylish stand.  Only way to store your brush for longer life.  Pair this with the badger brush, great combo.</li>
            <li> There is really not much to say here: The product is pretty straightforward and works as intended. I&#x27;ve had no issues with staining or warping. It sits flat on the counter and holds my razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Razor and brush stand is Exactly as advertised. Looks great and is very durable. I Would recommend to any friends and family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to enjoy this product. It has not failed me, also I use product for razor handle, shaving brush, and even has room for my tongue cleaner. I give the razor and brush holder 5 stars and I don&#x27;t really know about me paying for the  price because I did not do any research on the price.</li>
            <li> Nicely weighted, this simple little holder does the job. The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is because the brush holder apparently only holds escali brushes, as two others I&#x27;ve tried have handles that won&#x27;t fit. That&#x27;s a shame.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great stand for the price. It holds my badger hair brush perfectly and my razor fairly securely. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because it loosens fairly easily. I had to wrench it in place to make sure it stopped wobbling.</li>
            <li> I use this to put my merkur long handle and my badger shaving brush that has a black handle with silver tip. Both fit perfectly. Looks great on the counter and keeps everything nice an organized. I highly recommend this product if you are in the market for a similar product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly heavy. I feel like it&#x27;s well made and has this non slip bottom. Good hanger for sure.</li>
            <li> Who knew that shaving brushes need to be stored upside down.  Works great and hold my Shick 5 bladed razor.</li>
            <li> very stylish and perfect to display and dry out my brush and razor</li>
            <li> Nice Stand. Looks great on the counter with my [[ASIN:B002FC7B2G Merkur Long Handled Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome #180, 10 Double Edge Platinum Blades]] and my Art of shaving badger hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does what it is supposed to and looks good while doing it :-)</li>
            <li> This is of nice quality. It&#x27;s pretty shiny and complements my Mercur 180 long handled safety razor and badger brush very well.</li>
            <li> The stand is sturdy and well made....great choice for my long handled razor!  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Good one.i have no problem.</li>
            <li> It is a nice, heavy stand.  Your brush will be supported by sliding it onto the stand where the bristles meet the holder.</li>
            <li> Material quality is excellent. The price was very fair for the quality, and packaging and delivery was great. Base is of moderate weight; ensures no tipping over. No noticeable tarnish spots to date; good deal. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The stand is pretty sturdy and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it tipping over or anything like that. The rubber grip on the bottom keeps it from sliding around when taking my razor/brush on and off the stand. My only complaint is that the brush holder is too large for my brush (I have a brush that I got from the Art of Shaving). Eventually I will probably upgrade to another brush but for now I just wrap a couple of rubber bands around the base of the brush to make it large enough to be held by the stand.</li>
            <li> beautiful stand. Not cheaply made. Nice heavy weight and high shine.</li>
            <li> Very nice--good quality, matches my Merkur razor well.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and brush stand for my dad and he was extremely pleased with it. He liked for stable the base was, its looks, and its portability. I will most likely be picking one up for myself once I get back to the joys of bar soap shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a great little device. It allows the shaving brush to hang in a way once used so that it keeps its shape while drying. It&#x27;s also a neat and convenient place to store the razor without taking up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> Great size for a DE razor and a brush</li>
            <li> The side for holding the brush was to small for my brush and the side to hold the razor was to just a little to big but  but I figured out how to make it work for me.</li>
            <li> Loved the stand . Did every thing I was looking for . Fit my brush and razor perfectly . Very pleased I would recommend purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Very well made and sturdy. The base has a non slip thick pad that sits well on sink countertop. The brush (Escali) fit perfect and so did my Parker 96R razor. Great value and well made product. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality stand.  Chrome appears to be very thick, the stand feels heavy and my old fashioned razor and brush fit in it perfectly and I do not have to worry about cluttering my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> For the price this stand is very sturdy and nice. I like the weight so it doesn&#x27;t fall over.</li>
            <li> This stand is nearly perfect...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a great finish in bright nickel chrome. Nice anti-skid pad on the base, keeps your stand from slipping or marking your counter top. The height is perfect for a standard length safety razor, but a long handled razor may not sit in the forked hanger properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints about this stand, but I do have one minor caveat: Your shaving brush may not nest in the forked hanger. I don&#x27;t blame the manufacturer or seller, as it is exactly as advertised. I am using a cheap Omega &amp;#34;48&amp;#34;, and neither the handle, nor base of the brush fit in the holder. But don&#x27;t despair! There&#x27;s a workaround: Just rest the brush horizontally on the forked holder, and all is good with this little gem of a shaving stand!</li>
            <li> Well made, simple, handsome design.  Fits my Gillette razor and brush perfectly. Price is a fraction of comparable stands on the market.  I&#x27;m delighted.</li>
            <li> Great stand, works well with my EJ DE89bl. Fit and finish is outstanding. Packaging was good and secure. Lightning fast shipping. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor stand for my boyfriend and he loves it! It is sturdy and the better than another brand that I purchased a few months ago that end up being was with a hefty price tag. The price is unbeatable for the quality of this stand. It is so sleek and goes perfect with my boyfriend&#x27;s Merkur razor. The shaving brush I bought him is black with stainless steel trimmings so it goes well. Customer service has been wonderful as well!</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful. Combine it with the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor &amp; Escali Badger Shaving Brush and you have an art piece. My only observation was the razor didn&#x27;t sit evenly on stand, the left side for some reason was slightly fwd than the right. Not sure if its that specific razor or the stand is off. Either way it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 of these stands and they are simply the best stands you can find for medium and small handled brushes. Most DE razor types will fit on this stand as well. Also, working with the fine folks at Perellas has been wonderful. Will continue to order products from them. Thanks Amazon and Perellas!</li>
            <li> Closest shave ever. More control around lips nose etc. Not so much as a nick yet. Will pay for itself in a few months of not buying overpriced multi-blades. Plus it looks great sitting on the sink. Don&#x27;t know if all wet shavers are this good, but this one is awesome!</li>
            <li> Great product, looks good with my razor and brush</li>
            <li> Very sturdy. Clean, sleek look. The quality feels just as good as stands in the $100 range.</li>
            <li> We just remodeled our bathroom. In the process I changed my shaving system to a safety razor and badger brush so I began my hunt on Amazon for a stylish support stand that was well-made, and complimented our brand new bathroom.  After looking at several offerings on Amazon I stumbled on the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and brush stand. I loved the price and ordered one. It arrived quickly and I unpacked it. Just as I hoped, it has proven to be well-made and sturdy. The base is strong and has enough weight to it that I have no concerns about it tipping over. I can add the razor and brush to the stand (in either order) and it doesn&#x27;t lean or tip. The bright chrome surface looks great and my razor and badger brush look like they belong on the new vanity. All in all, it was a great choice and I am very pleased with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Does a great job as a holder for your razor and brush. Also looks very nice. Clean simple look. Holds the Tweezerman shaving brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks.  Works perfectly so far!</li>
            <li> Works well to hold my generic shaving brush and Muhle R89 razor. Sturdy enough to not tip over. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice stand for the price,  chrome is well done and base is well weighted.  I wish base was larger in diameter to catch any drips.</li>
            <li> Great construction and quality!</li>
            <li> Well made...nice and heavy...and more attractive in person than in the picture. Fits my Harry&#x27;s razor and Escali brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good value for money. SS models are available, but this seems to stand up just fine to moisture as long as you dry it off.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find item in local stores. Sometimes it just feels good to return to using instruments from the past. This will work for new razors as well as old models.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone using an old razor, brush and shave cup.</li>
            <li> This unit does the job, clean lines and presents well. It looks perfect on the wash basin with the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Love the stand looks nice and is very portable. I put it in my medicine cabinet and looks great. Just be aware that the brush holder side is very narrow so if you have a fat brush handle it wont accomodate the brush stand part. Just be sure that your brush handle isnt for large sized it probably wont fit in this stand. Other than that restriction this stand is a great addition to shaving supplies</li>
            <li> I like the look and feel of the brush stand.... 1 Problem. The brush side was too narrow for my brush. The brush I have seems pretty standard and does not fit without using extreme pressure. I also have another brush that is too narrow and slides right through. Not sure which brush this is supposed to work with.</li>
            <li> does its job hold my gillet pro glid razor and my shaving brush nothing to complain bout,good product with a great price cant beat $20 bucks</li>
            <li> Great price for a nice stand.  It fits brush and razor well.  One of two for each corner of my sink.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and looks great in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Better priced than others and is very solid and sturdy. Looks very handsome also. You will not go wrong with this item for your brush, but note that it may not fit brushes with very thick handles. Perfect complement to the Escali brush or any other with a knob-type handle.</li>
            <li> I received the stand in excellent condition. The quality of construction is very good. I&#x27;m very pleased with the item and the purchase experience.</li>
            <li> What can I say, this stand is elegant and functional. I have had this stand for over three weeks now, and, if I had it to do over I would definitely order this again.  A great product and company. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very good razor-and-brush stand, with a more stable base than many.  Nice finish.  Accommodates most brushes, though not the larger-handled ones.</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy. The only complain is that I have to force my brush in because it&#x27;s diameter is a bit big for the stand.</li>
            <li> The stand is a perfect fit for my razor and shaving brush. Keeps the brush dry and out of the way on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Well built and beautiful. Fits my brush and razor perfectly. The finish has not faded at all and it has remained sable.</li>
            <li> I use this for my Merkur 34c razor and it fits perfectly. Most brushes should fit as well. No reason to spend more than this, it holds the razor and brush so they dry properly to keep them in good condition over the long term. That&#x27;s it. Paying any more is a waste of money! .</li>
            <li> My grandson said it was perfect.  Use it for his razor and this keeps&lt;br /&gt;it off of the sink.  Nicely done.</li>
            <li> Very nice stand, well made and good looking. Does the job well. I am pleased with it and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The base is nicely weighted, the chrome is shiny and hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of wear in over a year of use. Cleans up easily, and most importantly holds my brush and razor off the counter and lets them dry. The base also has a bit of felt on the bottom, no danger of marking your counters or slipping around.</li>
            <li> Very good unit. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This stand is very nice looking and works well. I would have given it 5 stars if the razor holder had been just slightly larger. I order razors from Dollar Shave Club and the razor handle is a little &amp;#34;fatter&amp;#34; than other razors I have had so it takes a little effort to put the razor on the stand, but with a little twist and at the right angle it works.</li>
            <li> This is a very simple yet elegant stand. Very clean looking, yet functional. Would recommend if you are looking for something to hold that razor and brush you have laying on your countertop.</li>
            <li> Nice stand, weighted well and holds the brush and razor perfectly.  I would buy this again if I needed another stand.</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for. The product is as advertised. Delivery was prompt and in good order.</li>
            <li> Nice stand.  The brush holder is a little small, but good quality make</li>
            <li> Worthy novelty to add to your collection.  Fits my Murker razor and escali brush perfectly (of course).  The base is very heavy and it stays very still.  A huge improvement to the experience, as I just acquired it and wish I had a long time ago !</li>
            <li> does the job well and can be taken apart for travel</li>
            <li> Looking for a good item to hang brush and razor, and it has delivered.  Arrived to me in new condition, packaged well, etc.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> So far I like it, it looks nice. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see how long it will hold up.</li>
            <li> This stand has a nice finish and a nice hefty weight to it.  It looks great on my sink too. The only draw back for me is that it doesn&#x27;t fit my Parker best badger brush. the knot fits in the opening but the handle is to round and the brush rolls around awkwardly on the stand. It isn&#x27;t a bad rack but for me its either getting returned or shelved until i get a different brush that will fit on it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as part of his Father&#x27;s Day gift. I chose this product for two reasons: 1.) I wanted him to be able to store his favorite razor instead of buying a stand made to hold X brand and 2.) the price was reasonable. The stand is very well made and all the parts fit together snugly. The base is solid in addition to being weighted well. His Tweezerman shaving brush fits like a glove. The fact that it is travel-friendly is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> Great product, very clean look!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Nice balance. Keeps brush and razor on my vanity, just like I wanted it.</li>
            <li> Love this stand. It&#x27;s perfect for the escali badger shaving brush and your favorite safety razor. It looks great also</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied.  The product was relatively inexpensive but has a weight and finish closer to far more expensive products (Art of Shaving, etc).  It is perfect for the space in which it sits and cleans up nicely.  I will continue to buy from this vendor as their products are top notch and meet or exceed expectations.</li>
            <li> very satisfied it&amp;#34;s exactly as described on line</li>
            <li> This razor stand was just what I was looking for. It was easy to set up or take apart for travel and it looks great with my Feather razor and Badger brush.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome stand. I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for only a short time and this helps to keep my razor and brush dry. I&#x27;m thinking of giving it as a gift to my brother.</li>
            <li> Fits my Merkur razor and brush very well and has a surprisingly nice weight. It looks good on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This is better quality than I expected for the price. I went back and purchased the badger brush, as well. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, sturdy product that performs its function well. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for razors and brushes.</li>
            <li> Arrived ahead of time  and  exactly as pictured  holds  brush  and razor</li>
            <li> Nice solid little stand that matches my EJ diamond cut razor.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy brush stand and good build quality. Definitely gets the job done and looks great! The knurling on this stand adds a nice touch and also matches the handle on my Edwin Jagger de89.</li>
            <li> WARNING: While this a high quality, well made stand it DOES NOT fit a Gilette Fusion Proglide razor.  The handle is too thick and while it can be put in sideways it can easily fall out.  It&#x27;s a shame considering the Fusion Proglide is the best selling razor in the USA.</li>
            <li> This stand is well made and looks great. Razor and brush fit great and is heavy enough to not tip over. Should last a lifetime!</li>
            <li> Holds my Merkur long-handeled razor and Escali badger hair brush.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it&#x27;s somewhat expensive (seems more like a ~$15 piece rather than $22+).  Nothing crazy about it, it&#x27;s a razor and brush holder that does its job!</li>
            <li> Beautiful gift item, purchased with Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl chrome plated Double Edge Safety Razor.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need it to do. Feels sturdy and nice. Fits my  brush and razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> Came as pictured, holds razor and stuff well.</li>
            <li> Nice stand for my shaving brush and razor.  Not the best for Gillette Sensor razor.  The razor has an angle that wants to slide off the stand.  There is no &amp;#34;retaining angle&amp;#34; built into the razor section to keep it from sliding off.  It is best for the old fashioned double edge razor.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a quality stand for my brush and razor for my everyday use.  This is well made, with a good weight at the base.  And a fair price.</li>
            <li> Fit and finish are just fine with no issues. Fits my Edwin Jagger DE89 and cheapo badger brush fine.  Holding up well so far.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband for Christmas. He is very happy with it.  I bought the Tweezerman brush and the Merkur long handle razor and they both fit on here perfect.  It is an attractive stand, shiny chrome, solid weight. Looks great in the bathroom. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice looking brush stand and well constructed. My brush handle is a little snug (SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush) in the holder, but its fine. I made a little adjustment to the brush prongs and now fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a solid product this does the job.  My Art of Shave brush is a tight squeeze but I manage to get it in there.  Wish they made the opening wider.</li>
            <li> It has a nice weighted base to keep it from tipping, and the brackets are very strong. It is an excellent value.</li>
            <li> This is a good looking well made product. I have it on my vanity next to my Escali Stainless steel shaving soap bowl. This stand is very functional and displays my vintage 58 Gillette Fat boy very well and air dries the razor and brush to my complete satisfaction. I am extremely pleased with this purchase and do not hesitate to recommend this stand or this company. Like my shaving bowl my wife likes it enough to let me leave it on display.</li>
            <li> The cons are I guess you have to buy  Escali Brush, It does not fit my brush and did not see the previous reviews stating that, The company should have  integrity and stated the brush holder is narrow and no other brush fits and or sell brush with it. I paid 21.95</li>
            <li> This is a very nice stand. The fit and finish is great. The brush does not fit as well as I would like, but it still fits. He razor side will hold just about any razor made. The stand is weighted, so it will not easily tip over. The price is great for what you get. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this stand for the &amp;#34;Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &#x27;Barber Pole&#x27; Long Safety Razor&amp;#34; and it works perfectly, holding everything just right. It&#x27;s very elegant looking, and it&#x27;s got enough weight to avoid sliding around the counter when removing and replacing the razor and brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone who recently started using a straight razor to shave and he loves it!  The razor and shaving brush fit perfectly and it has held up well.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this stand to match the color and texture of my Merkur 180 Long razor (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_26). If you didn&#x27;t know it, you would think that the razor and the stand were made by the same company.</li>
            <li> A simple device that does what it is supposed to do and looks simply good doing it. Particularly like the well-weighted base.</li>
            <li> My DE razor kind of barely dangles on, doesn&#x27;t feel stable. Like as if the slightest nudge will send my razor flying and slicing off a near by appendage. So I don&#x27;t like that one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the fact it gets really dirty and stains with finger prints and soap scum real easily, since it is a shiny chrome-like finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s so many better stands out there, you can even make one. I like the wooden one I have, seems more manly.</li>
            <li> And it holds them well, so well that they don&#x27;t fall off. Perhaps an earthquake could dislodge things from this sturdy anchor-like stand, but anything short of that would surely fail.</li>
            <li> Beautiful stand, not much more to add but that, looks really good, sturdy and all. And the metal is really well done :)</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought the Brush, Soap, Blades and Stand years ago. Great shave. I will say that I use a Gilette three blade to get a tighter shave. But I use one blade every two weeks. Really awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> Smart looking and it looks great on the bathroom vanity.  It keeps everything in one place and at an arm&#x27; s reach.  My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Classy looking, Great price.</li>
            <li> Great stand, but my brush (from the Art of Shaving) fits very snugly.  I have to force the brush onto the stand.</li>
            <li> I love my razor/brush stand. It&#x27;s very well constructed and looks very rich and expensive. Nice job on the chroming.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sits on my bathroom sink and is very solid and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;Nice job Escali!</li>
            <li> Not yet fully embracing traditionalism, I commit the heresy of using plain old Barbasol instead of a brush and mug with my double-edge safety razor, a Merkur #34C.  This looks as if it were designed specifically to match that razor&#x27;s style, and doesn&#x27;t tip over without a brush on the other side acting as a counterbalance.  The chrome plating seems nice and sterile, and is easily cleaned when needed.  The vertical style air-dries your razor (and presumably brush) quickly and keeps them from getting dirty.</li>
            <li> I got it because the stand that came with my Gillete razor was too plain.  This stand is something you can live without, but once you have it you can see a big difference.  It is a great accessory.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Keeps razor and brush together in a limited area and stainless steel seems to be holding up well</li>
            <li> This stand is just the right size for my long handled Merkur razor and my Omega badger brush.  I was worried that the brush might not fit but the measurements for the holders are correct.  I made sure when purchasing my brush that it would fit and it does.  The chrome job is great and the bottom is heavy so it doesn&#x27;t wobble or tilt when putting the razor or brush on it.  Very sturdy and sexy.  Makes the bathroom look sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Well, the stand arrived, and it is very nicely done, beautiful chrome, and heavy enough to hold the jagger de89 from the handle, or the head, depending on how you want to display it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest bummer for me is that the opening for the brush does NOT hold the Semogue 1305 brush, and I am not sure which Semogue it would hold, as the taper for the handles are quite similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will have to hang the brush from the ring where the bristles go into the handle, and hope that it does not cause issues with drying or with the finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is too bad because the stand really looks great, and looks like it could have been a matched set with the Jagger, the chrome appears that nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good purchase, but not great, as the whole idea was to have the stand to hold the razor and the brush, and the opening for the brush is just not wide enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~syf</li>
            <li> How can one write something to get you excited about a Razor and Brush Stand?  It holds the brush and razor nicely with a small footprint on the shelf. The stand is new so the chrome is still holding up fabulously.  The quality is immensely better than below average.  I would recommend this product if I cared to tell someone about it... hey!.,. It&#x27;s a freakin&#x27; stand!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a good stand for your razor and brush at a reasonable price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product.  Go for it!</li>
            <li> Keeps the razor and brush off the counter.  Looks nice and sleek, functions as advertised.  Yes, would recommend this stand.</li>
            <li> Fits my brush and razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> Low-cost luxury that earns its keep every time you shave, or just look at for that matter... it&#x27;s that classy!  Flawless chrome finish -- milled sections match steel razor handles beautifully -- and the weighted base stands up to the heft of my solid steel, chrome plated Parker brush without wince or wobble.  Still handy enough for the travel kit though...so I can impress hotel housekeepers with it, too.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely well built.  It is heavy for it&#x27;s size and I cannot foresee it being easily knocked over.  The Chrome finish is impeccable and can only be explained as being Harley level.</li>
            <li> Everytime I look at it, nostaglia overcomes me and I smile. Sometimes the oldest is the bestest!  I enjoy nostaglia</li>
            <li> I really like the way this stand looks on my bathroom shelf.  It&#x27;s classy looking and works great.  I like walking into the room and seeing it.</li>
            <li> The Escali Deluxe Razor and Brush stand lives up to its name: &amp;#34;Deluxe&amp;#34; in appearance and quality craftsmanship. Having this smartly designed stand is functional (allows the razor and brush to air-dry naturally) and makes an accessory that is proudly displayed on my counter.</li>
            <li> Great brush and razor stand. I would not hesitate to buy one of these again. It is functional and performs well in allowing my shaving brush and double-edge safety razor to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And absolute necessity for those who are into wet shaving (a renewed art and a great way to save $ and the environment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and service was great -- go ahead, put it in your cart...you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great looking and does a great job. It came in a very timely manner. Happy customer I would recommend to friends and family</li>
            <li> This stand is the perfect fit for a merkur safety razor and brush.  I have had mine for 2 months.  I read some articles from varying brands complaining about rust.  This product is stainless and shows no signs of rust, and I hang my wet razor and brush on it after shaving every day.  Good buy and classes up the bathroom...as much as a bathroom can be classed up.</li>
            <li> Looks like it is very well made and should last for years and years. It holds my brush and my razor well.</li>
            <li> Ordered this stand because I also ordered an Escali brush and after reading some reviews of this and other stands I didn&#x27;t want to have the same issue. Good little stand, everything fits perfectly and it matches my Merkur razor like they were made as a set.</li>
            <li> Guys, it&#x27;s just a stand.  It doesn&#x27;t really do anything but hold your tools for you, but this is a nice quality piece.  It&#x27;s heavy enough so that it won&#x27;t knock down too easily, It&#x27;s very attractive looking, the knurling on the vertical post is well executed, the base and hanger tabs nicely mirror plated.  It holds my Merkur 180 and Escali brush perfectly.  Should last a lifetime.  What more can one say, it&#x27;s just a stand--but for under $20 you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as described. It was very nice relative to the price i paid. I am very happy with it. It holds my razor and brush well. Even my wife commented that it looked nice on the counter! I would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a decent quality, inexpensive razer/brush stand and I found it with this product. It&#x27;s built well and looks great! I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> It is a nice little stand but the opening for the razor does not work for my razor.  Also the opening for the brush did not work for some of my brushes.</li>
            <li> Fits my Merkur Futur and Escali badger-hair brush perfectly</li>
            <li> The stand did not work for me.  I found that my razor did not stay on the stand very well, it fell off very easily.  This made using this product impractical for me.  Having to be extremely careful to balance the razor on the stand is not what I was looking for.  My brush didn&#x27;t fit either, but this I believe to be my fault because I use a smaller travel sized brush.  Can&#x27;t speak for the usefulness with a full sized brush.</li>
            <li> There are others more expensive, but this is high quality.  It holds the brush and razor well.  The razor can be a bit tricky to balance it quite right.  I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is an attractive, solid, and heavy stand. It holds my Parker 99R and Evernice Progress Model 247 Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Chrome Handle perfectly. With all three pieces being polished, it makes an impressive display. Being in a humid environment, I removed the base and put WD-40 on the threads before reassembling it. This prevents corrosion on the threads. To prevent possible corrosion of the stand, I will give it a good coat of car wax. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The stand works well with my short handled merkur razor and whenever I purchase my full size brush, it will be complete.</li>
            <li> Nice basic stand, pretty heavy for the price much better than I anticipated. Quite slim which worked out well for me as it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of our sink counter space.</li>
            <li> Stand is sturdy enough to hold either the brush or razor while you use the other one without tipping over, and has a nice looking finish to it.  Arrived on time and everything as advertised.</li>
            <li> I boutht this for my son.  It looks sharp when it is holding the razor and brush and reduces clutter.  It is as advertised and was delivered in time for Christmas</li>
            <li> Great quality and a great price.  Looks just like the overpriced razor and brush stands in the fancy boutique stores.  It matches and fits my long handled Merkur razor perfectly.  Save yourself  $100 and buy this one.</li>
            <li> quality of product and price were surprisingly great.  very happy with the stand and fits my husbands razor and brush perfectly</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. The stand was actually much nicer than I expected.</li>
            <li> very nice product exactly as described. good product, looked really nice, great price. Definitely worth the price. Nice shinny chrome finish.</li>
            <li> Not much that can be said about this - it looks great, matches most safety razors (including mine, a Mekeur 180) and is well made.  It holds my badger hair brush with such tenacity, I feel warm fuzzies inside everytime I look at it.</li>
            <li> As compared to other similar brush and razor stands.  The finish is flawless and the construction is very solid.  I have an Merkur HD34C, Gillette Heavy SS Red Tip, and a Muhle R41 and all three fit the stand perfectly (not at the same time).  The Gillette and the HD both have a pretty bulky handle and it poses no issue.  The brush holder also does it&#x27;s job wonderfully.  The base has a good amount of heft to it, thus far after a month of use, I&#x27;ve had absolutely no stability issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I might gripe about is the fact that the pad on the bottom of the stand appears to be foam rubber.  My counter gets wet while I&#x27;m shaving, and the stand sits on the counter, rather than a shelf.  The pad on the bottom, when wet, is a bit slippery.  It&#x27;s not an issue really.  It dries quickly and easily, and once it dries, it&#x27;s back to it&#x27;s normal grippy self.  But when wet, you could probably slide it down the counter like a frosty beer mug down a long bar top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side of that coin, I don&#x27;t know what other material wouldn&#x27;t have the same issue.  Say cork for instance may be just as slippery when wet, I have no idea.  Overall, you can&#x27;t beat this for the price asked.  You can pay double or more for the exact same look from another brand.  It doesn&#x27;t take much shopping around to see that.</li>
            <li> Good looking and great performing. Glad my brush can dry like it&#x27;s supposed to! Would recommend to anyone! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I wanted a chrome (not brushed nickel) stand for a vintage double-edged razor and badger brush. It had to have room for both, be under $25, and contain some style elements that matched my post-war bathroom.  This little stand had all of those features.  It came on time, and looks great.  In addition, it&#x27;s really solidly built and has a non-slip base.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> A very classic stand.  Solidly made and good looking.  Effectively holds my safety razor and brush.  Solid enough metal with a heavy base that keeps the stand from being knocked over.  This is obviously crafted of metal with no plastic parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand was shipped in a quick and timely fashion, well packaged.</li>
            <li> Compact and functional stand for shaving brush and razor. Since it&#x27;s important to hang your shaving brush upside (promotes longevity of the brush), this works well. It does gather water stains, but can easily be cleaned with a damp cloth.</li>
            <li> I love this razor and brush stand. It is heavy enough to be stable and the finish is very nice.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for someone. It came on time and seems like a solid purchase.</li>
            <li> Good build quality and exactly as advertised. Holds the brush and razor perfectly!</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured, arrived in good condition in the timeframe specified.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice stand that seems to fit any standard sized safety razor and brush. Looks great, and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband for his travel badger brush.  While it is a beautiful stand, the brush does not fit, so he can&#x27;t use it.  Before buying this, I tried to find a list of brushes that would fit this or dimensions, but couldn&#x27;t find any of that.  I would recommend the manufacturer list this information so others don&#x27;t have this issue as well.</li>
            <li> Holds my razor and brush and looks good</li>
            <li> it is a good basic stand. it could be and in or two taller as I prefer brushes with longer handles. But other than that for the price it is a nice stand.</li>
            <li> This was part of a Christmas wish list for our son. He was pleased; we haven&#x27;t heard any negatives, so the razor ensemble was a hit . Very quick delivery was also much appreciated.</li>
            <li> The razor stand was exactly as described! It fits a safety razor on one end and a brush on the other. My brush was the badger brush from the art of shaving. and it fits it well.&lt;br /&gt;Its nice that the entire thing can be taken apart (unscrewed) for storage/traveling, but the base is heavy enough to prevent tipping.&lt;br /&gt;High quality, would buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful.  It is sturdy and looks very good in my bathroom.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stand is very well made and looks fantastic. It really compliments my razor and shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Space is a premium in my small bathroom. The stand helps me save counterspace and it looks great.</li>
            <li> Quality product for a very fair price.</li>
            <li> This stand is for my son for Christmas.  I received it quickly and we&#x27;ll packaged.  It is as nice and in some instances nicer than more expensive ones.  I would highly recommend this gift and the vendor.</li>
            <li> Sturdy good quality. My dad loves it.</li>
            <li> Really good simple stand, it holds the long Merkur DE razor and an Escali badger brush</li>
            <li> Perfect match for my EJ DE89 razor. Looks like they were made for each other. Get it. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I needed to find a solid safety razor and brush stand and came across this as an option.  I must say this is excellent, and I would highly recommend as the build quality is solid.  For what you pay, you get value and much more.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works well and made well.</li>
            <li> Top quality and great value</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the quality of the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand. It was the perfect size for my razor and shaving brush. The stand is extremely sturdy and looks awesome sitting on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this stand for the quality is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent razor stand.  i could not be more pleased.  the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> The order was promptly filled and the razor and brush stand are exactly what I had expected. The stand seems to be well built and I fully expect to use it for many years. I would definitely purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> Fits my Escali brush and Parker handle.</li>
            <li> This stand looks fantastic in my bathroom! And it works great for holding my razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Fits my Mercur razor perfect, and brush sits just right.</li>
            <li> The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand has a great chrome plating. When you send something out to a chromer,you only hope it looks like this product when it comes back. The stand has also a great length and weight to it which prevents it from tipping over. The price is also very reasonable. I received the product in the indicated time and I a am overall very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice and stable. The weighty bottom keeps it in place and the metal finish looks nice in the bathroom. My wife&#x27;s actually asking me to get a matching shaving brush now!</li>
            <li> The quality is 5 stars but I only gave it three because I was led to believe by other reviews that it would fit my husbands Art of Shaving brush-but it doesn&#x27;t. The arm is just a tad but too small. The brush can be &amp;#34;hung&amp;#34; on it but not the appropriate way so it doesn&#x27;t look as clean and snazzy as I would have liked. The Art of Shaving Razor hangs and fits properly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stand because I have a few razors that are bigger than the average safety razor.  They fit on this stand perfectly.  All of my razors fit it (not at the same time, of course).  The stand is well built and looks great!  The seller was terrific!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great quality stand at a good price.</li>
            <li> Good quality stand. Does the job.</li>
            <li> The product is pretty much exactly what I asked for. Im not an expert that could point out the fine details that make it great or mediocre but it holds my razor and brush. Nothing is broken, smells bad, or makes a funny noise so I can&#x27;t imagine what would be disappointing about it. It looks exactly like it does in the picture so if you like it i recommend getting it.</li>
            <li> Chrome finish is beautiful and this stand looks fine in your shaving spot. The cost is lower than others of the same quality</li>
            <li> This stand works perfect with my razor and brush. The shipping was extremely fast. I would definitely order from Perella&#x27;s again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful stand that holds my long handled Mekur razor and shaving brush. Only complaint is that I wish the razor holder had a slight angle to better hold razor in place.</li>
            <li> Sturdy construction, looks nice. Holds a razor and brush no problem. Very easy to clean</li>
            <li> Nice stand. It is a gift for my husband and he loves it.  Holds his razor and brush.  Nice quality too.</li>
            <li> As a newbie to the world of classic DE and wet shaving I have been trying to assemble the products necessary. With a razor and brush stand being one of those items I chose the Escali because of the positive reviews and price point. And I have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;And my service through Perella&#x27;s has been exemplary. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The stand is exactly what it looks like in the picture.  I needed something to put my razor and brush on (wire hanger started to rust), so I bought the first decent looking stand.  It sits in my medicine cabinet.  My boar bristle brush I picked up at Walmart doesn&#x27;t fit, but a badger brush I picked up on Amazon fit&#x27;s just fine (it was the $13 one).  All in all, it does what I expect to.</li>
            <li> Very nicely made. Looks good!</li>
            <li> Well made. Classic elegance. Unfortunately, my brush handle is too wide.  Brush is precariously perched on top of hanger. Something to consider.</li>
            <li> Solid, attractive and well-made.  Well suited for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Really nice stand. Seems to be very sturdy and holds my shaving set well.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my husband and he enjoys it everyday!  Thank you for your speedy service and quality product!</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this stand!  It holds up very nicely and when I clean the mirror...this gets a cleaning too and it&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
            <li> Nice quality stand. Compliments my Merkur safety blade.</li>
            <li> Keeps the razor and brush firmly off the ground and isn&#x27;t cheaply made.  Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> Well made. Pleasing to the eye</li>
            <li> Beautiful stand of sturdy construction. I wish I got to use this more, but it holds my razor and brush diligently while I&#x27;m away, ready to go to work anew each morning. I dropped some cream on it once or twice and clean up was a breeze. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  The side to hold the razor is a little off for a disposable but perfect for old school strait razor.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect stand for you brush and razor.  Looks good.  Weighted properly so the stand is stable and functional.  Highly recommended this.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy great finish.</li>
            <li> A substantive piece that is both very functional and good looking.  High quality construction that has withstood months of use. It is there when you want/ need it.  A best, best buy...</li>
            <li> Some things like:&lt;br /&gt;The quality of chrome looks good&lt;br /&gt;The thickness of the forks is good. Heavy weight, not flimsy stamped out plated steel.&lt;br /&gt;My razor (merkur progress) and brush (also Escali) both fit well, with plenty of room underneath.&lt;br /&gt;If you like chrome, it looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;The base has a nice thick non-skid type high density foam in it, but I wish it had a chunk of brass in it to give it a bit more bottom end weight.&lt;br /&gt;There is no danger of it tipping, I&#x27;d just like it a bit heaver to stay planted when I bump it. I may fill it with casting resin.</li>
            <li> This stand is ideal for keeping your safety razor and badger hair shaving brush dry. The details on the stand match the Merkel Safety Razor we own. The stand is sturdy and well made and the bottom has a thick foam pad to prevent counter scratches.</li>
            <li> This stand looks classy and has a good durable feel to it. For the price it&#x27;s well worth it, and it beats having your razor and brush just sitting on the counter top.  It also matches my Merkur Classic Safety Razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> I use this as a stand for my mini-ego passthrough with a protank on it. It works great! It&#x27;s fairly heavy, so it doesn&#x27;t fall over easily.</li>
            <li> I treated myself to the brush, shaving cream, merkur blades and razor and stand made by The Art of Shaving. I am now getting a much smoother shave then ever before.  The initial investment is a little high but I have found that in the long run these products save money. The merkur blades are less expensive and last longer than the cartridges I was using. I just need a small amount of the shaving cream for each shave. I was so satisified that I sent my son the products as a gift. I would recommend these products to anyone who shaves.</li>
            <li> What can I say, its fits well with my boyfriend&#x27;s merker and new Parker lather brush. I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This exactly what the hubby wanted for his new razor. Very glad to have found it for a good price. Was packaged great and he is very happy. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great heft to it so no fear of falling. Handles my brush n razor easily, looks good and does the job I need. Easily do it again!</li>
            <li> good quality, adds to my masculine bath. I recommend for keeping shaving articles separate from other items and wife happy about bath appearance</li>
            <li> I just started wet shaving and i gotta, this is the best stand. The merkur heavy duty razor and escali brush fit perfectly on this stand.</li>
            <li> I wanted a razor and brush stand that would give off the classy 1920s/30s vibe that seemed to match with using a safety razor. This stand does the job. It fits my razor and brush perfectly, and looks damn good while it does it.</li>
            <li> I ordered for a gift for my husband and he was pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> The stand is just as described, very sturdy and looks great.  The razor and brush fit very well.  I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It is a nice stand with a beautiful chrome finish.  I have an Edwin Jagger with chrome finish displayed in it along with my badger brush.  I was slightly disappointed in the smaller stature of the stand.  I expected it to be slightly taller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand seems very sturdy and nicely weighted at the base.  I have read some of these style stands do not hold up well on the chrome finish.  I do hope this one will.  Time will tell.  Overall  it is very attractive and a nice product.  Do not expect it to be very tall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, looks nice and it looks like it will last for a long time. excellent for the price highly recommended</li>
            <li> Beautiful finish, and looks great. Fits my Murker razor and Parker brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> The stand is well built and looks great on my sink. It reminds me of the shaving stands that my father had.</li>
            <li> The razor and brush stand is a good looking, well built device. It holds my razor and brush well and allows them to drain and dry.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a reasonable price. Stand is well made and works exactly as intended.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand about 6 months ago and it sits on my bathroom counter top and it gets its fair share of abuse from a steamy environment.  In those 6 months it has not had any affect on the stand and when wiped down, still has that brand new chrome finish to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stand is solid and heavy and holds my Parker 24C, Parker 99R and Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor and Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush, Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush and a Boars Hair brush perfectly. I&#x27;ve purchased 2 more since and they arrived around Christmas and are doing great as well.  I highly recommend this stand. For the price you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I figured id give this a shot given the price vs the price of others that started above 50 bucks.  Ive had this for several months and it holds up just fine....no pitting amd cleans up easy.</li>
            <li> Solid stand. My safety razor doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly but it works.</li>
            <li> It works!  Enough said!</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Good value for money.</li>
            <li> Does the job and looks good,</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the quality and appearance of this stand. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works great. Nice and heavy, won&#x27;t fall over if you take the brush off and leave the razor hanging. Finish is very nice. I have a E.J. DE89 L  and tweezerman badger brush, fits both great.</li>
            <li> The stand does just what it is designed to do and looks great holding either my new razor or a vintage safety razor.</li>
            <li> Good product, just as described. Great addition.</li>
            <li> Very solid, well finished piece.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Highly recommended. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> high quality yet simple...very happy</li>
            <li> I ordered this stand for my son recently. He was very pleased with the quality and sturdiness of the product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I think this thing is great.  Substantial base.  Base has a thin foam bottom for grip.  Good chrome.  Good hardware.  I don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s made but it looks like it was done very well.  Glad I got it.  Now my brush can hang properly.  I had been using a makeshift noose out of dental floss.  Good to have the right stuff:)</li>
            <li> It works great! My razor&#x27;s held, my brush is held.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is it does not hold back my cat who likes to be closely involved with my morning shaving routine. Perhaps the cat needs a shave too?</li>
            <li> Excellent product from an American business - keeps the razor off the countertop at the same time provides a great aesthetic.  Very sturdy and strong!</li>
            <li> Really like this.  My brush (also a Escali) fits perfectly.  Very high quality.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to get this Razor and Brush Stand for a long time. Im glad that I finally got it. The badger brush was great and felt good against my face and Im excited to shave every now and then!. Thanks to Escali</li>
            <li> This was a good buy.  I have the Art of Shaving brush which fits in this stand if you place it on where the brush meets the handle.  No big deal for me, but for the perfectionist, this might be an issue.  I love that this stand looks expensive, but was very modestly priced.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $60 on an Art of Shaving stand.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality, looks fantastic, and is sturdy and feels substantive. Love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Functions well. Heavier base than expected but that&#x27;s a good thing! Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, heavy &amp; nicely chromed, good buy!</li>
            <li> My razor doesn&#x27;t fit in it (razor too large for the spacing) and my brush fits very loosely in the other side (brush not large enough).  The stand itself looks very nice just wish it was more adjustable</li>
            <li> Its nice and stable, recommended.</li>
            <li> purchased after seeing a similar one at the Art of Shaving store while purchasing a straight edged razor for my boyfriend. the one in the store was over $75. This works great and while it may not be $70 value, it definitely works wonderful for holding a razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Found something better and not made in China! Looks great, but looking for some made in USA or Germany!</li>
            <li> I needed a stand that would fit my brush (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P6KDHXG?refRID&#x3D;8Y3WJSTT3V100M533FF1&amp;ref_&#x3D;pd_rhf_cr_p_img_10) and many are just a tad bit too wide. This one is perfect. It also holds my Gillette Fusion perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great looking stand. It has a nice finish to it and feels sturdy. It holds my Escali Brush and Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl perfectly. The shipping from Perella&#x27;s was also fast and reasonable.</li>
            <li> Well made, looks great and holds my brush and safety razor well.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I tried to go without buying this stand but now am glad I did.  It holds my razor and brush safely out of the way.  The quality is excellent!</li>
            <li> The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush stand was received well within the time period. It&#x27;s an excellent piece with a lot of weight. Very happy</li>
            <li> This was a christmas gift for my husband.  He loves it!!  The construction is great and looks expensive.  i would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a razor/brush stand.</li>
            <li> Heavy, and durable. Better than the one sold at Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> Thanks it was perfect, as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Great stand - exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Works great, good quality, heavy.</li>
            <li> Scratched up out of the box not to mention doesn&#x27;t fit brush like many other customers have stated.</li>
            <li> Quickly delivered in time for Christmas, and it looks great!</li>
            <li> Quite sturdy and functional. Makes my sink area look neater. It just feels cleaner to have your razor &amp; brush up and off the counter, plus it allows proper drying of the brush. Fits my Merkur short handle razor and Escali brush perfectly. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my first razor and brush stand. I looked for a while at what was available and the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand stood out. This product is much more impressive in person. For under $20 I do not expect much. When you see how much you could spend on shaving accoutrement without necessarily understanding what you get for the extra money, this product delights. It is very well built, stable, packaged well and looks handsome enough to leave on the counter. It holds my brush and razor relatively high-up and looks like this would allow it to accommodate for many razor and brush shapes without tipping. It is chrome so expect to see water spots and smudges so plan to wipe it down if that kind of thing bothers you - it sure gleams easily when you quickly towel it off. I was planning on storing it all in a drawer, but my wife liked the way it all looked and so it decorates the bathroom counter. Don&#x27;t think too hard about this. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Can&#x27;t really complain, nice finish.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself.  Loved it so much, I bought another one for my son.</li>
            <li> great product. works just like it was advertised. looks very sharp on the sink and my wife likes seeing it</li>
            <li> Fantastic stand for razor and brush. Sturdy and clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it. Not much else to say, it does its job.</li>
            <li> works great with Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl and Escali Badger brush.  Quick delivery too!!</li>
            <li> Nicely made stand for reasonable price.Good weight,easy to clean and fit my Simply Beautiful Badger shaving Brush</li>
            <li> Good balance for brush and silver handle razor..  Sturdy. Does not tip over.l</li>
            <li> I really like this stand.  It&#x27;s very simple but it works.  It&#x27;s just overall a very nice product and fits my Parker 99R and my Escali Brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stand, I would have like the base to have been heavier although it is weighted enough to keep from falling over when one side is in use.</li>
            <li> This stand feels solid and looks good with a chrome razor and lather brush.  Been using it a few weeks and no complaints.</li>
            <li> This stand is great for keeping and caring for your razor and bristol brush. It does not take up alot of space. It is well built and sturdy and looks nice. The price was right, so I now own 2 of these stands.</li>
            <li> The stand is essential if you want to properly dry a shaving brush.  The stand is decorative and functional.  It looks good and holds one razor and my badger hair brush.  I would reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and it looks great as well. What more could you want? A nice addition to the shave den.</li>
            <li> I love this stand.  It&#x27;s simple, yet an attractive addition to the vanity.  My Escali badger brush and Merkur 34C razor fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Solid stand that looks great as part of any shave kit. Sturdy stand holds my heavy DE safety razor without toppling over and the finish is excellent.</li>
            <li> My husband just loved this new stand he received for his birthday. The product is solidly made with masculine detailing. Looks very nice sitting on our sink top. My husband&#x27;s Merkur safety razor and boar tip brush both fit the stand nicely. If you are looking for a wonderfully crafted and aesthetically pleasing stand the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand is awesome!</li>
            <li> This stand goes perfectly with my stainless brush and safety razor. It appears to be well made and offers sufficient heft to resist tipping over when the brush or razor are removed.  The stand holds the items at the right height so that they don&#x27;t touch the counter top or other parts of the stand. I was afraid that it&#x27;s proximity to the messy items and it&#x27;s shiny surface would require frequent cleaning/maintenance, but that has not been the case.</li>
            <li> This is a very stable stand,  It holds my Parker 99r Long handled razor with about an inch and a half to spare.  The picture does not do it justice in regards to the flat piece on top where the brush and razor hang from.  It is thicker and heavier than how it looks in the picture.  That&#x27;s just my opinion of the picture.</li>
            <li> The handle on the current shaving brush I have does not fit the stand, the handle is too large.  However, I like the stand itself and will keep it so that when I purchase a shave brush from Parker it will hopefully fit the stand.</li>
            <li> If you have a boar bristle brush you need this stand. Sturdy and allows the brush to drain properly so it has a longer life.</li>
            <li> very high quality needed it for razor and brush glad I did</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and stylish.  Just with my Fusion Proglide with Flexball razor fit better.</li>
            <li> Quick Delivery, Product as Described</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband- he&#x27;s doing the MoVember beard and/or mustache grow to bring awareness to men&#x27;s cancer.  The stand is great, very sturdy and looks nice on the counter.</li>
            <li> Very good brush, makes shaving a pleasure</li>
            <li> It holds my Merkur razor like nobody&#x27;s business, and the stand matches it and brush I have, so all is well except for two things: 1) the weight at the bottom  (it isn&#x27;t visible unless you disassemble the stand) is iron, so it gets rusty if you leave water on it, and 2) the side for the brush is too narrow. I&#x27;m not taking any stars away for that because I didn&#x27;t look it up before I bought it, but it&#x27;s something to look into, especially if you&#x27;re a newcomer to the &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34; shaving products like I am. As far as I know, I bought a standard-sized brush.</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose well. Attractive and well made.</li>
            <li> Classy stand for razor &amp;  brush</li>
            <li> It works and its nice.  A cheaper one would do the same thing, but this one is aesthetically very nice and sturdy</li>
            <li> Just what I need to keep my shaving stuff stored.  It&#x27;s substantially buiilt and attractive.</li>
            <li> Great stand, very solid and balanced.  No problem recommending this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the hubs and his razor + brush he just picked up from the Art of Shaving.....and far less cost.  He&#x27;s as happy as can be with it.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels very sturdy.  You have to keep wiping it just since it is susceptible of water spots.  This can also be a great gift.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my safety razor and shaving brush. The stand is stylish and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Stand itself is a real beauty, only issue is only certain brushes will fit the brush holder when hanging up side down as recommended to maintain shape</li>
            <li> Excellent stand. Appears to be much more expensive than its actual value. Holds my merkur 180 and Parker brush nicely!</li>
            <li> DOES NOT FIT GILLETTE ART OF SHAVING BRUSH. Otherwise its very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two razor and brush stands, one for myself, I was very impressed, then ordered the second as a gift.They are both very well crafted and weighted, I recommend to anyone who uses safety razors, brushes (or any other kind) to keep this in mind. If I could give more stars I would!</li>
            <li> Fits my razor and brush perfectly, looks fantastic and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son and he is absolutely loving it he thanks me every time he uses it.</li>
            <li> It does its job, It&#x27;s nice to look at, and it came at a decent price.  I recommend years of extensive martial arts training before attempting to use it as a weapon however.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with Escali Badger Brush. 0 complaints. 100% satisfaction.</li>
            <li> This Escali stand exceeded my expectations. It is well built with a good heavy base that won&#x27;t tip over. Polished chrome also looks great. That being said, this is the best price you will find for such a quality razor/brush stand. I&#x27;ll buy from this company again!</li>
            <li> so far looks great, solid and has good weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks and feel as promised.  Fits my brush and razor well.</li>
            <li> The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand is perfect for my needs.  This product is very high quality with a well designed heavy base that ensures stability.  I unequivocally  recommend this product if you are in the market for a well made brush and razor stand.</li>
            <li> Excellent stand that perfectly fits my brush and my razer with plenty of space between floor and brush. Feels sturdy and looks very nice and high quality. Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Works with my razor (Harry&#x27;s) and brush (Escali). Very stable and easy to clean. Purchased from Perella&#x27;s and I experienced a fast and well-packaged delivery!</li>
            <li> This stand is quite heavily made. I was surprised with the quality. It does exactly what it was made for and does it extremely well.</li>
            <li> The stand feels very solid and well built.  Has a nice weight to it. Holds the shave brush nicely as well as my razor.</li>
            <li> Nice quality but some added weight in the base would be nice.</li>
            <li> Great little stand!  I put my brush (Escali brush bought on Amazon) on one side and my razor on the other.  It&#x27;s that simple.  It sits in my shower on one of my shelves and has held up for a couple months now just fine.  BTW I use a regular razor (Dorco Razors on Amazon are very inexpensive and very good!) and it fits into the little slot perfectly and hangs just right.  This stand is a best seller for a reason.  Very sturdy and looks nice.</li>
            <li> Solid and looks good.  Great for displaying my razor and shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This stand feels very solid. I have a long-handled Merkur razor and this holds it fine. The base has good weight to it so it doesn&#x27;t slip around the counter. I was worried that the metal hook portion might be weak, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and a beautiful compliment for my husbands razor.</li>
            <li> HIgh quality stand,  exactly as described. Vendor shipped promptly. Well done.</li>
            <li> Excellent stand that easily holds a brush and safety razor. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with the brush or razor falling off the stand or the stand tipping over. Very well balanced and weighted. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality at reasonable price. Attractive, perfect height, weight, finish. Base is solid with a well crafted cushioned bottom. Brush hanger accommodates my 50 year old Ever Ready full sized brush and my AOS travel brush. Razor side should fit any DE or SE razor made (except perhaps the Merkur Futur or Vision; haven&#x27;t tried those).</li>
            <li> The product was perfectly adequate, and was exactly as described. It holds my razor and my brush, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> This razor/brush stand does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it well in a visually appealing package. Everything seems to be constructed sturdily and the chroming has held up after a month. The base is also pretty heavy which makes it hard to accidentally knock over. Excellent price too, considering that the Art of Shaving store wanted to charge me $80 for essentially the same thing.</li>
            <li> This razor stand is very well made and looks attractive sitting on the bathroom counter.  The base is nice and heavy, so tipping over is never a problem.  My only issue with it is that the opening on the side that holds the shaving brush is a little narrow.  My shaving brush is a tight fit in this stand, but otherwise I have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as part of a fund raiser raffle for the hospital at which I work. When I received it, I was very happy with its appearance and with its weight, balance, and stability. Should I ever decide to go with a shaving brush -- and I think I will, eventually -- I intend to get one of these for myself.</li>
            <li> The price of shaving has gotten ridiculous, so I looked into the alternatives. I&#x27;m the kind of guy who will go miles out of my way, just to keep moving rather than stew in bumper to bumper traffic. A few months ago I took the plunge back in time. I learned on the safety razor, so had no particular fear of it.  Did some due diligence and bought a German safety razor, shaving cream in a tube, a styptic pencil, a hundred blades that last me about 2 weeks at a cost around 20 cents each, a badger brush and this stand.  My total investment was about $80.  The safety razor is not the rickety trap door type and I don&#x27;t foresee needing replacement ever.  Not sure how long I can expect the $10 brush to last, but if I live long enough, I believe the savings in blades will show a profit over \\&quot;modern\\&quot; shaving.  Not a significant amount, that&#x27;s why I mentioned the driving the extra miles to at least not hating the drive. The satisfaction is a little like if I had found a way to extend one gallon of gas into 3 and drive a larger, better car for less in the long run than my little 4 cylinder.  The shave is better by far. Expect a few scrapes early on, but it gets better in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the stand. It is a lovely, I mean masculine, addition to my vanity. Well weighted, with the substantial razor and the brush on I have not come close to knocking it over. The prongs are bent upward slightly to keep from too easily knocking  the razor and brush off accidently.  It can still be done, but has not quite happened to me yet. It needs to be wiped dry almost every use to keep it looking sexy because water gets on it and will leave water marks, easily removed from the highly polished finish.  I suspect it will also prevent corrosion, I suspect.  It&#x27;s not quite \\&quot;universal\\&quot;. I enjoyed my experience so much that I purchased a shaving \\&quot;set\\&quot; as a gift  that included this stand. The brush that came with it was a marble handled one that was just a millimeter or two wide, so the brush had to be forced into the stand with 2 hands.  With a hammer, I was able to spread the prongs enough to slip in easily.</li>
            <li> Unexpectedly high quality for the price. Nice chrome and very weighty. No rattles when I set my razor or brush down on it</li>
            <li> It holds my brush and razor. It is awesome to not have them laying around the sink. Says my wife.</li>
            <li> I like it. I still had it from 2 days so i still don&#x27;t knwo if it&#x27;s going to be durable but so far it looks ok. It holds my brush fine and the razor. Feels heavy as well.</li>
            <li> I love it. It fits the brush I have which is medium size as well as the Merkur razor. nice look and clean look.</li>
            <li> From the picture I though the stand would be smaller, but when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised by how sturdy it really is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and feels sturdy. I would like it to have a soap bowl attachment though.</li>
            <li> It looks great and displays my brush and razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband and it looks as great as the fancy shave brand store for less than half the price !</li>
            <li> This has a very nice weight to it and a very nice chrome finish. I am very happy with this purchase and recommend this to anyone looking for an attractive, well built stand for your razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting. Fits my brush and razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> Well made, heavy holds my razor and brush just fine.</li>
            <li> good quality material, however, my only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold the Mach III razor as securely as I hope. Have to have it balanced just right, otherwise it falls. Or maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use the stand properly.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how the chrome holds up, but so far it works as advertised.  It has some heft to it so it is stable and has no tendency to tip over.</li>
            <li> Very nice piece. Nice heavy construction. Chrome is shiny and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> I ordered the item from looking at the picture and knowing that if I wasn&#x27;t happy with it, I could return it without any problems.  I&#x27;m  was very happy about the quality and the price.  I would order again in a heart beat from this Company. Love the stand and it looks great on my vanity.</li>
            <li> Gave old razor and brush a little class. Nice solid piece with good looks and function.</li>
            <li> Great stand. Fairly heavy and very solid. Fits my Weber bulldog and art of shaving brush just fine.</li>
            <li> Got mine for my birthday. It functions perfectly &amp; looks good-shiny &amp; sleek. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this razor stand.  It looks really good on my countertop.  It&#x27;s nice and heavy and well-crafted.  It holds my razor and brush and allows them to dry.  Great design and great utility.  I highly recommend it!  Pete</li>
            <li> The stand was perfect for my Merkur razor and my Parker brush.  The weight is great.  This is definitely the way to if you want to keep you razor and brush in good condition.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stand. It keeps my brush and razor dry in the shower until I need them. It looks great and the base is heavy enough that it is secure. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and I love it!</li>
            <li> This stand is sturdy, looks very nice, and fits a Merkur long handled safety razor and an EscalI badger brush beautifully.</li>
            <li> This really worked out. The man in my life has a custom shave brush, so finding something that would fit was key. I had to gamble and picked this one. It fits most brush sizes that I&#x27;ve encountered, and most razors also fit on the other end too. It&#x27;s very streamlined looking and doesn&#x27;t class with the decorative items that I have on the sink in our bathroom (which aren&#x27;t much really, but they are a different metal).It&#x27;s not wobbly, so it doesn&#x27;t keel over. I haven&#x27;t tried it with heavier brushes or razors, but I feel that if I stick to brushes that are NOT made of heavy stone- this will be ok. Super easy to clean though the velvet bottom catches dirt and gunk. It&#x27;s not really that bad and only someone that is really OCD would notice.</li>
            <li> Works for myour merkur future and escali brush and looks great on my sink!</li>
            <li> Durable construction, as advertised.</li>
            <li> My husband saw this stand and immediately wanted it. It is sturdy and very good quality. The package arrived timely and in good condition. I recommend this brand and the seller</li>
            <li> Got my stand in the mail fast! Definitely like it and it comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Way sturdier than I originally anticipated. Goes perfectly with my chrome razor.</li>
            <li> The quality and price are self evident with this product. I am very satisfied with this purchase,and have no doubt that it will help preserve my high quality razor and brush for as long as I remember to hang them on Escali&#x27;s well finished Razor and Brush stand.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stand.  Well made, sturdy, and has a very nice look.  The chrome is smooth and well done.  It is a classy addition to our bathroom and, although he has only had it for a month, I expect he will get many years of use out of it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this.  I bought him this to replace one that was old and broken.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase, especially for the money!  The stand has a solid heavy base that stays put when you remove and replace your brush and razor, it doesn&#x27;t slide around, it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s glued in place on your counter top.</li>
            <li> Very high quality with a heavy stable base. My Merkur razor and Escali brush fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I got this stand in hopes it&#x27;d work with my Merkur razor and Omega brush. When it arrived, I was rather surprised by its sturdiness; do not let the pictures fool you - it has heft and feels very solid when standing on the counter or when held by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Merkur razor fit perfectly in the smaller u-hook, however my Omega brush did not fit in the bigger u-hook when I tried to hang it by its base; the plastic handle of the brush is too thick even in it&#x27;s slimmest spot to fit. Instead, I hang it by the base of the bristles and while it works fine and dries just fine - some may perceive it as a bit of an eye sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s nearly impossible to test the stand with every brush make and model out there but... it is what it is.</li>
            <li> Simple, elegant and well constructed. There are no tacky logos which I appreciate. The frame is solid. I have only had it for ~2 months, but rust doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue. Well done.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the look of this item.  It holds my razor and brush very well and is really nice to look at.  My wife actually complimented me on the choice.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of these available but this stand is not that expensive and is a natural companion in fit and finish for any Merkur Razor and happens to mate perfectly to the Parker Black Handled 100% Badger Bristle Shaving Brush. Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son for Christmas. He loves it! Great stand for a great price. Good choice.</li>
            <li> it helped me tidy up my bathroom sink area&lt;br /&gt;before this I had my razor brush everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;gotta have it</li>
            <li> Great product and gives very smooth shave!</li>
            <li> This is a very good looking piece that seems very sturdy. It holds my razor and my brush and is nice enough to keep out on display in the bathroom even when we have guests. I almost feel proud to show off my fancy shaving tools and have them look so neat. It seems like it will last a long time and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I don&#x27;t believe it was necessarily the cheapest stand on Amazon, but the prior reviews did not steer me wrong. I would make the same purchase again in a heartbeat. Hope it works for you too!</li>
            <li> it looks great, and was heavy enough to support my bf&#x27;s razor and brush. he had an escali brand brush, and an art of shaving razor. the brush fit perfect, and the grip on the razor actually matched the design on the stand perfectly too</li>
            <li> Quality feel. Like other reviewers mentioned, this product has a great weight to it, and it&#x27;s very sturdy. The finish looks well (only time will tell on that).</li>
            <li> I bought this stand a couple weeks ago now and have had nothing to complain about since. The box it arrived in was not glamorous, but who is keeping the box??&lt;br /&gt;The stand itself does the job of holding my safety razor and brush. I have not noticed anything that even hints of instability in the design, or any product flaws.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say worth the money if you want your shaving set to look nice and be a little better taken care of.</li>
            <li> Great stand that holds my brush and razor without any problems. Nice and minimal look too, I love it !</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase, the stand is chrome and looks and works great. The bottom is heavy so it will not fall over and looks good sitting on the sink cabinet</li>
            <li> This is my first razor stand, having recently taken up the traditional art of shaving with a safety razor. I knew I wanted something functional, sturdy, and aesthetically pleasing, this product was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> The Escali Stand holds the brush, it holds the razor, it cleans up easy, it looks nice, and works for me!</li>
            <li> I purchased a Merkur Classic Safety Razor and Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush with this stand and it all fits great!  The finish is nice, compact and doesn&#x27;t over take my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This stand is simple and functional. I am new to wet shaving and this stand does exactly what it should do and it doesn&#x27;t take up that much space.</li>
            <li> This item is unspectacular ... and that&#x27;s a good thing.  it has one job, to stand there holding a brush and razor, and it does that job well.  Its color will blend with most bathrooms and it matches my razor.  The base is heavy to prevent tipping and the construction feels solid.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor and brush stand to.. hold my razor and brush! It does exactly that, and nothing more. The chrome finish is very nice and compliments my master bathroom nicely, as well as holding both the razor and brush off the counter. It&#x27;s a beautiful piece that accents very well, and am very happy for the easy and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Item just as described. Fast shipping, heavy weight craftsmanship.  Great chroming, matches my DE razor well. No imperfections and would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I needed to get this after started DE shaving. I was placing the razor and brush on the counter to dry. This stand looks nice and can handle the weight of the heavy razor. The stand feels and looks like high quality.</li>
            <li> Very heavy and deluxe...happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Good design, functional and easy to clean. I only wish it would hang the razor upside down. Glad I got it!</li>
            <li> A very well made stand.  Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my Harry&#x27;s razor!</li>
            <li> is what it is. matches the razor and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I use this for my DE razor and badger brush.  Looks great and does a good job.  Good buy overall, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted; nothing more, nothing less.  Perfectly weighted, this stand will last for many years.</li>
            <li> Nice piece for the price and it works great.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Works perfectly with my Merker long-handled double-edge safety razor and Escali boar-hair brush. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Fits my razor (Harry&#x27;s) and my brush (Escali). Looks good while doing its job.</li>
            <li> This stand was a great addition to the bathroom, but be sure to double check it with your products. It fits my Gillette Fusion razor perfectly, but my brush is too small.</li>
            <li> My own fault, it is too short for a standard brush from e shave. Had too place on small pedestle</li>
            <li> I purchased this stand because it was mentioned in reviews of the two items I purchased for use with it. Both the Edwin Jagger DE89LBL Lined Double Edged safety razor and the Edwin Jagger Best Badger Brush fit perfectly into the slots for them. The base is sturdy as well. Great Product.</li>
            <li> sturdy and handsome. This stand holds any type of razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. I now have 2 of them.</li>
            <li> Product is as good as advertised.  My 1961 Gillette Fatboy and Thater brush fit perfectly on it.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice item. The base is heavy enough that it will not tip over easy. It look&#x27;s great and hold&#x27;s all of my razor&#x27;s and brushes just fine. Everyone that see&#x27;s it alway&#x27;s admires it&#x27;s beauty. Thank&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Great product. High-quality workmanship.</li>
            <li> Very nice weight and beautiful addition to my bathroom counter. Would recommend to any novice or pro with a razor and badger brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  One of the finest stands I have.  Very shiny and clean...and stays that way.  A real beauty.  Very proud to show off in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> My bf really loved this stand. It holds his set nicely and neatly.</li>
            <li> Beautiful,solid and functional product!</li>
            <li> Great product. The base is weighted enough to sit where I put and not move around when I&#x27;m removing/storing my razor and brush. The stainless look goes with my brushed nickel fixtures well, I imagine it would not detract from any bathroom decor.</li>
            <li> Arrived as described great weight to it. Looks great holding my razor and brush on bathroom sink. Would recommend company and will buy from again.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking. Holding well brush and razor.</li>
            <li> The stand looks quite classy and simple. It doesn&#x27;t slip, is very balanced and secure, and is a good universal size for holding my Merkur Safety Razor &amp; Escali Brush (though I expected this one to fit appropriately).</li>
            <li> Very nicely weighted stand, fits razor and brush perfectly, overall well made.</li>
            <li> Product as described.  Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It keeps my DE razor and brush organized and I especially like the bottom padding that lifts the stand up a little to prevent water from gathering there.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Perfect size for my brush and razor. Sturdy with a big enough base to not tip but not too large that it takes up all the counter space.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend and it was of very sturdy material not cheap metal. It holds the razor and brush perfectly and looks amazing. Also it arrived at a very fast speed.</li>
            <li> Who says you have to spend a lot of money on a stand in order to reap the benefits.  First off, if you are not using a stand with your brush and safety razor stop right now and buy one.  This holds both my Merkur razor and Escali badger brush perfectly and is very stable, couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  This is relatively inexpensive compared to some other products I&#x27;ve seen that all do the same thing, if you&#x27;re not looking to spend a lot of money for aesthetics, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Great safety razor. Nicked myself not at all. Looking for better blades- may try the Japanese ones next time- not as smooth a shave as the 3 or 4 blade disposables, but with good soap, it is much more of a pleasure.</li>
            <li> When my wife saw this item next to our sink, she commented on how good it looked. And it works, too!</li>
            <li> This razor and brush stand is shiny, well constructed, and holds my razor and brush nicely. As an added bonus, I get to look both retro and hipster at the same time because I can now display my double-edged safety razor shaving accoutrement to all who enter my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I use this for my badger hair brush and my Merkur safety razor.  It is a solid stand and presents very well.  I&#x27;m pleased with the cost and quality.</li>
            <li> This is a very simple but sturdy stand.  It fit my brush very well, but the razor kept slipping out of it&#x27;s holder.  I applied two short pieces of heat-shrink sleeving to each side of the razor holder, and now it stays put.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Good solid feel and heft. Holds my Escali Brush and Muhle Safety Razor. Cleans easily as well. Good product.</li>
            <li> The stand is great for my shaving collection. It fits my razor and brush with no problems. Overall the quality is great at an affordable price. Could not of asked for a better deal. Thank you</li>
            <li> worked fine for my brush but my gillette razor did not fit.</li>
            <li> Great item, excellent</li>
            <li> Stand is sturdy and it fits my razor and brush perfectly. I also like how it disassembles for travel.</li>
            <li> Before buying this stand I read other Amazon reviews and initially thought that I should go for a more expensive one, which presumably would be more balanced and better all around. I was glad to see how this razor and brush stand is very stable and works perfectly with my new Merkur razor and Escali brush. The fine polished stainless steel finish looks great. An added bonus is that you&#x27;ll be buying from an American company.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the stand. It has a solid feel, stable base, and fits my 4&amp;#34; long safety razor.</li>
            <li> Great style and look.  Since changing to a straight safety razor, the stand is a must.  It allows me to properly store both my razor and shaving brush.  Great to know I am supporting an American company by purchasing a high quality product.</li>
            <li> This is a real joy because it simply works and is of high quality. It is sturdy and compact. Should have bought it long time ago!</li>
            <li> This is a great stand for my razor and brush.  It looks good - a definite must have for the man transitioning out of being a college bachelor into a polished professional grown up. The stand has a nice weight to it matching the heft of my razor.  Arrived on time with no issues.</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s elegant,light weight yet steady, holds both razor and brush very nice</li>
            <li> It fit the brush I had before and the Merkel Razor perfectly. Nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> Great razor and brush stand; delivered on time</li>
            <li> This stand holds the shaving equipment nicely, allowing it to dry properly.  I have worked in a machine shop, and I appreciate the quality of the knurling, the dressing of the edges, and the quality of the plating.</li>
            <li> Great quality and sturdy stand from a small American business. My long handled Merkur fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, not made of cheap material of cheaply built. Would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Product was well made. I purchased two for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Good looking stand, I leave it out on the counter.</li>
            <li> Everything I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Clean, cheap, and sturdy. Had some friends over and some legit said &amp;#34;You have the most luxurious shaver/brush stand&amp;#34; haha, worth it.</li>
            <li> The stand looks, good, but it doesn&#x27;t fit the brush that I bought to go with the stand. I probably should&#x27;ve looked into it a bit more before buying it, but I really have to shove my brush in there to get it to stay, and it doesn&#x27;t really fit.</li>
            <li> Great stand, holds my grandfathers 50 year old razor, and my shaving brush. On top of it all, it looks great.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Has a nice weight and has made my wife happy by dressing up my space in the bathroom. Good purchase all in all.</li>
            <li> Very well made, easy to luster and clean, not sure how the bottom base(against sink surface) will do if it gets wet (it&#x27;s a foam)</li>
            <li> This does what it should and for a fraction (25%?) of the cost of a certain popular men&#x27;s shaving store that is spreading around the country. Tip : if you want to shave like your grandfather, you can be pretty sure he wouldn&#x27;t pay $100+ on a razor and brush holder (if he even used one).</li>
            <li> Great quality and very functional, heavy enough so that razor and brush to not tip over.... completely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> After many years of electric razor shaving I&#x27;ve returned to double edge razors and Italian soaps.  Part of the experience of double edge shaving is the pleasure of owning a quality razor and brush to enhance the experience.  Next I needed a stand to store my razor and brush when not in use.  The Escali stand is a perfect choice for my needs.  I was surprised by its heft allowing the razor and brush to be displayed yet they weren&#x27;t in jeopardy of falling off or flipping the stand on its side.  Its chrome finish is of a premium quality and matches the high luster of my razor&#x27;s finish.  An added bonus is its American Made pedigree. I like that.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great product!</li>
            <li> Disappointing, to say the least. Nicely made, but brush holder limits the size of the brush to very small handled brushes. Of the four brushes I own, only one—my least favorite—fits within the holder as designed. This may be a problem with ALL razor stands, but, in the mean time I may search for a brush that does, WHEN necessary.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, great quality!</li>
            <li> Love this stand.  Simple and inexpensive, but does the job well.</li>
            <li> I can understand why it&#x27;s a best seller... the stand is nicely plated, sturdy and compact with ample fit for my razor and brush (Merkur long handled razor and Escali brush). My wife certainly thinks it&#x27;s attractive and I agree!</li>
            <li> Had to replace it, because it cant hold a Merkur Slant stably</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as I had hoped. The base plate came loose as soon as I opened the package.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for since going to a shaving brush. It holds my razor and brush just fine and looks good doing it. Really good weight and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Looks good on the counter, keeps my shaving brush dry and gives me a safe place to keep my razor.</li>
            <li> Very Nice and Sturdy Stand - Delivered for Supplier (not Amazon) Quickly.  Recommended.  Holds Soap Brush and Razor (Gillette Sensor Excel) Nicely.</li>
            <li> This is a good stand for your brush and DE razor. Good weight on the bottom so there is no chance of tipping. Ascetically pleasing. Had it for 4 months now without any wear or tarnish.</li>
            <li> This is a nice standard sized brush and razor holder perfect for holding a brush and razor.  It looks really nice too</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving, I ordered the razor, Astra blades and soap and all is going so well, I ordered my brother the same thing.</li>
            <li> I received the stand in just a few days and gave it to my husband for Christmas.  The stand is absolutely beautiful! It is more impressive than the photo. I will definitely shop with this vendor again.</li>
            <li> This is my first razor and brush stand. I got it because I wanted to try out shaving with a safety razor. I find it&#x27;s simple and out of the way. I had no problem fitting my tweezerman brush and merkur model 180 on the stand. It doesn&#x27;t tip over. It doesn&#x27;t move. Can&#x27;t complain about.</li>
            <li> Just got into safety razor shaving and this guy holds my brush and razor perfectly</li>
            <li> Nothing much to report.  It keeps my Merkur 180 and my brush elevated to dry and allows the brushes to hang upside down to avoid harming the bristles.  It has a small footprint on the vanity and keeps my razor at-hand when I am rinsing my face between passes.</li>
            <li> This stand goes great with my Merkur razor and looks great. The quality is very good and would be great for anyone.</li>
            <li> Very nice and solid stand.  It complements the Merkur Double-Edge Razor nicely (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;ox_ya_os_product).  It has a polished chrome finish that matches my Merkur DE Razor. So far so good!</li>
            <li> Over the last several months I&#x27;ve done a lot of searching for the right stand. I have well water and this gift was for my teen son who isn&#x27;t easy on any product he owns.&lt;br /&gt;This hasn&#x27;t corroded because of the hard water.&lt;br /&gt;Its still together one month later and still sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit I was concerned about the ends that hold the brush and razor, they are stronger than the picture leads them to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are made for a real razor and not a bic by the way. I wanted to teach my son about razors and the value of a good shave after reading about them. He said he&#x27;s noticed a huge improvement in his skin since switching.&lt;br /&gt;Investing in the right tools really do matter.</li>
            <li> This is a great stand.  It feels well built, very solid.  It fits my Merkur 180 Long Handle Razor perfectly.  The opening for the brush is a bit narrow for a lot of brushes (someone posted that it is 24mm wide, it looks about right but I didn&#x27;t measure myself).  My Van Der Hagen badger brush didn&#x27;t fit, but I&#x27;m working on purchasing a brush from Whippeddog.com that should fit just fine.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. As advertised, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Great product for a cheaper price.  Works just as well as the overly expensive products and is balances so it doesnt tip over.</li>
            <li> I ordered the piece along with a shaving brush.  the brush fit the stand but my razor did not. I can&#x27;t put my razor on it.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product far exceeded my highest expectations.  I use to have a stand very similar that cost over 100 dollars, lost it while moving, bought this one just as a quick replacement until I made a trip back to Europe.  Well next time I go to Europe I wont need to buy a new one because this is better and more stable than the one I bought for over 100 dollars over seas.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a stand with an amazing finish that is sturdy, and all for a great price!</li>
            <li> This stand is exactly as advertised.  High-quality and solid construction.  Easily holds my brush and DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base is weighted which helps stabilize the stand. Unless I bump it, there is no danger the stand will fall over.  There is also a rubber sole to the base which helps to keep the stand in one spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chrome cleans up very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all it has a simple and elegant design so my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t mind if I leave it out between shaves.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for a month and it reminds me of chrome plated brass fixtures from houses built 100 years ago.  I was just prompted for a review and so I took it apart.  Inside the base is a cast iron weight with a high quality foam pad glued to the bottom.  Over that goes a stamped (probably chrome plated brass) metal cover that is thickly chrome plated completely inside and out.  Even the inside you would never normally see is plated.  There is a 1\\&quot; piece of all-thread that screws into the cast iron base, through the stamped metal cover into the upright shaft.  There is another 1\\&quot; piece of all-thread which screws into the top of the shaft, through the flange that holds the razor and brush, and into a acorn nut--the top of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made just like you would think, just like it would have been 100 years ago and for the most part out of quality materials that would have been used 100 years ago.  I&#x27;ve tested all pieces with a magnet and the only parts that are not non-metallic are the cast iron base weight (which is necessary and a good design feature) and the two short pieces of all-thread that fit into either end of the shaft to hold it all together--not a good design feature.  They appear to be plated to look like brass, but they are definitely magnetic.  I would think it would be easy to make this product with brass all-thread, but I still give it 5 stars.  With some spit and polish, this product will have value in 50 or 100 years.  This is not Wal-Mart/3rd World crap.</li>
            <li> I purchased the merkur model 180 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o05_s01_i01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and found that the detail on the metal matches the detail on the razor, so that was an added plus! Does it&#x27;s job well, and looks good while doing so. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> love it. It fits the brush I have which is medium size as well as the Edwin Jagger razor. nice look and clean look.</li>
            <li> This stand fits my Merkur 180 and Escali brush perfectly. It feels like it&#x27;s solidly built, and I expect it to last a good while.</li>
            <li> The chrome finish &amp; texture is a perfect match for my Merkur Heavy Duty #34C razor &amp; is the perfect size &amp; compliment for my Escali badger hair brush. Stunning looks &amp; built to last.</li>
            <li> The stand has no rust or pits and retains shine with just a quick swipe of dry cloth.  Would recommend this and would buy it again but I don&#x27;t think it will wear out.</li>
            <li> I recently went back to shaving with a blade rather than electric. I wanted a stand so that my brush would not sit on the shelf to drip and also have the bristles get warped. This fits the bill perfectly.  It holds a brush and a Gilette razor with no problems. It has not tipped over after more than a month of use. The base does not show excessive water spotting, although naturally there is some.  Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I like the stand for my razor and brush.  The only issue is that the brush holder is a tight fit on my &amp;#34;super large&amp;#34; boar bristle brush.  I would have no concerns buying it again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, simple and sturdy stand. I purchased a safety razor and brush as part of a shaving kit that I have as a gift. Rave reviews on all the pieces, and this little stand fit in very nicely with the set.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased the Escali stainless razor and brush stand. very very convenient . Excellent stand, a lot of bangfor the Buck!! Looks super !! And very sturdy. Would buy it again !!</li>
            <li> Well-constructed, at a good price -- sometimes when you buy a kit the stand is where they skimp. With this one, you&#x27;ll have a solid stand.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged. Quality product.  My Tweezerman brush and multi-blade razor fit perfectly. Sufficiently heavy so will not tip over on its rubber base. Beautiful chrome finish too. Can&#x27;t think of any cons. Well worth the price. Most of all it passed the &amp;#34;wife test.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really like the heavy base and chrome plating. It is heavy enough so as not to be knocked over easily. The chrome plating looks to be very high quality and should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Very happy for this very well made stand, that I proudly have on display on my bathroom counter. Read several reviews, and took a chance on this Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.  Ordering was simple, arrived on time. Was packed very well, and was in its own, very nice box box. VERY well done from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it has some weight on the bottom, which keeps everything secure. I would recommend this product for it&#x27;s quality to anyone looking for a stand.</li>
            <li> This stand looks amazing with my Escali shaving brush and Merkur razor. It&#x27;s like they came in a set. Very high quality, very heavy and very shiiiiiny.</li>
            <li> Have had this for a year now and it&#x27;s great. Everything I could hope for.</li>
            <li> Looks great in the bathroom and it takes up less space.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor/brush stand. Purchased for son, fits his shave gear perfect.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price. Looks classy and functions great. Comes apart for travel.</li>
            <li> This stand has a nice feel and heft to it. Fits the saftey razor I inherited from my grandfather perfectly. Unfortunately my shaving brush doesn&#x27;t fit but I&#x27;m going to dremel that so it does. Either way I am extremely satisfied with this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it for my AoS badger brush and my Edwin Jagger razor. They both fit perfectly and the stand is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> This is a nice looking stand. There&#x27;s good weight to the base and it&#x27;s not flimsy at all. Nice piece of kit!</li>
            <li> brush slot is a little tight, but works very well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality stand. Nice, heavy material. It won&#x27;t tip over. Holds my razor and brush with no problem.</li>
            <li> Excellent stand. Nothing to assemble. Razor and brush fits perfectly on weighted stand.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift hubby loves it so far</li>
            <li> Looks very stylish, helps preserve the shape of my badger brush after use, and overall is a great addition to my bathroom vanity top.</li>
            <li> Not much to comment here, it seems to be a well made item. Holds my DE razor and brush just fine while being sturdy and shiny. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Simple sturdy product - looks good, compact but functional. Looks great and lends a certain elegance to the ritual of shaving.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, well made, good solid base and it just looks good. I would gladly reorder again if I had need for a second one. Also anyone using a shaving brush should have a stand it truly protect and allow for the brush to dry correctly.</li>
            <li> Arrived on the date as promised.  Look great.  It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> Great Quality very nice finish.  Went well with my Merkur 180 Long Handled Razor and Escali Badger Brush.  Did not feel wobbly, felt sturdy and secure on my sink.</li>
            <li> What else can I say... nice heavy product, looks good with my Merkur 180 and Escali brush... other than that</li>
            <li> Very elegant and functional!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, hefty, solid stand, at a good price.  The base is weighted well, and the &#x27;forks&#x27; are thick and strong.  I might prefer a bit more length on the tines that hold the razor (or perhaps a bit more of an upturn at their ends), but it&#x27;s really not much of a problem unless something bumps it.  The chrome looks good, though it hasn&#x27;t been in my bathroom long enough to see if it holds up against rust.  At around twenty bucks, it&#x27;s well worth it, so far.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a birthday gift for my 22 year old son.  He loves it.  Very practical (his old stand only held his brush) as well as very stylish.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband as a special gift for his birthday. I had purchased a pricey razor,  but something he specifically wanted. He absolutely loves the razor and then I purchased the stand, so it is not only functional, but looks classy on the counter. The service was efficient and the stand is perfect for the razor (a Merkur razor).</li>
            <li> This neat little stand is an excellent start of a set for a beginning wet shaver.  The construction is very stout and will hold fairly heavy badger knots with ease.  Added bonus, the stand helps dry the brush and blade after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A well recommended item for anyone looking to start or gift wet shaving.</li>
            <li> My husband recently decided to shave the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; way - with a safety razor, a brush, and some shaving cream. I got him this stand (along with the other supplies) for Christmas. This stand completes the whole look. I have to say, seeing his shaving brush and safety razor hung on this stand, on our bathroom counter, looks so much more elegant than his old electric shaver. I highly recommend getting this stand to accompany your, or your guy&#x27;s, shaving needs.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my brushes , an Omega and a no-name. Guess I should have measured and asked first. Not that this matters to me now, but it seems oddly tall by at least two inches.</li>
            <li> Overall, it does its purpose. Very sturdy and it looks sharp. No issues with the items falling off the stand.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!  It looks nice on the vanity top and keeps the moisture from leaking into his brush and ruining it. I also think it is much safe to have the razor secure on the stand than rolling around in a drawer. And shipping was fast as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Came on time and as described. It is pretty sturdy and actually matches the Merkur razor I bought with it.  I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Perfect stand to compliment  my Merkur razor and  badger brush.  Looks good on the granite bathroom counter top.  The stainless steel fits right in with the other bathroom decor.</li>
            <li> I love this stand because I am able to quickly hang up my razor and keep it out of reach of my children! It looks nice too!</li>
            <li> good price, I like the finish and hit held both my razor and brush very secure.  The weighted base is nice as I&#x27;m not worried about it falling over and damaging the razor.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about ordering on-line with inspecting the product first hand.  I relied on the previous reviews of this product to make me more comfortable with the purchase.  Needless to say, the product arrive and it was much more than expected.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This stand works perfectly. I am enjoying the old double edged razor shaving experience once again. Good folks to buy from too!</li>
            <li> Strong sturdy and practical is what this stand is. At first I thought it was expensive but after receiving it I see it is well worth the money. The stands in the malls are a lot more money and not half as good.</li>
            <li> Looks very durable. Nice appearance. Fits my blade and brush well. The finish doesn&#x27;t stain. I&#x27;m pleased with this choice...</li>
            <li> Needed a brush and razor stand for my Art of Shaving Brush and Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor. This little stand works great for both!</li>
            <li> This is a simple elegant addition to our bathroom. My fiance loves his razor and brush. This the perfect way to have them on display while not needing to pay an arm and a leg at The Art of Shaving. Very stable. Fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son&#x27;s graduation gift (along with the other requisite wet-shave swag) and then decided to get one for myself as well.  Sturdy, with clean and classic lines.  It does what it&#x27;s designed to do at a price that I could afford.  Even better, it cleans up easily as well!</li>
            <li> This is a great razor and brush holder. I love it. It looks great and adds character to the bathroom. My wife is hard to please but when she saw the razor and brush holder, she said it looked great too.</li>
            <li> This is a nice stand to hold my husbands razor and brush.  I&#x27;m very glad that I went with this stand.  Very good purchase and a nice price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, looks durable and is weighted so there&#x27;s no tipping.  Fits my Edwin Jagger DE razor and badger brush just fine.  Good seller, item arrived as expected and on schedule.</li>
            <li> This may sound funny, but it does exactly what is suppose to do; hold my razor and brush.  The finish is nice and it cost considerably less than other stands.  A great buy!</li>
            <li> This stand is weighty, shiny, with heavy duty metal. It pairs perfectly with my Murkur safety razor and Tweezerman brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this stand- seems to be made with decent quality, and allows me to hang my shave brush with the bristles down to dry.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. Prompt delivery. The stand is a quality piece and is a very nice bath room accessory. My razor and brush fit perfectly.  Love it!  Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a reasonably priced stand for my new Edwin Jagger DE89 and Escali brush and this fit the bill. Been about a month and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Has a good weight to it and holds the razor and brush perfectly. The arms are a little curved at the end so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the brush and razor falling off. There are several stands offered at a similar price point on Amazon with similar features. You will not be disappointed by going with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this stand for about a month but I am very happy with it.  Seems to be made pretty solid, and it has not started to rust or chip.  Perfect fit for my Merkur Razor and Escali badger brush.  Price on this was great!  I couldn&#x27;t find anything else that even looked decent for under about $60.  Shipped and arrived within a few days.  Wise purchase if you need a nice looking, quality stand that is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I like that this has some weight to it.  It&#x27;s not going to knocked over on your bathroom counter easily.  It&#x27;s well made and reasonably price.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality, nice heavy base and it fits regular razors ( like fusion ) without a problem. It&#x27;s very elegant and serves the purpose perfectly! :)</li>
            <li> Stand appears to be good quality. Delivered quickly. Came just as I was expecting based on the existing reviews. I have no problem recommending this stand.</li>
            <li> It holds my razor and Escali brush. That is all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, but at the same time elegant.  I love this little stand, especially the knurled part in the middle, which gives it tactile and visual interest.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little stand.  It seems well made and is not tippy or cheesy.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift.  Item came in a very nice box, well packaged.  Finish of the stand was very good.  This makes for a great display of a brush and razor.</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday. One of the forks was slightly bent but no big deal i bent it back up and its good. It holds my van der hagen brush by setting the bush bristles down with the entire handle setting on the fork. I think this is by design since there is no standard size or shape to brush handles. My merker #180 fits nicely and looks great on the stand. The base of the stand is weighted and lined with what appears to be neoprene on the bottom. The forks are thick and the chrome is without blemish. not bad for $20 delivered. Oh and its made in Taiwan, the Republic of China, not mainland China.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor stand!  Very sturdy and looks nice!</li>
            <li> Top notch! Looks high dollar, and compliments the  Merkur razor blade.</li>
            <li> This is a great stand! I bought after purchasing a safety Razer and badger brush. Works perfectly, and looks great.</li>
            <li> Great stand.  Solid construction.  Tall enough to hold my brush and safety razor.  Slim enough to not take up a lot of counter top real estate.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting. Definitely well-made product. Nice and heavy. I wouldn&#x27;t pay more for anything that looks like this one. It&#x27;s really good; my Parker 99R Long Handle razor fits very nicely with room to spare.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. I told him a fine razor deserves a fine stand. It was a great stocking stuffer for Christmas. Excellent service, packaging, and delivery. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Given as a stocking stuffer. The recipient loved it! I thought that it was well-made and at an excellent price!</li>
            <li> Great quality, beautiful stand. Do your homework to make sure your brush will fit in the space provided. Very happy.</li>
            <li> excellent item for a great price.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy stand, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> very sturdy, husband loves it</li>
            <li> Item came very quickly and my husband loves it! Is a very nice product, heavy, and fit my husbands badger brush and razor perfectly!</li>
            <li> We got this for our son for Christmas. He was moving from electric to razor. He LOVE the set up and this stand works great to hold his razor and brush!</li>
            <li> Looks great and works well in keeping both my razor and brush off the counter.</li>
            <li> Very nice finish on the product. Got fast shipping and product was better than my expectation. Goes well with the Merker razor.</li>
            <li> Not a products you can find in a store, I&#x27;m always leery about reviews, but this products seemed to be worthy of a try. Not only did it arrived before projected due date, but when I opened the package I found a beautifully packaged product. The pictures on the website  doesn&#x27;t  do it justice. The base is well weighted, and the brush and razor hooks are capable of holding any of my razors and brushes. I would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Came in fast and looks wonderful. its a Christmas gift, so it hasn&#x27;t been used. But I cant wait to give it to my husband.</li>
            <li> Got this as a christmas gift for my boyfriend who just started using a brush for shaving. He loves it!</li>
            <li> Good, well designed stand except the arm that holds the brush is too narrow.  It will only hold a brush with a small handle.  Would like to have known this prior to purchase.  Suggest putting dimensions regarding the arms in the description of the item.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy heavy stand.  Seems very well built and should last a long time.  Fits my razor and brush perfectly and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Looks great, and is sturdy.  Fits the Edwin Jagger Double Edge Safety Razor and Parker Safety Razor 100% Badger Bristle Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li> Simple design, made well. Surprised how nice the finish is on this thing. Weighted base keeps it from tipping. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice stand.... Would buy it again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I rarely take time to write reviews; however, I realize that many people rely on feedback to know how good (or poor) these products are.  Therefore, I&#x27;d like to say that this product exceeded my expectations.  It is nicely weighted and looks very handsome!  I recently purchased a double-edge safety razor and brush and needed a place to store them.  I am completely satisfied with this product. If you are considering a stand for your razor and brush, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.  Bonus, it is very affordable.</li>
            <li> It a little over the top, unless u have a fancy bathroom.but looks good and heavy.</li>
            <li> All good, keeps wife happy as it organizes shaving gear. Supports best way of shaving- with brush and shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my friend and he loved it!</li>
            <li> made a really nice gift... my dad loved it!</li>
            <li> This is a good quality stand. My only problem is that my Gillette razor doesn&#x27;t really fit the stand. I&#x27;m not sure which razor the stand was designed for.</li>
            <li> purchased for husband;  very well made and heavier than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, looks like one solid piece. Base has nice weight, will not tip over. Shaft has same machined style as my merker razor, and my escali brush hangs nicely from it.</li>
            <li> Great value, fast shipping and husband loved it! Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Adds elegance to the shave den.  Sturdy and solid, as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was back and forth on which razor and brush stand to by and decided on this one.  I couldn&#x27;t have done any better.  It&#x27;s attractive, very sturdy, and heavy enough not to slide around.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good Chrome platting with felt on bottom of stand.  Heavy enough to not fall over when accidentally hit.  Shipped fast.  Holds my brush and DE safety razor nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he is delighted with it.  It gives him a place to keep his shaving equipment together.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research regarding drying shaving brushes and razors. I was going through a shaving brush every 2 months because of losing bristles and blades every month.  The articles said brushes and razors need to be dried. This is a great stand at a resonable price and works well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loved it.  It looks nice and holds his new Escali brush perfectly.  It is very solid which is a plus so that it won&#x27;t tip over.</li>
            <li> Well made basic shaving stand.  Sturdy, quality materials and workmanship.</li>
            <li> Item received as promised and described.  Very sturdy and well weighted.  Does the trick to hold my brush and razor.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Still as its shine like when I pulled it out the box. Razor and brush fit perfectly. I&#x27;d buy it again and recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> The stand is very well designed and looks great on my counter.  The quality is great and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand. I put it deserved 5 stars and I think that could recommend them to others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole safety razor/brush thing, but needed a place to hang my stuff.  This stand looks great on the bathroom counter and works well.  The heavy base keeps it from tipping over easily.</li>
            <li> I love the styling. It matches my razor very well. It works as advertised by correctly holding up my stuff.</li>
            <li> This is small and attractive on the bathroom vanity. Definitely good value for the price. It is a very useful item!</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a great price</li>
            <li> ordered for a friend of mine who had found a stand that was VERY similar to this one for $220!  He was thrilled to receive this one&lt;br /&gt;and in fact, said he liked it much better.&lt;br /&gt;Good deal.  Fast shipment</li>
            <li> Simple, but elegant stand. Easy to clean and sturdy. Holding my Merkur razor and brush handy, with minimal use of sink space. Works great for me.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy and elegant unit. My son loves it. He had been wanting something like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Nice stand.  Simple, manly, sturdy.  What else could you ask for.  The product was shipped promptly and I received it in perfect shape.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This stand is used daily.  It hold my brush so it can dry completely.  The heavy base keeps it from falling over.  Simple and well made.</li>
            <li> looks amazing in the bathroom when it has a razor and a brush on it. easy to clean and much nicer than having things just laying around.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works perfect! The chrome is flawless! Would buy again if I needed two stands.</li>
            <li> A very well crafted chrome stand that looks elegant. Very sturdy and holds the razor and brush easily without tipping over when putting them away. Cleans up to a beautiful shine leaving everything clean looking and neatly put away. I love it and highly recommend it. It enhances the sink area very nicely. Also wonderful packing and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Solid Stand.  Using this to hold two double edge razors.  My Proraso brush was too big to fit, but I knew this from other reviews.  Very solid, recommend to all.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s designed to do. The weight is substantial enough to hold a razor and brush well. The finish is nice.  Happy with it.</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to.  I like it because my brush hangs down to dry the way it is best for the brush.  Very study, doesn&#x27;t tip over.</li>
            <li> This stand has a stable base so it can securely hold my heavy Burt&#x27;s Bees brush &amp; long handled Merkur razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> Easy to order and came at a good price.  The unit is sturdy and holds my razor and brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy stand and it looks great. It&#x27;s heavy enough so that it does not tip over during use.</li>
            <li> Seems like excellent quality. Nice and heavy. Chrome plating is like a mirror. Keeps my Merkur shaver and my brush at the ready. . A man&#x27;s got to have his tools.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little expensive at first, but after realizing we had to hang up the DE razor and brush, we decided on this stand.&lt;br /&gt;We were plenty satisfied and there&#x27;s no reason this stand wont last many years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soft bottom keeps it in place without scratching your counters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a safety razor and a brush, do yourself a favor and get this.&lt;br /&gt;I got the Merkur 180 Long handle and the Escali Brush. They both fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great looking, sturdy and awesome price. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me. Holds my brush just fine. 5 star purchase!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and well balanced stand. It looks better and more classical to me than the more modern stands being sold at these new &amp;#34;shaving shops&amp;#34;, and at a fraction of the price. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This stand holds my shave brush perfectly and the base is weighted, so it won&#x27;t tip over. It also looks nice. I would definitely recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Escali razor and brush stand.  It is well made and has met all my expectations.  I purchased the Escali shaving cream brush at the same time and, it too, is a superior product.  I would recommend both items to anyone considering such a purchase.</li>
            <li> Had it for a few months now, no problems.  Holds my DE safety razor and brush securely and out of the way.</li>
            <li> Excellent finish, stable stand, overall a great product.</li>
            <li> Well made with nice chrome plating. The stand is stable and the perfect accessory to match with a chrome safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;The brush holder did fit my brush but it is somewhat tight. Shipping was quick and reasonable.</li>
            <li> Have an &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; brush and manual razor. Works perfectly for it and looks beautiful. Very sturdy as well.</li>
            <li> Great piece of hardware!</li>
            <li> Although the razor and brush holder are very sturdy, after a few weeks next to the bathroom sink, the bottom of the holder is beginning to rust.</li>
            <li> This is a great stand! It&#x27;s solid, has a good weight to it and the finish is attractive. It fits my Edwin Jagger De89bl and brush perfectly and looks great.</li>
            <li> Excellent stand- be sure you check your razor and brush before you buy. Fits my Schick Quattro perfectly. Excellent service- fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Description of unit says it fits most brush sizes, this is not the case. I have to sort of balance my brush where the bristles start to get it to work somewhat. Looks tacky... Not happy</li>
            <li> useful and nice finish. Finish has not dulled in a couple months.  Great price</li>
            <li> Works as expected, looks nice.</li>
            <li> A slight tight fit for the badger brush side, other than that a great purchase for my razor and bathroom counter</li>
            <li> High quality, no faults.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, hard to get a bad review :D</li>
            <li> Holds the Escali brush just fine, of course. Brush prongs weren&#x27;t wide enough for the Parker Silvertip brush without widening slightly with a 22mm socket. Now Parker brush fits perfectly when held by the slot near the base of the handle.</li>
            <li> I originally was looking at comparable stands at the Art of shaving that were 4x the price. This stand is and excellent value.</li>
            <li> I cannot say anything about some of the reviews that say the chrome finish does not stand up well over time. I have only had this a few days. It works great for holding my Merkur Razor and Parker brush. It is hefty enough to not tip over. Looks nice in our bathroom.</li>
            <li> Great for my brush and razor.  Good looking also!</li>
            <li> I started with just the razor sitting on the stand and it stayed in balance - nice. I then added the brush later. The stand if very sturdy. The seller did a great job - very fast shipment and arrived in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> A gray gift for my husband on Father&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li> Overall, very nicely made.  The brush holder is a bit snug for the brush I own, so I have to use a little force to get it in and out.  Other than that, works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> very nice product and quality is spectacular</li>
            <li> This brush works quite well, and if it ever wears out I&#x27;ll get another one.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers up nicely, stays hydrated and spreads it on just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is the perfect match for the Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8) aesthetically and has a nicely weighted base that ensures it does not topple. It also works brilliantly with the Paker Safety Razor 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Ebony handle (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LY2PG4/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2) which also highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this little stand because it has great balance, holds my razor and brush nicely, and still fits in my medicine cabinet so that nobody has to see it.</li>
            <li> Nice stand. Attractive and can be taken apart easily for travel. Chrome is bright and the unit is weighted so it doesn&#x27;t tip.  It fits my Edwin Jagger 89lbl well. I bought a EJ Chatsworth and the handle will not fit into the stand.  I used a file and opened it enough to make it work.  That is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This stand was exactly what I was looking for. Solid built, holds both the razor and brush really well and looks great! Very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently ordered this stand along with the shaving brush (Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush) and I cannot be more pleased. It&#x27;s a great value. Nicely built and it looks great.</li>
            <li> weighted base keeps it steady, good looking and holds the brush as recommended by manufacture for drying.1 2 3 4</li>
            <li> This stand is nice quality and exactly as advertised.  Fit my razor and brush perfectly.  Should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, nicely weighted base. The brush looks sturdy as well. I have nothing more to say about this product</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the price. It&#x27;s heavy and solid. Fits my Escali brush and Merkur 34c perfectly. Good buy.</li>
            <li> This is a really great stand, good quality, good weight. Would recommend to anyone interested in this sort of thing.</li>
            <li> This is a quality stand, but the razor clip will not hold a Gillette Mach 3 razor. I haven&#x27;t tried other razor models, but I suspect that many standard razors would also not stay on.</li>
            <li> Yeah, nothing really shocking here. Weight is good so that it doesn&#x27;t wobble around when you&#x27;re putting things back. Looks nice and is exactly what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> I purchased theEscali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand a month ago to hold my Edwin Jagger razor and Badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;They both fit in the stand perfectly, and the chrome of the stand is of sufficient quality to complement the razor.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;d read the other reviews on the possibility of rust, I&#x27;m careful to keep the stand away from standing water.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that it will last a good, long time.</li>
            <li> Works fine. The brush I use is a little wide to clip on using the handle, so I use the brush part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks but it works as I expected and has held up to moderate use well.</li>
            <li> Its a great size fit the razor and brush well, and looks really nice!  I gave it to my son along with a razor and brush and he really liked it!.</li>
            <li> Keeps my shaving area on the counter neat and tidy and makes my collection look sharp and professional. The base is nice and heavy, it really keeps it sturdy. I do recommend this stand.</li>
            <li> Perfect to let your shaving brush dry correctly and your double edge razor too. I did have to spread the arms for the shaving brush (SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush) so it would fit, but that was a minor problem. Looks very nice too.</li>
            <li> sturdy and great quaity and beautiful.  received promptly and packaged nicely... very professional.</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy. Adds a nice look to the bathroom. Perfect for my razor and badger brush</li>
            <li> Great stand for razor and brush.  The brush is a little tight fit but works great.  It will look great on my new bathroom vanity.&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can take it apart and take it with me when I go to see my grandkids.  Complements the soap dish I also got.</li>
            <li> Nice product buy way overpriced. My shave brush and razor are able to properly dry and look good doing it, but the price for this piece of metal seems a little high.</li>
            <li> Well designed.  I did have to modify the razor holder with zip tie because my razor was too narrow but a zip tie did the job.  I&#x27;d recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say, really. It is very simple and does it&#x27;s job well. I was worried that it would be flimsy, but it is solid as a rock and actually has some good weight to it. Looks great in my bathroom, too.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. It’s small enough that I can keep it on a shelf in my medicine cabinet, yet big enough to handle my Merkur razor and Escali brush as designed. I haven’t had it long, but the finish seems to be holding up fine. I like the rubberized base on the bottom for a cushiony and skid free surface. Count me as a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy base. Holds the razor and one of my brushes. The other brush doesn&#x27;t fit. I don&#x27;t if they have a standard for brush handle but they do very in size. I don&#x27;t think this is the fault of the stand maker...&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy!</li>
            <li> The brush stand is high quality looking and fits the Escali brush perfectly.  The razor holder doesn&#x27;t fit my boyfriend&#x27;s drugstore razor, but that&#x27;s the only con to the product.</li>
            <li> The stand seems to be good quality and does a fine job holding my razor (Merkur 34C) however the brush holder is a mm too small to properly hold my tweezerman brush by the handle. Instead the brush needs to be placed on the stand just above the bristles. It&#x27;s only a minor inconvenience though and is still effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this razor and brush stand.  The quality is much better than it appears in the photos, and it has a good heft and is very stable.  Its a bit taller than I thought it would be; for a modern multiblade razor, its about the perfect height, for a safety razor, it looks a bit tall.  But, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything comparable available for less than around $50.  The brush opening is just large enough to hold my Art of Shaving Pure Badger brush, but it sits just a little crooked.  A larger brush might not fit.</li>
            <li> Excellent Brush Stand. Works well as it allows my brush to completely dry an be nice and fluffy the next day</li>
            <li> Great attractive product! Matches the handle of my Merkur safety razor perfectly. Well designed. Good value for the money. Much less expensive than other brands.</li>
            <li> Great product!! good price!!</li>
            <li> This stand looks Great.  All of my razors and brushes fit this stand (unlike another brand of stand that I bought previously).</li>
            <li> I bought this along with an Escali badger shaving brush and Edwin Jagger De86bl safety razor. Both fit in it perfectly and it keeps the brush in good shape.</li>
            <li> One of the nice things about this stand is the heavy base covered with rubber. It is designed to be stable while holding the weight of the brush and razor. You know, stuff like this should be a no-brainer, and this one is.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down getting a new shaving brush to replace my old one which I pretty much destroyed by storing it in my shaving mug. Brushes need to dry with the bristles down and exposed to the air. I checked many different styles and price ranges for a brush holder. The Escali was my choice for being the best value for the price. I&#x27;m very pleased with the weight and sturdiness of the unit. I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now with no complaints.</li>
            <li> The razor and brush stand is very heavy to avoid toppling over, but compact enough to fit nicely on my countertop.  It maintains its bright silver appearance with jus a quick wipe down.  Great value!!</li>
            <li> This thing feels *very* solid and stable.  I&#x27;ve only had it a short while, so I don&#x27;t know how well it will resist water stains and such, but so far it feels solid, stable, and it looks very shiny.</li>
            <li> This thing looks great and holds my Escali shaving brush with deft grace.  That said, my only gripe with this razor and brush stand is that it doesn&#x27;t have like a rubber grommet to cross the span or something to hold up straight razors, but I can hardly fault the stand for my lack of readership and it manages to hold up my straight razor with relative ease regardless.</li>
            <li> They buy did not say the dimension of the brush holder but said it would fit most brushes. Well my brush is very common and the stand it too small to hold it. They should mention the dimensions.</li>
            <li> Very well made, more than heavy/sturdy enough to do the job well.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price. It fits the standard safety razor (if you are puzzled, its the plain metal one that takes one razor blade, google safety razor and you&#x27;ll get the idea). I don&#x27;t know about other brands, but the Escali razor, not only fits, but looks good with the Escali stand! Takes up a ridiculously small amount of room on the counter. Looks good. Functions well. Not wobbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that other fancy stores sell items similar to this for about $80.00, and that&#x27;s not even with a brush stand included!!!  Great value, super satisfied.</li>
            <li> Holds the razor and brush without issue.&lt;br /&gt;Coloring is sharp, and is low maintenance for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Well made with a sturdy base. Fits my brush and razor perfectly and looks great!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the modest price fool you. The Escali razor and brush stand is as fine a product as those found in specialty stores. Purchased as part of a Christmas gift for my son, the stand holds the razor he inherited from my father. I think my father would be happy. My son certainly is.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the stand. The chrome is solid and deeply plated and it is especially nice to keep my shaving brush bristles in good shape. Well done Perella team</li>
            <li> The item was perfect.  I will use this company again.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a very solid and functional stand at a reasonable price.  It looks great with chrome fixtures; adds a nice touch to the vanity. Shipped quickly from Perella&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have said this item is sturdy, and I agree. It has a heavy base with a non-slip pad that is truly non-slip. The brush and razor supports are solid. Appearance is very nice, and complements my Parker 99R, Parker badger brush and Edwin Jagger Ebony razors well.  I definitely recommend the Escali razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the way I received this product with displayed image. Serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> Very clean and cleans up the sink space. Good quality!</li>
            <li> The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand are absolutely beautiful. Well made, solid, and just feel good to hold and use.. could not be happier with my purchase and the seller. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The stand is very nice, and the metal bushing matches my Merkur double-edged razor. However, I find that the brush side is just a little too small to properly accommodate my Van der Hagen badger brush by the curve of the handle. I am able to make do by putting the brush on the stand where the handle joins the bristles. Solid construction and stable balance.</li>
            <li> very stylish, solid, you can feel the metal. I love all shaving stuff since I was 9, this stand worked really well.</li>
            <li> Great product, looks good, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> should come with brush not extra</li>
            <li> the stand is a great addition to my bathroom countertop.  nice quality and sleek look!!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a razor and shaving brush that I did NOT buy on Amazon, but they work as expected.  My Merkur 34 fits perfectly and it has held up with daily use.</li>
            <li> This is a great stand.  Very sturdy and good looking.  Unfortunately, the brush holder was not large enough to accomodate my Baxter of California best badger brush.</li>
            <li> A handy little stand that makes my area of the bathroom countertop look a little bit neater and stylish.  Sturdy and attractive, I&#x27;m very please with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this with my new razor and badger brush, mostly to feel fancy.  The stand it nice and heavy, not over bearing on the bling, and elicits the eye roll from my wife when I carefully remove it from the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the money.  Very stable, does not rock or wobble.  The chrome is beautiful, matches my EJ razor and bowl perfectly.  The EJ brush fits well in the large tines, and the smaller tines are just wide enough to perfectly hold my EJ razor by the slight collar at the bottom of the handle.  So I&#x27;m able to hang the razor with the head down, which allows it to dry better.  the rubber pad at the bottom makes it stand solidly without slipping or moving across the marble sink top.  Water stains wipe off with a tissue and some water.  So far, it gives me no reason to doubt that it will last for years.</li>
            <li> The weight on it is sufficient to keep it pretty steady.  Nice finish.  Safety razor and Escali brush fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my razor and brush (another escali). A few water spots on the finish that I can simply clean up. Bottom feels like those anti-slip bathtub toys for toddlers and is very stable.</li>
            <li> This stand has a heavy base and is well built. The base prevents the razor or brush from tipping over or even wobbling when you are using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an Edwin Jagger DE89, and it fits securely upright or upside down.&lt;br /&gt;I also have an Escali badger hair brush, that is a little on the smaller side, but still fits as comfortably as a larger brush would. When hanging the brush, make sure you wash it out and the bristles are facing downwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great buy for the price and I am extremely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This was an anniversary gift to my boyfriend who is heavily into classic shaving. It&#x27;s great because he has Merkur razors with textured handles - this matches his razors perfectly. Now he can display them on the vanity, and they&#x27;re easily accessible. The brush holder is convenient because it allows the water to drip into the bowl to evaporate and doesn&#x27;t smash the bristles. 100% recommend - he&#x27;s very happy, which makes me happy!</li>
            <li> I bought this and the Escali shaving brush for my BF, and he LOVED it!! He thinks it looks elegant, and loves that it&#x27;s heavy enough not to have to worry about tipping. The price was great I thought too! It holds his brush and razor all in one spot, and looks great doing it! He said it was a perfect gift!!</li>
            <li> I set up the Escali chrome razor and brush stand in my lavatory last week. And I must say this item has improved the ambiance of my morning ablushions dramatically! I have added through a recent purchase an Escali shaving brush and the Merkur (barber pole) hefty two piece safety razor. Wonderfull!!! A little class starts the day off right , I would say,and my wife agrees whole heartedly. A great item that should be part of any order that is made by anyone considering switching to d.e. safety razor practicality! simple, effective, classy!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stand.  I bought it as a gift and he hangs his razor and his shave brush from it (like you are supposed to).  They fit great, it is sturdy and appears to be great quality.</li>
            <li> Great quality, works well</li>
            <li> Buy it!  Love it!!  Yeah, so much fun to shave!!!  What a great little stand.  Buy two, buy three, buy four...</li>
            <li> I really like this stand, specially for the price compared to others I looked at. It fits my Merkel safety razor (head up) and a standard brush. Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> Why I gave this Razor/Brush Stand 5-stars:&lt;br /&gt;-It was priced better than it&#x27;s competition&lt;br /&gt;-It looks absolutely great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this Razor/Brush Stand:&lt;br /&gt;-It helps keep my razor and brush dry; drying your razor is a necessity because moisture typically dulls blades more quickly than the act of shaving&lt;br /&gt;-It provides the complete &amp;#34;package-feel&amp;#34; to my brush and razor&lt;br /&gt;-The complete set sitting on my bathroom sink makes me look and feel sophisticated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who I would recommend this Razor/Brush Stand to:&lt;br /&gt;-Anyone wanting to make the switch to a Safety Razor intents on also buying a brush.  The stand is not an accessory, it is an absolutely necessary piece of a safety razor kit!</li>
            <li> Precisely what I wanted and expected!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful stand .. Should last a lifetime.  I have my Parker Badger brush and a Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; Long Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> Hey, it holds my razor and brush quite well. Hasn&#x27;t dropped them yet.</li>
            <li> i bought this for ny boyfriend and he really loves it. Awesome stand for his razor and brush. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Well built.  Solid.  Perfect .  No issues at all.  Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Works well and very sturdy. Only fits with Escali brush.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this stand!  My brush is a bit big but that&#x27;s my fault not taking into consideration the measurements. Looks amazing!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, free shipping came quick.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li> High quality product! Looks great works even better!</li>
            <li> This stand is solid, with a decent base to it wont tip over easily.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect fit for my Escali badger brush &amp; Merkur #34C DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;The opening for the razor will easily fit other types of DE&lt;br /&gt;razors or even a cartridge style if needed.&lt;br /&gt;Nice chrome fit and finish, must have shaving accesory.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a huge stand and thought about cancelling the order after I placed it, because I thought it would be too big and I wouldn&#x27;t have room for it.  I was wrong - it&#x27;s 6&amp;#34; tall and 4&amp;#34; wide.  It&#x27;s fits very nicely in my bathroom vanity cabinet with plenty of room to spare.  No assembly required - it&#x27;s fully assembled out of the box. I&#x27;m very glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Purchased a recommended brush to go along with the stand and it doesn&#x27;t fit......waste of money.</li>
            <li> Good stand, looks good, cleans easy</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  It holds his Merkur 33c and brush.  It has a small footprint so it fits into our medicine cabinet.  Its also weighted nicely so it won&#x27;t tip easily.</li>
            <li> The razor slides off too easily. I was not about to BEND the flat piece upward. This would have worked, but I should NOT have to do this.</li>
            <li> This stand was a gift for my birthday, so I can&#x27;t comment on price but in terms of appearance this stand is sharp! The finish looks great. It is also very functional and works as advertised. It keeps my brush (Silvertip Badger, of course) and razor in position and reduces clutter on the counter top. It exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Shiny finish and a solid/heavy base so it won&#x27;t tip easy. Makes my setup look nice and fancy and keeps my brush in good shape. Definitely worth the extra cost compared to some of the cheap look a likes available on here.</li>
            <li> It holds my items and holds up well. Very sturdy and I expect it should last me for quite some time!</li>
            <li> Got this to hold a Merkur safety razor and it matches the precision-made feel perfectly. The base is solid and heavy, which is great for keeping it stable. Very happy with the quality and craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> This is a well made razor and brush stand that does its job well. The razor holder is wide enough to hold all the safety razors I have seen. The brush holder gives my brush a tight fit, which is fine, but I&#x27;m not sure it would accommodate all other brushes. Best to check before buying. I like the bright chrome finish, though it does necessitate frequent cleaning if you keep it nearby when shaving so that it accumulates soap splashes.</li>
            <li> Nice product, does the trick. For the price you can not beat it. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a stand, it holds my stuff, and it works. Buy it. Son, I don&#x27;t think you understand. This brings out the embodiment of Ron Swanson in men. My recommendation is essentially a guarantee. Try it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Simple yet elegant. Water stains wipe off easily. Unobtrusive. Transaction was completely without hassle. Excellent! What else need be said.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find that the stand well sturdy and well made. I don&#x27;t worry that it will be unstable or rust out in a wet environment.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must if you own a safety razor and brush , it keeps them looking them nice ! It just looks nice in your bathroom !</li>
            <li> This razor/brush stand is an extremely well built item.  It has a nice heavy base and a beautiful chrome finish.  Both function and form which is what I go with.  One can see that this is a well constructed quality item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a Merkur long handle razor, so the finish matches perfectly with this stand. It&#x27;s cheap, it gets the job done, what more to complain about? Seller was fast, efficient, and arrived a day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The razor feels substantial in my hand.  The stand is just the thing to keep clutter off my bathroom counter - also very sturdy.  Nothing flimsy about these items.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful stand that was perfect for the brush and razor I have been using for about a year.  It came promptly, looks good and keeps the razor and brush in a compact space and lets it dry efficiently.  Even my wife like it!</li>
            <li> Its a nice stand and relatively cheap.  It could be a little heavier but for the price I paid, Im not complaining.</li>
            <li> This stand is great and does it&#x27;s job perfectly. Both the brush and the razor fit nicely and the base is heavy enough that it won&#x27;t tip over. It is small enough to stay out of the way and the Chrome looks great in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Works great. Can&#x27;t think of anything I would want changed on it. Heavy so it won&#x27;t to over and good Chrome</li>
            <li> This stand is perfect. Fits my Edwin Jagger 89L and my Parker Badger brush! Don&#x27;t shop at &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; they are way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Brush and razor fit, although the prongs for the razor could be a little broader. Fit my former razor well, but my Parker 89R is a tad larger. It fits, yes, but could be better. Stand is heavy and solid. Very handsome appearance, too. 4.5</li>
            <li> The bottom of the stand has a rubber piece glued on to reduce the movement of the stand when handing the razor and brush, when i need to move the stand the rubber piece is not falling out after about 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> The best stand for your brush and razor.</li>
            <li> Great stand, very sturdy and stable, and great height for razors and brushes</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in perfect condition.  This stand looks clean and sharp.  Feels sturdy and has some heft to it.  It is on permanent display on my bathroom counter top.  Love it.  Will purchase from Perella&#x27;s again.</li>
            <li> This is a great piece of equipment for the professional man at a low cost. I bought this to help clean up my sink area and it did just that, and looked good doing it too!</li>
            <li> Looks great and fits perfectly with my [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] and [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor]].</li>
            <li> Great looking and functional.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and it looks great.</li>
            <li> Simple, elegant way of storing (and showing off) my wetshaving gear. Exactly as expected, feels and looks solid and high quality. Also, it forces you to store your shave brush properly (bristles down), which I had never done before because I didn&#x27;t have a convenient way of doing so.</li>
            <li> Works just as you think it would! Merkur Long Handle razor hangs perfect as does my Escali shave brush.  I&#x27;d buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Good stand. It&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d expect. This makes for a good father&#x27;s day present. Allow your razors to dry in the open extend ends the life of the blades. I got tired of the disposable razor blade model and shifted to buying a nice set with a few hundred razors replacements. I&#x27;m enjoy shaving more now and I&#x27;m never going back to disposable blades.</li>
            <li> It was well packed and when I took it out of the box I was shocked at how well it was made and how really beautiful it looked! This is a very sturdy piece.[[ASIN:B00A3LVMMQ Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Deason, Texas</li>
            <li> The quality of this stand was above what I expected for the price. its nice and sturdy and looks great with my Merkur and brush. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a classic sturdy stand.</li>
            <li> Looks good on my bathroom counter, and does a great job air drying my brush and razor after shaves. Also, has good weight and stability. Great price too! Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with this stand.  It is sleek and simple.  It was also rather reasonably priced which is always a plus!</li>
            <li> Mensa Mensa..my safety razor falls off the hook every time.  You have to very slowly place it in the hook and hold it a second.</li>
            <li> This holds my Gillette Double Edge Safety Razor like it was meant for it.  The stand is much heavier than I thought it would be and the chrome finish looks good as well.  My shaving brush does not fit in the stand correctly but it is a cheap brush so I am not concerned.  When I replace it I will make sure it fits my stand.</li>
            <li> Beautiful stand that fits my merker perfectly!</li>
            <li> Excellent razor stand.  Quick service and great price.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous! It is really well made and adds to the aesthetic of my bathroom.</li>
            <li> You may find a slightly cheaper on but its worth the small difference from a small USA company that takes pride in a fine product.  I also appreciate the personal follow up to assure that I was satisfied with my purchase, which I am very much so.</li>
            <li> Very nice stand, easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> This is a good stand, sturdy and well made.... Does it&#x27;s job very well.</li>
            <li> Good quality stand which fits my Merkur razor and Crabtree &amp; Evelyn badger brush.</li>
            <li> Looks fine..chrome shiny..but .....It will fit the Escali Brush at the bottom of the handle perfect....If you have a bigger brush handle...then it has to be hung from the KNOT...which doesn&#x27;t look as nice....get a wider specified knot dimension to be able to fit bigger handles.</li>
            <li> This is a well constructed product. The finish is flawless and it is nice and heavy. It is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Fits Parker razor and brush well, base is heavy enough not to tip over when only one of them is hanging on it.</li>
            <li> Looks great, sturdy one, kind of heavy actually. Holds my razor and brush like it should. I do like the extra height of the brush holder, some others that I looked at seemed to be a little too short.</li>
            <li> Sent it for a friend&#x27;s birthday.  I have no idea what it looks like in person, but in the picture it looks nice!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband&#x27;s birthday. It is nice and heavy and he loves it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It looks good in my bathroom with my shaving equipment. The price was also good. I would recommend</li>
            <li> This is a nice stand, very bottom heavy to sit up well. I took off a star just because the brush holder was bent slightly down but was able to straighten it out.</li>
            <li> What I like about this stand is that its weighted at the bottom. It holds my edwin brush and merkur heavy weight handle razor with no problem. The quality is very good.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy base, use it in the shower. Fits my non-Escali brush and Merkur DE handle perfectly. Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as it should. Weighted on the bottom so it won&#x27;t fall over and holds both my brush and razor.</li>
            <li> I got this with the SimplyBeautiful Basic Badger Hair Shaving Brush, and though at first the brush didn&#x27;t fit in without jamming it in, I was able to easily (but slightly) bend the brush holder to accommodate the wider brush. So don&#x27;t worry too much about brush handle size if that is your concern.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what i needed to keep my brush and razor on.  It appears as though it will last for a long time, nice and solid very sturdy and it looks great.</li>
            <li> This is a good stand that fits my Merkur 34C and Gillette Super Speed Flair well. I previously used the Van Der Hagen shave kit stand and unlike the acrylic stand in the Van Der Hagen kit, the Escali stand is too narrow to hold the Van Der Hagen brush at the narrow section of the handle. But it fits well holding at the neck between the handle and the bristles. The metal stand and stable base is a good upgrade over the Van Der Hagen acrylic stand I was using.</li>
            <li> Bought this stand to use with my Perfecto badger shaving brush and Merkur safety razor.  Holds both perfectly and solidly built.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> As described.  Feels very study.  Has enough grip to surface to not slide when putting on brush/razor.</li>
            <li> Very classy design. Obviously does the job and accommodates my brush and razor. Heavy in weight so it&#x27;s stable on the surface you set it on. 10/10 women would sleep with a guy using this razor stand proudly being displayed.</li>
            <li> if you like the looks, then this is a good price for what you get. I was worried this would be a light weight stamped piece of metal.  The base is hollow, stamped, but it has a lead weight in it that gives it heft and stability.  the upright seems to be a sold piece and not a hollow tube.  This fits my escali pure badger brush (well, one would hope!) and Merkur HD 34C.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a couple of months now.  I have glass and metal stuff in the bathroom, so this was a nice fit looks wise.  Holds a razor and brush securely enough and the fit and finish are good, so I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The product is heavy enough to work without tipping over, and sized appropriately for a standard razor and brush.  It might not work for a longer (non-standard) razor or brush, but was fine for my purposes.  The fit and finish were good.</li>
            <li> The stand is very well made. I love the finish and the clean look. I have an Art of Shaving badger brush that is just ever so slightly too big around to hang properly on this stand (as you can tell from the photo, I have to hang it from the opposite end). I plan to try out a different brush next time, so that&#x27;s not too big of a deal. The razor I have from Dollar Shave Club fits great. Overall this is a great stand for the money. Compared to other stands I researched, you&#x27;ll save yourself about $100 for the same quality of stand.</li>
            <li> Works great and looks good</li>
            <li> Awesome stand - heavy duty- looks and works great- reminds me of my grandfathers razor stand</li>
            <li> More affordable than The Art of Shaving and works just as well!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my husband and he loves it!  The base is heavy and it is nice and sturdy.  Beautiful chrome color.</li>
            <li> Clean, crisp and functional. Perfect for my shaving materials.</li>
            <li> Very nice stand, has some weight to it so that it stays upright.  Very nice chrome finish.</li>
            <li> Fits a Merkur HD 34c razor and Perfecto Badger Brush perfectly. Exceeds expectations!</li>
            <li> This was everything the other reviews said it was. Note the Omega 10049 does not fit in this stand</li>
            <li> Great price for a chrome stand. Good for guys just getting into DE shaving. Matching my merkur long handle perfectly. I shopped around some and this was the best way to go and barely takes up any space.</li>
            <li> Looks great, holds my razor and brush well and was well priced!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas... HE LOVES IT! Plus it looks nice on the side of the sink. So when people come over and use our bathroom I&#x27;m not embarrassed by his junk on the sink. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Very solid and has a nice weight to it. This stand will likely last until my grandkids are old. The only issue iIhave is that out doesn&#x27;t fit my cheap badger brush perfectly, but it works for literally every other brush and razor I could find. Great buy</li>
            <li> Bought this along with the Merkur 38HD and the Escali Badger brush. Everything fits perfectly, with length below the razor and brush to spare. It is sturdy and really accents everything - makes it all look really \\&quot;on purpose\\&quot;. I would imagine any razor that is too long for this stand is a real monster and probably not that easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little annoying if you need to move the stand with everything on it because it has a base that sort of adheres to surfaces so if you try to slide it, it doesn&#x27;t go easy and instead tips, dumping the razor because the holder is open ended and the razor sort of sits in an open V on it. This makes the thing top heavy, but it&#x27;s only a problem if you are trying to slide it or otherwise pick it up and move it with all the stuff hanging in it. Other than that it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Nice stand. Neither too big nor too small. Nice weight for stability. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and looks good also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this purchase.  My first impression upon taking it out of the box was how good it looked, very shiny and classy. I have not had any issues with chips or rust as others seem to have.  Its very solid as well and does not slip off of my very slippery sink.  It holds both my badger brush and Jagger razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> Looks great on my bathroom counter and supports my razor and brush perfectly. And at a very reasonable price. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Well made and sturdy. Highly polished chrome stand is classy and keeps my badger brush and  Merkur HD shaver dry.</li>
            <li> Great stand for my antique (Gillette) safety razor and a perfect fit for the Escali shaving brush.</li>
            <li> first experience with this brush/razor shaving. this stand works really well. the bottom is well weighted for sturdiness and countertop space.</li>
            <li> A well conceived and constructed stand at a fair price. Does a nice job of holding an Art of Shaving Pure Badger brush (where the bristles meet the handle) and a Harry&#x27;s Truman razor (slightly below the handle shoulder.) Keeps your shaving tools organized, at hand and ready for action.</li>
            <li> As the title says. This is a very nice looking stand, but it doesn&#x27;t fit my husband&#x27;s razor handle. Close!</li>
            <li> Does the job. Weighted so it doesn&#x27;t tip over and the bezel matches my razor handle. Very neat and useful!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, heavy.....holds my razor and brush perfectly and looks great!  I am highly impressed with the quality of this item.</li>
            <li> After spending too much time trying to figure out what would fit my razor and brush, I took a chance on the Escali Stand and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  My Harry&#x27;s Razor and 30 year old Kingsley brush fit fine.  But perhaps the biggest surprise was the heft of the base.  I was concerned that the stand might get knocked around on the vanity, but between the heft and the large rubber disk on the bottom, it stays in place.  I would recommend this stand.</li>
            <li> The stand pairs well with my Merkur razor and Escali brush. The base is solid and seems well made.</li>
            <li> Just received this as a birthday gift. Started straight razor shaving a few months back and stayed in limbo for a while as to buying additional accessories to see if I would enjoy and stick with it. Looks like I&#x27;m a lifer. The Escali razor and brush stand is nice quality and functional. I like it!</li>
            <li> Looks and functions exactly as advertised. Solid construction; seems like it will hold up nicely for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Very solid stand. Was pleasantly surprised how heavy it was. The knurling perfectly matches my Merkur razor. My only complaint is that the brush holder wasn&#x27;t wide enough to hold the brush in this set http://amzn.com/B001A3HPT0 (one of the most popular shaving sets on Amazon).</li>
            <li> Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand holds my razor and brush when I am not shaving. It does so pretty well.</li>
            <li> Love the polished stainless steel.  It matches both my razor and the polished stainless shaving cream bowl.  I love the look and glad to have a place to hang my badger brush.</li>
            <li> GREAT STAND,  FITS PERFECTLY TO MY DE HANDLE AND BRUSH,  SOLID AND STABLE.  IF YOU USE MERKUR 34C THAT&#x27;S THE STAND FOR YOU.</li>
            <li> Good size and looks great. I have a large omega boar brush and it barley fits, but I&#x27;m sure smaller brushes will fit well. I also like the weight.</li>
            <li> Fabulous stand! Looks classy, and Escali really rocks! I&#x27;ve purchased their badger brushes before, and now, this brush stand - very good quality materials for both, and fairly inexpensive! My husband really loves this stand!</li>
            <li> I purchased a Edwin Jagger DE89L Safety Razor and this razor stand is perfect. This has a weighted base that won&#x27;t allow your brush and razor to fall over. I would definetly would recommend to any one to purchase this one. and also the price is perfect also.</li>
            <li> Got this to store my Merkur 180 razor and Tweezerman brush .  The fit for both is perfect and I am pleasantly surprised at the size, sturdiness and beautiful chrome finninsh.  It feels well  balanced and sturdy so there is no worry of it tipping over.  The finninsh is a stylish chrome that matches the finninsh of the razor very well.  Have had it so far for two months with no rusting.  I do however pat the stand dry from time to time.  With good care I see no reason that it would not last for a long time.</li>
            <li> A must have if you are shaving with a safety razor and soapbrush! This is a solid piece of metal with a decent weight to it and will definitely not slip of of the counter (plus it is keeps things organized). Razor side fits a normal safety razor and would probably fit a brand name cartridge razor like a Gillette fusion (though I haven&#x27;t tried); brush side fits a standard badger-hair brush comfortably. Sellers ship fast and professionally.</li>
            <li> Looks good. Good quality too.</li>
            <li> Does not hold my brush, but the handle is smaller than most.  Otherwise good quality and looks good.  I am able to lean the brush in the slot so it works for now.</li>
            <li> My husband and son love it!!!!</li>
            <li> The Escali stand looks great and is tall enough to properly hang the  [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor]].  Not surprisingly the [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] also fits into the brush fork.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My son loves this product.  It holds all his shaving tools neatly and they are easy to grasp from the holder.  It was a great purchase!</li>
            <li> It keeps my razor and brush elevated to air dry, so it works, but it also only fits my Art of Shaving brush at the knot and my Harry&#x27;s razor sideways. I considered trying to bend the prongs to make everything fit a little bit more nicely, but I didn&#x27;t want to risk scratching it and chipping off the chrome. The chrome has held nicely in my steamy bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this stand again.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy stand that fits neatly in my medicine cabinet. The razor slot is a perfect fit for my Merkur 34C and my Gillette Fusion ProGlide. The bottom is heavy enough to keep the stand balanced while standing. Shipped quickly and packaged very well too!</li>
            <li> This brush stand looks great on my sink, and even holds my heavy chrome brush without a problem. I would buy it again, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to!</li>
            <li> I wish these things were easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my razor, which wobbles and falls out each time I touch the thing. I guess it&#x27;s designed specifically for the Escali safety razor, which I don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> Great quality nice looking stand.</li>
            <li> Perfect stand for setting my razor and brush out to dry. Looks nice and works perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a solid stand and looks nice.  It holds my Merkur long handled razor with no problem and the anti-skid base prevents it from sliding.  It has enough weight to it to keep in place and it will not topple over.  It is a great choice and terrific value.</li>
            <li> Works well to keep my brush in the right position for drying and hold my razor. What more can you expect?</li>
            <li> Looks classy and it&#x27;s sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought it to hold my Edwin Jagger Badger Hair Brush and Edwin Jagger Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No issues</li>
            <li> This is a nice stand, looks nice in my bathroom. Holds my brush and a razor. Though this has not presented a problem, I do notice that the bottom is very slippery when the counter top is wet.</li>
            <li> This little tool has been a delight, allowing me to keep my brush dry and my razor from being damaged by inadvertent nicks which are such a &amp;#34;pain.&amp;#34;  I had no idea how much I&#x27;d appreciate my Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand</li>
            <li> Excellent item, looks very nice with the rest of my shaving supplies. Will have to see how it holds up over time.</li>
            <li> High quality chrome finish. It&#x27;s much more beautiful than the lousy stock photo. Nice robust size to it. Designed for most DE safety razor and brush combos. I have it with the Edwin Jagger and a Parker brush. I have it places in the bathroom and women always comment on it. It&#x27;s really a great piece.</li>
            <li> Listen, you can go flinging your razor (safety or multi-blade) and shaving brush around your bathroom like a monkey throwing feces. OR you  can drop a few dinars and get this attractive shaving stand. I&#x27;ve had it for months, and the chrome still looks good. Also, the bottom is lined in a nice, padded non-slip rubber.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. This stand works and has a nice look.</li>
            <li> Great product and great vendor.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use. Wish I had one of these way back. Simple construction, solid build. Will last a long time if cared for correctly</li>
            <li> This stand looks great if it will fit your brush.  It didn&#x27;t fit mine, and I am having a hard time bending it.  Not sure what I will do with it.</li>
            <li> This stand is great! The finish is nice and cleans easily. I can&#x27;t find anything to complain about.</li>
            <li> very sturdy, works great</li>
            <li> Nice stand. I am happy with it so far. Holds my Gillette super adjustable and Tweezerman brush nicely. Shipment was prompt and trouble-free.</li>
            <li> This was a great complement to my husband&#x27;s new Edwin Jagger Safety Razor. It looks very smart and classy in our master. :)</li>
            <li> Looks pretty good on my sink, holds what it is supposed to hold, no rusting or other cosmetic issues.</li>
            <li> Very nice chromed still holding up great.... I love it...</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my razor and Tweezerman brush.</li>
            <li> What is it:&lt;br /&gt;Chrome razor and brush stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;Well constructed. Fits my razor and brush perfectly. (I use an Edwin Jagger DE89 razor, and an Edwin Jagger brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush hangs upside down letting it air dry well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far despite getting it / leaving it a bit wet from time to time, hasn&#x27;t rusted or shown any signs of issue which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom has a black non-slip pad ensuring you won&#x27;t damage counter tops, and it won&#x27;t move around on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;Nothing - great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again/recommend it?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, good product would recommend</li>
            <li> Good quality product. I use it regularly. Some of the razors do not fit in the holder like the new Gillette fusion proglide power razor,  otherwise the item is top quality. It is built strong and looks cool.</li>
            <li> Looks good and functions as advertised.  More than heavy enough to hold my 3.2 oz (90g +) razor without tipping when the brush is out.</li>
            <li> Very sharp looking! Super sturdy too! Heavier than expected. The side that holds the shave brush was just a hair too narrow for my brush. But I can wedge it just enough to hold.</li>
            <li> the side for razor will not hold my razor which is gillette</li>
            <li> Looks great works great</li>
            <li> Perfect accessory for my Merker safety razor and boar hair brush.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. I use a Tweezerman badger brush and Harry&#x27;s razor and they fit great on this. Given the way the hooks are shaped I&#x27;d guess they fit a wide range of razor handles and brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its heavy base is stable, and the knurled grip in the middle and on the top are both really useful additions. I&#x27;d 100% buy this again or give it as a gift to someone I know that uses a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Purphict with my Escali brush and Muhle shaver</li>
            <li> My son gave me some nice shaving soap for Christmas.  I accessed Amazon to find a shaving mug and brush to go with it, and found this splendid chrome stand to hold one&#x27;s brush and razor.  The stand features one&#x27;s brush and razor with charm.  The morning shave has been (almost) transformed from drudgery to adventure!  It is very nice and worth five stars, but for some reason the stand will not hold my 3-blade Gillette razor, though it holds my 5-blade Gillette razor (with battery) just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Hunter&lt;br /&gt;Nicholasville, KY</li>
            <li> Ok, I finally got to the point that I was sick of having my razor and brush laying on the counter next two the sink, so I decided to buy a stand. I did&#x27;nt really know how to buy a stand, or what made one better than the other, but I did know I did&#x27;nt want to spend a fortune. I saw this model, and it seemed reasonably priced, so I bought myself a birthday present (along with the GREAT edwin Jaeger 89l razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it seems nice, and it is pretty. It holds both my razor and brush, and does it´s job. I guess my biggest complaint would be that it does´nt make coffee (very old joke). so overall i´m happy with it. Yes, I would suggest it to someone looking for a cheap stand.</li>
            <li> Much heavier and solid feeling than what I was expecting.  Very high quality.  Holds my escali brush and my muhle safety razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works great. Looks great.</li>
            <li> I bought this after while back when I started shaving with a new razor. Looks and functions beautifully. The chrome looks great, the stand doesn&#x27;t fall down, it&#x27;s simply fantastic. If you&#x27;re in  need of a stand then get it. You won&#x27;t regret your decision.</li>
            <li> Good quality, has some weight to it, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it yet. I like it!</li>
            <li> Holds the razor and brush great.  Doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the counter.</li>
            <li> Looks very nice in my bathroom.  Holds DE safety razor but not a snug fit. Only 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to say it&#x27;ll stay as I bought it after time and use.</li>
            <li> Simple, elegant, ample, affordable. I love the way it has cleaned up my bathroom sink...and moved my razor to safety: no more tidy-uppers dulling my blades by moving them around while I&#x27;m at work. And if you&#x27;re not using a shaving brush before you shave, you&#x27;re doing something wrong..this stand dries and protects your badger hairs.</li>
            <li> The stand is very sturdy. Exactly what I was looking for my DE razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Fits inside my narrow medicine cabinet but also looks attractive sitting out in the open. Perfectly matches my Merkur long handled and fits my Escali badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this one because I liked the fact that it has a rubber bottom. Others have Styrofoam bottoms.</li>
            <li> Check to make sure the holder widths are compatible with your razor/brush dimensions.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it should, and looks great on my sink. Very classy, I cannot recommend it enough! The price is a steal.</li>
            <li> I looked perhaps ridiculously too long for the &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; stand...and this one is, just right. It&#x27;s made with good quality at a reasonable price. For those who were initially wondering about the base and rubber pad being released too much, I have some information. I took mine apart to give it a wax job and noticed that there is a washer placed between the chrome base and weight. The pad is actually stuck to that weight so...what the effect of the washer is, it raises the height of the chrome base up just a small amount so that the skirt of the base won&#x27;t come in contact with your countertop. I think this may have been an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; at some point in the assembly chain to address that problem.&lt;br /&gt;The arms are perfect and hold my Merkur and Escali brush perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The weight is just right; just heavy enough to avoid toppling.&lt;br /&gt;The knurling gives just enough grip to avoid sliding and also masks fingerprints.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Nice addition to my bathroom and helps prevent my brush from getting ruined by letting it properly dry.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Solid construction, all metal, breaks down for traveling or storage, nothing feels cheep about it, and it holds my Escali brush and Merkur 180 razor perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product! It&#x27;s not cheaply made and Looks great. Just the right size. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The razor and brush stand works well for me it look good and very practical the shaving brush is also Escali so it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Looks great on my counter and does a great job of showing off my brush and razor.  Allows the brush to dry properly and keep it&#x27;s shape.  Comes apart easily so you can travel with it as well, but is very sturdy when assembled.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I just took up shaving with a safety razor and needed to get the necessary tools to shave. I use this stand with a Merkur Long Handle razor and the Escali Badger shaving brush. I like how the base is weighted and securely holds the razor and brush and allowing them to dry between shaves. Very happy with this stand.</li>
            <li> This sturdy yet small razor stand holds my husband&#x27;s razor perfectly.  His original brush was too small to fit, but we purchased a slightly larger one which works great!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it does what it is suppose to do and looks great! Shipped to the house in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for holding brush and razor, the cutouts that hold them are spot on correctly sized. Quality build and seems durable.</li>
            <li> This stand works perfectly with my Tweezerman badger brush and my Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl DE razor. It is stable, elegant and functional.</li>
            <li> Looks good, feels sturdy.  Muhle R89 fits very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owns a whipped dog 24mm silver tip and an Art of Shaving pure badger brush and neither fits great - they have to hang by the knot rather than the top of the handle like I wanted.</li>
            <li> Solid. Doesn&#x27;t tip over. Holds an Escali brush well, but is a bit weird sometimes putting my Merkur razor on.  Once it&#x27;s on, it stays on fine. Wish I could give a 4.5.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about the quality of this, but it&#x27;s heavy and well made.  It fits my brush and razor perfectly, and the box it comes in is presentable.  Would make a fine gift.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Does its job, looks decent enough. Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Got these for the groomsmen in my wedding along with a Art of Shaving kit. Quality was better than I expected. I ordered one for myself the next day. Pretty heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t fit my large based badger brush, but it fits like a dream. Both my merkur 180 and my parker badger brush fit beautifully into this gorgeous chrome stand.</li>
            <li> Exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li> We love this shaving stand.  It&#x27;s quite elegant, substantial and well made.  We&#x27;re also pleased that it&#x27;s American made and sold by a small business.  We&#x27;ve bought several for friends and family.</li>
            <li> Received it quick and so far it fits my two razors and brushes.</li>
            <li> Simple, sturdy, stable, effective, well packed and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> A nice decor to your bathroom sink. Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor stand. Nice finish and good quality. I definitely recommend</li>
            <li> The base fits perfectly with my razor and brush.  Weight is good and it has a rubber base to prevent slipping and scratching of surfaces.  The ends of the holders are bent slightly up with prevents the razor and brush from falling off, if bumped. The chrome surface looks great, making it a great addition for anyone who uses safety razor and brush to shave.</li>
            <li> Precision made, works and looks wonderful on the counter-top.</li>
            <li> Nice stand, works great!</li>
            <li> The razor is perfect to handle. It came with 1 Merkur razor blade. I bought Personna Blades for replacement. The quality of the Merkur blades is well worth the price difference as the Merkur has platinum edge and is a bit stouter blade. The stand worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> My only complaints are that the size of the hole for the brush is too small for my brushes (which are very typical, run of the mill brushes) and that the &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; to keep the razor in place is too shallow, allowing my razor (both the standard Gillette Mach 3 and the nice metal one I got with the stand) to easily fall off.  Otherwise it would be a very solid five star.</li>
            <li> Quality stand,  made of great material and holds my safety razor and brush nicely.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves the new razor set I bought him and this is a perfect accompaniment to it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this while on vacation in the US this summer. Absolutely delighted with this product as I had been looking for one for ages. The stand is solidly built and is an excellent stand for my Merkur Futur razor and brush. Delivery was quick and hassle free. Would definitely recommend this razor/brush stand to anyone who is thinking of buying one.</li>
            <li> Equal in quality to more expensive razor stands and less expensive.  Excellent chrome finish.  I&#x27;ve had mine several weeks now and have zero complaints.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product.  It is heavy enough to be very stable, and the chrome finish is nice.  My vintage Gillette Ball Tech razor and badger brush are now nicely displayed on the bathroom counter, rather than moldering in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and solid feeling. Gives my old Gillette a nice retro look!</li>
            <li> Very well made.I also like the weight it is heavy enough that it doesn&#x27;t tip over.</li>
            <li> Great product, great quality</li>
            <li> Very Nice stand. Good quality, not only serves it&#x27;s purpose, but it is also a nice looking article for for display in my bathroom. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> !I&#x27;m in love with this stand. It looks great and it is build to last a lifetime. Everyone who has seen in in my bathroom has complemented how good it looks.</li>
            <li> Looks great and is very sturdy. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a nice heavy combo holder for razor and brush.  Good quality, fast shipping, no issues at all with the seller.  Great transaction - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> You all have done a wonderful job of fulfilling your online promises, couldn&#x27;t be happier or expect more. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Its weird but a shaving brush and razor almost look naked without a stand. For reference I use this brush stand with a Merkur 34C and a Parker chrome handled silvertip badger shaving brush. I like the stand’s heavy base because I never have to worry that it’ll tip over when I’m hanging my brush and blade to dry. I cannot attest to its long-term durability, but I can say that it doesn’t have that cheap feeling that cheap things have…if that makes any sense. I have no major complaints; this is just a beautiful, functional product that works exactly as advertised without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> I love this stand. It&#x27;s well made, sturdy and attractively designed. Shaving brushes come with their own totally lame stands. Upgrade to this stand and you&#x27;ll be very pleased.</li>
            <li> Stands up well to daily use. A quick wipe down &amp; it&#x27;s like new again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a straight forward holder for my razor and brush without paying a premium price. This holder was exactly what I wanted. Has a nice chrome finish and holds both razor and brush nicely.</li>
            <li> Looks just as good as the $100 one</li>
            <li> Handsome and functional at a good price.</li>
            <li> The finish matches perfectly to my Merkur 180 model. It also fits my Escali badger brush perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice weight and shine to it. The bottom is rubbized for grip and stability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very high quality item.</li>
            <li> Like it! As described from the seller!</li>
            <li> Great product looks amazing in my bathroom a must have !</li>
            <li> Good solid and heavy chrome stand. Anti-skid base. Excellent quality for the price. You can pay two to three times the price and not get a better quality material or assembly. Excellent value for you money!</li>
            <li> The stand is beautiful and came exactly as it was shown on Amazon.  It holds both my brush and razor perfectly.  No stains or rust after a month of use and not likely to be so.  I highly recommend this stand!</li>
            <li> This stand is sturdy and easy to use.  The seller sent it very, very quickly and the transaction was as smooth as the shave!</li>
            <li> Fits my razor and Escali Badger Brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> Solid and it looks good&lt;br /&gt;Better then I expected</li>
            <li> Just be aware of that, as some of the larger brushes won&#x27;t fit the smaller stand. I have one of each and they&#x27;re great! Solid company, too. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> nice item suits me fine, arrived when promised</li>
            <li> The stand has a great weight to it and looks really good!  In addition, apparently it extends the life of the brush to hang it upside down to dry so I wholeheartedly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Solid, stylish, well-finished piece of kit that compliments my shaver &amp; brush very nicely indeed. And at a bargain price. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand not because I needed it but because I wanted to change what has become a tedious, boring task (shaving every day) into something more interesting.  I added a well made razor, new brush and am trying out different shaving soaps. And have created my own ritual every morning.</li>
            <li> No visible rust after many months of use, perfectly fits my razor and brush, and allows enough room for the brush to air dry a bit.  Performs it&#x27;s just perfectly</li>
            <li> Exceptionally well crafted and beautifully designed</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this stand. It is well made and has really good weight to it.  Looks great on the counter. I will be looking into other products from this company.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, love it!</li>
            <li> Appears to be constructed of quality materials, weighted base with neoprene bottom for stability and the stainless also looks to be quality also, though I haven&#x27;t had long enough to see how it holds up against sink splash, etc.</li>
            <li> Excellent workmanship and style.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves his stand, and I love that his extra-manly shaving kit is stored in a neat and orderly fashion. This stand looks sharp and keeps the brush from resting on surfaces and harboring nasty bacteria and such!</li>
            <li> too small to hold brush handle</li>
            <li> Look nice and works well.  Holds my Escali brush and Merkur safety razor (long handle). If you like the polished chrome look this is the one for you. It matches the safety razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful stand for your razor and shaving brush.  The look matches most razor handles and it has a nice heft to it - its not shoddy and quickly thrown together.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product that looks very nice and is well made.</li>
            <li> Seems like a quality made product. Unfortunately for me, the brush holder was too wide for the handle of my shave brush.</li>
            <li> Hard to really get excited about a razor and brush stand, but this one seems nicely weighted and does the trick.</li>
            <li> A very nice object  d&#x27;art.  Very substantial and well made.</li>
            <li> Great Product, really nice quality, love it</li>
            <li> Very nice addition to my shave set. Delivery was timely and product appears well made</li>
            <li> This Stand looks very nice. I love it</li>
            <li> This is a really nice stand. Good weight, won&#x27;t tip. It will hold an Edwin Jagger 89 by the ridges on the handle. I can also hang a Weber classic handle in it upside down. Finish looks nice. No complaints.</li>
            <li> as advertised and saves space</li>
            <li> Sturdy, well made, fits all of my razors and brushes without an issue.</li>
            <li> Quality is good. Cleans up nicely. Knurling matches my Merkur 180 perfectly.</li>
            <li> Looks good, and well made. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I  bought a Parker Safety Razor 100% Pure Badger brush and the stand that came with it was cheap plastic.  I ordered this stand but didn&#x27;t research if the parker brush would fit, but it did!  I would recommend others to order one of these if they&#x27;re getting a brush because it holds your brush upside down and dries it the proper way</li>
            <li> Does its job wonderfully. I have a Merkur short handle razor and a Tweezerman badger hair brush; it fits the stand perfectly lengthwise. A perfect way to keep things organized and prevent damage from occurring to your brush and razor. I subtracted a star because the razor holding side wasn&#x27;t deep enough to casually place my razor head on the holder without it resting off-kilter unless one delicately places the razor on the holder. A minor issue but a easy correction for the manufacturer to deepen the razor holder part.</li>
            <li> Really nicely made, a good weight, but the opening for the brush is much too narrow for my windmill shaving brush. Not sure I&#x27;ve seen a shaving brush it would fit</li>
            <li> Very nice stand and received order quickly!  Excellent!!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, solidly constructed, and fits my razor.  Balanced well enough to not fall over as well.  It also has a great look to it.</li>
            <li> Solid and hefty. Coupled with Shark blades makes for an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> Great product that showed up just as described. I really liked the &amp;#34;hefty&amp;#34; feeling of the stand. Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect stand for perfect price. Stainless, effective and perty on any counter or shower.</li>
            <li> Recently, I returned to shaving with a double edged safety razor and brush.  I just did not want to store them hidden in a bathroom drawer so I purchased this chrome stand.  It is an attractive way to keep my shaving gear close at hand and dry for its next use.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This stand is simple, yet elegant. It keeps my razor and brush up off the counter and ensures that they dry properly after each use. The general air of 1950s sophistication with which it imbues my bathroom is pretty great too.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality. Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping as well. I am very satisfied with the product and the service.</li>
            <li> Looks good. The weight is good. My heavy razor works good in it.</li>
            <li> Classy stand. My husband loves it. It fits his Art of Shaving Brush and Merkur Razor.</li>
            <li> Great stand.  Easy to clean and both brush and razor fit perfectly.  Keeps my sink well organized and shaving supplies close by.</li>
            <li> Not what I would call an essential but I certainly enjoy this stand. It looks quite nice sitting on the bathroom counter with my safety razor and shaving brush sitting hanging on it.</li>
            <li> Very nicely made stand.  Holds my razor well and is very weighty.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my FIance and he loves it.  Is very sturdy and looks great.</li>
            <li> Works well solid heavy base.</li>
            <li> This product  is exactly what I need. It is compact, stable, and a terrific price. My twenty year old brush fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, but doesn&#x27;t fit the Parker Safety Razor 100% Best Badger Bristle Shaving Brush</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the price.  It utilizes minimum space on the counter, and  is sturdily built. The weighted base keeps it steady.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I have found is that it will not readily accept the wider brush handles. It will, however, allow a brush to be placed on the bottom of the handle, bristles down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and sturdy and great price</li>
            <li> Sturdy and solid! Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product and speedy delivery. Thank you</li>
            <li> It takes a very steady hand to get the Mach 3 razor handle to balance precariously in this stand (razor side up).  Once it&#x27;s there, it looks great and works well but getting to that point is an exercise in frustration.</li>
            <li> Gap too small for brush. Basically useless.</li>
            <li> Well made product, works as designed.</li>
            <li> Really snazzy product. Somehow elevates the chore of shaving to something more. Silly I know.</li>
            <li> Gift for my son who is just starting DE shaving.  Arrived quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li> Very nice!  Excellent price for the quality!</li>
            <li> This was part of a Christmas gift for my son-in-law.  He put it on his Christmas wish list and he seemed very pleased with it.  I can offer no other information since this was given as a gift.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, bought one for my husband and one for my brother</li>
            <li> Sturdy stand and everything fits perfectly into it. Not much else to be said. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Super fast delivery 2 days before Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is avery nice, HEAVY stand. Very high end look for an extremely reasonable price! It&#x27;s a nice compliment to an old-school shaving set-up.</li>
            <li> This stand is very sturdy, and it looks great.  I have seen others that have a cheap finish or are flimsy, but that is not the case with the Escali stand. I have an Edwin Jagger DE89bl razor and an Escali badger brush, and they both fit very well.  It seems like it will hold most razors but some brush handles may be too big (although the opening has a decent size).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a razor/brush stand.</li>
            <li> Very good quality product.</li>
            <li> It looks great. Perfect. Just what my husband needed.</li>
            <li> The delivery time on this was amazing! The product looks awesome on our bathroom shelf!</li>
            <li> Great product! Quality product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product available at a great price.  It is visually very appealing and holds both a razor and the brush in a neat well balance manner. The product arrived in a very timely manner and was nicely packaged.  I would have no reservations about buying this or any other of their products.</li>
            <li> Good quality stand. Base had nice weight.</li>
            <li> This is very well designed and sturdy.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Great sturdy product for the price.  Looks really sharp and classy.  Definitely alot cheaper in price than most stands and the quality is alot better too.  I would highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a razor and brush stand for your set up.</li>
            <li> The stand looks great and is sturdy and well made. At half the price of mast comparable stands I highly reccomend this product. My parker 22r long handle fits with room to spare (Longer handled razors touch the counter with some stands) as does my cheapie badger brush I got from my local Target. Be aware if you have a Van der Hagen boar brush from the kit it wont fit. This will vary with different manufacturers obviously. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Just about perfect.  Good quality chrome.  The Escali brush fits perfectly by the handle, other brushes need to hang by the top of the brush.</li>
            <li> I chose a 5 star rating for this because of the price and finish. The Escali is exactly  the same stand as the Col Conk Evernice stand except for the finish.  I paid $29.59 for the Conk and $21.95 for the Escali (savings for a 100 pack of Derby DE razors, huh?).  The Escali has a polished chrome finish that matches my Merkur DE Razor and is sturdy just as the Conk stand is.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Exactly as described and solid.</li>
            <li> Looks great! Nice heavy base to keep the stand balanced well.</li>
            <li> Great stand. I have really liked it a lot, and it has helped my badger brush stay fresh. The brush holder was a little tight on my brush, but it works. The seller was also wonderful.</li>
            <li> Nice razor stand. Looks good on the vanity .</li>
            <li> This works well, and looks great on the counter.</li>
            <li> Looks nice and works.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED AND RECEIVED IT VERY FAST!  THE PRICE AND THE QUALITY WAS SUPER!</li>
            <li> The order for the Escali razor and brush stand was processed and shipped promptly.  It has a beautiful chrome finish and looks great on my sink top.  The weight is perfect so it will not tip over and the rubber base is hidden and does not mark the counter top.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my long handle merkur razor and tweezerman brush, fits perfectly! Feels nice and heavy, when you pull it out of the box you would swear you paid 50 bucks for it!</li>
            <li> does exactly as described</li>
            <li> A little expensive but I love seeing the quality of this device every day.</li>
            <li> I went into Art of Shaving and they tried to sell me something very similar to this with a starting price of $100.  The mustachioed salesman told me that their stands were so solid they wouldn&#x27;t fall over during an earthquake.  As a geologist, I found this notion offensive.  Needless to say, the above stand will meet all of your brush and razor-holding needs just fine.  It&#x27;s utilitarian and doesn&#x27;t get in the way.  Everything I needed.</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed with this unit.  The stand Does Not do a very good job holding either the shave brush or my razor.  The ends of the stand should be turned up a bit more to help hold the items on the stand better.  As designed now both my razor and brush simply slide off the holder.&lt;br /&gt;Sign...disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my Escali deluxe Razor and Brush stand. It looks great with my Mekur 180 razor.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Looks nice. Works great.</li>
            <li> Nice and shiny. Just a holder so not much else to comment on until it gets older....</li>
            <li> I just received my razor stand. First impression, I love it. It was heavier than I expected it to be, and sturdier. I own a 1971 Gillette razor and it fits perfectly. Not to mention how nice it looks too.</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> American made arrived on time. Quality products. Nuff said!!!!</li>
            <li> Great stand to use with my Merkur DE razor and Escali Badger brush</li>
            <li> Heavy base, easy to use.  Looks good.  Good price.  Nothing more needed by me.</li>
            <li> Nice product, nice price, very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Very nice and practical stand.  Sturdy, sits well on the bathroom counter.  Holds the razor and brush well.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Really nice sturdy organizer for your shaving equipment !!</li>
            <li> Beautifully made razor/brush stand for the right price. Looks great and is of high quality. Would highly recommend purchasing!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  This stand holds my Escali shaving brush and my shaving razors nicely.</li>
            <li> This product is great for any safety razor shaving kit.  I currently own the Parker 96R which sits ok on the stand.  The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the mount for the shaver could be a bit longer so it would sit more securely.</li>
            <li> The stand is sturdy and looks great - and has a great price. Especially compared to the ridiculous high end stand that don&#x27;t look or work any better. My only comment is that I wish it would be able to hold the Fusion razor with the razor side up. Otherwise a great buy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold my razor very well.  It&#x27;s great for the shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I cannot review how this product works since I bought it for my son who is discouraged with the price of blades.  He will be 42 in October and has very sensitive skin.  He has never shaved with a safety razor but has decided that the new razors are too expensive and not worth the price.  When he said that he would like to try the razor his father used when he first started to shave, I jumped on the suggestion and did some research.  This stand is part of a gift he will be getting in October on his birthday.  The rest of the gift consists of a Merkel safety razor, a soap and soap dish, and a combination package of blades offered by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say the stand looks beautiful and should help eliminate clutter on his sink.  Hopefully, he will be able to use this type of shaving system and not get a terrible rash on his face.  As his mother, I am grateful that I was able to purchase all the components of an \\&quot;old fashioned shave\\&quot; on Amazon.  I can say for certainty that the style of the stand looks elegant and will fit in with the decor of his WC.</li>
            <li> Quality product.  My Merkur long-handle DE razor fits the stand perfectly, as does my Escali shaving brush.  Perfect size and weight!  Recommended.</li>
