            <li>This moisture cream goes on so smoothly and is so lightweight.  </li>

            <li>It has also exfoliated some of the smaller age spots and has really helped my skin tone.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll have to start looking before I completely run out.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li> NeoStrata works for me, but this is an expensive product for just 1.4 oz.</li>
            <li> It seems like its a bit difficult to find</li>

            <li> This product is amazing. It&#x27;s one of few that makes a difference overnight - literally. I have never had a product work so quickly and so consistently. Any time I have an event or important occasion coming up, I use NeoStrata in the few days leading up to it and I always end up with clear, glowing skin. This product is fantastic. My only complaint would be that it contains parabens, and I prefer to avoid them. That&#x27;s the only reason I don&#x27;t use the product daily.</li>
            <li> It works just as doctor said it would. I alternate it with the stronger version for great, but gentle  exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Nice, like that it&#x27;s unscented. Small size would be good for travel</li>
            <li> This is an amazing moisturizing face cream. It definitely reduced the wrinkles I had on my face and neck. It has also exfoliated some of the smaller age spots and has really helped my skin tone. I also started to use it on my chest and I already see that it is less freckly and a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I used it for 4 months.</li>
            <li> Love how. This moistened.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a good  product. I wish it was offered in a  larger quantity for a better price.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer because I do not see peeling skin on my face.  A lot of moisturizer have anti-aging ingredients that leave patches of peeling (dry) skin here and there.  NeoStrata works for me, but this is an expensive product for just 1.4 oz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky on my hands when I put it on my face. I can&#x27;t wear it under makeup. So I use it in my night time regimen instead.  Helps to smooth Roth skin.</li>
            <li> Posted by Cynthia Specht, good product, your skin will thank you for using it.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product in Africa by a Russian dermatologist .  I start using it a year ago and I don&#x27;t regret.  It&#x27;s a good product for people with color as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for several years and it is one of my staple products. Great at moisturizing and refining skin texture with no irritation (and I am very sensitive to exfoliating products). Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I never seen the best face cream like neaostra ultra moisturizing.  This is my first time to use it but it works better on me and I relly love it, even it&#x27;s expensive but it makes my face look wonderful</li>
            <li> Dont need another moisturizing face cream,this one is a big winner</li>
            <li> I like to change up my moisturizers from time to time.  This product is very moist and leaves my skin feeling great.  I would recommend it as an alternate to my other face creams.</li>
            <li> This moisture cream goes on so smoothly and is so lightweight.  It does not irritate my sensitive skin like so many other creams.  I saw a program recommending polyhydroxides and this cream has it. It seems like its a bit difficult to find so I&#x27;ll have to start looking before I completely run out.  I don&#x27;t want to be without it!  Love it.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product, and it does moisturize the skin beautifully.I will continue to use it and recommend it to others</li>
            <li> This is the only product one of my friends daughters will use.  She has me buy it for her occassionally.  She highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> I was concerned when I looked in the mirror an hour after the 1st use. My face was bright red and splotchy. My dermatologies recommended that I not use it again.</li>
            <li> I use this all day and every day.  I am highly allergic and it satisfies all my needs.  I recommend it highly.</li>
