            <li>One of my favorite concealers!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Great coverage and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This is a good size tube and it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>this concealer is great, full coverage and works as a highlighter too.</li>
            <li>A lot of people have had good results with this concealer, but even on a clean and primed face</li>
            <li>I love it and probably will purchase this again.</li>
            <li>To me, I&#x27;ve not used anything better</li>
            <li>Absolutely love and adore this concealer...</li>
            <li>My complexion has never looked so blemish free!</li>
            <li>I love this concealer.</li>
            <li>and I use a foundation and powder on top of it.</li>
            <li>Love this concealer from Physicians Formula.</li>
            <li>Does not feel greasy or cause other products applied best it to run.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>but this product is not as good as &amp;#34;almay clear complexion 100&amp;#34; with wand.</li>
            <li>I like it, but it comes off to easy and appears Daley when first applied.</li>
            <li>Tried many many concealer to over the years, and none ( even those that are several times the price) compare to the coverage and wearability ( all day!)</li>
            <li>This concealer works great on my &amp;#34;italian inherited under eye dark circles&amp;#34; and on blemishes.</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with this concealer.</li>
            <li>Really like this concealer!!</li>
            <li>You can use just a little for light coverage or apply more for layering more coverage.</li>
            <li>I order it because it&#x27;s a more natural brand</li>
            <li>This is enough on it&#x27;s own and my experience has been it looks cakey when applied over foundation (or under).</li>
            <li>Thanks to YouTuber: missglamorazzi who posts product reviews!</li>
            <li>REALLY COVERS!</li>
            <li>Very dense concealer.</li>
            <li>I actually really appreciate it for the coverage.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be high coverage</li>
            <li>The fact that I can get a great concealer at my local over the counter pharmacy/store instead of paying outrageous prices at a cosmetic counter makes me happy.</li>
            <li>They discontinued it in the stores where I live.</li>
            <li>On my oily/combination skin, this concealer looks good when I put it on in the morning but without fail will move and &amp;#34;cake up&amp;#34; by the end of the day no matter how I apply it or how much I use.</li>
            <li>It also sucks up all moisture on my skin as well as sucking up powder and making it look more caked on than it really is.</li>
            <li>I just use a little bit on blemishes, blend blend blend, and use a light powder because anything else will just cause a pile up on your face.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and it&#x27;s easy to use too much.</li>
            <li>quality is satisfactory, nothing major to give 5 stars though, some times it causes irritation</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really thick and when applied it looks fine</li>
            <li>MUCH lighter than expected</li>
            <li>It really does wonders with my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is thick and dries quickly.</li>

            <li> If you have some minor acne scarring, even red spots, this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long as well.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that you seem to have to use a lot of it to get the dark circles and other flaws covered up.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> EXTREME concealer.</li>
            <li> That being said, I would not use this for layering with other makeup.</li>
            <li> well - however I do mix it with a little moisturizer because it is a bit dry and tends to cake if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not only was it lighter than expected, but the application was too thick, not smooth and blendable like others i have tried.</li>
            <li> a tube of it lasts virtually forever because so little is needed.</li>
            <li> Should be a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I mix a little bit with a little primer or moisturizer and use a blender sponge and get the coverage I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> It was too heavy for what I needed in a concealer.</li>
            <li> but after maybe an hour it sinks into any wrinkles and imperfections and makes them worse.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s prescription strength concealer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tricky to work with but definitely is a serious concealer.</li>
            <li> but it was not, it was about medium coverage and is very hard to blend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick with a powdery finish.</li>
            <li> I have awful skin and it covers very well.</li>
            <li> Paired with some coverage powder, you can&#x27;t go wrong and you don&#x27;t look cakey.</li>

            <li> quality is satisfactory, nothing major to give 5 stars though, some times it causes irritation</li>
            <li> Really like this concealer!! A little goes a long way, and it&#x27;s easy to use too much. But, once you get the hang of it, it works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick with a powdery finish. MUCH lighter than expected</li>
            <li> Work so well!! I have awful skin and it covers very well. I apply it under my foundation or wear it alone.</li>
            <li> On my oily/combination skin, this concealer looks good when I put it on in the morning but without fail will move and &amp;#34;cake up&amp;#34; by the end of the day no matter how I apply it or how much I use. It&#x27;s really thick and when applied it looks fine but after maybe an hour it sinks into any wrinkles and imperfections and makes them worse. It also sucks up all moisture on my skin as well as sucking up powder and making it look more caked on than it really is. A lot of people have had good results with this concealer, but even on a clean and primed face I can&#x27;t get it to sto</li>
            <li> this concealer is great, full coverage and works as a highlighter too. I love it and probably will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it comes off to easy and appears Daley when first applied.</li>
            <li> Tried many many concealer to over the years, and none ( even those that are several times the price) compare to the coverage and wearability ( all day!) of this product. Does not feel greasy or cause other products applied best it to run. The Price is great, too! Hope they never discontinue this!</li>
            <li> I tried this and it does even my skin tone out well - however I do mix it with a little moisturizer because it is a bit dry and tends to cake if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer!  Goes on smooth and great coverage!  A keeper for sure!</li>
            <li> Perfect coverage!  Great product!  I would highly recommend this product.  To me, I&#x27;ve not used anything better and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of over the counter concealers.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love and adore this concealer... And conceals it does!!! Great coverage and no shine!!! This product goes a long way with one tiny bit. I use this alone over my moisturizer or I&#x27;ll use under my foundation... both ways look great! My complexion has never looked so blemish free! Thanks to YouTuber: missglamorazzi who posts product reviews! It&#x27;s amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this concealer. The fact that I can get a great concealer at my local over the counter pharmacy/store instead of paying outrageous prices at a cosmetic counter makes me happy. This concealer works great on my &amp;#34;italian inherited under eye dark circles&amp;#34; and on blemishes. It lasts all day long as well. And a little goes a long way. You can use just a little for light coverage or apply more for layering more coverage. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This has lasted me over a year and it&#x27;s still going strong. Its coverage can&#x27;t be beat, and it lasts all day. If you have some minor acne scarring, even red spots, this is the way to go! Paired with some coverage powder, you can&#x27;t go wrong and you don&#x27;t look cakey.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite concealers! Great coverage and easy to apply. Tube lasts quite awhile and doesn&#x27;t collect bacteria like wand applicators and pots.</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied with this concealer. It is brightening, so works well for the under eyes, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for blemishes. Has great coverage. It is thick and dries quickly. I&#x27;ve found using a damp sponge to apply it works best,</li>
            <li> Though this concealer does just that, I had to stop using it because my face began to break out. It was too heavy for what I needed in a concealer.</li>
            <li> Not only was it lighter than expected, but the application was too thick, not smooth and blendable like others i have tried.</li>
            <li> Best concealer on market in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I think this is the best under-eye concealer on the market, and a tube of it lasts virtually forever because so little is needed. - just a drop the size of a freckle. Lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t melt off with heat, doesn&#x27;t cake, REALLY COVERS!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Great coverage for a good price, will be buying again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good concealer that seems to blend well. Only thing is that you seem to have to use a lot of it to get the dark circles and other flaws covered up. I order it because it&#x27;s a more natural brand and I use a foundation and powder on top of it. Blends well though. Should be a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer from Physicians Formula. They discontinued it in the stores where I live. So, I am thankful that I can purchase it through Amazon.com. It really does wonders with my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a good size tube and it&#x27;s ok but this product is not as good as &amp;#34;almay clear complexion 100&amp;#34; with wand.</li>
            <li> Very dense concealer. I actually really appreciate it for the coverage. Problem is, it is obvious and requires a LOT of blending. I mix a little bit with a little primer or moisturizer and use a blender sponge and get the coverage I&#x27;d like. It&#x27;s tricky to work with but definitely is a serious concealer. I mean, it&#x27;s prescription strength concealer. EXTREME concealer. Melasma concealer. That being said, I would not use this for layering with other makeup. This is enough on it&#x27;s own and my experience has been it looks cakey when applied over foundation (or under). I just use a little bit on blemishes, blend blend blend, and use a light powder because anything else will just cause a pile up on your face. And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer I have found and I have been using it for about a year now.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be high coverage but it was not, it was about medium coverage and is very hard to blend.</li>
            <li> My favorite concealer at a great bargain</li>
