            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know that there was a product as awesome as this that will make that dream come true!</li>
            <li>However, it does smell, but i just wash my hands really good when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>my skin has not reacted which is a good thing</li>
            <li>Over all it was a good product.</li>
            <li>It is packaged very nicely and comes in a cute petite container that fits great in my very full medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it!</li>

            <li>Works good love it</li>
            <li>My arm pits didn&#x27;t darken overnight, so I&#x27;m going continue to use the product and am very confident I&#x27;ll see even better results.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was too good to be true, but it didn&#x27;t work like I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>Used it for 4 weeks didn&#x27;t work, too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Thank god that I was able to return it.</li>
            <li>it works better with the nivea whiting deodorant i use it at night and nivea in the morning.</li>

            <li>maybe its better this way.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>This cream did remove most of the brown.</li>
            <li>its been more than 2 weeks already.....</li>
            <li>not for me, now I&#x27;m just going to have to learn to love my underarms the way they are.</li>
            <li>make sure you exfoliate and wash your UA before applying it.</li>
            <li>lol thanks</li>
            <li>My skin gets so dry during the winter time, and this is the best cream!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best product Ive ever purchased from any site or store that does EXACTLY what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>ur underarms use something light and refreshing lke</li>
            <li>I had light underarms with just some darkness that I wanted to get rid off.</li>
            <li>cheap, you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li>a cheap product please don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>my pits are looking more and more normal.</li>
            <li>Today, 3-31-12, after using it about 8 times, I have on a tank top for the first time in a year.</li>
            <li>Totaly worth the money and the time!</li>
            <li>was excited to use this product.</li>
            <li>and i really had high hopes for it after reading all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>There should be at least direction on the box on whats the best way to use this product.</li>
            <li>Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of if you want your too white armpits to be more than this</li>
            <li>okay so far.</li>
            <li>as I have YET to see any results from the product even after a month&#x27;s worth of use.   </li>
            <li>After receiving the package, I used it right away.</li>
            <li>i used it consistently for about a month and saw no results at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, I&#x27;ve NEVER used a product that worked so well for exactly what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li>Truly a product that does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>Most of the cream is left.</li>
            <li>I wished this would be the magic potion that could finally lighten my underarm pigmentation once and for all, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I think I used too much</li>
            <li>Thanks a million.</li>
            <li>i used it about 3-4 weeks saw no changes in the discoloration of my under arm and the cream felt very gloopy and sticky and smelled like glue.</li>
            <li>and I am ready to wear tank tops for the summer</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, not had much time to use it.</li>
            <li>To my delight, the product goes on gentle and has not irritated my skin at all.</li>
            <li>; u have absolutely nothing to lose, the price is affordable and the product works</li>
            <li>I used the whole jar, and never saw a difference.</li>
            <li>once u put it on everyone knows...felt very embarrassed when someone asked &#x27;what is that sent&#x27; in an unfriendly voice.</li>
            <li>cream was gentle and caused no irritation.</li>
            <li>It required very little.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend this item!</li>
            <li>, i never used one on top of the other.)</li>
            <li>The cream goes on smooth and a lil goes a long way.</li>
            <li>it got more dark of my skin</li>
            <li>Got a second jar to use on the razor bumps scars in the bikini area, you would not believe how quickly this stuff lighted scars that have been there for years.</li>
            <li>I figure I will continue to use the product in HOPES that it at least yields some results before I move on to a BETTER product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any major changes</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin and had no problems using this product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, rash-prone skin and this</li>
            <li>When I first started using this product, it worked all right, but after using it daily for about a couple weeks, it completely stopped working and all the discoloration under the arms came back.</li>
            <li>I got this last week, item came quickly and was as described, small jar of lightly scented under-arm cream.  </li>
            <li>The following times I&#x27;ve used the product, I have used about the size of a dime [which worked fine for my skin], and after the first few days, I have seen some improvements.</li>
            <li>i had grossly dark armpits, so i never wore tank tops or sleevless tops but after trying this product i feel confident enough to wear them now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have only been using it for a 3 weeks, use only a very little and always wash pits before use best to use at night and when using don&#x27;t shave or wear very dark clothing</li>
            <li>I made the huge mistake of buying two of these little jars and they haven&#x27;t done a thing.</li>
            <li>this combined with NonScents deodorant have completely lightened my underarms just in time for summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been several weeks since I&#x27;ve been using  this produce with absolutely zero improvement in the area I was trying to lighten.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin probably just got sensitive with age.  </li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin use caution.</li>
            <li>havent seen much of a result but its only been 2 weeks</li>
            <li>and I dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It does make the underarm soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>it helps (when i say don&#x27;t shave i mean don&#x27;t use blades, use a safe hair removing creme.</li>
            <li>if ur like me and ur armpits are extremely dark then one bottle wont do the trick while it does fade rather quickly, u still must keep up with the routine.</li>
            <li>definitely proved to be gentle enough for me.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in my underarms, which are typically dark and very dry.</li>
            <li>After 3 times using this, I was comfortable to at least wear a short sleeve shirt.</li>

            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I was a little apprehensive in trying the product.</li>
            <li> know how long I need to continue using</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anybody with dark and dry underarms.</li>
            <li> Kinda small, but its working so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be going back to my trusty Black Opal &amp;/or Esoterica.</li>
            <li> : I am very pale with hyper sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Dabbed a little of this product on those very same spots, I dont even have to wear concealer now.  </li>
            <li> Have not really seen a change</li>
            <li> I just received the product and have only tried it for a few days now.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of time unless you&#x27;re looking for red, patchy, itchy smelly underarms.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to waste a lot of money on products that probably won&#x27;t have this same effect as this one.</li>
            <li> And get this, I&#x27;ve been using Palmer&#x27;s and other skin lightening cream for dark spots on my face from acne and such, no success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used half the bottle so far--diligently--and see only a slight change, It&#x27;s been about six weeks, and I still have half a bottle to go</li>
            <li> It might work for other people but not for me...</li>
            <li> I usually buy one jar a year, and make it last around 4 months.</li>
            <li> I used it every other day the darkness has been fading I noticed it 2 weeks after using every day it works</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t advice people to buy this if their discoloration is extreme.</li>
            <li> i used them separately the armpit creme at night by it self and the nivea anti-perspirant in the morning when i was active or leaving home</li>
            <li> I put the product after I exfoliate my armpits from the dead skin and after it&#x27;s completely dry</li>
            <li> was not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> and already I am noticing that that dark splotches under my arms are already lightening up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using it on the dark area between my legs</li>
            <li> not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have olive-tone skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money or time.</li>
            <li> It smells weird and it doesn´t really \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to your skin.</li>
            <li> just still dark my under arm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark underarms since I started shaving but ever since I started using this product it&#x27;s lightening my armpits.</li>
            <li> and gosh it&#x27;s dark again yikes</li>
            <li> When I say a dab, I mean a dab will definitely do you.</li>
            <li> After having it for 2 weeks and using it three random different times, my underarms were obviously lighten.  </li>
            <li> The previous review must have been a \\&quot;paid\\&quot; one</li>
            <li> I believe the product has lightened the area under my arm slightly.</li>
            <li> I used it for three months it lightened slightly but it hurt to exfoliate my skin</li>
            <li> I had hopes for this product, even just a slight.</li>
            <li> I complained in a previous review about how small the jar is (before I had used it), only to find out how little you have to use.</li>
            <li> smells a little off but it works.  </li>
            <li> I have always wanted to remove the dark spots from my underarm!</li>
            <li> I have used it for a little bit by now</li>
            <li> waste of tome and money</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I had used the product a few years ago with no problems -</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I do this everyday.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This item does not work...........waste of my money  don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> i have been using this everyday.........</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream faithfully morning and night for a few weeks, without ANY discernible difference.  </li>
            <li> what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> apply the mixture a few times a day.</li>
            <li> bottle too small</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I forgot some days and hardly ever used it twice a day as instructed.</li>
            <li> but i see slow</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the price, and because I have horrible dark pits under my arms from genetics and having high blood sugar.  </li>
            <li> I have bad pigmentation on my underarms and my inner thighs.</li>
            <li> Bye bye dark underarms forever!!!!</li>
            <li> and I do not see a big change &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> But this one just made it a lot worse.</li>
            <li> Not happy about that,</li>
            <li> Did not lighten my skin at all, smells funky AND caused SERIOUS chafing of the skin on my underarms, rendering me unable to wear deodorant, wax, shave, what have you, for WEEKS.</li>
            <li> Not a good cream for underarm!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money !!!!</li>
            <li> all of the cautionary info is creepy</li>
            <li> also used this cream on my elbows which had discoloration from a flawed faux tanning.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I decided to try this product based on some reviews</li>
            <li> but sadly I stop using it</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s not THAT bad.)</li>
            <li> My underarms don&#x27;t look so bad anymore</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything and smells bad.</li>
            <li> I just think it takes time to do its stuff and depends how bad they are.</li>
            <li> so it shocked me.</li>
            <li> disappointed, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> but not working at all.. :(</li>
            <li> Also it has a very very very very unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This is horrible.</li>
            <li> The cream has an horrible sent....</li>
            <li> The smell when you apply it on your underarm is really awful!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> This cream is awful and I do not like its consistency or the way it smells.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Maybe it was too good to be true, but it didn&#x27;t work like I hoped it would. I&#x27;ve used half the bottle so far--diligently--and see only a slight change, It&#x27;s been about six weeks, and I still have half a bottle to go so I will keep on til it&#x27;s gone. However, it does smell, but i just wash my hands really good when I&#x27;m done. I put it on at night too, so I don&#x27;t carry the stink with me around during the day. (It&#x27;s not THAT bad.) Works okay so far.</li>
            <li> it didnt work at all. i did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews before i bought this stuff and i really had high hopes for it after reading all the good reviews. but nope. i used it consistently for about a month and saw no results at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me 👎😟</li>
            <li> Too scared to try it. all of the cautionary info is creepy</li>
            <li> Have not really seen a change</li>
            <li> smells a little off but it works.  this combined with NonScents deodorant have completely lightened my underarms just in time for summer.</li>
            <li> I had light underarms with just some darkness that I wanted to get rid off. But this one just made it a lot worse. Thank god that I was able to return it. It&#x27;s more of if you want your too white armpits to be more than this is the one for u.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to remove the dark spots from my underarm! I didn&#x27;t even know that there was a product as awesome as this that will make that dream come true! I am so glad I found it! Bye bye dark underarms forever!!!!</li>
            <li> it works better with the nivea whiting deodorant i use it at night and nivea in the morning. bottle too small</li>
            <li> Well, I thought that this would work. I have bad pigmentation on my underarms and my inner thighs. I have alomost used up the jar and have NOT seen any results. I bought it for the price and now I will do my research before I purchase another product.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for 2 weeks my skin has not reacted which is a good thing but i see slow but sure results...maybe its better this way.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money! was not worth it at all. will nevr order it again. waste of tome and money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, I&#x27;ve NEVER used a product that worked so well for exactly what it claims to do.  I don&#x27;t even use this everyday. After having it for 2 weeks and using it three random different times, my underarms were obviously lighten.  I haven&#x27;t worn a tank top in almost a year. After 3 times using this, I was comfortable to at least wear a short sleeve shirt. Today, 3-31-12, after using it about 8 times, I have on a tank top for the first time in a year. And get this, I&#x27;ve been using Palmer&#x27;s and other skin lightening cream for dark spots on my face from acne and such, no success. Dabbed a little of this product on those very same spots, I dont even have to wear concealer now.  Got a second jar to use on the razor bumps scars in the bikini area, you would not believe how quickly this stuff lighted scars that have been there for years. I complained in a previous review about how small the jar is (before I had used it), only to find out how little you have to use. When I say a dab, I mean a dab will definitely do you. This is by far the best product Ive ever purchased from any site or store that does EXACTLY what it says it will do. Honestly, it&#x27;s a beauty miracle.</li>
            <li> I made the huge mistake of buying two of these little jars and they haven&#x27;t done a thing. I do not see any improvement on my arm pits. It might work for other people but not for me... What a waste of money !!!!</li>
            <li> Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described. Thanks a million.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the price, and because I have horrible dark pits under my arms from genetics and having high blood sugar.  The previous review must have been a \\&quot;paid\\&quot; one as I have YET to see any results from the product even after a month&#x27;s worth of use.   I figure I will continue to use the product in HOPES that it at least yields some results before I move on to a BETTER product!</li>
            <li> I got this last week, item came quickly and was as described, small jar of lightly scented under-arm cream.  anyways I&#x27;ve been using it since I got it and already I am noticing that that dark splotches under my arms are already lightening up, hubby has noticed it too, so I&#x27;m very happy and will keep using it and see if it all goes away. I&#x27;m also using it on the dark area between my legs but that doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed yet.</li>
            <li> i used it about 3-4 weeks saw no changes in the discoloration of my under arm and the cream felt very gloopy and sticky and smelled like glue.</li>
            <li> I usually buy one jar a year, and make it last around 4 months. My skin gets so dry during the winter time, and this is the best cream!  the price is just perfect and works great.</li>
            <li> Used it for 4 weeks didn&#x27;t work, too good to be true. cheap, you pay for what you get. do not buy. not worth it. i give it a zero.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been several weeks since I&#x27;ve been using  this produce with absolutely zero improvement in the area I was trying to lighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know how long I need to continue using but I&#x27;ll try for another week or two.  If no difference, will stop.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT! It definitely works on me. I have used it for a little bit by now and I can notice a difference already. My underarms don&#x27;t look so bad anymore and I am ready to wear tank tops for the summer :) I feel happy and satisfied. Totaly worth the money and the time!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me as I had hoped .  Maybe my areas were too severe  for it to work .  I used it as recommended.</li>
            <li> It works but it gave me a rash so I had to stop using it.  I had used the product a few years ago with no problems - my skin probably just got sensitive with age.  It does work but if you have sensitive skin use caution.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it coz i feel like it&#x27;s not working for me and plus its leaving a stain on my white tshirt...</li>
            <li> havent seen much of a result but its only been 2 weeks so lets see&lt;br /&gt;ordered two maybe it will take about 2 to 3 months</li>
            <li> I bought this product but after using twice I NEVER USE ANYMORE .. IT Doesn&#x27;t work.. Don&#x27;t Wast your money!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, not had much time to use it.</li>
            <li> This does not help lighten my underarm skin. I have olive-tone skin and dark hair. I used this for a while and did not see any improvement. Instead I bought the Nivea Whitening Deodorant, which has worked wonders for my hyperpigmented skin.</li>
            <li> I just received the product and have only tried it for a few days now. It is packaged very nicely and comes in a cute petite container that fits great in my very full medicine cabinet. I have very sensitive skin, so I was a little apprehensive in trying the product. To my delight, the product goes on gentle and has not irritated my skin at all. I work out after work, so I like to apply the product after I shower and before bed.  I believe the product has lightened the area under my arm slightly. My arm pits didn&#x27;t darken overnight, so I&#x27;m going continue to use the product and am very confident I&#x27;ll see even better results.</li>
            <li> Got it for my friend. She said it didn&#x27;t work at all. Not happy about that, but then again it was a low price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything and smells bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as per the instructions and I have yet to see any difference. Not worth the money or time.</li>
            <li> I used this for 3week now and i didnt see any resalt  It is like that i do nothing dont buy it at alll</li>
            <li> Totally didn&#x27;t work. Waste of money. I used it once a day for the night.</li>
            <li> This product did wonders, it worked absolutely great. I noticed a huge difference in my underarms, which are typically dark and very dry. After using this product for just a couple of days I saw the and felt the changes in the color and dryness of my underarms. I also have very sensitive skin and had no problems using this product. I would definitely recommend this to anybody with dark and dry underarms. This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> This product is ok I didn&#x27;t really see any major changes but I guess it takes it&#x27;s time to work. I was expecting something faster than 2 months but it did what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Bought this parallel with \\&quot;X-treme Brite Whitening Gel\\&quot; for my armpits. After 4 weeks there still was no result AT ALL. It smells weird and it doesn´t really \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to your skin. I used it after every shower, but nothing happend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greetings from Germany :)</li>
            <li> I used it for three months it lightened slightly but it hurt to exfoliate my skin and I dont have sensitive skin so it shocked me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month I&#x27;ve seen my armpits lighten but not as I hopped. I just think it takes time to do its stuff and depends how bad they are.</li>
            <li> Did not lighten my skin at all, smells funky AND caused SERIOUS chafing of the skin on my underarms, rendering me unable to wear deodorant, wax, shave, what have you, for WEEKS. This is a waste of time unless you&#x27;re looking for red, patchy, itchy smelly underarms.</li>
            <li> Does not work in my opinion.  It does make the underarm soft.  However, so does lotion.</li>
            <li> i had grossly dark armpits, so i never wore tank tops or sleevless tops but after trying this product i feel confident enough to wear them now. if ur like me and ur armpits are extremely dark then one bottle wont do the trick while it does fade rather quickly, u still must keep up with the routine. I did it only at night after showering and i used it without any deorderant and in the morning i showered and used the NIVEA EXTRA WHITENING anti-perspirant. together they are amazing( let me clarify i did not use both at the same time i used them separately the armpit creme at night by it self and the nivea anti-perspirant in the morning when i was active or leaving home, i never used one on top of the other.) my pits are looking more and more normal. trust me if ur hesitant because your unsure; think of it this way; u have absolutely nothing to lose, the price is affordable and the product works i used it on my neck too and it worked as well. don&#x27;t hesitate try the product its awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;i have only been using it for a 3 weeks, use only a very little and always wash pits before use best to use at night and when using don&#x27;t shave or wear very dark clothing let ur pits breathe once in awhile, and get rid of those anti-perspirant that clog and damage ur underarms use something light and refreshing lke the nivea extra whitening it helps (when i say don&#x27;t shave i mean don&#x27;t use blades, use a safe hair removing creme. Because if you shave you develop razor bumps and when you use the creme it irritates the bumps and it stings, so plese no shaving when using this product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take before and after pics give the product atleast 2 months for awesome results and remember nothing happens overnight it takes time and energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now i wish they made something for inner thigh discoloration.</li>
            <li> Used it twice a day for a month but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s why I was second guessing whether I should purchase the product or not. After receiving the package, I used it right away. The first time I used it, I think I used too much that&#x27;s why I felt like my underarms were burning. The following times I&#x27;ve used the product, I have used about the size of a dime [which worked fine for my skin], and after the first few days, I have seen some improvements. My underarm got lighter with my regularly use of twice a day. I think it is still too soon for me to make a final say for the product for now.</li>
            <li> This product was extremely effective to lighten my underarms. It also helped to condition and moisturize my underarms. Truly a product that does exactly what it says it will. I have very sensitive, rash-prone skin and this definitely proved to be gentle enough for me. Extremely pleased and satisfied with this purchase. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I just started I will see if is gonna work. If it does I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered 2 of them.Have used already one but no change.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using it after a showered and I have noticed the difference. I would recommend using it with a whitening deodorant to see results faster.</li>
            <li> This creen don&#x27;t work in my armpits</li>
            <li> Kinda small, but its working so far.</li>
            <li> There should be at least direction on the box on whats the best way to use this product. Over all it was a good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 4 week, i don&#x27;t see result!,&lt;br /&gt;Is a cheap product please don&#x27;t buy!&lt;br /&gt;very upset!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, I guess, I have being using the cream every night and I do not see a big change &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t do nothing it like applying regular cream on. I would not re-buy this product it does not work.</li>
            <li> I used the whole jar, and never saw a difference.</li>
            <li> Not a good cream for underarm! I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and I don&#x27;t see any progress!! It makes my underarm sweat a lot too.</li>
            <li> This is horrible. Does not work at all. Waste of your money.</li>
            <li> The cream has an horrible sent.... once u put it on everyone knows...felt very embarrassed when someone asked &#x27;what is that sent&#x27; in an unfriendly voice.</li>
            <li> i do not recommend this product at all. i&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and i haven&#x27;t seen any changes at all. like i said, waaaaste of mooooney!</li>
            <li> It made my underarms even darker.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I used it under my arms for a month. I forgot some days and hardly ever used it twice a day as instructed. After a month, my under arms were a shade lighter than the surrounding area. I did not have did not have severe discoloration there, just enough to annoy me.&lt;br /&gt;I also used this cream on my elbows which had discoloration from a flawed faux tanning. This cream did remove most of the brown. My elbows are red. The redness is not from the lightening cream.&lt;br /&gt;This cream was gentle and caused no irritation. Most of the cream is left. It required very little.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been months since I used this. No discoloration has returned.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am very pale with hyper sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing work from this i used about 3weeks&lt;br /&gt;After shower&lt;br /&gt;But just still dark my under arm&lt;br /&gt;Waste money don&#x27;t buy this company</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few months now. I dont use it as often as I should but the times I did use it I noticed my underarms have gotten a lil lighter. The cream goes on smooth and a lil goes a long way. You dont have to apply much just a few dots and rub it where you want it to be lighter.</li>
            <li> Applied it for atleast a week .. But no visible changes. Also it has a very very very very unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark underarms since I started shaving but ever since I started using this product it&#x27;s lightening my armpits. I put the product after I exfoliate my armpits from the dead skin and after it&#x27;s completely dry I apply it. I do this everyday. You have to do this continuously in order to see results. I&#x27;ve had almost two weeks using this product and it&#x27;s gone three shades lighter and I&#x27;m happy about it. It&#x27;s cheap and I don&#x27;t have to waste a lot of money on products that probably won&#x27;t have this same effect as this one.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money. This item does not work...........waste of my money  don&#x27;t waste your money. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> its not working .... i have been using this everyday......... its been more than 2 weeks already..... but not working at all.. :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I decided to try this product based on some reviews but it did not work for me.  I&#x27;ll be going back to my trusty Black Opal &amp;/or Esoterica.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all</li>
            <li> The smell when you apply it on your underarm is really awful!!! I can&#x27;t take it, I washed it again, still the smell lingers. Terrible!</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend this item! ive been using it now for not even a week and you can already see the difference! Great product</li>
            <li> Well it didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would read all the comments and people were saying it definitely worked for them. Maybe my skin is different.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream faithfully morning and night for a few weeks, without ANY discernible difference.  I wished this would be the magic potion that could finally lighten my underarm pigmentation once and for all, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case.</li>
            <li> I used it every other day the darkness has been fading I noticed it 2 weeks after using every day it works</li>
            <li> was excited to use this product. been using it for 3 weeks now and not even one shade lighter. not for me, now I&#x27;m just going to have to learn to love my underarms the way they are.</li>
            <li> Sigh.. what can I say? I had hopes for this product, even just a slight. I shouldn&#x27;t have. Doesn&#x27;t. work. at. all. Period. Or should I say, exclamation mark?! what a waste of money. Back to lemons and milk which ACTUALLY WORKS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milk+lemon juice &#x3D; whitened underarms in a week! you just have to be patient! apply the mixture a few times a day. make sure you exfoliate and wash your UA before applying it. Wax, don&#x27;t shave. And use Milcu (alum powder) deodorant bec it can also whiten your skin and prevent odors.</li>
            <li> it got more dark of my skin</li>
            <li> Works good love it but sadly I stop using it and gosh it&#x27;s dark again yikes lol thanks</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, it worked all right, but after using it daily for about a couple weeks, it completely stopped working and all the discoloration under the arms came back. I wouldn&#x27;t advice people to buy this if their discoloration is extreme.</li>
            <li> This cream is awful and I do not like its consistency or the way it smells. I will never purchase it again.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x60;t meet my expectations and it smells even with regular usage. i guess it works with some people only. it depends.</li>
