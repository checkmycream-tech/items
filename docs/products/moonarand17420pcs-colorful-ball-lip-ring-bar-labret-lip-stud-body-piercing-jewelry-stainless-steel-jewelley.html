            <li>I wish it was more colorful though. /-\</li>
            <li>if I wear the short one my skin will eat the back of the ring (it does with most shorter bars) and the longer one ends up almost perfect, doesn&#x27;t dig into my skin, (</li>

            <li> Some of them broke ver easily and some did not</li>
            <li> Super cute. Great assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> Great for people with a nickel allergy. Very nice material, and the colors are beautiful. After changing the jewelry a few times, the threads in the balls are worn down a little, but it was a great deal, and definitely worth every penny.</li>

            <li> Just what I needed and wanted all new</li>
            <li> Yeah if you twist it together too tight the ball breaks. I broke two already. There are two sizes of bars, the smaller ones are too small for my lip ring (thick lips) but then the longer one was too long, I can&#x27;t eat without holding it pulling it away from my face. I love the colors, though. I got a good assortment.&lt;br /&gt;When my lip puffs up at night (it does when I wear the studs, I don&#x27;t know why) if I wear the short one my skin will eat the back of the ring (it does with most shorter bars) and the longer one ends up almost perfect, doesn&#x27;t dig into my skin, (and when it&#x27;s puffy) I don&#x27;t bite down on the end of it when I eat. I do sometimes, but not as bad.&lt;br /&gt;I did get unusually sick after wearing the first one, and judging by the WAY TOO LONG SHIPPING WAIT (around a month) and the Chinese (or Japanese?) tracking website they emailed me... it&#x27;s not from America. So reaaaallly wash them better than me (listerine them all including the bars, rinse, etc.)</li>
            <li> Bars are short but cute ball designs</li>
            <li> Good jewelry for the price I paid</li>

            <li> Nice item. I liked how they were colorful.</li>
            <li> Took a while to receive them but the wait was worth it!</li>
            <li> Nice Colors, But The Sticks Are Too Short And The Balls Fall Off Easily. Personally, I Wouldn&#x27;t Buy Again.</li>
            <li> Got them 2 days early. Very good quality.</li>
            <li> These are very nice, but they do fall off easily. None have broken yet and I like the colours of them all</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly and look nice</li>
            <li> Good product except a ball broke while wearing it one day</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my medusa piercing. The colors are cool got it like a week before my estimated delivery date</li>

            <li> Balls are constantly breaking. I liked that I could buy a bunch of lip rings at once but hate that I&#x27;m constantly breaking the balls just put the ring in.</li>
            <li> Took for ever to get here. But happy with the product</li>
            <li> Good item great price</li>
            <li> I got them today and I didn&#x27;t get the ones on the picture but i still love them !!  Their long like I been looking for since I have a thick lip and their just perfect so far! ‚ô°</li>
            <li> Cool colors. Fits great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> for great price they wasn&#x27;t cheap at all got the colors i wanted thanks</li>
            <li> Came two weeks before expected arrival. Fits perfect.</li>
            <li> Four of rings were the same then most of the others came as a pair not a good variety of ball.</li>
            <li> I pierced my lip with a 14g, I put the end of the piercing in, and then I put the ball on. It fits perfect even with the swelling. Asdfghjkl. I wish it was more colorful though. /-\</li>
            <li> The balls just crumble and I got like 8 of the same one</li>
            <li> Thanks u very much I love them all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using them, for the first day, it&#x27;s okay. But it made my piercing start hurting like I just got it pierced. (Had it done for 2 years now). It was also harder to screw the balls in. So I wouldn&#x27;t do it if I were you.</li>
            <li> This lip ring it&#x27;s okay a few of the ball broke.</li>
            <li> The bright colors are cool but they balls are pretty small.</li>
            <li> Love it great deal I made</li>
            <li> I love ‚ù§ having all the different colors</li>
            <li> They arrived before the expected date and are cute</li>
            <li> The bars were way too long</li>
            <li> Great assortment and colors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wanting to purchase these, but the description doesn&#x27;t include what gauge they are. I&#x27;m needing a 16g.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my cousin and she couldn&#x27;t wear them. But they were still nice anyway</li>
            <li> They were a gift for a friend and she loves them!!</li>
            <li> These are amazing . They work great .</li>
            <li> Really happy and worth the money:)</li>
