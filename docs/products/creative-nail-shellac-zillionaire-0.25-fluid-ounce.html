            <li>Another great CND color!</li>
            <li>I have on 2 coats and it looks great.</li>
            <li>This color is great-</li>
            <li>so this is the best I have found and so much better also.</li>
            <li>love it great product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for both and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Awesome stuff and worth the investment both in money and time.</li>
            <li>Not too impressed, it is just a confetti clear coat.  </li>
            <li>Not the over the top kind.  </li>
            <li>I love the bling :)  One coat is good, two coats is better.  </li>
            <li>This is a good addition to any color, I put it over Beau and it adds a nice sparkle, just the right amount.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to invest in my own UV light and polish and just do it myself.</li>
            <li>you can use it as a cover to many colors to add some zip to your nails.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of adding some top coat to color but not a fan....</li>
            <li>The glitter is multicolored but tends to be more silver/blue instead of gold/pink.  </li>
            <li>never lasted more than a day or two.  </li>
            <li>I added this on top of a solid colour and it looks awesome.  </li>
            <li>Love this one.</li>
            <li>but if you wanted more you could always put two coats.  </li>
            <li>but there aren&#x27;t as many as I would expect for a nail polish for sparkles.</li>
            <li>I was fishing for more sparkles when I put it on.</li>
            <li>I do love CND polishes though, they are easy to apply and your nails don&#x27;t chip or break.</li>
            <li>Great idea and lasting nail colors.</li>
            <li>This is a great color to wear over a color to give it a little punch or great for a french manicure.</li>
            <li>Nice clear polish with sparkles</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve had glitters from OPI (regular polish) that were more stunning, IMO.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying the products and doing it yourself.</li>
            <li>Nice to be used as the last layer.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any color itself, would be nice with a french manicure esp.</li>
            <li>I always use it over mine after using Romantique and White for french, it gives the nails a nice spark!</li>
            <li>so I like it a BIT better, but only a bit</li>
            <li>last long and the quality is great</li>
            <li>Pretty, but not as noticeable as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprising, but a coat of this stuff can even save a half done manicure of a color you don&#x27;t really care for.  </li>
            <li>I put it on top of Red Barones and it made it look like a nice dark shade of rasberry.</li>
            <li>Overall Zillionaire is a great color choice if you want something that isn&#x27;t flashy, but still interesting!</li>
            <li>The nail tech used a stick looking tool to gently scrape the polish from my nail, it begins to crystallize into a gummy powder.</li>
            <li>So I guess it is more versatile than I expected because you can put it over any color, but</li>
            <li>You can really notice the sparkle.  </li>
            <li>very nice for a french manicure with a little zing.</li>
            <li>This is a great clear polish with larger irradescent glitter than typical glitter polishes.  </li>
            <li>I used it over two different color CND Shellac polishes by applying it just before the UV top coat for an extra zip.</li>
            <li>This product is clear, gives more of an opalescent look rather than the sparkly look I expected.  </li>
            <li>The seller was fine and the product was delivered before expected arrival.  </li>
            <li>I was excited that CND was releasing a more \\&quot;flaky\\&quot; glitter - looks fantastic over Black Pool, and gives a normal french manicure a little bit of pizzaz.</li>
            <li>Five days later they still look freshly painted.</li>
            <li>So this is new territory in that sense</li>
            <li>Nice, subtle color but not all that.  </li>
            <li>Nice color that adds a subtle sparkle.</li>
            <li>This color is basically clear with multi color flecks of glitter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically a clear polish with iridescent flecks of color.  </li>
            <li>this is a clear shellac and it has multi colored glitter in it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to gel polishes &amp; have only dealt with CND.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;About Gel polish in general.  </li>
            <li>Worn alone, you can barely notice it.</li>
            <li>- make sure if you&#x27;re going to do this, you apply your color coats on the thin side.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize I needed a special light for this expensive product to dry.</li>
            <li>If you want more glitter, I would suggest 2 coats instead of 1, which can start to get a little thick if you&#x27;re not careful</li>

            <li> I had my nails done with Zillionaire on March 2. Five days later they still look freshly painted. This color is basically clear with multi color flecks of glitter. I have on 2 coats and it looks great. I was curious about the Shellac manicure since my spa just started offering it. Initially I chose Romantique but it looked streaky and was not opaque. It was removed using the acetone pads from CND, and took about 10 minutes to soak. The nail tech used a stick looking tool to gently scrape the polish from my nail, it begins to crystallize into a gummy powder. My spa charges $44 for the Shellac manicure, which in my opinion is ridiculous. I think I&#x27;m going to invest in my own UV light and polish and just do it myself. Overall Zillionaire is a great color choice if you want something that isn&#x27;t flashy, but still interesting!</li>
            <li> This is a great clear polish with larger irradescent glitter than typical glitter polishes.  I used it over two different color CND Shellac polishes by applying it just before the UV top coat for an extra zip. I tried it by itself but didn&#x27;t like it that way. The seller was fine and the product was delivered before expected arrival.  Would definately buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Great idea and lasting nail colors. I find that the Shellac Polishes last up to 2 weeks with no problems. I am allergic to acrylic so this is the best I have found and so much better also. This color is great- you can use it as a cover to many colors to add some zip to your nails. I always use it over mine after using Romantique and White for french, it gives the nails a nice spark!</li>
            <li> When I bought the product I thought it would look like the bottle-white with glitter flecks. However it is just clear with a few flecks of glitter. Not what I expected at all. I do love CND polishes though, they are easy to apply and your nails don&#x27;t chip or break. It&#x27;s worth buying the products and doing it yourself.</li>
            <li> This product was so thick, I had to throw it away.  Very unhappy.  I thought I would save some money, but now I have to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not too impressed, it is just a confetti clear coat.  The package says that the color dries to match the color on the bottle but it does not. So I guess it is more versatile than I expected because you can put it over any color, but considering I only have 2 colors I am somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice, subtle color but not all that.  I&#x27;m new to gel polishes &amp; have only dealt with CND.  So this is new territory in that sense b/c CND has only had solid colors, AFAIK.  It&#x27;s basically a clear polish with iridescent flecks of color.  I used one coat over CND asphalt.  Probably two coats next time.  But I&#x27;ve had glitters from OPI (regular polish) that were more stunning, IMO.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize I needed a special light for this expensive product to dry. Disappointed that this was not prominent information when I purchased and wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Nice to be used as the last layer.  Transparent base very discreet glitter.</li>
            <li> love it great product</li>
            <li> Another great CND color!</li>
            <li> Nice color that adds a subtle sparkle.</li>
            <li> I was excited that CND was releasing a more \\&quot;flaky\\&quot; glitter - looks fantastic over Black Pool, and gives a normal french manicure a little bit of pizzaz. If you want more glitter, I would suggest 2 coats instead of 1, which can start to get a little thick if you&#x27;re not careful - make sure if you&#x27;re going to do this, you apply your color coats on the thin side.</li>
            <li> Do not love this.....I like the idea of adding some top coat to color but not a fan....mother of pearl are just like this color but the glitter pieces are a bit smaller so I like it a BIT better, but only a bit</li>
            <li> I thought by the looks of the bottle, I was getting a white polish w/sparkles....NOT THE CASE. It is actually JUST sparkles. Worn alone, you can barely notice it.</li>
            <li> This is a great color to wear over a color to give it a little punch or great for a french manicure. I&#x27;ve used it for both and have been very pleased.  It soaks off in 10-15\\&quot;.  It has sedate glitter.  Not the over the top kind.  The glitter is multicolored but tends to be more silver/blue instead of gold/pink.  I like gel shellac line but for the price if I can find the about same color in Gelish...I buy Gelish.  Twice the product for the same price.  The overall products seem to be about the same for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Gel polish in general.  I&#x27;m totally addicted to Gel soak off polish.  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and was never a gal who always had her nails painted.  I HATE chipped polish and the time and effort of regular polish was just not worth it...never lasted more than a day or two.  Now I do a Gel every other week-end.  I can get about 3 weeks out of a french manicure.  Awesome stuff and worth the investment both in money and time.</li>
            <li> I added this on top of a solid colour and it looks awesome.  You can really notice the sparkle.  Love this one.</li>
            <li> last long and the quality is great</li>
            <li> This product is clear, gives more of an opalescent look rather than the sparkly look I expected.  Pretty, but not as noticeable as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> this is a clear shellac and it has multi colored glitter in it.  very nice for a french manicure with a little zing.</li>
            <li> This is a good addition to any color, I put it over Beau and it adds a nice sparkle, just the right amount.  There isn&#x27;t a lot of them but if you wanted more you could always put two coats.  It doesn&#x27;t have any color itself, would be nice with a french manicure esp. around the holidays.</li>
            <li> I love the bling :)  One coat is good, two coats is better.  It&#x27;s surprising, but a coat of this stuff can even save a half done manicure of a color you don&#x27;t really care for.  I put it on top of Red Barones and it made it look like a nice dark shade of rasberry.</li>
            <li> Nice clear polish with sparkles but there aren&#x27;t as many as I would expect for a nail polish for sparkles. I was fishing for more sparkles when I put it on.</li>
