            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a very good purchase.</li>
            <li>like I feared, and most importantly, it stopped the feathering.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but it was traveling through my fine lines around my lips.</li>
            <li>because when applied they would bleed into my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Used to buy online at Sephora but no longer available.  </li>
            <li>Wished it would smooth lines and help keep lipstick on.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase it all the time if it is available here.</li>
            <li>There is also a light moisture like feeling.</li>
            <li>it used to be a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>but I kept trying and it eventually became available again.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying if you have lip lines!</li>
            <li>Spending, but worth it!</li>
            <li>I found this when I was looking for a clear liner that would stop feathering, and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>It really works as described and I&#x27;m going to order more</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to find on Amazon, as the local store no longer carries it.</li>
            <li>it would only smear the lip color more!.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li>There is no other product as good as DUWOP REVERSE LIPLINER if you have tiny lines around your mouth.</li>
            <li>I just bought some  Le Metier de Beauty &#x27;Sheer Brilliance&#x27; Lip Gloss which I love because its so creamy</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>and  I did not see any positive results.</li>
            <li>cannot live without!!  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>It really helps against lipstick bleeding into wrinkles of aging lips.</li>
            <li>I apply it every morning, and it works for the day and evening, unless I use a lip gloss or lipstick that is very creamy.</li>
            <li>Duwop reverse lipliner really works.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to all women!</li>
            <li>really keeps color on lips and keeps lips moist</li>
            <li>I  consider this an essential to my daily regimen as do many of my friends.</li>
            <li>Lip color just will not  bleed through and therefore you have a nice finish to your face  and a good solution to what was an annoying problem.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am 65+ and have fine lines above the upper lip and also lower lip.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product several years ago when I reached-</li>
            <li>I prefer clear liners to colored ones because I don&#x27;t have to worry about color matching.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of using lip liners, mostly because I don&#x27;t want to spend money on all of these colors to match my various lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Instead of the typical lip liner that you use to outline the edge of your lips, you use DuWop Reverse Lipliner to outline the OUTSIDE your lips which prevents lipstick from bleeding into the fine lines around an aging mouth.</li>
            <li>ahem- a certain age and was starting to have that problem of lipstick bleeding outside my lipline despite using lipliner pencil.</li>
            <li>You only get them when you&#x27;re old-er so this product helps you to feel young.</li>
            <li>Have only been using this for a short while, but so far the product is doing what it claims: preventing lipstick from bleeding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a senior citizien and obviously have issues with the small cracks that liptstick leaks into that make an older person look even older.  </li>
            <li>This really does what it says it will do-prevent lipstick from moving in to those little vertical lines around your lips.</li>

            <li> I can, as long as I start with a line of DuWop&#x27;s colorless reverse lipliner on the outside of my lips.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it and am having trouble finding it.  </li>
            <li> Red lipstick is my trademark, but I must use liner to prevent bleeding into the vertical lines and dry skin bordering my lips.</li>
            <li> It also minimizes the lip lines I have above my lips -- I apply after foundation and before a dusting of loose powder.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, comes with a sharpener and is the answer to my prayers.</li>
            <li> It prevents bleeding for four to six hours -- as long as you don&#x27;t eat during that time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these lipliner sticks for a long time.  </li>
            <li> This is lightweight and invisible, but keeps lipstick from feathering into any tiny little lines around the mouth.</li>
            <li> DuWop reverse lipliner helps to keep lipstick from seeping into those little lines above your lips.</li>
            <li> The only criticism I have of this product is that I usually have to throw it away before it is used up because after you get down to about the last two inches, the crayon becomes loose and falls out during sharpening.</li>
            <li> It has a fat tip, so this is not for precision lining, but that&#x27;s really not the purpose of this liner.</li>
            <li> big waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands but nothing compares to Duwop Reverse Lipliner.  </li>
            <li> this just doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same product as what i&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of primers since they can dry out my lips or change the color of my lipstick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to line just the outside of the lip with the tip being fat!</li>
            <li> previously had been discontinued.</li>
            <li> For all of you who have those little lines that extend from you lips...</li>
            <li> Will continue to use everyday.</li>
            <li> I think Italy be a little overpriced!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not cheap; but it works!  </li>
            <li> no more lip bleed.</li>
            <li> Hard to work with, must use a lot of pressure to put it on</li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned the fact they found the product hard to use (needed pressure) -- I have never found this to be the case.</li>
            <li> Question: why is it so hard to get?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this for some years and was devastated when it became impossible to get.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d known about this product 20 years ago, because it can also act as a colorless base for lipstick, helping it stay in place.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Can you be sure that your lipstick won&#x27;t bleed into those wrinkles around your lips?  I can, as long as I start with a line of DuWop&#x27;s colorless reverse lipliner on the outside of my lips.  It forms a barrier that tells lipstick and lipliner to stop flowing just where the reverse lipliner&#x27;s &#x27;coating&#x27; begins.  I wish I&#x27;d known about this product 20 years ago, because it can also act as a colorless base for lipstick, helping it stay in place.</li>
            <li> The best lipliner ever.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands but nothing compares to Duwop Reverse Lipliner.  It&#x27;s the best!!!  I love it!!</li>
            <li> Best product to keep lipstick or gloss where it belongs.  Your lipstick or gloss will not feather!! I love it!</li>
            <li> This is lightweight and invisible, but keeps lipstick from feathering into any tiny little lines around the mouth. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for over 5 years.  Love it.  Glad I was able to find on Amazon, as the local store no longer carries it.</li>
            <li> Product does not disappoint. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Hard to work with, must use a lot of pressure to put it on and  I did not see any positive results.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It prevents my lipstick from feathering which is a big problem for me.  It also minimizes the lip lines I have above my lips -- I apply after foundation and before a dusting of loose powder.  I am ordering several so I can have one in my purse and in my makeup bag at home. Another reviewer mentioned the fact they found the product hard to use (needed pressure) -- I have never found this to be the case. Definitely worth trying if you have lip lines!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. Instead of the typical lip liner that you use to outline the edge of your lips, you use DuWop Reverse Lipliner to outline the OUTSIDE your lips which prevents lipstick from bleeding into the fine lines around an aging mouth. The product is waxy and invisible, perfect for preparing your mouth. It lasts a long time, comes with a sharpener and is the answer to my prayers. I use this instead of plumping with a injectable filler.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my number ONE beauty product! Great for prevention of feathering of lipstick! I keep a supply on hand so as to never be without it!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  Used to buy online at Sephora but no longer available.  Run around your lips, provides an area of impenetrability for running lipstick etc..lip lines no problem lipstick does not run with this. I buy 5 or 6 at a time..</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with the product and it is much better when compared to the product I had been using.</li>
            <li> What a find!  I am sold!  My only regret is that sharpening takes a lot of product off the pencil.  But a great and well executed concept in lip liners.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this reverse lipliner. What a great idea! I just bought some  Le Metier de Beauty &#x27;Sheer Brilliance&#x27; Lip Gloss which I love because its so creamy but it was traveling through my fine lines around my lips. This DuWop Liner was the answer to my problems. Easy to apply. People won&#x27;t even know you have it on but your gloss stays where it is supposed to. Perfection.</li>
            <li> Excellent in keeping lip gloss in its place. Still see lip lines, I do not have deep lines, but still visible. Wished it would smooth lines and help keep lipstick on.  I do like the product because it does keep gloss from running.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of using lip liners, mostly because I don&#x27;t want to spend money on all of these colors to match my various lipsticks. I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of primers since they can dry out my lips or change the color of my lipstick. I found this when I was looking for a clear liner that would stop feathering, and I am so glad I did! It has a fat tip, so this is not for precision lining, but that&#x27;s really not the purpose of this liner. It is meant to be applied around the lips as a barrier to prevent feathering. I apply it around the lips and on the edge of the lips. It doesn&#x27;t change my lip color, I don&#x27;t feel it when it&#x27;s on, I don&#x27;t see any streaks around my lips like I feared, and most importantly, it stopped the feathering. Overall, a very good purchase.</li>
            <li> Have had no lipstick bleeding! Very happy with this product!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT.  It keeps the lipstick inside the inside the lines and does NOT bleed out.  Spending, but worth it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and now cannot do without it.  It really helps against lipstick bleeding into wrinkles of aging lips.</li>
            <li> For all of you who have those little lines that extend from you lips...this is the product that will help keep your lipstick on your lips!  I know it&#x27;s not cheap; but it works!  I apply as directed...run it around your mouth 3 times...give it a rest and, then, apply your lipstick.</li>
            <li> Red lipstick is my trademark, but I must use liner to prevent bleeding into the vertical lines and dry skin bordering my lips. I prefer clear liners to colored ones because I don&#x27;t have to worry about color matching. This is the best clear liner I&#x27;ve tried. It prevents bleeding for four to six hours -- as long as you don&#x27;t eat during that time. The only criticism I have of this product is that I usually have to throw it away before it is used up because after you get down to about the last two inches, the crayon becomes loose and falls out during sharpening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years. It always works, keeps my lipstick from feathering outside my lip line. I apply it every morning, and it works for the day and evening, unless I use a lip gloss or lipstick that is very creamy. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Love me some Duwop. This really does what it says it will do-prevent lipstick from moving in to those little vertical lines around your lips. You only get them when you&#x27;re old-er so this product helps you to feel young. Yay Duwop reverse lipliner.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Does prevent feathering!</li>
            <li> Great product. Stops lipstick  from running. Will continue to use everyday.</li>
            <li> cannot live without!!  the only  one that works</li>
            <li> Duwop reverse lipliner really works.  It keeps lipstick from bleeding into lines around your lips and I love the product.  I received the product quickly and it was at a good price.  I will purchase it all the time if it is available here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior citizien and obviously have issues with the small cracks that liptstick leaks into that make an older person look even older.  I&#x27;ve been using these lipliner sticks for a long time.  If you follow directions and then apply your lipstick, the lipstick does not run.  There is also a light moisture like feeling.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this for a short while, but so far the product is doing what it claims: preventing lipstick from bleeding.</li>
            <li> I really love this item.  Keeps lipstick from smearing and running in the fine lines and wrinkles experienced by all women at some time or another.  It is a bit pricey, I think, but I have as yet to find anything as easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> this just doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same product as what i&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  it feels greasy/slippery and isn&#x27;t the matte finish of before.  i bought two of them and threw away the packaging several weeks before i finally used one.....big waste of money and that&#x27;s a shame.  it used to be a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Can&#x27;t live without it and am having trouble finding it.  Can anyone help?  e-mail me at ellenkarin@aol.com.  Everyone seems to be out of it.  ??</li>
            <li> DuWop reverse lipliner helps to keep lipstick from seeping into those little lines above your lips. Works pretty well. amen,</li>
            <li> This is a great product for those of us who are reaching the age that lipstick bleeds into lip lines. It really works as described and I&#x27;m going to order more so I have a back up supply.</li>
            <li> I have used this for some years and was devastated when it became impossible to get. Sephora used to stock but doesn&#x27;t anymore - or didn&#x27;t when I tried getting it.  Amazon didn&#x27;t have it either but I kept trying and it eventually became available again.  Question: why is it so hard to get?&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product for stopping lipstick running. I have now stocked up and should be good for a while!</li>
            <li> Reverse Lip Liner worked A+. I am 65+ and have fine lines above the upper lip and also lower lip. I have avoided wearing lipsticks&lt;br /&gt;(reds, pinks, lip glosses) because when applied they would bleed into my fine lines. If I would try to correct the problem by wiping with&lt;br /&gt;a tissue it would only smear the lip color more!. As soon as I received the duwop lip liner I tried it and it works!!! Applied to the outside&lt;br /&gt;of the upper lip and lower lip, applied your lip color- no more lip bleed. Now I can wear the colors that I have avoided for so long!!&lt;br /&gt;No more clown lips!!</li>
            <li> I have just begun using this product as the one I used previously had been discontinued.So far it seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li> The liner does what it is supposed to do . I wish it had a finer tip. It&#x27;s hard to line just the outside of the lip with the tip being fat! Otherwise it does keep lipstick from running and minimizes the lines around the lips. I think Italy be a little overpriced!</li>
            <li> There is no other product as good as DUWOP REVERSE LIPLINER if you have tiny lines around your mouth.I  consider this an essential to my daily regimen as do many of my friends. Lip color just will not  bleed through and therefore you have a nice finish to your face  and a good solution to what was an annoying problem.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product several years ago when I reached- ahem- a certain age and was starting to have that problem of lipstick bleeding outside my lipline despite using lipliner pencil. Applying this before lipliner works perfectly. I never have even the slightest lipstick bleed when I use this. It even seems to have helped minimize those tiny lines I was starting to get around the mouth. I can no longer find this at any local retailer and Amazon is the only online retailer that had it this last time I was looking for one so I bought two! I highly recommend this product to all women!</li>
            <li> really keeps color on lips and keeps lips moist&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for years&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful lip liner</li>
