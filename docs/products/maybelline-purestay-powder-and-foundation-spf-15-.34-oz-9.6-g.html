            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>Glad I could find some on Amazon:)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite foundation, it is a shame</li>
            <li>I love this foundation on #s 20 &amp; 50.</li>

            <li>My favorite product ever.</li>
            <li>boy am I glad I took a chance and found it on line.</li>
            <li>No longer available in stores!</li>
            <li>And I glad for that</li>
            <li>My favorite powder.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for covering any type of facial spots.</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>Wish it has more of a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My color better never go out of style.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this piurchase.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>As always my favorite</li>
            <li>This product covers beautifully and naturally.  </li>
            <li>love how easy it applies.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, love the combined make up and powder in one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad this was available on line since they don&#x27;t provide it in the pharmacies any more.</li>
            <li>Its really easy</li>
            <li>I tried replacing it with other powders since it has been discontinued and nothing has come close to its wonderful smooth application.</li>
            <li>This powder has a full coverage which I love and need.</li>
            <li>Hands down greatest company ever!</li>
            <li>Their new powders are not as good as this.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very comparable to the Nars Power Foundation, and a fraction of the price, but more product in the compact!</li>
            <li>I have a very fair complexion so its very hard to find one that is a good match.</li>
            <li>Right amount of coverage!&lt;br /&gt;Not too much , but if you need more you can just apply some more !</li>
            <li>The powder goes on smooth and does not crack.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and just goes on lightly and does not feel or look cakey.  </li>
            <li>Helps my skin look smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Goes on as a smooth powder.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth never greasy.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product.</li>
            <li>I love this so much, unfortantly it discontinues</li>
            <li>True to color.  </li>
            <li>Looks good for several hours.</li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>This is a super foundation.</li>
            <li>I have the best foundation around back,  It stays on, looks natural and lasts all day even after intense workouts.</li>
            <li>It has taken forever to find a foundation that when applied, looked natural; no flaking, doesn&#x27;t sit on top of skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for a smooth look.</li>
            <li>They changed the name and the formula slightly and now call it FIT ME, but I love the original.</li>
            <li>Covers blemishes and smooths better than my Bare Minerals or anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Hope to get more in the future when I run out.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many foundations and I come back to this one.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so your skin looks flawless even though it is not flawless.  </li>
            <li>Also the first drugstore cosmetic&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think Maybelline is shooting itself in the foot by discontinuing this product.&lt;br /&gt;Please bring it back and recognize your mistake in discontinuing this favorite to your dedicated buyers.  </li>
            <li>My favorite, finally after 57 years and they stopped making it.</li>
            <li>so i have to track it down online when I need it, but definitley worth it!!!</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t find that as a powder or foundation that it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>I buy as much as I can.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My favorite makeup and not available in stores anymore</li>
            <li>then I will have to find a new brand to buy.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It is has a very natural look.</li>
            <li>This foundation applies easy and never feels or looks heavy.</li>
            <li>Natural Beige is darker than Nude or Cameo but still looks natural</li>
            <li>The coverage usually lasts all day long &amp; its very easy to touch up.</li>
            <li>I can go to work early morning, and come back later in the day and my face looks exactly as it did when I left.</li>
            <li>Very timely delivery, just as expected.  </li>
            <li>i would get a natural look with my store bought maybelline pure stay powder foundation and the one i ordered is slightly tannish and the labels are different and im a natural beige 50</li>

            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Unlike the cream liquid foundation this press foundation doesnt take too long to put on.</li>
            <li> it helps control  oil all day and looks the way it was applied all day long.  </li>
            <li> a little more expensive than I used to pay</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and does not rub off onto things as much as other foundation and does not make me look oily.  </li>
            <li> This discontinued it, so I hunted it down with the help of Amazon .com</li>
            <li> I wear this pressed powder foundation everyday.</li>
            <li> Maybelline sucks forr getting rid of it.</li>
            <li> SPF 15 is hard to find too!</li>
            <li> Not the same :(</li>
            <li> I was so upset when I couldn&#x27;t find this product in any store-for some crazy reason Maybelline no longer makes this.</li>
            <li> It is too bad they have discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> Too bad Maybelline doesn&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff! I wish Maybelline wouldn&#x27;t have stopped making this!  One of these days these Amazon Sellers are going to run out then I will have to find a new brand to buy.  This stuff is very comparable to the Nars Power Foundation, and a fraction of the price, but more product in the compact!</li>
            <li> Hope to get more in the future when I run out.  I&#x27;m so glad this was available on line since they don&#x27;t provide it in the pharmacies any more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation, it is a shame I don&#x27;t find it at any store anymore! I love this foundation on #s 20 &amp; 50. I have tried many foundations and I come back to this one. It has a great coverage! I really love it!</li>
            <li> This product covers beautifully and naturally.  Why oh why did they stop making it?  I had to stock pile up on it online because all the stores told me they stopped making it.  Why do they do this to us?  So, I bought enough to last till I&#x27;m 60.  I&#x27;ll worry about what I&#x27;ll do after that.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product. I thought I can never find it again since it was discontinued. This powder is so awesome. I have been using it for over ten years. Maybelline need to bring it back!</li>
            <li> This is a super foundation. Perhaps Maybelline will reconsider and bring this back to market or make one just like it.</li>
            <li> I love this so much, unfortantly it discontinues so i have to track it down online when I need it, but definitley worth it!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup and not available in stores anymore so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and pleased with the quality and the speed with which it came.</li>
            <li> I purchased this once or twice online because it was cheaper than even the local Walmart store prices.  However, I didn&#x27;t find that as a powder or foundation that it worked very well.  I&#x27;ve gone back to using another brand.</li>
            <li> My favorite product ever. Maybelline sucks forr getting rid of it. Nothing else works as good. Bring it back please!</li>
            <li> After I discovered that my local stores no longer carried my foundation, I became frantic. It has taken forever to find a foundation that when applied, looked natural; no flaking, doesn&#x27;t sit on top of skin. I went on line with the hope that I may possibly find my foundation, and low and behold..I found it. I immediately saw my skin color tone and ordered it. Boy o&#x27; boy am I glad I took a chance and found it on line. I love this product!! Bring it back!!!</li>
            <li> No longer available in stores! They changed the name and the formula slightly and now call it FIT ME, but I love the original. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This incredible powder foundation is the best I have used in all brands I have tried over the years.  I have tried all brands and have always loved Maybelline products.  It is too bad they have discontinued it.  This powder is a great foundation powder that makes you feel like you have used foundation but you are using powder.  It is smooth and just goes on lightly and does not feel or look cakey.  it is very good at covering up any imperfections so your skin looks flawless even though it is not flawless.  So the look is flawless, without looking cakey.  It lasts all day and does not rub off onto things as much as other foundation and does not make me look oily.  it helps control  oil all day and looks the way it was applied all day long.  True to color.  People have always complimented on how my skin is so nice, but thanks to this powder foundation, it is what makes my skin look perfect without looking like I wear foundation.  It is very natural and blends well and coverage is awesome. I can&#x27;t believe they took this off the market.  The best foundation powder out there.</li>
            <li> Flawless finish . love how easy it applies.</li>
            <li> It was Discontinued!!... It is by far the best product for flawless coverage!!...used to buy for $11 at Walgreens now have to get it from scalpers!.... Please write Maybelline to bring it back!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite powder EVER! SPF 15 is hard to find too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 8 years! I absolutely love it! the coverage it &amp; doesn&#x27;t cake at all. The spectrum of shades are great, lots of colors to choose from.  I have a very fair complexion so its very hard to find one that is a good match. This makeup is perfect. The coverage usually lasts all day long &amp; its very easy to touch up.</li>
            <li> Once you use something for awhile it always gets discontinued . So I came to amazon.  And I glad for that</li>
            <li> My favorite powder. I&#x27;ve been using for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for covering any type of facial spots. I highly recommend this product for a smooth look.</li>
            <li> Not the same :( i would get a natural look with my store bought maybelline pure stay powder foundation and the one i ordered is slightly tannish and the labels are different and im a natural beige 50...why did this product get discontinued !!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product... Helps my skin look smooth and even.</li>
            <li> Pure Stay is the best foundation I have ever used and was at an affordable price.  Also the first drugstore cosmetic&lt;br /&gt;I ever paid any attention to.  I think Maybelline is shooting itself in the foot by discontinuing this product.&lt;br /&gt;Please bring it back and recognize your mistake in discontinuing this favorite to your dedicated buyers.  It is being sold on the&lt;br /&gt;black market now for 5x its price.  What have you guys done???</li>
            <li> Great coverage, even with rosacea. Too bad Maybelline doesn&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
            <li> Nice for the price. Long lasting. Wish it has more of a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup, stays on through anything, plus sunscreen protection!</li>
            <li> This shade was darker than it appeared in the project description.  Needed to return it.</li>
            <li> Very fast !!!!  Great product</li>
            <li> I was so upset when I couldn&#x27;t find this product in any store-for some crazy reason Maybelline no longer makes this. Thanks to Amazon I have the best foundation around back,  It stays on, looks natural and lasts all day even after intense workouts. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> My color better never go out of style. I wear this pressed powder foundation everyday. Keeps my pimples at bay and makes my complexion look flawless! Plus- my skin can breathe!</li>
            <li> Love this powder/foundation!  I&#x27;ve been using it since I was 16, it is great for combination skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, love the combined make up and powder in one.  Goes on as a smooth powder.  Looks good for several hours.</li>
            <li> I think this line was discontinued (I can&#x27;t find it in stores) so I was happy to find it online.. a little more expensive than I used to pay but it&#x27;s a great product. Covers blemishes and smooths better than my Bare Minerals or anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Natural Beige is darker than Nude or Cameo but still looks natural so it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> I Love this product! This foundation applies easy and never feels or looks heavy. It is has a very natural look.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this piurchase.  The color goes great with my skin color. Not oily, doesn&#x27;t run, applies smoothily.  great price and dependable shipment.</li>
            <li> wish this was still sold in stores - it is great!</li>
            <li> My favorite, finally after 57 years and they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful makeup with the best pigmentation available when it comes to face powder. I tried replacing it with other powders since it has been discontinued and nothing has come close to its wonderful smooth application. I never had to wear any type of concealer or liquid foundation whenever using this powder.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has found anything that comes close to this PLEASE let me know on a comment below.</li>
            <li> Right amount of coverage!&lt;br /&gt;Not too much , but if you need more you can just apply some more !</li>
            <li> This powder has a full coverage which I love and need. It goes on smooth never greasy. It is a fav of mine.</li>
            <li> I simply LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!! This product leaves my skin looking so flawless and soft. I can go to work early morning, and come back later in the day and my face looks exactly as it did when I left. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Their new powders are not as good as this. I buy as much as I can.</li>
            <li> I love this make up!! This discontinued it, so I hunted it down with the help of Amazon .com and bought a lot of it!!! Hopefully the manufacturers will bring it back!! Other wise I will need Amazon.com to help me look for some more!!! lol</li>
            <li> The best powder foundation ever made. Great product! Fast delivery. Exceptional customer service.</li>
            <li> Very timely delivery, just as expected.  This product became unavailable quite a while ago, but it is the only make-up I like and I wont keep spending money on stuff that just doesn&#x27;t work.  This is the only product out there like it for the price.</li>
            <li> Got just what I ordered &amp; am a happy camper.  Many thanks.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I wish they still made it!</li>
            <li> As always my favorite</li>
            <li> Hands down greatest company ever! I&#x27;ve been wearing this brand for over ten years, it was discontinued and this place has been a life saver!!! Two thumbs up, five stars across and a HUGE thank you!</li>
            <li> great purchase im happy about it.</li>
