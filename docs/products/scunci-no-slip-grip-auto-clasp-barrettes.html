    <ol>
            <li>I love them!!!!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>These kinds of clips never used to work for me, but the no-slip part is awesome.  </li>
            <li>As others have stated, these barrettes are excellent at holding hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent clips!!</li>
            <li>so I was was really happy to find these on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The plastic layer does a great job of holding without ripping out.  </li>
            <li>These hold my hair great.  </li>
            <li>Great clips that hold hair well.</li>
            <li>good quality and value onthis item.</li>
            <li>These clips holdover good, but the plastic tops broke.</li>
            <li>They hold a fair amount of hair and do not slip out.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the quality and hold.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>to searching for better barrettes!</li>
            <li>I love these hair clips, too!</li>
            <li>LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>These worked amazing.</li>
            <li>I was still optimistic thinking that I could just use the barrette without the plastic or replace it with my own design</li>
            <li>My hair is curly, but fine and needs good holding power.  </li>
            <li>For someone with thicker hair, these could hold your hair in a nice ponytail to give it a more spread out look, rather than just using a hair elastic.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>The clip has 3 adjustable settings that should hold many hair types/amounts.  </li>
            <li>While these are great at not damaging your hair, they don&#x27;t really grip or hold-</li>
            <li>Shorter hair is so more effort to be presentable</li>
            <li>Cheap!</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t find any more of in the store</li>
            <li>Able to hold a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li>These barrettes are my favorite way to keep my longer, wavy hair up and out of my face.</li>
            <li>I kept the latest package, and the store receipt I attached to it is dated just under a year ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would love to see these barrettes get attached to decorative parts that wouldn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>Better plastic, metal or wood, perhaps.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;m reluctant to buy more.</li>
            <li>These were a great price and came fast.</li>
            <li>Held a nice amount of hair; however, plastic on clip broke quickly</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad they are available on amazon.</li>
            <li>I was happy to get the right size I was looking for and they are well made and do a good job of pulling my hair back away from my face at work.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps there are other &#x27;no slip&#x27; types out there, but these are so wonderful I have not bothered looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think these are practical and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The pieces seem to fall apart easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put in and take out.</li>
            <li>works well, keeps hair in place, easy to put on and off</li>
            <li>Great product - only wish in more colors and finishes</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and these clips hold well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I have extremely fine hair</li>
            <li>I would have preferred two tortoiseshell, but the ones I received are fine, too.</li>
            <li>Works well and stays put in my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Holds my hair securely.</li>
            <li>Holds my hair securely.</li>
            <li>although the metal clasp portion remained secure</li>
            <li>It was really WAY more work than a cheapo barrette warrants, and I can&#x27;t figure out what the scunci people were thinking.  </li>
            <li>She is absolutely thrilled... and as far as hair clips go, I use these for all of my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;hair styles.</li>
            <li>practically free, well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I think they are sort of bulky with the gripper stuff but not bad.</li>
            <li>I purchased these to use as quick updo&#x27;s or pony tail holders.  </li>
            <li>One broke the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Would be great for 1/2 up and down though.</li>
            <li>Not even worth the $3 price tag.</li>
            <li>not even worth returning.</li>
            <li>and it slips right through these barrettes.  </li>
            <li>My Girlfriend likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I would think these will work great with thick hair</li>
            <li>Then this barrette can hold your hair back for a month or two before the plastic top breaks.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought they worked well.  </li>
            <li>These clips are exactly what I wanted, purchased as replacements for one that broke (the metal \\&quot;clip\\&quot; part still works, but the decorative tortoiseshell strip broke and came off).&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I could put my hair in a pony tail and fasten the barette, later in the day the plastic top cover snapped in two -</li>
            <li>And they really don&#x27;t slip!</li>
            <li>Good for everyday...</li>
            <li>It is difficult to find good barrettes for fine hair, but Scunci offers more than any brand I know.</li>
            <li>For me, they don&#x27;t hold just a ponytail as well as my french twist thing, but are still good, especially over an elastic.</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy hair that is more course on the top layer.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to just be able to pull my hair back, put a little twist in it to put it up, spritz the front and voila</li>
            <li>These barrettes are the first ones I have found that are strong enough for my hair.  </li>
            <li>pretty big havnt tried yet arrived quickly fit description</li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s to my shoulders) and the clips keep it back easily.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine post chemo hair and these actually stay in my hair!!</li>
            <li>I have other Scrunchi and Goody barrettes that are much higher quality, but, of course, cost more.</li>
            <li>These are the most secure barrettes I have found - but hard to find in the store.  </li>
            <li>This barrette really comes through and holds all day if needed.  </li>
            <li>If you MUST have a particular color, I&#x27;d suggest looking elsewhere, otherwise, I&#x27;d highly recommend these clips to anyone.</li>
            <li>These are inexpensive, well made (I have yet to break them--lose them yes, frequently, but not yet broken) and most importantly</li>
            <li>The other has been working fine.</li>
            <li>Complete waste of money, but would cost more to return than barrettes.</li>
            <li>first problem: the individual pieces of the barrette have shrink-wrap plastic around them.  </li>
            <li>They also have a soft rubbery cover over the hinge and metal bar that helps prevent hair getting caught and breaking.</li>
            <li>I wore one about 5 times,  and it cracked near the end.  </li>
            <li>Basically, to get all the plastic off, I had to take the barrettes completely apart</li>
            <li>I also like that there are 3 different &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; you can shut the clip to (according to how much hair you&#x27;re trying to put in the clip).</li>
            <li>So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But overall the product is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Looks really old.</li>
            <li>Hair clips rarely stay in place even if they are big enough to hold all of her hair.</li>
            <li>went right in closed without issue and stayed in place.</li>
            <li>Not the colored outside piece, but the two main metal pieces that make up the barrette.</li>
            <li>The outer, colored edge is the same exact size as several other (similar style) barrettes I own, but the actual clasp is not big enough.  </li>
            <li>I liked the green color, but this is not a set of black and tortie</li>
            <li>My daughter has very thick, very voluminous, very long, very fine hair.</li>
            <li>At least for me, they&#x27;ll hold either a portion on top or an entire ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first set last me 4 years of daily use before finally cracking.</li>
            <li>...broke right in half.</li>
            <li>These can hold up a little less than half my hair (in that half-up, half-down style) comfortably and securely.</li>
            <li>These do hold, but I find the clasps hard to use while still keeping my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>and it barely reaches my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>The next time I wore it, it broke completely.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, the manufacturer does not sell a card with two of the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have really thin hair you will probably love this.</li>
            <li>And my hair is very slick and fine.  </li>
            <li>I, too, have long (mid-back length) hair, but mine is thin and very fine.</li>
            <li>One of these broke within the first few uses--</li>
            <li>I have long (mid-back length) hair that is fine in texture and thick in density.</li>
            <li>My barrettes usually slide right off my head after a couple hours.  </li>
            <li>--my hair is work ready in less than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like these clips a lot for a cute half up half down hairstyle</li>
            <li>This product does not slide, good to hold hair once it&#x27;s in, but pulls your hair badly while trying to put in.  </li>

            <li> I like these clips a lot for a cute half up half down hairstyle</li>
            <li> This product does not slide, good to hold hair once it&#x27;s in, but pulls your hair badly while trying to put in.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t trying to force it or anything just the same normal pressure that ive been using previous.</li>
            <li> I had read the previous reviews, so I was aware that one would likely be green ( I didn&#x27;t know what exactly they meant by Kermit the Frog green, but I did when I saw it).</li>
            <li> My hair is by no means thick and anything more than half up is impossible with these clips, and I have used clips like this that rest more even on the head.</li>
            <li> the black plastic of the barrette broke in half the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find reasonably priced  barettes in town that are this big.  </li>
            <li> grass green thin stripes along with the neon color showing through as well on the top side.</li>
            <li> I just ordered more, will need them long after they have become impossible to find.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing these barrettes and both times one has broken right down the center of the plastic clip.</li>
            <li> If you want a black and tortoise one, you won&#x27;t necessarily get them.</li>
            <li> Tight enough hold so that my hair doesn&#x27;t slip out.</li>
            <li> It seems stupid to leave a review on a 3 inch barrette, but these are my favorite go-to hair accessories besides just regular ponytail holders.</li>
            <li> For reference, I am college aged.</li>
            <li> Not the way I expected.</li>
            <li> I used this only a few times before it broke.  </li>
            <li> The green one is actually sort of artsy looking.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of green in my wardrobe so it totally works.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it was only about a week and a half after getting them that the plastic on the first barrette broke.</li>
            <li> One of mine is black and one is green - like a cross between neon lime on the clip side and darker sort of</li>
            <li> I had other barrettes just like this I had bought in Walgreen&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have to shop for other product that&#x27;s stronger to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and most barrettes are either to flimsy or unable to hold my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I got a green one, which is pretty useless.</li>
            <li> The rubber grips keep the clip from sliding down.</li>
            <li> That said, it will hold fine hair and this is difficult to find in hair clips for those of us with thin hair.</li>
            <li> Instead of one black and one tortoise, one is black and one is a dark dark green (think army, but so dark it&#x27;s almost black).  </li>
            <li> My package had a black clip and a brown tortishell color clip.</li>
            <li> This is frustrating, because it&#x27;s difficult to figure out until you buy it (and remove all the plastic)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem 3: They feel cheap.  </li>
            <li> There is one tortoiseshell and one black per card.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The clips I received are one black, one dark green, as a previous reviewer stated.</li>
            <li> I bought two packages (one green and black and one tortoise and black)  </li>
            <li> : The colors are black and BOTTLE GREEN, not the brownish color displayed in the picture.</li>
            <li> it is black and bottle green.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this can only hold up a small amount of my hair.</li>
            <li> I also needed small, sharp scissors (and poked my finger with them once, ouch.)  </li>
            <li> The green was a surprise</li>
            <li> Both broke within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Bought two sets, one of them finally had the plastic part broken.</li>
            <li> trouble is that I&#x27;ve now had half a dozen of them over the past few years, and none of them is still in one piece.</li>
            <li> Split in half after wearing once!</li>
            <li> I need something that will stay put all day without fussing and that is plain and conservative.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time hair clips that will hold my pony tail tight -</li>
            <li> Also, as others have mentioned, these barrettes are difficult to open and close.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat small.</li>
            <li> I now have half a dozen broken ones.</li>
            <li> Gripped my hair so hard that it pulled it out.</li>
            <li> I would have not have purchased these if I would have known they would not hold thick hair.</li>
            <li> Thick hair , forget it.  </li>
            <li> Do you have thick hair?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hold my hair, and it isn&#x27;t that thick.</li>
            <li> It maybe because my hair are too thick.</li>
            <li> My hair is too thick.  </li>
            <li> I have really incredibly thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick and curly hair</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time getting a barrette to close on even a small quantity of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and ordinary bobby pins get lost in my hair</li>
            <li> I did luck out and got the black and brownish colors, however the clasp is difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> I got a black one and an ugly green one, which is, thankfully, the one that broke.</li>
            <li> Clip will not hold very thick hair as it says.</li>
            <li> I have medium-length, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> One was broken when I tried to get it off the card.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, really poor quality.</li>
            <li> (One I even took the broken plastic off and redecorated just the clip.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> But now - and just in a matter of months, they can&#x27;t clasp together, so they are completely useless.  </li>
            <li> The clasp is difficult opening and closing.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Really awful and time consuming to get</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> pretty big havnt tried yet arrived quickly fit description well</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing these barrettes and both times one has broken right down the center of the plastic clip.</li>
            <li> I have long (mid-back length) hair that is fine in texture and thick in density. I like to twist it from a low ponytail into a french twist and then use these clips to clip it up with the ends sticking out. The no-slip grip helps to hold it in place all day, and since the metal is covered in the no-slip material, the barrettes don&#x27;t break off your hair. For someone with thicker hair, these could hold your hair in a nice ponytail to give it a more spread out look, rather than just using a hair elastic. For me, they don&#x27;t hold just a ponytail as well as my french twist thing, but are still good, especially over an elastic. Also, the colors are different than pictured, but I think that&#x27;s a plus. Instead of one black and one tortoise, one is black and one is a dark dark green (think army, but so dark it&#x27;s almost black).  For reference, I am college aged. I think these are practical and easy to use. It seems stupid to leave a review on a 3 inch barrette, but these are my favorite go-to hair accessories besides just regular ponytail holders.</li>
            <li> Not all barrettes are the same and I have been through numerous barrettes to find ones that hold my hair and this one fits the bill.  My hair is curly, but fine and needs good holding power.  This barrette really comes through and holds all day if needed.  Very pleased with the quality and hold. The No-Slip Grip definitely works!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. I have fine hair and these clips hold well. The clip has 3 adjustable settings that should hold many hair types/amounts.  They also have a soft rubbery cover over the hinge and metal bar that helps prevent hair getting caught and breaking. The neutral colors should match anything.  I couldn&#x27;t find these in stores so I&#x27;m glad they are available on amazon.</li>
            <li> While these are great at not damaging your hair, they don&#x27;t really grip or hold- my hair has been sliding out of them non-stop. I&#x27;ll use them til they wear out, but won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
            <li> These do hold, but I find the clasps hard to use while still keeping my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. Holds my hair securely. My package had a black clip and a brown tortishell color clip.</li>
            <li> Clip will not hold very thick hair as it says. I would have not have purchased these if I would have known they would not hold thick hair.</li>
            <li> Would never buy again.  Thick hair , forget it.  This product does not slide, good to hold hair once it&#x27;s in, but pulls your hair badly while trying to put in.  Not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> One barrette broke immediately but one is doing well. It does grip well for no-slip, but the plastic snapped when it was clasped shut.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and these seem to hold well.</li>
            <li> These are inexpensive, well made (I have yet to break them--lose them yes, frequently, but not yet broken) and most importantly, THEY DO NOT SLIP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My choices for work are to either wear my hair up or cut it shorter.  Shorter hair is so more effort to be presentable so it&#x27;s nice to just be able to pull my hair back, put a little twist in it to put it up, spritz the front and voila--my hair is work ready in less than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have extremely fine hair and it barely reaches my shoulders.  No regular barrette will hold my hair for any length of time.  I need something that will stay put all day without fussing and that is plain and conservative.  These are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps there are other &#x27;no slip&#x27; types out there, but these are so wonderful I have not bothered looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JTG</li>
            <li> I have baby fine post chemo hair and these actually stay in my hair!!</li>
            <li> The one star is for the price. I wore one about 5 times,  and it cracked near the end.  The next time I wore it, it broke completely. I have other Scrunchi and Goody barrettes that are much higher quality, but, of course, cost more.</li>
            <li> I think they are sort of bulky with the gripper stuff but not bad. I would think these will work great with thick hair</li>
            <li> Good for everyday... practical. One was broken when I tried to get it off the card.</li>
            <li> I picked these up at my local grocery store.  Same item number (#17851-A) as what&#x27;s shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first problem: the individual pieces of the barrette have shrink-wrap plastic around them.  Not the colored outside piece, but the two main metal pieces that make up the barrette. One of those pieces is against the back of the barrette, and I could not find a way to remove the plastic without removing the piece from the barrette.  Basically, to get all the plastic off, I had to take the barrettes completely apart (I had 3 separate pieces at the end, for each barrette).  I also needed small, sharp scissors (and poked my finger with them once, ouch.)  It was really WAY more work than a cheapo barrette warrants, and I can&#x27;t figure out what the scunci people were thinking.  Maybe I just got a weird batch (I&#x27;d love to hear if others had this problem), but I&#x27;ve never bought barrettes with individual plastic on the parts before.  Really awful and time consuming to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem 2: The barrettes are not as big as they look.  They don&#x27;t hold enough hair.  The outer, colored edge is the same exact size as several other (similar style) barrettes I own, but the actual clasp is not big enough.  This is frustrating, because it&#x27;s difficult to figure out until you buy it (and remove all the plastic)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem 3: They feel cheap.  The pieces seem to fall apart easily.  You can get them to stick back together, but I&#x27;ve never had barrettes where the pieces just fall off like this.  I&#x27;m not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to searching for better barrettes!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without these specific barrettes.  I love them!!!!</li>
            <li> Split in half after wearing once!</li>
            <li> Do you have thick hair? Then this barrette can hold your hair back for a month or two before the plastic top breaks.</li>
            <li> good quality and value onthis item.</li>
            <li> Cheap! One broke the very first time I used it. And, the colors in the photo are not what I got. I got a black one and an ugly green one, which is, thankfully, the one that broke. Never again! Not even worth the $3 price tag.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and it slips right through these barrettes.  Also, as others have mentioned, these barrettes are difficult to open and close.  I just have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> This was the size I wanted, (about the length of a pack of gum) I bought two packages (one green and black and one tortoise and black)  The green was a surprise but I will wear it so I didn&#x27;t mind.  I was happy to get the right size I was looking for and they are well made and do a good job of pulling my hair back away from my face at work.  I had other barrettes just like this I had bought in Walgreen&#x27;s and I couldn&#x27;t find any more of in the store so I was was really happy to find these on Amazon.  I just ordered more, will need them long after they have become impossible to find.</li>
            <li> Not the colors I ordered, and they didn&#x27;t look the way I thought they would.  But they were sturdy, and they worked.  For a while.    At first, I thought they worked well.  My hair didn&#x27;t get tangled in the clasps, and they seemed to fasten quite neatly.  Able to hold a lot of hair.  And my hair is very slick and fine.  But now - and just in a matter of months, they can&#x27;t clasp together, so they are completely useless.  Will return to the Goody&#x27;s brand.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hold my hair, and it isn&#x27;t that thick. Complete waste of money, but would cost more to return than barrettes.</li>
            <li> My barrettes usually slide right off my head after a couple hours.  The plastic layer does a great job of holding without ripping out.  The first set last me 4 years of daily use before finally cracking.</li>
            <li> One of the barrettes broke the second time I used it. The other has been working fine. I do like the fact that the barrette can close to hold three different thicknesses of hair.</li>
            <li> These clips holdover good, but the plastic tops broke.</li>
            <li> Gripped my hair so hard that it pulled it out.</li>
            <li> I love these hair clips, too! I, too, have long (mid-back length) hair, but mine is thin and very fine. These clips hold my hair in a ponytail all day, no problem. The rubber grips keep the clip from sliding down. These clips are exactly what I wanted, purchased as replacements for one that broke (the metal \\&quot;clip\\&quot; part still works, but the decorative tortoiseshell strip broke and came off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips I received are one black, one dark green, as a previous reviewer stated. I would have preferred two tortoiseshell, but the ones I received are fine, too. Maybe they should list the color as \\&quot;assorted.\\&quot; If you MUST have a particular color, I&#x27;d suggest looking elsewhere, otherwise, I&#x27;d highly recommend these clips to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product! Holds my hair securely. Easy to put in and take out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, really poor quality. the black plastic of the barrette broke in half the first time I wore it. I had it clipped to the back of ponytail and heard a *snap*, and it had done just that...broke right in half. not even worth returning.</li>
            <li> Both broke within a few days.  While I could put my hair in a pony tail and fasten the barette, later in the day the plastic top cover snapped in two - although the metal clasp portion remained secure</li>
            <li> One of these broke within the first few uses--and I only used it to put up part of my hair.  I am really disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick, very voluminous, very long, very fine hair. Hair clips rarely stay in place even if they are big enough to hold all of her hair. I bought these clips for myself, but tried them on my daughter and they stayed in place! She is absolutely thrilled... and as far as hair clips go, I use these for all of my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;hair styles.</li>
            <li> The clasp is difficult opening and closing. I did luck out and got the black and brownish colors, however the clasp is difficult to use. I was hoping for easier opening and closing. That said, it will hold fine hair and this is difficult to find in hair clips for those of us with thin hair. Kudos for the concept and I hope they continue to improve the clasp design so it functions easier.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bough clips like this in a while.  I have thick, wavy hair that is more course on the top layer.  These kinds of clips never used to work for me, but the no-slip part is awesome.  I have shorter hair now (used to be to my waist and now it&#x27;s to my shoulders) and the clips keep it back easily.  I also like that there are 3 different &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; you can shut the clip to (according to how much hair you&#x27;re trying to put in the clip).</li>
            <li> I have medium-length, very thick hair. These can hold up a little less than half my hair (in that half-up, half-down style) comfortably and securely. So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The colors are black and BOTTLE GREEN, not the brownish color displayed in the picture.</li>
            <li> These hold my hair great.  Tight enough hold so that my hair doesn&#x27;t slip out.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, these barrettes are excellent at holding hair. The coated grip doesn&#x27;t slip, and it seems to be easier on the hair as it holds it. Once they&#x27;re in, I never have to rearrange them. These barrettes are my favorite way to keep my longer, wavy hair up and out of my face. At least for me, they&#x27;ll hold either a portion on top or an entire ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trouble is that I&#x27;ve now had half a dozen of them over the past few years, and none of them is still in one piece. I kept the latest package, and the store receipt I attached to it is dated just under a year ago. As the plastic part ages, it gets brittle, and it snaps in two. I now have half a dozen broken ones. (One I even took the broken plastic off and redecorated just the clip.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors probably won&#x27;t \\&quot;vary\\&quot;. There is one tortoiseshell and one black per card. As far as I know, the manufacturer does not sell a card with two of the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see these barrettes get attached to decorative parts that wouldn&#x27;t break. Better plastic, metal or wood, perhaps. In the meantime, I&#x27;m reluctant to buy more.</li>
            <li> Bought two sets, one of them finally had the plastic part broken. Can&#x27;t claim warranty internationally. But overall the product is very sturdy. My Girlfriend likes it very much.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE! I have very thick hair and ordinary bobby pins get lost in my hair but these stay in place and hold securely.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah...they&#x27;re practically free, well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> If you have really thin hair you will probably love this. My hair is by no means thick and anything more than half up is impossible with these clips, and I have used clips like this that rest more even on the head. I liked the green color, but this is not a set of black and tortie it is black and bottle green.</li>
            <li> works well, keeps hair in place, easy to put on and off</li>
            <li> I like these clips a lot for a cute half up half down hairstyle but I wanted a tortoise one and I got a green one, which is pretty useless. If you want a black and tortoise one, you won&#x27;t necessarily get them.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time hair clips that will hold my pony tail tight - but this one does. Great product - only wish in more colors and finishes</li>
            <li> These are the most secure barrettes I have found - but hard to find in the store.  My daughter tried to take one of my packages, but compromised with just one barrette.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the CVS store. I only used about two month and they broke. It maybe because my hair are too thick. Anyway, I have to shop for other product that&#x27;s stronger to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> They hold a fair amount of hair and do not slip out.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use as quick updo&#x27;s or pony tail holders.  My hair is too thick.  Would be great for 1/2 up and down though.</li>
            <li> Looks really old. Not the way I expected.</li>
            <li> I used this only a few times before it broke.  One &amp;#34;arm&amp;#34; which clasps onto the bar bent and just snapped off!  I&#x27;ve been using a different barrette instead.</li>
            <li> Great clips that hold hair well.</li>
            <li> Hard to find reasonably priced  barettes in town that are this big.  These were a great price and came fast.</li>
            <li> Works well and stays put in my fine hair. That is quite an accomplishment. It is difficult to find good barrettes for fine hair, but Scunci offers more than any brand I know.</li>
            <li> I have really incredibly thick hair. I have a very hard time getting a barrette to close on even a small quantity of my hair. These worked amazing. went right in closed without issue and stayed in place. unfortunately it was only about a week and a half after getting them that the plastic on the first barrette broke. I wasn&#x27;t trying to force it or anything just the same normal pressure that ive been using previous. I was still optimistic thinking that I could just use the barrette without the plastic or replace it with my own design but the plastic seemed to add a pressure to the metal part and the barrette itself wouldn&#x27;t function properly afterward.</li>
            <li> I have thick and curly hair and this is the only clip that I have found to work! I love it! I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Held a nice amount of hair; however, plastic on clip broke quickly</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and most barrettes are either to flimsy or unable to hold my hair.  These barrettes are the first ones I have found that are strong enough for my hair.  And they really don&#x27;t slip!</li>
            <li> Somewhat small. I have thick hair and this can only hold up a small amount of my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent clips!! I had read the previous reviews, so I was aware that one would likely be green ( I didn&#x27;t know what exactly they meant by Kermit the Frog green, but I did when I saw it). One of mine is black and one is green - like a cross between neon lime on the clip side and darker sort of grass green thin stripes along with the neon color showing through as well on the top side. It&#x27;s also sort of translucent. The green one is actually sort of artsy looking. I have a lot of green in my wardrobe so it totally works.</li>
