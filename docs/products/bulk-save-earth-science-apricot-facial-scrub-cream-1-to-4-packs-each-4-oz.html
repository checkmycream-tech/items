            <li>this product is awesome!</li>
            <li>This face wash is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Its a very good scrub for my acne prone skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you get a good scrubbed feeling and best of all</li>
            <li>My 3 teen/preteen daughters use this also, and they have beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a great rating on EWG</li>
            <li>Its a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This face scrub feels great while you are using it and my skin feels softer after using.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good for the environment.</li>
            <li>This is also really good for removing makeup.</li>
            <li>The granules weren&#x27;t very effective because it&#x27;s more of a cleanser than a scrub.  </li>
            <li>I love this scrub!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and it has done an amazing job.  </li>
            <li>Not an effective 2 in 1 product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and still love it.</li>
            <li>The best facial scrub ever made.</li>
            <li>This is ok.  </li>
            <li>My face is so smooth after using this!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also better than any foot exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>one of my best facial products</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I have used this scrub for many years</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This product is just as good and priced right.</li>
            <li>The smell is light, pleasant and fades away quickly.</li>
            <li>Great consistency, gentle for sensitive skin on the face, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It smells great and has kept out faces clear since we&#x27;ve started with it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s remarkable in that it removes dead skin and leaves your skin feeling moist and looking great.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower, so this is quite easy to do.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and leaves skin very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>not too gritty, gets the exfoliating done gently, and smells great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too abrasive, doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering fragrance, and leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin smooth and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for my beloved Aveeno Skin Brightening Daily Scrub.  </li>
            <li>Recently had a facial and the technician said my skin was in excellent condition (and I&#x27;m 45).</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better suited for normal to oily</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most cleansers make me break out.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to be more natural in their skin care.</li>
            <li>Earth Science products are superior to other brands.</li>
            <li>Love using this after a long day, exfoliates gently and leaves my face feeling clean without over drying.  </li>
            <li>Natural and effective alternative to major name brand &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Exfoliates well and leaves skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li>I am a BIG Earth Science fan and LOVE their facewash and moisturizers (been using them for years) but this scrub creme I DO NOT like.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Skin is smooth and soft after use.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using raw honey as a cleanser, which was fine, but was so glad to find this scrub.  </li>
            <li>Also I like the texture, not too gritty and not too fine.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really really like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting as much acne now.  </li>
            <li>-- I guess that is why it&#x27;s called gentle --</li>
            <li>That way its not too abrasive on your skin but removes the dead skin effectively.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Earth Science but NOT this particular product!</li>
            <li>It is gentle for sensitive skin but tended to dry mine out if I used it more than once a day.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this exfoliant.</li>
            <li>Gentle for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is more abrasive than Aveeno but not as harsh as St Ives for example.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin, oily t zone, and normal on rest of face.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>High quality face scrub and natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I like this products because it&#x27;s not harsh to the skin and my boys enjoys it too.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it is all natural.</li>
            <li>The scent is not terrible but not amazing.  </li>
            <li>The key is to rub it onto your face with hardy any pressure, but spend about half a minute or so making light circular motions all over your face.</li>
            <li>Whenever I decide to try something new I see on the market, without exception I come back to this apricot scrub.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for daily use, cleans well and smooths out my skin.  </li>
            <li>The little scrubbies in the cleanser are perfectly gentle, yet rough enough to get my face clean.  </li>
            <li>I generally get acne around my t zone.  </li>
            <li>Apparently.  </li>
            <li>There is barely any materials in it to \\&quot;scrub\\&quot;</li>
            <li>you want a high quality skin exfoliate that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry, check out louisebianco.com - they make a product called Derma Polish - it&#x27;s not listed on their website so you have to call them to order it.  </li>
            <li>The contents are totally different in texture, consistency and even color-it is much lighter and is not as grainy as the other one.</li>

            <li> I have dry, oily flaky skin.</li>
            <li> Does not cause breakouts or dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I can say about this scrub is that it&#x27;s quite solid, so you have to run it under hot water to soften it up and make it easier to squeeze out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt the &#x27;tight face&#x27; after washing (which means my face would be over dry) with this scrub.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t notice any exfoliating results like I achieve with other exfoliating cleansers.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just a thick, sticky, gooey, gross mess.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased this cleanser and found it to be harsh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky on your face and is hard to wash off.  </li>
            <li> The beads are hard core exfoliating</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any negative marks for this product.</li>
            <li> It smells bad</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. It has lots of abrasive fragments so you get a good scrubbed feeling and best of all they&#x27;re not plastic so it&#x27;s good for the environment.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most cleansers make me break out.  I&#x27;d been using raw honey as a cleanser, which was fine, but was so glad to find this scrub.  It is gentle enough for daily use, cleans well and smooths out my skin.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen dermatologists for years and stumbled upon this. Please, if you have acne problems, try this!</li>
            <li> Earth Science products are superior to other brands. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for about 12 years, after I received a facial using their face cream.  Recently had a facial and the technician said my skin was in excellent condition (and I&#x27;m 45).</li>
            <li> My wife and I use this scrub religiously. It smells great and has kept out faces clear since we&#x27;ve started with it. This is the 6th bottle we&#x27;ve purchased and I know we&#x27;ll buy another one when this one is gone!</li>
            <li> Gentle for my sensitive skin. Exfoliates well and leaves skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing!! I have been using it for years and still love it. Noticeably clears up my skin without causing any drying/irritation.</li>
            <li> Great consistency, gentle for sensitive skin on the face, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> The best facial scrub ever made.</li>
            <li> not too gritty, gets the exfoliating done gently, and smells great!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and leaves skin very smooth and soft.  Also I like the texture, not too gritty and not too fine.</li>
            <li> I am amazed with this face wash! I have dry, oily flaky skin. This face wash helps to get rid of the flakes without making my face all red. I no longer have acne on my face. Both my husband I have been using it for over 6 months!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. Its a very good scrub for my acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a great rating on EWG so I rinse it well and/or use a cleanser afterward.</li>
            <li> This is my go to exfoliating scrub. I use it three times a week and while in the shower. The key is to rub it onto your face with hardy any pressure, but spend about half a minute or so making light circular motions all over your face. That way its not too abrasive on your skin but removes the dead skin effectively. After that I use a moisturizing face wash and a moisturizer. This leaves my skin smooth and fresh looking.</li>
            <li> I really really like this product. The exfoliators are abrasive enough to make it feel like they&#x27;re doing something, but not enough to make it feel like your skin is being ripped off. No greasiness after use, either. The smell is light, pleasant and fades away quickly. The only bad thing I can say about this scrub is that it&#x27;s quite solid, so you have to run it under hot water to soften it up and make it easier to squeeze out of the tube. I use it in the shower, so this is quite easy to do. I highly recommend this exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my beloved Aveeno Skin Brightening Daily Scrub.  I&#x27;m looking for a replacement as Aveeno uses the plastic microbeads which get eaten by fish and then kill them.  Apparently.  I don&#x27;t like a scrub that feels like I&#x27;m punishing my skin.  This is ok.  It is more abrasive than Aveeno but not as harsh as St Ives for example.  It is also very pasty, so it is hard to rinse off and I often find myself with some grit left on my temple or under my chin.</li>
            <li> Love using this after a long day, exfoliates gently and leaves my face feeling clean without over drying.  I have combination skin, oily t zone, and normal on rest of face.  I generally get acne around my t zone.  I&#x27;m not getting as much acne now.  I use this with the clarifying facial wash too.  This is also really good for removing makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub! It&#x27;s not too abrasive, doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering fragrance, and leaves my face feeling clean and smooth. I don&#x27;t have any negative marks for this product.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this cleanser and found it to be harsh. I have good skin, but it&#x27;s sensitive and was quite disappointed to find my skin very tight and dry after using it. I think it&#x27;s better suited for normal to oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a high quality skin exfoliate that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry, check out louisebianco.com - they make a product called Derma Polish - it&#x27;s not listed on their website so you have to call them to order it.  It&#x27;s about $25 but it&#x27;s remarkable in that it removes dead skin and leaves your skin feeling moist and looking great.</li>

            <li> I am a BIG Earth Science fan and LOVE their facewash and moisturizers (been using them for years) but this scrub creme I DO NOT like.  It smells bad and it&#x27;s just a thick, sticky, gooey, gross mess.  There is barely any materials in it to \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; -- I guess that is why it&#x27;s called gentle -- but I don&#x27;t notice any exfoliating results like I achieve with other exfoliating cleansers.

I&#x27;ve never felt the &#x27;tight face&#x27; after washing (which means my face would be over dry) with this scrub.  My 3 teen/preteen daughters use this also, and they have beautiful skin.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> one of my best facial products</li>
            <li> Natural and effective alternative to major name brand &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; scrubs (which contain tiny bits of micro plastics that accumulate in waterways and harm marine animals). This product is just as good and priced right. Recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is not the same I had bought before.  It has a sticker with the Earth Science name and logo but it makes me wonder if it&#x27;s the same company.  The contents are totally different in texture, consistency and even color-it is much lighter and is not as grainy as the other one.</li>
            <li> this product is awesome! The beads are hard core exfoliating</li>
            <li> Its a great product.  The scent is not terrible but not amazing.  It works well.  I might buy it again but Im going to see if I can find other products that are similar.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have very sensitive skin and I use this on my feet. Skin is smooth and soft after use.</li>
            <li> This face scrub feels great while you are using it and my skin feels softer after using. I love it</li>
            <li> It is gentle for sensitive skin but tended to dry mine out if I used it more than once a day.  The granules weren&#x27;t very effective because it&#x27;s more of a cleanser than a scrub.  Not an effective 2 in 1 product.  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> High quality face scrub and natural ingredients.  I use it twice a week for extra cleansing and exfoliating.  Does not cause breakouts or dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this scrub for many years and I love it. I use it after cleansing cream, soften it with water and it does the deep cleaning and smoothing. Whenever I decide to try something new I see on the market, without exception I come back to this apricot scrub. I do get compliments on my skin and I give this scrub the credit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it is all natural. It cleans well and I like the scent. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to be more natural in their skin care.I will definitely purchase more.</li>
