            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and thin...didn&#x27;t even come in a box</li>
            <li>Its nice, super fast shipping, it doesn&#x27;t really add cup sizes though.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well during sweaty days.</li>

            <li> There was no indication of origin or expectation of such a long delivery delay.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because is does not hide your nipples as well as some other bras.</li>
            <li> I bought it to go with a backless dress and because the usual solution of band-aids to keep my nipples from chaffing was truly getting old.</li>
            <li> One, its too small</li>
            <li> Very thin.</li>
            <li> Terrible design that has no shape at all.</li>

            <li> This bra is..not good in my opinion. One, its too small and I ordered a size up. two, it doesnt cover anything!! I don&#x27;t recommend as a bra but there can be other uses for it like for your husbands liking haha ;)</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good quality. Worked pretty well during sweaty days.</li>
            <li> Saved my life at a wedding! Even with sweating and dancing!</li>
            <li> Very nice and punctual!</li>
            <li> Awesome piece for cute outfits!</li>
            <li> The product itself is ok. Runs slightly smaller than similar products I have used before. The bigger issue however is it took a month for delivery as it came directly from China. There was no indication of origin or expectation of such a long delivery delay. Very unlike any other of my experiences with Amazon.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t give any support for your breast. All it does is cover your nipples.</li>
            <li> Very thin. No support.</li>
            <li> I like this. I bought it to go with a backless dress and because the usual solution of band-aids to keep my nipples from chaffing was truly getting old. This set stays in place nicely, and is comfortable. I tried it out well before the event to make sure and I actually forgot I was wearing it. I wore it for nearly the whole day and while it doesn&#x27;t do much for support or cleavage, it definitely protected the goods. As others have mentioned, they don&#x27;t hide the nipples quite as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This product was a no go for me. It caused a strange bulge of breast where the top of the product met my skin, no matter how I placed it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my white backless birthday dress!  I love this product.  I&#x27;ve worn it several times.</li>
            <li> Its nice, super fast shipping, it doesn&#x27;t really add cup sizes though.</li>
