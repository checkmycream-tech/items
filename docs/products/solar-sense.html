            <li>This product was recommended by Dr. Oz &amp; I am very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>So this is the perfect compromise between physical and chemical sunscreen and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>The sun is really strong!</li>
            <li>Maybe sun block spackle is a better name?</li>
            <li>If you have hair on your body (as many of us do)</li>

            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It is more healthy and thats why I bought 2 of them</li>

            <li>they discontinued it so we have not be able to get ti</li>
            <li>I am very fair skined and I purchased my first clear zinc product from my  Dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>it gets even more fun</li>
            <li>It does smooth in with time</li>
            <li>The guys from True Blood would rule Louisiana by slathering this on.</li>
            <li>you are good in the water for a solid 2-3 hour session.  </li>
            <li>I will feel more protecded with the clear zinc lotion.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m hooked and happy to have finally settled in a sunscreen and am reordering (3rd tube).  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li>in all a great product, especially at Amazon prices (nearly $20 in the one local store that carries this brand).</li>
            <li>I like the other products by clear zinc, this is good a lso.</li>
            <li>This is a thick cream and its just not as great as your normal sunblock.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quite</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and really like it--not greasy</li>
            <li>It is very greasy.  </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to rub that much, just need to wait a minute for it to absorb.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a light sheen, which tells me that the ZO is working (that&#x27;s how physical sunscreens work, not through absorption, but reflection, and though UV is not visible, ZO also reflect some in the visible spectrum.)  </li>
            <li>have dark skin, so most sunscreens turn my skin gray, which just looks funny.</li>
            <li>I occasionally allow myself up to 15 minutes of sun on bare, unprotected skin, but anything more than that</li>
            <li>I first found Solar Sense clear zinc oxide in a grocery store in Aruba 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>but it absorbs quickly and leaves no white residue on your face.  </li>
            <li>I rarely had to re-apply (even after a 11 mile hike with a swim in the middle).</li>
            <li>This is ok, but hard to spread compared to other more natural sunscreens I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The formulation makes it easy to reapply in that the previous layer doesn&#x27;t ball</li>
            <li>My head is almost bald and this is the only product that keeps me from burning in the hot sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens, never satisfied as I have combination skin that is prone to breakouts (cistic acne?).  </li>
            <li>It becomes clear after about 15 minutes of putting in on.</li>
            <li>you are looking for something to COMPLETELY block the sun.</li>
            <li>so I really just get my face, neck arms, lower back, and legs.  </li>
            <li>I was about to wash it out but got distracted (have young kids).  </li>
            <li>When I came back to wash it 30 seconds later, I was surprised to find it had been mostly absorbed  </li>
            <li>This starts off with a little graying of my skin, but quickly fades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot comment on how well the lotion protects during a full day at the beach or on a sailboat (I limit my time at the ocean), but I can spend up to 10 hours outside gardening (not necessarily in full sun all day), and I have not burned yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With that said the tube lasts pretty long, I still have plenty left on my 2nd bottle.  </li>
            <li>and I protect my skin with a complete physical block.</li>
            <li>It goes on very thick and makes you feel confident you are getting solid protection.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is somewhat thin (an improvement over last year&#x27;s formulation), making it easy to spread and melt into the skin, and it does not leave a thick white cast to the skin like so many other physical sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about every pure ZO sunscreen in the market and the fact is that they all go in heavy, makes me look like a ghost</li>

            <li> : it went on thick, white and pasty, I thought it would certainly cause me problems by clogging my pores.  </li>

            <li> This is not clear.  </li>
            <li> (The only other contender is DHC&#x27;s White Sunscreen, which goes on lighter and is only physical, but it&#x27;s spf 25 will only do on shady winter days.)  </li>
            <li> I am surprised that it has become so hard to find, even on Amazon, and forget about your local pharmacy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels heavy and thick when you first apply it</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave feedback, but I don&#x27;t want this to be discontinued, and hope this helps other folks out there with problematic, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We spent 10 days in the Galapagos.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> Other sunscreen products MAY react to sunlight and produce carcinogens as a result.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it does not have any of the bad chemicals (avobenzone and other stuff which I consider a no-no), in fact, it has very similar ingredients to a much more expensive sunscreen I had earlier purchased at my dermatologist  </li>
            <li> left off one star because it&#x27;s really hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Order on amazon because I just saw it in a surfshop down here for $16 for one tube.  </li>
            <li> I put on a heavy thick (yes White) layer on before my 2+ hour trail runs.</li>
            <li> I will use this for active pursuits rather than as an &#x27;everyday&#x27; sun screen.</li>
            <li> like the fact that it has aloe and green tea.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t risk running out, and I apply this neck to toe all year round because the sun does penetrate clothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a thick cream and takes a little bit of working into the skin.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I found this to be hard to spread.</li>
            <li> This is so thick that lotion may be a generous term.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, the formulation was SPF30 and the cream was thick and stiff, difficult to spread, but this year Solar Sense improved it dramatically by increasing the SPF, thinning the consistency, and adding aloe.</li>
            <li> I was in a beach vacation and ran out of my expensive dermatologist-office-bought sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> So I picked up a random sunscreen at the store, ZO (Zinc Oxide) based, which happened to be this one.  </li>
            <li> if my memory doesn&#x27;t fail me?).  </li>
            <li> and/or smell bad.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be water repellent and didn&#x27;t come off after swiming.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I will feel more protecded with the clear zinc lotion. The quantity of lotion at this price is great. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wish they would bring back the SPF 30 for those of us who do not care for glycerin in our skin care products.</li>
            <li> We spent 10 days in the Galapagos. Every local who talked to us warned us about the sun. They all had the same joke about how they used to be as pale as us until they moved to the Galapagos.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s near the equator! The sun is really strong! Be careful! We heard this a lot.&lt;br /&gt;With this lotion, neither my wife nor I darkened in the slightest. No color change after days out doors. Whether we were hiking across lava rock islands, or snorkeling in the Pacific, it didn&#x27;t matter. We appeared to never have left the house. It works that well.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something to COMPLETELY block the sun. This is it. Angel or Spike would have no problem in the LA sun with this. The guys from True Blood would rule Louisiana by slathering this on. Heck, the Twilight boys wouldn&#x27;t even sparkle wearing this stuff! It&#x27;s really quite impressive.&lt;br /&gt;I left off one star because it&#x27;s really hard to apply. This is so thick that lotion may be a generous term. Maybe sun block spackle is a better name? If you have hair on your body (as many of us do) it gets even more fun and the stuff adheres to your hair. But you just have to persevere and it can be rubbed in thoroughly and you don&#x27;t look as if you&#x27;ve applied whitewash to your body.</li>
            <li> This is ok, but hard to spread compared to other more natural sunscreens I have tried.  I am not sure if I would repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff all the time. Interestingly, in addition to preventing sunburn, it promotes tanning. The value is good in the 2-pack from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Other sunscreen products MAY react to sunlight and produce carcinogens as a result. I&#x27;ve heard that zinc is the way to go, so I went.&lt;br /&gt;I have dark skin, so most sunscreens turn my skin gray, which just looks funny. This starts off with a little graying of my skin, but quickly fades.&lt;br /&gt;It has very little odor, so it&#x27;s great to use no matter the situation you&#x27;ll be in.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very whipped consistency, so a small amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to test its performance in water, but will update rating when I do.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it has aloe and green tea. It&#x27;s moisturizing without leaving ones skin feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great product, especially at Amazon prices (nearly $20 in the one local store that carries this brand).</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used.  I have been in Costa Rica surfing now for over 30 days and this stuff works excellent.  One good application and you are good in the water for a solid 2-3 hour session.  I think only once in this blazing sun have re-applied a 2nd coat.  Other times when I should have I simply got a little more color on my face than expected but absolutely no sunburn.  I wear a short sleeve rash guard so I really just get my face, neck arms, lower back, and legs.  It goes on very thick and makes you feel confident you are getting solid protection.  With that said the tube lasts pretty long, I still have plenty left on my 2nd bottle.  Order on amazon because I just saw it in a surfshop down here for $16 for one tube.  I probably will never buy anything else for sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. The lotion is somewhat thin (an improvement over last year&#x27;s formulation), making it easy to spread and melt into the skin, and it does not leave a thick white cast to the skin like so many other physical sunscreens. The formulation makes it easy to reapply in that the previous layer doesn&#x27;t ball up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, the formulation was SPF30 and the cream was thick and stiff, difficult to spread, but this year Solar Sense improved it dramatically by increasing the SPF, thinning the consistency, and adding aloe. I am surprised that it has become so hard to find, even on Amazon, and forget about your local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy five bottles at a time so I don&#x27;t risk running out, and I apply this neck to toe all year round because the sun does penetrate clothing. I use about one tube a month. I cannot comment on how well the lotion protects during a full day at the beach or on a sailboat (I limit my time at the ocean), but I can spend up to 10 hours outside gardening (not necessarily in full sun all day), and I have not burned yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize there&#x27;s a lot of debate about the pros/cons of using sunscreen and it&#x27;s affects on vitamin D. I occasionally allow myself up to 15 minutes of sun on bare, unprotected skin, but anything more than that and I protect my skin with a complete physical block. I can always take D3 orally, so I&#x27;ll keep my skin youthful for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> This is a thick cream and its just not as great as your normal sunblock. It is more healthy and thats why I bought 2 of them but I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is the only sun protection I use.  I am very fair skined and I purchased my first clear zinc product from my  Dermatologist.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores so I went online and was able to purchase Clear Zinc.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen. Used this throughout my three day Grand Canyon hike and never got burnt once. It&#x27;s quite a thick cream and takes a little bit of working into the skin. It&#x27;s not greasy, but it also isn&#x27;t completely absorbed by your skin either (no doubt attributable to it&#x27;s water resistant properties). I rarely had to re-apply (even after a 11 mile hike with a swim in the middle). I will use this for active pursuits rather than as an &#x27;everyday&#x27; sun screen.</li>
            <li> I like the other products by clear zinc, this is good a lso.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the water 3 days a week and this product has eliminated sunburn from my life.  It feels heavy and thick when you first apply it but it absorbs quickly and leaves no white residue on your face.  It does not clog pores.  My skin loves it.</li>
            <li> This stuff says on and works. I put on a heavy thick (yes White) layer on before my 2+ hour trail runs. It becomes clear after about 15 minutes of putting in on. I care about the effectiveness of a product and don&#x27;t care if I&#x27;m a bit white looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and really like it--not greasy and it works</li>
            <li> I first found Solar Sense clear zinc oxide in a grocery store in Aruba 2 years ago. I haven&#x27;t seen it since, until I got on Amazon. My head is almost bald and this is the only product that keeps me from burning in the hot sun.</li>
            <li> This is not clear.  It is very greasy.  It does smooth in with time but I would. It buy again.</li>
            <li> they discontinued it so we have not be able to get ti</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by Dr. Oz &amp; I am very pleased with this. He recommends using sun protection with zinc oxide &amp; titanium dioxide. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> At first, it seems really thick and greasy when applying it to my skin.  I have to rub it quite a bit until my skin finally absorbs it and gives it a nice shiny look.  I think it repels the sun and does what its supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I found this to be hard to spread. Eventually it disappeared and did prevent sunburn. However, it didn&#x27;t breathe, and actually I got sun poisoning (itchy rash). I believe that it stops the skin from sweating. Wish I could report otherwise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens, never satisfied as I have combination skin that is prone to breakouts (cistic acne?).  I was in a beach vacation and ran out of my expensive dermatologist-office-bought sunscreen.  So I picked up a random sunscreen at the store, ZO (Zinc Oxide) based, which happened to be this one.  When I first put it on, I didn&#x27;t like it at all: it went on thick, white and pasty, I thought it would certainly cause me problems by clogging my pores.  I was about to wash it out but got distracted (have young kids).  When I came back to wash it 30 seconds later, I was surprised to find it had been mostly absorbed  - white paste was gone!  You really don&#x27;t need to rub that much, just need to wait a minute for it to absorb.  It leaves a light sheen, which tells me that the ZO is working (that&#x27;s how physical sunscreens work, not through absorption, but reflection, and though UV is not visible, ZO also reflect some in the visible spectrum.)  I also noticed that it does not have any of the bad chemicals (avobenzone and other stuff which I consider a no-no), in fact, it has very similar ingredients to a much more expensive sunscreen I had earlier purchased at my dermatologist  (Elta MD if my memory doesn&#x27;t fail me?).  I&#x27;ve tried about every pure ZO sunscreen in the market and the fact is that they all go in heavy, makes me look like a ghost and/or smell bad.  So this is the perfect compromise between physical and chemical sunscreen and it works beautifully.  I&#x27;m hooked and happy to have finally settled in a sunscreen and am reordering (3rd tube).  (The only other contender is DHC&#x27;s White Sunscreen, which goes on lighter and is only physical, but it&#x27;s spf 25 will only do on shady winter days.)  I usually don&#x27;t leave feedback, but I don&#x27;t want this to be discontinued, and hope this helps other folks out there with problematic, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using for several years. Started as sun screen but  found it cleared up his face and continues to use  His face was always breaking out from sun, he was diagnosed with roasea.</li>
            <li> Just as described very white when applied and clears up to form a shinny surface on the skin. Seems to be water repellent and didn&#x27;t come off after swiming.</li>
