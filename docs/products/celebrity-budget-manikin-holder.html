            <li>Please keep in mind, folks, that this does not stand on it&#x27;s own and needs a table of some sort.</li>

            <li>I really liked the product.</li>

            <li>Love, love this product!</li>
            <li>bought this to use on my very first wig making experience, and it turned up to be a great help.</li>
            <li>I knew it was too good to be so cheap ;(</li>
            <li>its fit perfect and is exactly as it was in the description box</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I need it to do, and for a great price.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my Arkansas Esthetician&#x27;s Practical Exam in October, and it held up just fine!</li>
            <li>Very light weight but sturdy.</li>
            <li>For one, it appears very cheap.</li>
            <li>Nice product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this one.</li>
            <li>this is an overall perfect product</li>
            <li>But, for the price, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>so I got creative and decided to attach it to the ironing board</li>
            <li>I use it to hold the mannequin head while the hair is drying, I am able to color, cut, and style the hair without any issues.  </li>
            <li>Sally&#x27;s has better more sturdy stand</li>
            <li>great item fast shipping</li>
            <li>The item arrived in great condition and fast.  </li>
            <li>It would be better if the height could also be adjustable</li>
            <li>You can take off the top and put another one.</li>
            <li>You can take the top off and you can buy another top.</li>
            <li>But I gust you can put another top on.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Why spend more, if you don&#x27;t have to?</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I was concerned about it fitting the manikin head</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, works great</li>
            <li>I love this and will be getting a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to be on the safe side</li>
            <li>and I passed by the way:)</li>

            <li>I may order a couple more just to have around.</li>
            <li>and she is able to style hair and rotate the mannequin head with ease.</li>
            <li>i totally love it.</li>
            <li>No biggie&lt;br /&gt;I am ok with it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>But also, the Manikin head just sits on that stick at the top.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe those two knobs up there at the top did something, but</li>
            <li>It holds the mannequin well though and gives a full rotation which is nice.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price, does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>Holds my styrofoam head in place perfect to blow dry and style my wig.</li>
            <li>It made me feel good to be able to give something so appreciated.</li>
            <li>Difficult to hold on a table still trying to find the ideal place to attach it to so as to get a perfect reach seated</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold on to surface good, my mannequin was very lose on the stick.</li>
            <li>Her hair has been styled and washed many times and is still as good as new.</li>
            <li>I tried to figure it out on my own, but the parts that came with it don&#x27;t seem to be the right parts.</li>
            <li>At such a good price I would get more than one, which is what I did!</li>
            <li>easy to put together and use.</li>
            <li>Convenient and easy to use.</li>

            <li>It holds the manikin head securely and is easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>It came in pieces with no instructions, but looking at the picture it was easy to tell how everything fit together.  </li>
            <li>But after that- everything is fine.</li>
            <li>Its works fine for me</li>
            <li>and I put this on a tv tray and it works fine for wig making.&lt;br /&gt;YES</li>

            <li>IT CAME RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t get it to work right.</li>
            <li>Maybe i don&#x27;t have the right piece of furniture</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product the top completely broke off.</li>

            <li>Hubby is glad to have his C-ring clamps back.</li>
            <li>Sturdy &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s for exactly what it&#x27;s to be used for.</li>
            <li>Fits most wig heads, but some wig heads have larger holes.  </li>
            <li>Mine broke after a few weeksüò© but it was really good.</li>
            <li>In the process of preparing to opening up my own shop, Awsome product will share with other student cosmotologist while in school because the school doesnt provide for home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clamp on the bottom is secure once tightened; little boat steering wheel thing to be able to move the stick mount is VERY secure.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Cheap and plastically, can brake easily just combing hair, don&#x27;t waste your money on this there are better ones out their for the same cost!</li>
            <li>The holder is made of plastic, so it doesn&#x27;t grip very well on table surfaces.</li>
            <li>The molding isn&#x27;t straight.</li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t hold my mannequin straight up.</li>
            <li>This makes wig styling on your mannequin head much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really kno how it broke.</li>
            <li>Very efficient.</li>
            <li>The clamp does not hold very well, it comes unhooked very easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The price for this product is reasonable.</li>
            <li>This holder made styling my units sooo much easier.</li>
            <li>This fits my mannequin very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I dont have much to say about this..</li>
            <li>Item is as described and was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I make a lot of wigs and this stand really came in hand...</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>My wife is a cosmetologist and she absolutely loves the manikin holder.</li>
            <li>The clamp doesn&#x27;t open far enough to fit on our counters, will have to get creative to make it work.</li>
            <li>I did have to go on youtube to search for a video that showed how one is put together though haha.</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I do recomend the product to any one who wants to practice cuting hair or like to do hair doos</li>
            <li>For the 6 or 7 dollars, this really exceeds my expectation.</li>
            <li>It is much studier than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really used it yet</li>
            <li>It holds up very well</li>
            <li>Very sturdy also...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It should hold any mannequin head nicely and firmly.</li>
            <li>I mean the swivel is good sometimes, but there are times when you need the mannequin to just stay still.</li>
            <li>It was extremely helpful and I love the style and position availability.</li>
            <li>She has had it for exactly 7 days so far and</li>
            <li>Not realizing that the size is too small for any of the manikin heads we own.</li>
            <li>Fine for the money but head is loose on the pole.  </li>
            <li>The top half (which holds the mannequin) has a screw which allows it to tilt in any direction.</li>
            <li>I guess there is not much used for this item since the doll head had to be tossed as it tangled very quickly</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase, less headache now</li>
            <li>My one main problem is that my package came in a beat up looking box.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly to hold foam wig heads but have also used it with display mannequins.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to be able to attach this to several workspaces so I can practice in different places.</li>
            <li>Works for what I need but not as strong plastic as I expected</li>
            <li>This item is made of plastic, I would recommend buying one that was a little more durable.  </li>
            <li>Again, no need to over tighten as the rod has a ball with little dimples for gripping.</li>
            <li>I may just buy a few more to keep in stock just in case....</li>
            <li>A TABLE TOP FIRMLY SO</li>
            <li>It is not hard to use.</li>
            <li>When tried to use it the top half broke completely off.</li>
            <li>I got the top part together fine, but now can&#x27;t get the lower half that it should stand on together because of the long screw and the turning knob (because it&#x27;s not flat ), which is on the bottom, won&#x27;t allow the thing to stand up.</li>
            <li>Sometimes she likes to create a new hairstyle just before she goes to bed.</li>
            <li>; Cheap, Flimsy, doesn&#x27;t stay wish I had bought a more expensive one.</li>
            <li>I fixed this with a little bit of padding to make it fit a little more snug and it works for me.</li>
            <li>However it broke on me within 30 mins of the first use because it is entirely plastic.</li>
            <li>and it feels cheap like it will not last long.</li>
            <li>For example, the screw seems way too long to fit properly.</li>
            <li>It is certainly sturdy and a ten year old can work it...since she did after I showed her once.</li>
            <li>and when I tighten the bottom it broke clear off</li>
            <li>This holder is made completely from plastic.</li>
            <li>but it does not fit the Lexi Manikin head securely or even snuggly.  </li>
            <li>Welp I can tell you what I want, I want a handle on the support screw like the handle that&#x27;s used to direct the Manikin head.</li>
            <li>a complete waist of money</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast, I received it next day.</li>
            <li>The old one I had was snug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not kept on the table, because the soft plastic and rubber mount like plastmas too.</li>
            <li>im not sure why so many people said this wasnt durable, but it actually is.</li>
            <li>This was high quality for the low price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tightening the clamp down to a table was a bit of a chore as the threaded shaft didnt free spin, and it took a lot of turns to get it open enough to put on my table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now most of the furniture in my home is very thick (besides the dinner table</li>
            <li>no regrets</li>
            <li>It fixes very well to the table but the hole in the bottom of the Manikin head is too wide for the part that it sits on.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old purple foam wig head stand with similar construction because I couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li>It also does a poor job gripping the table-</li>
            <li>It secures very tightly on any table top, shelf, chair, etc and the neck part adjusts so you can tilt the head down or to the side</li>
            <li>I was finally able to coax the thing onto a book case shelf that was thin enough, but as soon as I started messing with the Manikin head, it promptly fell off.</li>
            <li>Worth the small investment.</li>
            <li>My kids broke this one in less than a day, but the customer service and return process was very efficient.</li>
            <li>Mannequinn heads simply aren&#x27;t that heavy - even with large wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It works great and easily attaches to the counter or table.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Use your own opinion when deciding to purchase.  </li>
            <li> Please keep in mind, folks, that this does not stand on it&#x27;s own and needs a table of some sort.</li>
            <li> But yes, if you don&#x27;t want to spend much money this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product.</li>

            <li> This item is very easy to put together.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product!</li>
            <li> bought this to use on my very first wig making experience, and it turned up to be a great help.</li>
            <li> I knew it was too good to be so cheap ;(</li>
            <li> its fit perfect and is exactly as it was in the description box</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need it to do, and for a great price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Arkansas Esthetician&#x27;s Practical Exam in October, and it held up just fine!</li>
            <li> Very light weight but sturdy.</li>
            <li> For one, it appears very cheap.</li>
            <li> Nice product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this one.</li>
            <li> this is an overall perfect product</li>
            <li> But, for the price, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> so I got creative and decided to attach it to the ironing board</li>
            <li> I use it to hold the mannequin head while the hair is drying, I am able to color, cut, and style the hair without any issues.  </li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s has better more sturdy stand</li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> The item arrived in great condition and fast.  </li>
            <li> It would be better if the height could also be adjustable</li>
            <li> You can take off the top and put another one.</li>
            <li> You can take the top off and you can buy another top.</li>
            <li> But I gust you can put another top on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Why spend more, if you don&#x27;t have to?</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I was concerned about it fitting the manikin head</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, works great</li>
            <li> I love this and will be getting a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to be on the safe side</li>
            <li> and I passed by the way:)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend this product, its a great buy.</li>

            <li> Will purchase more as needed.</li>
            <li> I may order a couple more just to have around.</li>
            <li> and she is able to style hair and rotate the mannequin head with ease.</li>
            <li> i totally love it.</li>
            <li> No biggie&lt;br /&gt;I am ok with it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> But also, the Manikin head just sits on that stick at the top.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe those two knobs up there at the top did something, but</li>
            <li> It holds the mannequin well though and gives a full rotation which is nice.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price, does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> Holds my styrofoam head in place perfect to blow dry and style my wig.</li>
            <li> It made me feel good to be able to give something so appreciated.</li>
            <li> Difficult to hold on a table still trying to find the ideal place to attach it to so as to get a perfect reach seated</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold on to surface good, my mannequin was very lose on the stick.</li>
            <li> Her hair has been styled and washed many times and is still as good as new.</li>
            <li> I tried to figure it out on my own, but the parts that came with it don&#x27;t seem to be the right parts.</li>
            <li> At such a good price I would get more than one, which is what I did!</li>
            <li> easy to put together and use.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to adjust and take on and off the table.</li>
            <li> For the cheaper cost, I find it more attractive than the standard clamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and put together.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and came very quickly.</li>

            <li> It holds the manikin head securely and is easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> It came in pieces with no instructions, but looking at the picture it was easy to tell how everything fit together.  </li>
            <li> But after that- everything is fine.</li>
            <li> Its works fine for me</li>
            <li> and I put this on a tv tray and it works fine for wig making.&lt;br /&gt;YES</li>

            <li> Came securely packaged.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really fit the mannequin head that is was reffered with.</li>
            <li> Great stand - very functional and steady.</li>
            <li> It opens up to fit most surface pretty well</li>

            <li> fast shipping and accurate product description.</li>
            <li> It seems it&#x27;s only being sold now with a doll, but I got it on its own.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price which is why I brought 2, 1 for at home and 1 for the road.  </li>
            <li> This item is capers useful for those in the cosmetology business.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle at the time to return it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Economical so its a plus.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit Lexi or any other head we own or the school owns.</li>
            <li> IT CAME RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t get it to work right.</li>
            <li> Maybe i don&#x27;t have the right piece of furniture</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product the top completely broke off.</li>
            <li> This holder is a pretty good product for the price and it does what it&#x27;s expected to do by keeping the manikin&#x27;s head sturdy on it.</li>

            <li> Sturdy &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s for exactly what it&#x27;s to be used for.</li>
            <li> Fits most wig heads, but some wig heads have larger holes.  </li>
            <li> Mine broke after a few weeksüò© but it was really good.</li>
            <li> In the process of preparing to opening up my own shop, Awsome product will share with other student cosmotologist while in school because the school doesnt provide for home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clamp on the bottom is secure once tightened; little boat steering wheel thing to be able to move the stick mount is VERY secure.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Cheap and plastically, can brake easily just combing hair, don&#x27;t waste your money on this there are better ones out their for the same cost!</li>
            <li> The holder is made of plastic, so it doesn&#x27;t grip very well on table surfaces.</li>
            <li> The molding isn&#x27;t straight.</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t hold my mannequin straight up.</li>
            <li> This makes wig styling on your mannequin head much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really kno how it broke.</li>
            <li> Very efficient.</li>
            <li> The clamp does not hold very well, it comes unhooked very easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The price for this product is reasonable.</li>
            <li> This holder made styling my units sooo much easier.</li>
            <li> This fits my mannequin very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I dont have much to say about this..</li>
            <li> Item is as described and was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of wigs and this stand really came in hand...</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> My wife is a cosmetologist and she absolutely loves the manikin holder.</li>
            <li> The clamp doesn&#x27;t open far enough to fit on our counters, will have to get creative to make it work.</li>
            <li> I did have to go on youtube to search for a video that showed how one is put together though haha.</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I do recomend the product to any one who wants to practice cuting hair or like to do hair doos</li>
            <li> For the 6 or 7 dollars, this really exceeds my expectation.</li>
            <li> It is much studier than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it yet</li>
            <li> It holds up very well</li>
            <li> Very sturdy also...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It should hold any mannequin head nicely and firmly.</li>
            <li> I mean the swivel is good sometimes, but there are times when you need the mannequin to just stay still.</li>
            <li> It was extremely helpful and I love the style and position availability.</li>
            <li> She has had it for exactly 7 days so far and</li>
            <li> Not realizing that the size is too small for any of the manikin heads we own.</li>
            <li> Fine for the money but head is loose on the pole.  </li>
            <li> The top half (which holds the mannequin) has a screw which allows it to tilt in any direction.</li>
            <li> I guess there is not much used for this item since the doll head had to be tossed as it tangled very quickly</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase, less headache now</li>
            <li> My one main problem is that my package came in a beat up looking box.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly to hold foam wig heads but have also used it with display mannequins.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to be able to attach this to several workspaces so I can practice in different places.</li>
            <li> Works for what I need but not as strong plastic as I expected</li>
            <li> This item is made of plastic, I would recommend buying one that was a little more durable.  </li>
            <li> Again, no need to over tighten as the rod has a ball with little dimples for gripping.</li>
            <li> I may just buy a few more to keep in stock just in case....</li>
            <li> A TABLE TOP FIRMLY SO</li>
            <li> It is not hard to use.</li>
            <li> When tried to use it the top half broke completely off.</li>
            <li> I got the top part together fine, but now can&#x27;t get the lower half that it should stand on together because of the long screw and the turning knob (because it&#x27;s not flat ), which is on the bottom, won&#x27;t allow the thing to stand up.</li>
            <li> Sometimes she likes to create a new hairstyle just before she goes to bed.</li>
            <li> ; Cheap, Flimsy, doesn&#x27;t stay wish I had bought a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I fixed this with a little bit of padding to make it fit a little more snug and it works for me.</li>
            <li> However it broke on me within 30 mins of the first use because it is entirely plastic.</li>
            <li> and it feels cheap like it will not last long.</li>
            <li> For example, the screw seems way too long to fit properly.</li>
            <li> It is certainly sturdy and a ten year old can work it...since she did after I showed her once.</li>
            <li> and when I tighten the bottom it broke clear off</li>
            <li> This holder is made completely from plastic.</li>
            <li> but it does not fit the Lexi Manikin head securely or even snuggly.  </li>
            <li> Welp I can tell you what I want, I want a handle on the support screw like the handle that&#x27;s used to direct the Manikin head.</li>
            <li> a complete waist of money</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast, I received it next day.</li>
            <li> The old one I had was snug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not kept on the table, because the soft plastic and rubber mount like plastmas too.</li>
            <li> im not sure why so many people said this wasnt durable, but it actually is.</li>
            <li> This was high quality for the low price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tightening the clamp down to a table was a bit of a chore as the threaded shaft didnt free spin, and it took a lot of turns to get it open enough to put on my table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now most of the furniture in my home is very thick (besides the dinner table</li>
            <li> no regrets</li>
            <li> It fixes very well to the table but the hole in the bottom of the Manikin head is too wide for the part that it sits on.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old purple foam wig head stand with similar construction because I couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> It also does a poor job gripping the table-</li>
            <li> It secures very tightly on any table top, shelf, chair, etc and the neck part adjusts so you can tilt the head down or to the side</li>
            <li> I was finally able to coax the thing onto a book case shelf that was thin enough, but as soon as I started messing with the Manikin head, it promptly fell off.</li>
            <li> Worth the small investment.</li>
            <li> My kids broke this one in less than a day, but the customer service and return process was very efficient.</li>
            <li> Mannequinn heads simply aren&#x27;t that heavy - even with large wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that it would only work on flat panel surfaces, I couldn&#x27;t even use it on the kitchen countertop.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time providing you don&#x27;t over tighten anything.</li>
            <li> I just clamp it anywhere that has a flat surface where I can sit and sew</li>
            <li> And it could not clamp onto a single table or counter in my entire house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to wait and see how long it lasts, it is plastic, screw is metal.</li>
            <li> I had to put my project on hold for designing a cosplay helmet thanks to the slow shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely had better stands for my practice heads- this one is stiff, difficult to adjust position, and rather flimsy.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to style and dry my wigs after washing.</li>
            <li> The foam wig head is loose and not snug.</li>
            <li> The C-clamp is bent slightly inward, so the screw plate is not flat with the surface.</li>
            <li> It did not hold tight enough and as I practiced</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fully unscrewed the mouth is 1-1/4\\&quot; wide.</li>
            <li> AS EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> Received my item in a timely manner, sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> but it is what I expected.</li>
            <li> I do not see the use of it definitely came with a missing piece üòë</li>
            <li> It looks plenty wide in the picture, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> As you tighten the C-clamp it expands a little and the screw plate will sit flat to the surface.</li>
            <li> The part to mount the head on is a little long for the head</li>
            <li> it clamps things to other things...</li>
            <li> Seriously, the clamp did not go wide enough.</li>
            <li> A little complicated to handle, but it was the first one I bought, and I have figured it out</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slide all the way down</li>
            <li> Its sterdy, you can move it around or up &amp; down.  </li>
            <li> Extremely reliable for the money!</li>
            <li> I thought this came built and ready to go, but no it was with tiny loose parts in a baggy and it didn&#x27;t even come with the metal stand :(</li>
            <li> Part of the adapter broke easily :-(</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it was a recommended companion piece and doesn&#x27;t hold the head securely while working with the hair.</li>
            <li> no matter how tight I screw it one it touches table it just spins.</li>
            <li> It works well and holds the mannequin tightly.  </li>
            <li> It worked for a few days and then snapped in half.</li>
            <li> clamped to the little table beside her bed to hold her hair manniken that she plays with every day.  </li>
            <li> not familiar with this product</li>
            <li> This little tool is so helpful when styling a wig.</li>
            <li> Saves the trouble of holding.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Broke on the second day poor quality</li>
            <li> Does not hold the head firm in place.</li>
            <li> I purchased the &amp;#34;Celebrity Lexi Cosmetology Protein Fiber Cutting Manikin, 26-28inch&amp;#34; and this holder does not fit the head very well.</li>
            <li> Super glue didn&#x27;t hold it. :-(</li>
            <li> I had that clamp wrenched tight too, I thought!</li>
            <li> This is too small to hold the mannequin head that it was bought to hold.</li>
            <li> When one has to a lot of reps to turn  &amp; tighen, one doesn&#x27;t want to use 2 fingers only; it makes the reps slower and take longer and to mention its uncomfortable on the fingers.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way too small.</li>
            <li> Usually I just wrap scrap fabric around it and it seems to work ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This base helps get the head placed in the right</li>
            <li> However, if you pull too hard on it, the holder is bound to slip off.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again it really hard to use</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t attempted to use it yet , but it look somewhat confusing to use.</li>
            <li> was painfully slow.</li>
            <li> Item broken during shipping.</li>
            <li> Bad news: it was a waste of $$ for me.</li>
            <li> Just cause I&#x27;m not sure if I broke it or if it was bad quality</li>
            <li> Styling a wig is difficult when it&#x27;s mounted on a manikin head that&#x27;s just sitting on a table or counter.</li>
            <li> This is a must if you bought a Celebrity Cosmetology Protein Fiber Hair Cutting Manikin.</li>
            <li> When I bought a clamp from another store it came cracked and was very difficult to adjust.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not going to do hair there :{  )  </li>
            <li> and there was no redemption. :(</li>
            <li> disappointed</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I trusted to buy this in a selling package and it was so misleading.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it 1 star, but feel bad saying I &#x27;hate&#x27; it.</li>
            <li> Stupid thing never stays on my table</li>
            <li> I hate to complain since it was so reasonbly priced.&lt;br /&gt;Update.</li>
            <li> The base swivels around so after you place the manikin head on it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I hate it</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works just as I need it to. easy to put together and use.</li>
            <li> This is really great to have</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to style and dry my wigs after washing. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this one.</li>
            <li> After one use, the plastic piece that rotates broke. But, I superglued it and it seems to work fine now. I hate to complain since it was so reasonbly priced.&lt;br /&gt;Update. Super glue didn&#x27;t hold it. :-(</li>
            <li> Makes styling wigs way easier!</li>
            <li> Great product. Convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Has so as I tried to tighten it broke</li>
            <li> I got the item and soon as I place the mannequin head on the stand  and when I tighten the bottom it broke clear off</li>
            <li> This broke literally about 5 minutes after we got it. Still trying to figure out if I can somehow glue it back together but I know it won&#x27;t swivel anymore. Cheap plastic. Bummed.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for the head</li>
            <li> Works well, is sturdy and great price</li>
            <li> does the job and fits the mannikin perfectly</li>
            <li> this is an overall perfect product and i have no complaints , bought it for my wife together with a manikin for her hair dressing class,i have  no regrets</li>
            <li> The holder is made of plastic, so it doesn&#x27;t grip very well on table surfaces. If you try to tighten it up some, it just keeps skidding. It holds the mannequin well though and gives a full rotation which is nice. However, if you pull too hard on it, the holder is bound to slip off. If the holder were made of metal, then you&#x27;ll get a vice-like grip.</li>
            <li> This item is made of plastic, I would recommend buying one that was a little more durable.  My kids broke this one in less than a day, but the customer service and return process was very efficient.</li>
            <li> I wash and style wigs on the side - I need a product that will hold up and get the job done. When I bought a clamp from another store it came cracked and was very difficult to adjust. This one is great! gets the job done and holds the head in place. It&#x27;s easy to adjust and take on and off the table.</li>
            <li> Clamps well onto things</li>
            <li> This is too small to hold the mannequin head that it was bought to hold.</li>
            <li> Well, This item came very quickly, and in good condition. It seems it&#x27;s only being sold now with a doll, but I got it on its own.  It&#x27;s not bad for the price, and for what it does.  It&#x27;s not bad &#x3D;) [[ASIN:B002ZNJI58 Celebrity Bridgette Budget Cosmetology Human Hair Manikin with Holder]]</li>
            <li> It may be cheap, but it gets the job done. I purchased this for my Arkansas Esthetician&#x27;s Practical Exam in October, and it held up just fine! It&#x27;s your standard c-clamp design...very simple construction. This requires a whopping 2 minutes of assembly, and works like a charm. Extremely reliable for the money!</li>
            <li> The molding isn&#x27;t straight. So it doesn&#x27;t hold my mannequin straight up. But, for the price, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Stupid thing never stays on my table no matter how tight I screw it one it touches table it just spins.</li>
            <li> works perfect for canvas wig head</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need it to do, and for a great price. Now I can style my wigs without holding the foam head between my legs.</li>
            <li> This holds a head well, with an adjustable angle. It didn&#x27;t fit perfectly into the head I have (Bridgette), but perhaps it isnt supposed to? The head is finest chinesium, so it might not be the highest quality anyway.  Its not a big enough problem that it is going to slip off. I am using the head for a photography target. This base helps get the head placed in the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tightening the clamp down to a table was a bit of a chore as the threaded shaft didnt free spin, and it took a lot of turns to get it open enough to put on my table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RAD</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price. The top half (which holds the mannequin) has a screw which allows it to tilt in any direction. You can then re-tighten the screw and it will hold in that position. Nice product.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product the top completely broke off.</li>
            <li> This holder is made completely from plastic. Except for the screw, a metal holding plate beneath the rod, and the rubber boot. For the cheaper cost, I find it more attractive than the standard clamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fully unscrewed the mouth is 1-1/4\\&quot; wide. The C-clamp is bent slightly inward, so the screw plate is not flat with the surface. As you tighten the C-clamp it expands a little and the screw plate will sit flat to the surface. At that point stop tightning as you will further distend the C-clamp and possibly damage the plastic threads. Repeated over distending could damage the C-clamp over time. About three or four turns after surface contact is all you need. This makes wig styling on your mannequin head much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The locking ring for the rod resembles a ship&#x27;s Tiller wheel. It appears to give a 40 degree slant in any direction. Rotate the wheel counter-clockwise to loosen and clockwise to tighten. Again, no need to over tighten as the rod has a ball with little dimples for gripping. Over tightning can wear them off. Mannequinn heads simply aren&#x27;t that heavy - even with large wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should hold any mannequin head nicely and firmly. It will last a long time providing you don&#x27;t over tighten anything.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold on to surface good, my mannequin was very lose on the stick.</li>
            <li> Mine broke after a few weeksüò© but it was really good. I don&#x27;t really kno how it broke. 3.5 stars. Just cause I&#x27;m not sure if I broke it or if it was bad quality</li>
            <li> My 7 y.o.ganddaughter keeps this clamped to the little table beside her bed to hold her hair manniken that she plays with every day.  Sometimes she likes to create a new hairstyle just before she goes to bed.</li>
            <li> So when this item arrived and I felt how lightweight it was I thought \\&quot;Oh boy this is going to break in about a week\\&quot;  but I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.  It&#x27;s lightweight yet durable and it does exactly what its supposed to do.  Now most of the furniture in my home is very thick (besides the dinner table and I&#x27;m not going to do hair there :{  )  so I got creative and decided to attach it to the ironing board lol (it sounds ghetto I know, but hey do what you can with what you have)  and it works perfectly.  I use it to hold the mannequin head while the hair is drying, I am able to color, cut, and style the hair without any issues.  It&#x27;s well worth the price which is why I brought 2, 1 for at home and 1 for the road.  I may just buy a few more to keep in stock just in case....</li>
            <li> Works great, but not for all surfaces</li>
            <li> I guess there is not much used for this item since the doll head had to be tossed as it tangled very quickly and there was no redemption. :(</li>
            <li> Already Broke. Didn&#x27;t even have for 24 hours</li>
            <li> Fine for the money but head is loose on the pole.  Use your own opinion when deciding to purchase.  Grade b</li>
            <li> Serves it purpose.  Great hold.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made ! Sally&#x27;s has better more sturdy stand</li>
            <li> I purchased the &amp;#34;Celebrity Lexi Cosmetology Protein Fiber Cutting Manikin, 26-28inch&amp;#34; and this holder does not fit the head very well. It is still usable and I like it, I will continue to use it. It fixes very well to the table but the hole in the bottom of the Manikin head is too wide for the part that it sits on. I fixed this with a little bit of padding to make it fit a little more snug and it works for me. It works for what it is made for and you get what you pay for. I like this product and it was a good thing that when I ordered the manikin head it prompted me to buy the holder also. I hadn&#x27;t even thought of it! Very efficient.</li>
            <li> Doesnt hold the mannequinne head very good but Its defenitly better than nothing thats all I have to say !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely had better stands for my practice heads- this one is stiff, difficult to adjust position, and rather flimsy. It also does a poor job gripping the table- I&#x27;ve accidentally yanked it off the edge multiple times. That being said, it does serve its purpose, I would have just preferred to have something sturdier.</li>
            <li> she doesnt use it since i bought stand so she doesnt have to connect it to a table like this one</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind, folks, that this does not stand on it&#x27;s own and needs a table of some sort.</li>
            <li> This product worked well and has held up the product so that my daughter could practice her hair without worry.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> The clamp does not hold very well, it comes unhooked very easy.&lt;br /&gt;I had to get a different one.</li>
            <li> This is a must if you bought a Celebrity Cosmetology Protein Fiber Hair Cutting Manikin. My daughter uses it to practice braiding. This holder lets her use the coffee table or the foot board of her bed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold up well. Not sturdy enough to even brush out a weave.</li>
            <li> The item arrived in great condition and fast.  This item is capers useful for those in the cosmetology business.  This is a great item and the price was amazing</li>
            <li> It would be better if the height could also be adjustable</li>
            <li> I got the manikin holder to support the Lexi Manikin and it does a perfect job keeping the manikin in place.  thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product! It allows me to put my wigs on a stand and sit and style it. Saves a lot time and takes the strain off my feet so I don&#x27;t have to stand.</li>
            <li> Styling a wig is difficult when it&#x27;s mounted on a manikin head that&#x27;s just sitting on a table or counter. This clamp is very reasonably priced and very easy to use. It holds the wig head securely and makes styling much easier.</li>
            <li> This manikin holder holds my manikin well. You can take off the top and put another one. Well I don&#x27;t know. You can take the top off and you can buy another top. But I gust you can put another top on. Like I said ( I don&#x27;t know ).</li>
            <li> This piece helps a lot. You can hook it on anything while styling your manikan head. Very easy to use and didn&#x27;t cost a lot.</li>
            <li> The price for this product is reasonable. My one main problem is that my package came in a beat up looking box. And the product it self looked used and worn. I wouldn&#x27;t have mind this if I knew I was purchasing a used product but that was not the case. I don&#x27;t plan on purchasing anything else from this user.</li>
            <li> Not needed since I have the tripod.  Will be returning.</li>
            <li> The clamp appears well made but it does not fit the Lexi Manikin head securely or even snuggly.  Disappointed that it was a recommended companion piece and doesn&#x27;t hold the head securely while working with the hair.</li>
            <li> This works great for the manikin head.  We clamp it on the side of the coffee table, or end table, or even her desk.</li>
            <li> Did what it was supposed to do at a good price.</li>
            <li> I guess this is as described. I actually do not like the rotation part of the stand and it is not stable and I find myself removing the Manikin head from the stand and placing between my two legs to hold for it to be still while I sew a wig.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase, less headache now when I do my wigs.  I Even timing has been shorter for me because of how good it does the job it was intended for...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. Was just what I was looking for. Very light weight but sturdy. Good price and works Great!</li>
            <li> not expensive at all, and seems like it will be quite durable. i would definitely recommend this to a friend who needs to wash or style a wig.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used one of these and I love it. It holds the manikin head securely and is easy to adjust. I attached the holder to a snack table without a problem. The &#x27;wheel&#x27; in the middle tightens and loosens the holder so you can angled the  manikin head where you want it. This holder made styling my units sooo much easier. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I should have purchased this when I got the maniquin head, but I thought it came with it. Anyway it works perfectly and my daughter can now practice different styles.</li>
            <li> Excellent ! Looks exactly like picture and description. It is not hard to use.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE AND WORKS AS EXPECTED. NO COMPLAINTS. I RECOMMEND IT WOULD PURCHASE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN&lt;br /&gt;5 STARS RATING FROM ME</li>
            <li> This was high quality for the low price.  It works well and holds the mannequin tightly.  Worth the small investment.</li>
            <li> Excellent material!! I recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> Great product. Fits the description. I use it to hold wigs in place when styling them and it holds them securely. Recommended if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for too.</li>
            <li> Received my item in a timely manner, sooner than expected.  not familiar with this product but I also bought a mannequin head so I figure I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t attempted to use it yet , but it look somewhat confusing to use.</li>
            <li> I guess &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; Cheap, Flimsy, doesn&#x27;t stay wish I had bought a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Saves the trouble of holding.  I love it.  Easy to use and put together.  Use on corner table etc.  Buy it</li>
            <li> Great price, does what it&#x27;s supposed to doüëç</li>
            <li> Great stand for great price!</li>
            <li> this holder was perfect! did just what it said it would do which is hold a manikin head. The base swivels around so after you place the manikin head on it you can manuver it around. it is lovely and a great price!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my friend who loves it.  She says it holds her wig perfectly while she is styling it.  It made me feel good to be able to give something so appreciated.</li>
            <li> My daughter needed this for her manikin and it works perfectly! I recommend this product to anyone 100%! It is very sturdy for this use!</li>
            <li> This was inexpensive, and it gets the job done! Why spend more, if you don&#x27;t have to?</li>
            <li> This is a very handy device. I use it mainly to hold foam wig heads but have also used it with display mannequins. It functions exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I received this item without the post that is needed to put the manni head on. Couldn&#x27;t use it at all. Wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle at the time to return it. ( worried about my sate boards instead! ) Bad news: it was a waste of $$ for me. Good news: I passed my state boards!!</li>
            <li> This fits my mannequin very well. It stays in place too. I think it&#x27;s called a clamp or something but it is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend state board test and work great and she pass</li>
            <li> I got this so that I could shape a head piece for my jedi costume for Comic Con NYC 2013. I didn&#x27;t finish the costume, but this holder was perfect to keep the head in place and out of the way.</li>
            <li> Welp I can tell you what I want, I want a handle on the support screw like the handle that&#x27;s used to direct the Manikin head. When one has to a lot of reps to turn  &amp; tighen, one doesn&#x27;t want to use 2 fingers only; it makes the reps slower and take longer and to mention its uncomfortable on the fingers. I wouldn&#x27;t be complaining if I could leave the holder in place, but I have to move it and put it back, move it and put it back, move it and put it back....get the point. All in all, its a holder, whatdayah want? I&#x27;ll have to wait and see how long it lasts, it is plastic, screw is metal. It works for now.</li>
            <li> delivery was very fast. the product is perfect for my manikin head . its fit perfect and is exactly as it was in the description box</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!! Very happy I purchased from your company. Thanks</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Manikin head :)</li>
            <li> I love it i been making wigs since i got it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> this product is a must have if you order a maniquine head&lt;br /&gt;it fits great on all most all styling stations</li>
            <li> This manikin holder is of good quality and will also pivot if need be.  I was concerned about it fitting the manikin head and it works great.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose.  I wish there was a way to lock it in place.  I mean the swivel is good sometimes, but there are times when you need the mannequin to just stay still.</li>
            <li> I dont have much to say about this.. it clamps things to other things... so it does its job. it took me a while to figure out how it worked though...</li>
            <li> Great stand - very functional and steady.</li>
            <li> It tips and turns. You can tighten it into any position.  I thought the suction cup one might be the way to go but then you would have to find something to suction it to!&lt;br /&gt;This works great!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and came very quickly.</li>
            <li> IT CAME RIGHT AWAY AND NOW I CAN DO HAIR WITH EASE!!!! I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE</li>
            <li> Good product for the price, does exactly what I need it to do. At such a good price I would get more than one, which is what I did!</li>
            <li> Bought to go with mannequin head for grandaughter. This attached well to our wooden tv tray so she could be in the living room doing her hair. It is certainly sturdy and a ten year old can work it...since she did after I showed her once. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> You must have these to hold your manikin head to a table or your salon work area. It holds the manikin in place so you can work on your hair styles.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not standard size</li>
            <li> Item is as described and was reasonably priced.  Her hair has been styled and washed many times and is still as good as new. I recommend this product and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great Item for cosmotology head.  Instead of holding the head between your knees, it holds the head in place while you apply makeup and style different hair dos.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, works great</li>
            <li> Difficult to hold on a table still trying to find the ideal place to attach it to so as to get a perfect reach seated</li>
            <li> Good Deal works great</li>
            <li> Got this when we bought the real human hair head and it has been indispensable!  What a great deal too!</li>
            <li> I had been needing one of these for a while, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot.  This is perfect.  It came in pieces with no instructions, but looking at the picture it was easy to tell how everything fit together.  I could tell by the excess plastic on the parts why this was so inexpensive, but it&#x27;s working great for me.  The piece that fits inside the dummy head can be tilted, too!  I love this and will be getting a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I don&#x27;t use often , but when I do style or create my wigs this has really come in handy</li>
            <li> This item is very easy to put together. It takes two seconds. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed to hold my Styrofoam wig head in place. Great price too</li>
            <li> for the price, its really good.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this 3 stars is that it has a short bracket to adjust to the tables. I find that it would only work on flat panel surfaces, I couldn&#x27;t even use it on the kitchen countertop. I was hoping to be able to attach this to several workspaces so I can practice in different places.</li>
            <li> My Daughter said this is the best stand for the money.</li>
            <li> My daughter really enjoyed this gift and it works great with the manikin doll we also got her for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of wigs and this stand really came in hand...i will purchase many more in the future</li>
            <li> What to say:  It holds, anchors, and bends well</li>
            <li> Works great with the mannequin training head.  Received promptly &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> use in crafting to hold styrofoam head while glamming hats and headbands.  works great</li>
            <li> Works very well. Quite sturdy.</li>
            <li> Great tool!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to use on my very first wig making experience, and it turned up to be a great help. Made all the process easy. Will recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife is a cosmetologist and she absolutely loves the manikin holder. She needed it fro her state board test and it worked like a charm. My advice is do not be nervous about the price because the quality is definitely acceptable fro you need it for!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again it really hard to use</li>
            <li> This was just what I needed for a great price. Fits my wig head perfectly and attaches perfectly to my counter.</li>
            <li> Nice product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good value for the price.  The clamp doesn&#x27;t open far enough to fit on our counters, will have to get creative to make it work.</li>
            <li> a complete waist of money</li>
            <li> Good for what I need it for.</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet but just out of the package, it is smaller than it looks online and it feels cheap like it will not last long.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is learning to do hair. She has had it for exactly 7 days so far and her it holds the manikin head perfectly.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed at a great price!</li>
            <li> Works just fine- looks exactly like the photo. I did have to go on youtube to search for a video that showed how one is put together though haha. But after that- everything is fine. Holds my mannequin head in place.</li>
            <li> I bought it because my state board was coming soon and I wanted to be on the safe side thank God I practiced with this and realized that it wasn&#x27;t going to work. It did not hold tight enough and as I practiced it kept moving until it finally fell off the counter. Its good enough when you have nothing else. I ended up using the only one that I got with my kit a year ago that ended up getting stuck at the state board test but did not move or fall during my practical test..and I passed by the way:)</li>
            <li> This product is sturdy. Gives you a swivel option. It secure without damaging your furniture. It has been a life saver when making custom wigs. Shipping was extremely fast, I received it next day.</li>
            <li> I thought this came built and ready to go, but no it was with tiny loose parts in a baggy and it didn&#x27;t even come with the metal stand :( I knew it was too good to be so cheap ;(</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit on my table that has a lip underneath.</li>
            <li> This works well with a variety of manikin heads.  I love that it swivels easily allowing for numerous angled shots when taking pictures of our hair bow creations.</li>
            <li> It was delivered before the date I was given. Just made my day!  Works perfectly</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping. I can wait to start my project</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Best invention I&#x27;ve seen.  I can curl and style all my human hair wigs using this device.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Great product as describe</li>
            <li> fast shipping and accurate product description.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old purple foam wig head stand with similar construction because I couldn&#x27;t find it. While I give this three stars for the rigid construction, I took some stars away for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 star: Doesn&#x27;t fit the standard foam wig head comfortably. The foam wig head is loose and not snug. The old one I had was snug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 star: I purchased this from seller beauty cart and I purchased this as a prime member and shipping was painfully slow. With prime I expect stuff to be delivered within 2 days or so. I got this after a week. I had to put my project on hold for designing a cosplay helmet thanks to the slow shipping.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price</li>
            <li> I had bought this to fit the Celebrity Lexi but it&#x27;s way too small. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I can style my units with no problem! I love this. It fits easily and snug on my table. Well worth the price. If you style your units, this is a must have!</li>
            <li> My daughter is taking cosmo in school and needed something to hold up her manikin head, this works perfect !&lt;br /&gt;And at a great price !</li>
            <li> This holder is a pretty good product for the price and it does what it&#x27;s expected to do by keeping the manikin&#x27;s head sturdy on it.</li>
            <li> Great work item arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;It fits my manikin like a glove!&lt;br /&gt;No complaints!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a happy customer!&lt;br /&gt;Great option! :)</li>
            <li> It seems that I have received defective. This is not kept on the table, because the soft plastic and rubber mount like plastmas too. Do not buy. You will not save just throw out your money.</li>
            <li> If you wan&#x27;t a mannequin stand for state boards, don&#x27;t bring this one, this doesn&#x27;t have any means of adjusting the height. Thankfully the testers provided me w/ one that does. But yes, if you don&#x27;t want to spend much money this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It is the first one that I have purchased. I think for the price it is well put together and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Will hold the head very nicely. A little complicated to handle, but it was the first one I bought, and I have figured it out</li>
            <li> I really liked the product. They help me practice the hair does that I like to do. I do recomend the product to any one who wants to practice cuting hair or like to do hair doos</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on table very good. Part of the adapter broke easily :-( disappointed</li>
            <li> im not sure why so many people said this wasnt durable, but it actually is. It secures very tightly on any table top, shelf, chair, etc and the neck part adjusts so you can tilt the head down or to the side or however youd like and you can tighten it in whatever position you put it. For the 6 or 7 dollars, this really exceeds my expectation. I would really recommend this product, its a great buy.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a Christmas gift. She was very happy to receive and was using while learning how to braid the hair mannequin.</li>
            <li> Good product was as described bought for daughter to practice on and she loves it. She is able to practice lots of styles</li>
            <li> I brought this to go with the Mannequin Manikin Training Head, purchase for my 9 year and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to go with our cosmetology mannequin Manikin training head with human hair. It works great and easily attaches to the counter or table.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as pictured. Fits perfectly attached to my counter&#x27;s edge. It is much studier than I anticipated. Will purchase more as needed.</li>
            <li> Helpful to maintain the head</li>
            <li> This is a must have if you purchase the mannequin head!!!</li>
            <li> Just a clamp. It holds the mannequin head in place like it is supposed to. Head stays put fairly well.</li>
            <li> HOLDS DOLL IN PLACE FOR PRACTICE</li>
            <li> Works well with the Manikin</li>
            <li> Its works fine for me and it doesn&#x27;t seems cheap and I put this on a tv tray and it works fine for wig making.&lt;br /&gt;YES I WOULD RECOMMEND AND THE PRICE IS GOOD!!</li>
            <li> I received this item in the mail today and i literally cannot wait to use it! I&#x27;m starting to make wigs for the fun of it and this stand is perfect. It does come disassembled but its just screwing the pieces together. no big deal ! cannot wait to use it!</li>
            <li> Great for travel or to have an extra around the shop!  I may order a couple more just to have around.</li>
            <li> It worked for a few days and then snapped in half.</li>
            <li> Definetly get this manikin holder for your manikin. Holding it between your knees or your feet on the floor doesnt work out well at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. Not realizing that the size is too small for any of the manikin heads we own. I even bought this because it was a suggested seal on Amazon.com with Lexi head. It doesn&#x27;t fit Lexi or any other head we own or the school owns. What a waist of money.  Disappointed that I trusted to buy this in a selling package and it was so misleading. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come assembled or with instructions, unfortunately, however I was able to figure out how to assemble it and it is very good quality! I can&#x27;t wait to put it to use. I hope it as sturdy as it feels!</li>
            <li> Purchased for daughter mannequin head. Attaches to our bar well and she is able to style hair and rotate the mannequin head with ease. I recommend purchase!</li>
            <li> Where are the instructions on setting this thing up? It comes not assembled, and there is just a picture on the front of the bag, which is not a lot of help. I tried to figure it out on my own, but the parts that came with it don&#x27;t seem to be the right parts. For example, the screw seems way too long to fit properly. I got the top part together fine, but now can&#x27;t get the lower half that it should stand on together because of the long screw and the turning knob (because it&#x27;s not flat ), which is on the bottom, won&#x27;t allow the thing to stand up. I can&#x27;t stand stuff like this, why couldn&#x27;t it just come already assembled in a bigger bag geez.  Would that kill them to do that? I go to use the thing last night, and couldn&#x27;t, what a let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The company says that it will refund me for this item. I still can&#x27;t get it to work right.</li>
            <li> sturdy holder for manikin</li>
            <li> The holder does a fine job of holding the wig head in place.  I have several and I like this tool to help with styling.  Works great and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Hubby is glad to have his C-ring clamps back.</li>
            <li> It works well and at an affordable price. It stays in place and is great for style practice. It clamps into place almost anywhere.</li>
            <li> good quality... i totally love it. Its been 2 1/2 years and its still good</li>
            <li> Maybe i don&#x27;t have the right piece of furniture but I find that this doesn&#x27;t grip well</li>
            <li> Holds perfectly even when unknotting my wig!</li>
            <li> Broke on the second day poor quality</li>
            <li> It does the job&lt;br /&gt;holds the head so she can practice doing hair. No biggie&lt;br /&gt;I am ok with it</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose of clamping the manikin head to all our table tops.  It is my first product of its kind.</li>
            <li> In the process of preparing to opening up my own shop, Awsome product will share with other student cosmotologist while in school because the school doesnt provide for home.</li>
            <li> Just received it. Haven&#x27;t really used it yet but it seems like it&#x27;s in great shape! I would recommend this to anyone who need a holder.</li>
            <li> this product is cool...I use it when sitting and watching tv eating (lol) I just clamp it anywhere that has a flat surface where I can sit and sew</li>
            <li> I loved this product because it kept my doll head in place while I worked on it.....</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this for her manikin head.  It holds up very well and she is learning how to do hair.</li>
            <li> It was extremely helpful and I love the style and position availability. However it broke on me within 30 mins of the first use because it is entirely plastic.</li>
            <li> I do not see the use of it definitely came with a missing piece üòë</li>
            <li> Does not hold the head firm in place.</li>
            <li> it holds up head to do hair style. i would recommmend this if you are trying to learn to do hair doos</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but works great. Would recommend to buy. Holds my styrofoam head in place perfect to blow dry and style my wig.</li>
            <li> Well made! Sturdy &amp; fast shipping! Will definitely purchase from this company again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> This is a must have if you buy a mannequin head. It helps to hold the head in place while styling.</li>
            <li> This is nothing fancy it&#x27;s for exactly what it&#x27;s to be used for. I love it it did the job and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> it is so lightweight but works sooo good ‚ù§Ô∏è i recommend to anyone &amp; you cant bear the price</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves it.  She is teaching herself how to braid.&lt;br /&gt;Her mom  says she spends lots of quiet hours playing.&lt;br /&gt;This item was actually an add on for the manikin.</li>
            <li> Fits most wig heads, but some wig heads have larger holes.  Usually I just wrap scrap fabric around it and it seems to work ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 starts because like I said some wig heads holes are too big for it.</li>
            <li> Item broken during shipping. When tried to use it the top half broke completely off. Seems like cheaply made which probably explains why it broke the way it did. After this experience probably would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and holds mankind head securely. It opens up to fit most surface pretty well</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Very sturdy also... I currently have two and will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Great for beginners in training for making wigs or anything!!</li>
            <li> Works for what I need but not as strong plastic as I expected</li>
            <li> Cheap and plastically, can brake easily just combing hair, don&#x27;t waste your money on this there are better ones out their for the same cost!</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS GREAT ! GOOD PRICE AND IT HOLDS ONTO A TABLE TOP FIRMLY SO CAN WORK ON WIG - EASY TO PUT UP TOO...</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. I make wigs for my personal use. Economical so its a plus.</li>
            <li> Came securely packaged. Great price. Works as intended. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really fit the mannequin head that is was reffered with. It doesn&#x27;t slide all the way down</li>
            <li> This little tool is so helpful when styling a wig. Its sterdy, you can move it around or up &amp; down.  No need to borrow a human head to style your wigs. Its great! I will totally recommend everyone who wears wigs to add this in their collection of hair products.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it 1 star, but feel bad saying I &#x27;hate&#x27; it. It&#x27;s not that I hate it, it just didn&#x27;t work for what I had. It was offered as an item to purchase along with the Celebrity Manikin head I bought. For one, it appears very cheap. And it could not clamp onto a single table or counter in my entire house. Seriously, the clamp did not go wide enough. It looks plenty wide in the picture, but it&#x27;s not. I was finally able to coax the thing onto a book case shelf that was thin enough, but as soon as I started messing with the Manikin head, it promptly fell off. I had that clamp wrenched tight too, I thought! Hence the two stars. Maybe it&#x27;s my furniture&#x27;s fault? I had no idea I had such fat furniture. But also, the Manikin head just sits on that stick at the top. It did not come with any instructions, so maybe I was being daft. But I even had my husband look at it, and we couldn&#x27;t figure the dang thing out. There was no way to &#x27;lock&#x27; the head in place, or tighten it to the stick. It didn&#x27;t screw in, nothing. I thought maybe those two knobs up there at the top did something, but nope! Can&#x27;t move them. So you quite literally just set the head on the stick. When you start messing with the head&#x27;s hair, it wobbles and becomes unsteady.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it is going to do. The part to mount the head on is a little long for the head I got.&lt;br /&gt;Clamp on the bottom is secure once tightened; little boat steering wheel thing to be able to move the stick mount is VERY secure.&lt;br /&gt;Good product for a good price.</li>
            <li> Mannequin stand was flimsy.Doll head wouldn&#x27;t. Stay on.i wouldn&#x27;t.recommend.</li>
            <li> I received this manikin holder on last week and it works well.  It supports the manikin and is easy to adjust.</li>
