            <li> I was completely shocked as to how much product I received as far as how many ounces in fragrance. It was definitely like Christmas morning for myself when I opened my package. It smells just like cotton candy and is truly a treat worth ordering!</li>
            <li> Love the cotton candy body spray. They stopped selling it at my local Wal-mart. I searched on Amazon and found it. Smells great, long lasting scent. Yummy</li>
            <li> This is sooo delicious! Arrived on time and i really smell like cotton candy</li>

            <li> Great deal for all three.  Happy with scent</li>
            <li> Smells just like spun sugar at the fair! A couple of sprays on my shirt,  hair, neck and wrists and I&#x27;m good to go. I would say the scent lasts a couple of hours. I could smell it on my wrist if I put my nose to it but the general scent had dissipated by then. Lotion is creamy but light and absorbs quickly.  The bodywash is delightfully sweet and lathers well. Thank you vyer much!</li>
