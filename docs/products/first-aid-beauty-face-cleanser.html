            <li>and i liked it</li>

            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the clean wasn&#x27;t that good, and actually kind of oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that has semi frequent breakouts, and this stuff is perfect.</li>

            <li>The scent is quite mild and benign, neither good nor</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much of a scent to it but best of all most of the dirt and blackheads came out of my pores!</li>
            <li>Great when you have a face full of make-up and need to wash it off and have that squeaky clean feeling, no stickiness or greasy feeling afterwards.</li>

            <li>Will add this to my list of favorite beauty products.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is the most soothing thing I have ever put on my face.</li>
            <li>My favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li>Waited 6 months took it out waited another 6 months skin never got better.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This is gentle, has a nice clean smell and does a great job removing all traces of makeup.  </li>
            <li>I use it with my Clarisonic and it removes my makeup nicely and leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite cleanser gentle yet effective and doesn&#x27;t strip&lt;br /&gt;Skin!</li>
            <li>All the First Aid Beauty products I have  ever tried are good, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>I think this is a pretty good cleanser</li>
            <li>The ingredients are pretty good.</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time today and it did a great job getting my pores clean.</li>
            <li>which is awesome because I am prone to horribly dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Great for combination and sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>GREAT for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It also rinses easily, which is a great plus in my opinion because when cleansers do not rinse completely, they tend to leave a muddy layer that inhibits that radiant appeal we all strive for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love that the texture is rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>The price and easy buying from Amazon.com, makes it convenient for me too.</li>
            <li>Easily washes away any make up and doesn&#x27;t have any strong fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle cleanser, yet effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay, nothing special.</li>
            <li>This is a fine cleanser</li>
            <li>this is the most pleasant and only &amp;#34;moisturizing and face wash I used...</li>
            <li>After months of using it, I don&#x27;t get really huge zits anymore.</li>
            <li>This product is so gentle and so effective; it gets rid of the oil from my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this face cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have been free of breakouts and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It lathers up really nice and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, worth the price..</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling smooth, and also gets rid of my makeup, including eye makeup.</li>
            <li>The is perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Best gentle facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>A dime size amount is more then enough to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>this makes my face clear, clean, soft, and makes a perfect canvas for makeup.</li>
            <li>Goes on so gently, cleanses beautifully and leaves my skin feeling extremely soft!</li>
            <li>Nice, clean refreshing cleanser for someone who have sensitive skin but wants a nice, foamy clean feeling face.</li>
            <li>She loves the way it clears her skin and keeps her face very fresh.  </li>
            <li>I love First Aid Beauty products.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cleaner that was rich and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I thought the cleanser was rich and applied on well.  </li>
            <li>I love this product soo much !</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>It smells clean, but not overpowering or like perfume.</li>
            <li>It did clean my skin well.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and the blotches have dramatically reduced.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash so much.</li>
            <li>I have a almost full bottle, and I&#x27;m  probably never going to use it again.</li>
            <li>I love the whole FAB line.</li>
            <li>Super mild, leaves your face feeling clean without dyes or perfume or overdrying.</li>
            <li>It is mild, moisturizing without leaving me oily, and actually feels good on the skin as you use it.</li>
            <li>The one I received has a mild coconut-like scent to it and lathers up a bit.  </li>
            <li>I also like that although it is rich, it feels light and gentle on my face while I&#x27;m cleaning.  </li>
            <li>My face was very soft and smooth and all acne is gone!</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin that reacts to most cleansers.</li>
            <li>After I give my face a run of water under the shower first, I put some of the soap in my hands and clean my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great experiences with other First Aid Beauty products</li>
            <li>This method of washing has removed over 90% of my foundation, which is really all I ask for in a sulfate free/soap free cleanser, and this soap strikes all the tic marks.</li>
            <li>Their red clay cleanser is amazing, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I had on a face full of makeup and decided to test it out for the first time to see if it takes my make up off.</li>
            <li>5 stars and worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, for this price, worth it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>With a pea-sized amount, it is able to remove makeup and bring my face back to its (almost squeaky) clean state.</li>
            <li>Does nothing special .. already moved on to a different and see better results for me.</li>
            <li>It really leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Easy use , clean well and not dry after used.</li>
            <li>although it&#x27;s not the cheapest option, it&#x27;s CERTAINLY not expensive, and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>recommend this for anyone who wants a gentle cleanser that does its job leaving your face ready to better absorb whatever treatment product you use.</li>
            <li>I love this product for it cleans my skin but does not dry it out!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own merits, this product really has no major flaws.</li>
            <li>The first tube was pick up for me by a girlfriend.</li>
            <li>After the first application I was a convert.</li>
            <li>I first heard about it through @missglamorazzi on Twitter &amp; @TheGridMonster on YouTube.</li>
            <li>Those of you with normal, oily and &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sensitive skin will probably love this.</li>
            <li>I first used it when I got a sample from Sephora and decided to buy a bottle after using up the sample.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy how creamy and soft this feels on my face during application.</li>
            <li>To me this is a big deal because most cleansers I have tried still leave dirt or blackheads on my skin.</li>
            <li>I think this will be my staple facial cleanser forever! :)</li>
            <li>Prescription creams and pills keep my acne (mostly) at bay, but I still struggle with skin redness, especially in the wintertime.  </li>
            <li>I understand that facial  cleansers aren&#x27;t going to magically work overnight, but this doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>It removes all my eye makeup and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I use this as my morning face wash and my skin is so soft, smooth, and even toned since I added it to my routine.</li>
            <li>You get a pretty hefty bottle for twenty bucks.</li>
            <li>Clean, soft and lots of lather.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft yet clean.</li>
            <li>Love this product, especially if you have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t need to apply very much for one use.</li>
            <li>The skin feels clean but not tight or anything.</li>
            <li>will help cure noticeable acne, but for that it&#x27;s important to use a cleanser in general.</li>
            <li>My skin purged at first but really seems to be clearing up and brighter.</li>
            <li>Another reason would be it&#x27;s from First Aid, so I thought it would be very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also worked very well with the First Aid Beauty Dual Repair Face Cream</li>
            <li>I just ordered this facial cleanser on Monday, and it came very quickly with the 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li>It is nice and creamy that lathers slightly.</li>
            <li>I also have rosacea and this does wonders on my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face super soft.</li>
            <li>SUPER GREAT PRICE and amount of product will last a long time as you only need a petite pea sized amount to wash your whole face.</li>
            <li>It is winter where I live right now</li>
            <li>My face has never been sensitive, but using this product really irritated and reddened my skin!!</li>
            <li>a nice little gentle cleanser</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have much sent.</li>
            <li>really concerning that the ne I got is pirated.</li>
            <li>It foams, it&#x27;s gentle and it takes off all of my makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This seems to really be helping.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so refreshed and gently cleaned.</li>
            <li>Product was alright but didn&#x27;t really match the descriptions that others posted.  </li>
            <li>I will preface that I dont really have any skin problems, so I can&#x27;t attest to how this would help breakouts or acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>Gentle but not so gentle that you feel like you didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>i have very oily and acne proned skin and after using this every night for a month, all my breakouts were gone.</li>
            <li>And it removes makeup really well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really, really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser</li>
            <li>, it feels really gentle, do not have perfume (which is a plus for me).</li>
            <li>This has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>This product helped with that, way better than all of the other things I tried (rosewater, argan oil,</li>
            <li>Was glad I found this after the other manufacturer stopped making the one I used for years.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this is the first face cleanser that works really well for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is a little strong, but for the benefits, this product is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is safe for people who have sensitive and dry skin (I have eczema, so</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s generally pretty clear of blemishes.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin likes First Aid Beauty.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is my hands down favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li>I think I have found my new face wash!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars mainly because of the price</li>
            <li>Love this product, really gross with my red areas on my face.</li>
            <li>Rinses off easily and leaves your face feeling clean and not dry or tight.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, trust me</li>
            <li>other thing I really enjoy is that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It also took off most of my mascara except for a little bit.</li>
            <li>I really like the faoming action</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my sensitive skin, but still feels like it is cleaning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t break out my acne prone 34 yr old skin.</li>
            <li>After a recommendation from a friend who does makeup professionally, I got this because I had been having hormonal acne breakouts and wanted something gentle for my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is now normal.</li>
            <li>Background:&lt;br /&gt;I have oily T-zone and normal cheeks.</li>
            <li>and it actually does foam up a bit with the right amount of water.</li>
            <li>This product works great for sensitive skin but may cause random breakouts</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 29 with oily/acne prone skin that is very sensitive and prone to redness and peeling.</li>
            <li>As I have moved on from my teens, my skin has started to change a lot, and I needed a new cleanser because Cetaphil was becoming too harsh.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been this clear in years!</li>
            <li>Just tossed the first tube after 4 solid months of use.</li>
            <li>The great thing about it is that it cleanses deeply without irritating my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>We got a sample of this at our local Sephora when we purchased some other things and my daughter fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I love that this face wash is gentle without scary chemicals in it and compared to a lot of other high end non-drugstore brands, I love the price too.</li>
            <li>so I needed something that wasn&#x27;t going to do anything other than moisturize and clean.</li>
            <li>I have only been using First Aid Beauty Face Cleanser for a couple of weeks, and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>The cleanser does not dry me out (Cetaphil was too harsh for my face) and has cleared up most of my acne.</li>
            <li>Gentle on skin and goes well with other First Air Products</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t see amazing results after one use, but it does its job and doesn&#x27;t irritate or make your acne worse.</li>
            <li>This cleanser lathers well, you only have to use a pea-sized amount to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for nearly all sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product and Origins brand are the ones that work well with my skin type.</li>
            <li>I encourage you to buy this if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>BUT it definitely helps, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and I would recommend for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin (I have oily)</li>
            <li>Face feels soft after rinsing.</li>
            <li>It is the only cleanser I&#x27;ve tried that really removes makeup.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>Those who are sensitive to added fragrances and perfumes will also appreciate that this seems to have no added fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Having tried several of the FAB products it is clear they really understand sensitive skin and this product shows that understanding and commitment</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product does not bother my face.</li>
            <li>It is not pricey and completely dissolved makeup - including stubborn mascara and liner.</li>
            <li>and my face is much less flaky and irritated than it normally is this time of year, and my skin actually looks smooth.</li>
            <li>It is the first face wash I have found that actually does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>effect before you see results and most of the time your left with a red blotchy face waiting for the inflammation to go down</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean without being dried out.</li>
            <li>It also washes clean without much effort, neither overdrying my skin or leaving a residue behind.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a white, soft liquid</li>
            <li>leaves my dry skin soft and not tight.  </li>
            <li>I went on Accutane a few years ago, and it helped a little, but I still break out more than I should for someone who &amp;#34;completed&amp;#34; Accutane.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve used other face washes that are as effective at half the price or less.</li>
            <li>I love when I can buy it on Amazon for a few dollars less than the local stores as well!</li>
            <li>Does not dry skin.</li>
            <li>It does not dry up your skin and even removes a ton of makeup.</li>
            <li>After trying this product for 4 days, the dry skin was completely gone.</li>
            <li>it cleans well without drying or aggravating my dry sensitive</li>

            <li> This cleanser has been amazing.</li>
            <li> Gentle, and effective, and perfect for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> and i liked it</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin, so I am hoping this clears it up nicely.</li>
            <li> I have tried face products that range from $50 to $5, and this product has been the absolute best.</li>
            <li> It foams well and lathers nice on your face and neck.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the clean wasn&#x27;t that good, and actually kind of oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin and acne sufferers (I am one).</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that has semi frequent breakouts, and this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m just bummed that I stopped using a $5 cleanser for this that was more effective.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Washes off any kind of makeup easily (eyeliner, mascara, bb-cream, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> The scent is quite mild and benign, neither good nor</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much of a scent to it but best of all most of the dirt and blackheads came out of my pores!</li>
            <li> Great when you have a face full of make-up and need to wash it off and have that squeaky clean feeling, no stickiness or greasy feeling afterwards.</li>

            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> if you have Amazon Prime, this is the better option if you&#x27;re ordering online.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap.  </li>
            <li> But for me, it was okay.  </li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled with acne for most of my life.</li>
            <li> Will add this to my list of favorite beauty products.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is the most soothing thing I have ever put on my face.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li> Waited 6 months took it out waited another 6 months skin never got better.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> This is gentle, has a nice clean smell and does a great job removing all traces of makeup.  </li>
            <li> I use it with my Clarisonic and it removes my makeup nicely and leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite cleanser gentle yet effective and doesn&#x27;t strip&lt;br /&gt;Skin!</li>
            <li> All the First Aid Beauty products I have  ever tried are good, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty good cleanser</li>
            <li> The ingredients are pretty good.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time today and it did a great job getting my pores clean.</li>
            <li> which is awesome because I am prone to horribly dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Great for combination and sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> GREAT for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It also rinses easily, which is a great plus in my opinion because when cleansers do not rinse completely, they tend to leave a muddy layer that inhibits that radiant appeal we all strive for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love that the texture is rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> The price and easy buying from Amazon.com, makes it convenient for me too.</li>
            <li> Easily washes away any make up and doesn&#x27;t have any strong fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle cleanser, yet effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay, nothing special.</li>
            <li> This is a fine cleanser</li>
            <li> this is the most pleasant and only &amp;#34;moisturizing and face wash I used...</li>
            <li> After months of using it, I don&#x27;t get really huge zits anymore.</li>
            <li> This product is so gentle and so effective; it gets rid of the oil from my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this face cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have been free of breakouts and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It lathers up really nice and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, worth the price..</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling smooth, and also gets rid of my makeup, including eye makeup.</li>
            <li> The is perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Best gentle facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> A dime size amount is more then enough to get a good lather.</li>
            <li> this makes my face clear, clean, soft, and makes a perfect canvas for makeup.</li>
            <li> Goes on so gently, cleanses beautifully and leaves my skin feeling extremely soft!</li>
            <li> Nice, clean refreshing cleanser for someone who have sensitive skin but wants a nice, foamy clean feeling face.</li>
            <li> She loves the way it clears her skin and keeps her face very fresh.  </li>
            <li> I love First Aid Beauty products.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cleaner that was rich and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I thought the cleanser was rich and applied on well.  </li>
            <li> I love this product soo much !</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> It smells clean, but not overpowering or like perfume.</li>
            <li> It did clean my skin well.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and the blotches have dramatically reduced.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash so much.</li>
            <li> I have a almost full bottle, and I&#x27;m  probably never going to use it again.</li>
            <li> I love the whole FAB line.</li>
            <li> Super mild, leaves your face feeling clean without dyes or perfume or overdrying.</li>
            <li> It is mild, moisturizing without leaving me oily, and actually feels good on the skin as you use it.</li>
            <li> The one I received has a mild coconut-like scent to it and lathers up a bit.  </li>
            <li> I also like that although it is rich, it feels light and gentle on my face while I&#x27;m cleaning.  </li>
            <li> My face was very soft and smooth and all acne is gone!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that reacts to most cleansers.</li>
            <li> After I give my face a run of water under the shower first, I put some of the soap in my hands and clean my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great experiences with other First Aid Beauty products</li>
            <li> This method of washing has removed over 90% of my foundation, which is really all I ask for in a sulfate free/soap free cleanser, and this soap strikes all the tic marks.</li>
            <li> Their red clay cleanser is amazing, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I had on a face full of makeup and decided to test it out for the first time to see if it takes my make up off.</li>
            <li> 5 stars and worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, for this price, worth it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> With a pea-sized amount, it is able to remove makeup and bring my face back to its (almost squeaky) clean state.</li>
            <li> Does nothing special .. already moved on to a different and see better results for me.</li>
            <li> It really leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Easy use , clean well and not dry after used.</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s not the cheapest option, it&#x27;s CERTAINLY not expensive, and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> recommend this for anyone who wants a gentle cleanser that does its job leaving your face ready to better absorb whatever treatment product you use.</li>
            <li> I love this product for it cleans my skin but does not dry it out!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own merits, this product really has no major flaws.</li>
            <li> The first tube was pick up for me by a girlfriend.</li>
            <li> After the first application I was a convert.</li>
            <li> I first heard about it through @missglamorazzi on Twitter &amp; @TheGridMonster on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Those of you with normal, oily and &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sensitive skin will probably love this.</li>
            <li> I first used it when I got a sample from Sephora and decided to buy a bottle after using up the sample.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy how creamy and soft this feels on my face during application.</li>
            <li> To me this is a big deal because most cleansers I have tried still leave dirt or blackheads on my skin.</li>
            <li> I think this will be my staple facial cleanser forever! :)</li>
            <li> Prescription creams and pills keep my acne (mostly) at bay, but I still struggle with skin redness, especially in the wintertime.  </li>
            <li> I understand that facial  cleansers aren&#x27;t going to magically work overnight, but this doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> It removes all my eye makeup and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I use this as my morning face wash and my skin is so soft, smooth, and even toned since I added it to my routine.</li>
            <li> You get a pretty hefty bottle for twenty bucks.</li>
            <li> Clean, soft and lots of lather.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft yet clean.</li>
            <li> Love this product, especially if you have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t need to apply very much for one use.</li>
            <li> The skin feels clean but not tight or anything.</li>
            <li> will help cure noticeable acne, but for that it&#x27;s important to use a cleanser in general.</li>
            <li> My skin purged at first but really seems to be clearing up and brighter.</li>
            <li> Another reason would be it&#x27;s from First Aid, so I thought it would be very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also worked very well with the First Aid Beauty Dual Repair Face Cream</li>
            <li> I just ordered this facial cleanser on Monday, and it came very quickly with the 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li> It is nice and creamy that lathers slightly.</li>
            <li> I also have rosacea and this does wonders on my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face super soft.</li>
            <li> SUPER GREAT PRICE and amount of product will last a long time as you only need a petite pea sized amount to wash your whole face.</li>
            <li> It is winter where I live right now</li>
            <li> My face has never been sensitive, but using this product really irritated and reddened my skin!!</li>
            <li> a nice little gentle cleanser</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have much sent.</li>
            <li> really concerning that the ne I got is pirated.</li>
            <li> It foams, it&#x27;s gentle and it takes off all of my makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This seems to really be helping.  </li>
            <li> My face feels so refreshed and gently cleaned.</li>
            <li> Product was alright but didn&#x27;t really match the descriptions that others posted.  </li>
            <li> I will preface that I dont really have any skin problems, so I can&#x27;t attest to how this would help breakouts or acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> Gentle but not so gentle that you feel like you didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> i have very oily and acne proned skin and after using this every night for a month, all my breakouts were gone.</li>
            <li> And it removes makeup really well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really, really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser</li>
            <li> , it feels really gentle, do not have perfume (which is a plus for me).</li>
            <li> This has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> This product helped with that, way better than all of the other things I tried (rosewater, argan oil,</li>
            <li> Was glad I found this after the other manufacturer stopped making the one I used for years.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this is the first face cleanser that works really well for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is a little strong, but for the benefits, this product is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is safe for people who have sensitive and dry skin (I have eczema, so</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s generally pretty clear of blemishes.  </li>
            <li> My sensitive skin likes First Aid Beauty.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is my hands down favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li> I think I have found my new face wash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars mainly because of the price</li>
            <li> Love this product, really gross with my red areas on my face.</li>
            <li> Rinses off easily and leaves your face feeling clean and not dry or tight.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, trust me</li>
            <li> other thing I really enjoy is that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It also took off most of my mascara except for a little bit.</li>
            <li> I really like the faoming action</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my sensitive skin, but still feels like it is cleaning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t break out my acne prone 34 yr old skin.</li>
            <li> After a recommendation from a friend who does makeup professionally, I got this because I had been having hormonal acne breakouts and wanted something gentle for my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is now normal.</li>
            <li> Background:&lt;br /&gt;I have oily T-zone and normal cheeks.</li>
            <li> and it actually does foam up a bit with the right amount of water.</li>
            <li> This product works great for sensitive skin but may cause random breakouts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 with oily/acne prone skin that is very sensitive and prone to redness and peeling.</li>
            <li> As I have moved on from my teens, my skin has started to change a lot, and I needed a new cleanser because Cetaphil was becoming too harsh.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been this clear in years!</li>
            <li> Just tossed the first tube after 4 solid months of use.</li>
            <li> The great thing about it is that it cleanses deeply without irritating my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> We got a sample of this at our local Sephora when we purchased some other things and my daughter fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I love that this face wash is gentle without scary chemicals in it and compared to a lot of other high end non-drugstore brands, I love the price too.</li>
            <li> so I needed something that wasn&#x27;t going to do anything other than moisturize and clean.</li>
            <li> I have only been using First Aid Beauty Face Cleanser for a couple of weeks, and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> The cleanser does not dry me out (Cetaphil was too harsh for my face) and has cleared up most of my acne.</li>
            <li> Gentle on skin and goes well with other First Air Products</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t see amazing results after one use, but it does its job and doesn&#x27;t irritate or make your acne worse.</li>
            <li> This cleanser lathers well, you only have to use a pea-sized amount to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for nearly all sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product and Origins brand are the ones that work well with my skin type.</li>
            <li> I encourage you to buy this if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> BUT it definitely helps, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and I would recommend for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin (I have oily)</li>
            <li> Face feels soft after rinsing.</li>
            <li> It is the only cleanser I&#x27;ve tried that really removes makeup.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> Those who are sensitive to added fragrances and perfumes will also appreciate that this seems to have no added fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Having tried several of the FAB products it is clear they really understand sensitive skin and this product shows that understanding and commitment</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product does not bother my face.</li>
            <li> It is not pricey and completely dissolved makeup - including stubborn mascara and liner.</li>
            <li> and my face is much less flaky and irritated than it normally is this time of year, and my skin actually looks smooth.</li>
            <li> It is the first face wash I have found that actually does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> effect before you see results and most of the time your left with a red blotchy face waiting for the inflammation to go down</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean without being dried out.</li>
            <li> It also washes clean without much effort, neither overdrying my skin or leaving a residue behind.  </li>
            <li> This is my current fave and go-to because it removes nearly all makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a white, soft liquid</li>
            <li> leaves my dry skin soft and not tight.  </li>
            <li> I went on Accutane a few years ago, and it helped a little, but I still break out more than I should for someone who &amp;#34;completed&amp;#34; Accutane.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve used other face washes that are as effective at half the price or less.</li>
            <li> I love when I can buy it on Amazon for a few dollars less than the local stores as well!</li>
            <li> Does not dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does not dry up your skin and even removes a ton of makeup.</li>
            <li> After trying this product for 4 days, the dry skin was completely gone.</li>
            <li> it cleans well without drying or aggravating my dry sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not sure if it is my imagination, but my skin looked less pink after cleaning it with this cleanser than it does with most I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Principal Secret line since it first came out but is now hard to get individual pieces and none in the original formulation.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much it helps my complexion overall.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, only a pea size amount, so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Use at least twice a day and no more (cleaning your face more than once in a day just promotes dryness as well as oilyness).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because I would say my skin stayed the same, luckily it did not get worse.</li>
            <li> Perhaps not for sensitive dry skin as the formula might be a little drying for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so I anticipate it lasting quite a long time.</li>
            <li> It is extremely lightweight and all you need is a tiny bit for your entire face.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and it takes so little of the product to achieve this softness.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist told me that it was too harsh for my sensitive skin, but didn&#x27;t offer me any alternatives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hopeful that with continued use my breakouts will be few and far between.</li>
            <li> I spent all of 2011 &amp; 2012 trying to get my face back</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t necessarily done anything bad or good for my skin; breakouts are going away at their typical rate and dark spots haven&#x27;t gotten any lighter but there hasn&#x27;t been a noticeable increase in acne or anything.  </li>
            <li> It seems to remove makeup well, and it&#x27;s non-irritating and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Does not leave my skin dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> I have oily combo skin, and during the winter, my skin turns really dry.</li>
            <li> I had an extremely dry t-zone, forehead, and nose because of a tea tree cleanser I had been using.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat dry skin</li>
            <li> Also it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out -</li>
            <li> is they would over dry and burn my face up.</li>
            <li> It was pretty frustrating</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only take a little bit</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser because it removes all my make-up including my eye make-up without  irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I was curious if it would work.</li>
            <li> So if you already do have sensitive skin, please don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> My face tends to be dry with slight rosacea.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate and a, little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I did notice a light soapy smell that&#x27;s unpleasant to me, but it goes away quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes off makeup extremely well.</li>
            <li> I had heard about it on QVC and listened to what other purchasers had said on air.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as other products you might purchase at Sephora.</li>
            <li> and it seems from the other reviews that it works well for others.  </li>
            <li> I am a 3rd generation user of an expensive brand that you can only get in retail stores, but they were constantly changing their formulas to add ingredients that aggravated my skin.  </li>
            <li> I kept having with other products</li>
            <li> Either way, it makes me feel that something&#x27;s not right..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any issues rinsing it away but usually use a wash cloth to rinse off for a little extra exfoliating.</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint was that it dried out my skin a little.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every acne product on the market, and really, this works for my troubled skin.</li>
            <li> pimples and now dark spots</li>
            <li> I doubt this because after cleasing, I felt my face closed tied up and feel redness on the skin!!</li>
            <li> This cleanser does not give you that tight feeling of the skin after you wash your face.</li>
            <li> So perhaps, it&#x27;s a little too abrasive for me.</li>
            <li> Sorry to have to let it go, but this cleanser does the job of removing make-up and leaving my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I use this product year round.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Breaking out&amp;#34; for me now is one, maybe two pimples that disappear in a few days.</li>
            <li> No fragrance or harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it just gets worse and no good results come from other facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> I love this product and am very disappointed by the quality of the cleanser I received from this seller.</li>
            <li> You use very little to wash your face and it takes off makeup too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the residue on the face is moisturizing lotion that&#x27;s supposed to be there or</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Horrible for sensitive skin, I used the wash, facial radiance pads, and then the lotion.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser with the Daily Radiance Pads, and I am obsessed!!</li>
            <li> I use in the winter and summer - all year round!!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say my skin has gotten worse because of this product, but it has not improved after a months use.</li>
            <li> I used to have fairly bad uneven skin and pimples, but after weeks of using this, I&#x27;ve seen a change in how my face looks!</li>
            <li> To Tomatoes cleanser, but not really impressed.</li>
            <li> not impressed by any of the FAB products.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I just got sent the wrong product (purchased from SAI HOLDINGS).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather expensive at Sephora</li>
            <li> My face went crazy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pro&lt;br /&gt;Creamy texture&lt;br /&gt;Takes off the makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;In exchange for taking off the makeup, this product leaves some soapy layer on my face. I don&#x27;t get the feeling that everything came off even after washing out the product several times.. I&#x27;m not sure if the residue on the face is moisturizing lotion that&#x27;s supposed to be there or some soap that&#x27;s not washed. Either way, it makes me feel that something&#x27;s not right..</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin and acne sufferers (I am one). This is my current fave and go-to because it removes nearly all makeup. After I give my face a run of water under the shower first, I put some of the soap in my hands and clean my face. This method of washing has removed over 90% of my foundation, which is really all I ask for in a sulfate free/soap free cleanser, and this soap strikes all the tic marks.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin likes First Aid Beauty. It cleans my face well.</li>
            <li> This is gentle, has a nice clean smell and does a great job removing all traces of makeup.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> LOVE this cleanser. Gentle, and effective, and perfect for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser lathers well, you only have to use a pea-sized amount to cover your whole face. It seems to remove makeup well, and it&#x27;s non-irritating and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I don&#x27;t think this alone will help cure noticeable acne, but for that it&#x27;s important to use a cleanser in general. I did notice a light soapy smell that&#x27;s unpleasant to me, but it goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;On it&#x27;s own merits, this product really has no major flaws. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars mainly because of the price - I&#x27;ve used other face washes that are as effective at half the price or less.</li>
            <li> Best, absolute best, skin wash ever.</li>
            <li> Goes on so gently, cleanses beautifully and leaves my skin feeling extremely soft! LOVE this cleanser!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay, nothing special.</li>
            <li> I used to have fairly bad uneven skin and pimples, but after weeks of using this, I&#x27;ve seen a change in how my face looks! barley any breakouts and my skin tone evened out! I was impressed by the results. This stuff is safe for people who have sensitive and dry skin (I have eczema, so a cleanser that&#x27;s safe is a must. I&#x27;s great for washing off makeup and keeping pimples at bay. Use at least twice a day and no more (cleaning your face more than once in a day just promotes dryness as well as oilyness). I recommend this product for nearly all sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> A creamy, great lather, use with my clarisonic. Does not dry skin. A very nice cleanser at a good price.</li>
            <li> Tried this instead of the Say Yes To Tomatoes cleanser, but not really impressed. It didn&#x27;t make my face feel especially clean and it didn&#x27;t do anything to help reduce breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love First Aid Beauty products. This cleanser is particularly gentle and great for my acne-prone skin. I haven&#x27;t been this clear in years! I use this cleanser with the Daily Radiance Pads, and I am obsessed!! I have tried every acne product on the market, and really, this works for my troubled skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the faoming action and it doesn&#x27;t have much sent.</li>
            <li> Redness and dryness have definitely improved. A little goes a long way. Takes off makeup extremely well.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. I use it with my Clarisonic and it removes my makeup nicely and leaves my skin feeling clean. I love when I can buy it on Amazon for a few dollars less than the local stores as well!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite cleanser gentle yet effective and doesn&#x27;t strip&lt;br /&gt;Skin!</li>
            <li> really concerning that the ne I got is pirated. Becuase last time I bought one from its official website, the texture is clotted cream but this time, I opened and found the cleaser is like liquide!! I doubt this because after cleasing, I felt my face closed tied up and feel redness on the skin!! plz contact me and explain.</li>
            <li> I break out with almost anything. I&#x27;m not one of those people who like the &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; effect before you see results and most of the time your left with a red blotchy face waiting for the inflammation to go down and sometimes it just gets worse and no good results come from other facial cleansers. You don&#x27;t see amazing results after one use, but it does its job and doesn&#x27;t irritate or make your acne worse. After months of using it, I don&#x27;t get really huge zits anymore. It took time, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to purge to see results. Best gentle facial cleanser. Shipping was excellent.</li>
            <li> this is the most pleasant and only &amp;#34;moisturizing and face wash I used... I m a guy. The first tube was pick up for me by a girlfriend. I have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily as a combo moisturizer and shave cream. After the first application I was a convert. Just tossed the first tube after 4 solid months of use. My skin is now normal. Women understand this stuff. Neanderthals took a while before the fire was used for cooking :)</li>
            <li> a nice little gentle cleanser and i liked it but my skin is soooo oily and am cleaning my face every two hours</li>
            <li> This is the best face cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used! After just one use I see and feel a noticeable difference. My face was very soft and smooth and all acne is gone! I highly recommend this, trust me it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Horrible for sensitive skin, I used the wash, facial radiance pads, and then the lotion. When I went to work an hour later my face was red and swollen. I tried the product a week later to see if it was the product, and same reaction an hour later.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and it takes so little of the product to achieve this softness. I had heard about it on QVC and listened to what other purchasers had said on air. It&#x27;s what they said and more. I am very pleased to have purchased it.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser, cleans thoroughly without drying out your skin. Tightens skin too. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My son uses this and he loves it.  I have also started using it and I like it as well.</li>
            <li> This is a fine cleanser but I was just expecting more. It&#x27;s just &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34; and has made it&#x27;s way to my pile of &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> This face wash is very good and cleansing! I first heard about it through @missglamorazzi on Twitter &amp; @TheGridMonster on YouTube. It makes your face feel so clean and fresh! I use it every morning and night!</li>
            <li> Love this product, especially if you have super sensitive skin. Does not irritate and a, little goes a long way</li>
            <li> this is okay. not impressed by any of the FAB products. Won&#x27;t buy again.&lt;br /&gt;oatmeal mask is good, the rest - I&#x27;m all set w/. Does nothing special .. already moved on to a different and see better results for me.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. I have sensitive skin and this product and Origins brand are the ones that work well with my skin type. The price and easy buying from Amazon.com, makes it convenient for me too.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this facial cleanser on Monday, and it came very quickly with the 2 day shipping. I had on a face full of makeup and decided to test it out for the first time to see if it takes my make up off. And let me tell you, it took all of my foundation off, eyeshadow, and brow makeup as well. It also took off most of my mascara except for a little bit. But thats probably because I wear waterproof. This cleanser does not give you that tight feeling of the skin after you wash your face. It lathers up beautifully and feels so silky smooth! I will update my review after I have tried it for a while. I have oily acne prone skin, so I am hoping this clears it up nicely. Perfect for sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t wait to see the way this will change my skin. Just after the first wash, I can already see it&#x27;s going to be amazing! I encourage you to buy this if you have sensitive skin. You won&#x27;t regret it! :)</li>
            <li> really happy with this cleaner. It is gentle on my sensitive skin, but still feels like it is cleaning. Does not leave my skin dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> I have used the Principal Secret line since it first came out but is now hard to get individual pieces and none in the original formulation. Sorry to have to let it go, but this cleanser does the job of removing make-up and leaving my skin feeling soft and hydrated. You don&#x27;t need much, only a pea size amount, so it will last a long time. Satisfied with this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this is the first face cleanser that works really well for me. It&#x27;s only take a little bit so I anticipate it lasting quite a long time.</li>
            <li> This face cleanser is absolutely perfect. It&#x27;s non-drying. Washes off any kind of makeup easily (eyeliner, mascara, bb-cream, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> This face wash has replaced my Neutrogena Foaming cleanser. It removes all traces of make up without overly drying my face. It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t break out my acne prone 34 yr old skin. Their radiance pads are awesome to use as a toner after cleansing with this wash!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me this is your facial cleanser. I use in the winter and summer - all year round!!! It does not dry up your skin and even removes a ton of makeup. No harsh chemicals. Clean, soft and lots of lather. Great for combination and sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is my hands down favorite cleanser. As I have moved on from my teens, my skin has started to change a lot, and I needed a new cleanser because Cetaphil was becoming too harsh. This product is so gentle and so effective; it gets rid of the oil from my skin without drying it out. I have tried face products that range from $50 to $5, and this product has been the absolute best.I have oily combo skin, and during the winter, my skin turns really dry. I use this product year round. Their red clay cleanser is amazing, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little strong, but for the benefits, this product is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice, clean refreshing cleanser for someone who have sensitive skin but wants a nice, foamy clean feeling face. Great when you have a face full of make-up and need to wash it off and have that squeaky clean feeling, no stickiness or greasy feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> it cleaned the dirt off my face.  first i had dirt then no more.  good stuff, i recommend it.  i will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this face cleanser. It foams well and lathers nice on your face and neck. Rinses off easily and leaves your face feeling clean and not dry or tight. Works just as well as other products you might purchase at Sephora. I have combination/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Best make up removing cleanser ever.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser because it removes all my make-up including my eye make-up without  irritating my eyes. Not sure how much it helps my complexion overall.</li>
            <li> I had an extremely dry t-zone, forehead, and nose because of a tea tree cleanser I had been using. After trying this product for 4 days, the dry skin was completely gone. As a bonus, my blemishes were mostly gone too!</li>
            <li> Perhaps not for sensitive dry skin as the formula might be a little drying for dry, sensitive skin. Those of you with normal, oily and &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sensitive skin will probably love this. SUPER GREAT PRICE and amount of product will last a long time as you only need a petite pea sized amount to wash your whole face.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash so much. It is the first face wash I have found that actually does not dry out my skin. I have been free of breakouts and it is fantastic. I have somewhat dry skin and I love this product. I will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> My face has never been sensitive, but using this product really irritated and reddened my skin!! So if you already do have sensitive skin, please don&#x27;t waste your money!! It also did not help my acne one bit! I have a almost full bottle, and I&#x27;m  probably never going to use it again.</li>
            <li> Just like another reviewer I believe the product I received may not be the actual product sold in retail stores like Sephora. I love this product and am very disappointed by the quality of the cleanser I received from this seller.</li>
            <li> After a recommendation from a friend who does makeup professionally, I got this because I had been having hormonal acne breakouts and wanted something gentle for my skin. I think I&#x27;ll end up buying this again...although it&#x27;s not the cheapest option, it&#x27;s CERTAINLY not expensive, and definitely worth the price. It&#x27;s a white, soft liquid and you really don&#x27;t need to apply very much for one use. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since I started using it, although I did also get a prescription topical cream that I started using at the same time, so I can&#x27;t promise it was this cleanser alone that solved my problem. BUT it definitely helps, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is just amazing! I love to use this product!</li>
            <li> Best Cleanser I have found to go with my Clarisonic system. It removes all traces of makeup and grime without drying out my skin. All the First Aid Beauty products I have  ever tried are good, and this one is no exception. It also rinses easily, which is a great plus in my opinion because when cleansers do not rinse completely, they tend to leave a muddy layer that inhibits that radiant appeal we all strive for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone who wants a gentle cleanser that does its job leaving your face ready to better absorb whatever treatment product you use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. It foams, it&#x27;s gentle and it takes off all of my makeup. And the Environmental Working Group rates it a 1. Love that. It&#x27;s pricey but you only need a dime size amount.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  I first used it when I got a sample from Sephora and decided to buy a bottle after using up the sample.  This retailer sells it for the same amount as Sephora - but Sephora charges shipping on orders under $50, so if you have Amazon Prime, this is the better option if you&#x27;re ordering online.  The great thing about it is that it cleanses deeply without irritating my sensitive skin.  It also removes all of my eye makeup, so I don&#x27;t have to use an additional eye makeup remover when I&#x27;m washing my face at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I really enjoy is that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance.  It smells clean, but not overpowering or like perfume.</li>
            <li> I have only been using First Aid Beauty Face Cleanser for a couple of weeks, and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> leaves my dry skin soft and not tight.  Removes makeup well and I would recommend for sensitive skin.  I get seborreac and FAB has not given me any breakouts</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap.  I was using Dove for the longest (per my derm)  but just seemed to make my skin dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to really be helping.  I started the face pads at night soap in the morning and lotion after the soap.  My skin purged at first but really seems to be clearing up and brighter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin (I have oily) and I Love this stuff! My face feels so refreshed and gently cleaned. Will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Product was alright but didn&#x27;t really match the descriptions that others posted.  The one I received has a mild coconut-like scent to it and lathers up a bit.  It hasn&#x27;t necessarily done anything bad or good for my skin; breakouts are going away at their typical rate and dark spots haven&#x27;t gotten any lighter but there hasn&#x27;t been a noticeable increase in acne or anything.  Hopefully I just got sent the wrong product (purchased from SAI HOLDINGS).  I&#x27;ll probably compare mine to an in-store Sephora one when I get a chance.</li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty good cleanser and it seems from the other reviews that it works well for others.  But for me, it was okay.  I will preface that I dont really have any skin problems, so I can&#x27;t attest to how this would help breakouts or acne-prone skin.  I have combination skin and it&#x27;s generally pretty clear of blemishes.  I was looking for a cleaner that was rich and moisturizing.  I thought the cleanser was rich and applied on well.  It did clean my skin well.  My only minor complaint was that it dried out my skin a little.  So perhaps, it&#x27;s a little too abrasive for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product for it cleans my skin but does not dry it out!  I feel it is the perfect balance for a facial cleanser!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser-- it cleans well without drying or aggravating my dry sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;I love F.A.B. products-- I am a 3rd generation user of an expensive brand that you can only get in retail stores, but they were constantly changing their formulas to add ingredients that aggravated my skin.  I found F.A.B. and none of their products have made my skin react- I&#x27;ll be a user for life!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s not drying. It really leaves you feeling clean. Gentle but not so gentle that you feel like you didn&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;m in love with this. I have combination skin that has semi frequent breakouts, and this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> best facial cleanser i have ever tried and i have tried alot. i have very oily and acne proned skin and after using this every night for a month, all my breakouts were gone.</li>
            <li> This product works great for sensitive skin but may cause random breakouts</li>
            <li> Really enjoy how creamy and soft this feels on my face during application. A dime size amount is more then enough to get a good lather. Face feels soft after rinsing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 30 days and I am really happy with it. I have problem skin and am on a dermatologist prescribed skin cocktail so I needed something that wasn&#x27;t going to do anything other than moisturize and clean. You don&#x27;t need a lot and it actually does foam up a bit with the right amount of water. I don&#x27;t have any issues rinsing it away but usually use a wash cloth to rinse off for a little extra exfoliating. I don&#x27;t find that it works all that well to remove mascara- but I always use an eye make-up remover anyway. I think I have found my new face wash!</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample with some things I bought at sephora.  This product works great and feels great.  Easily washes away any make up and doesn&#x27;t have any strong fragrances.  I am on my third tube of this now and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels after using this.  it does a really good job of removing make-up, aside from mascara.</li>
            <li> It did not work for my skin.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time today and it did a great job getting my pores clean. To me this is a big deal because most cleansers I have tried still leave dirt or blackheads on my skin.It was pretty frustrating but I heard about this stuff and I was curious if it would work. It lathers up really nice and it doesn&#x27;t take much. There&#x27;s not much of a scent to it but best of all most of the dirt and blackheads came out of my pores! I am so happy with this product!  Also it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out - which is awesome because I am prone to horribly dry skin. The Fab Ultra Repair Cream works great with this cleanser. Will reorder both products again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, worth the price.. Super mild, leaves your face feeling clean without dyes or perfume or overdrying.</li>
            <li> For some reason since I moved to California, I got skin redness and breakouts. This product helped with that, way better than all of the other things I tried (rosewater, argan oil, night creams etc)</li>
            <li> I like this stuff because it&#x27;s not toxic. And it removes makeup really well, I don&#x27;t even have to use makeup wipes anymore.</li>
            <li> i like this because it removes the oil, grime and dirt off of your face without over-drying the skin and it clears up any pimples or break outs. The ingredients are pretty good. 5 stars and worth it. I think this will be my staple facial cleanser forever! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this face cleanser. It is nice and creamy that lathers slightly. It leaves your skin feeling soft yet clean. It is the only cleanser I&#x27;ve tried that really removes makeup. I also have rosacea and this does wonders on my super sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff!</li>
            <li> I used to get red blotchy spots on my face with using the Clinique line of face cleansers and lotion. A dermatologist told me that it was too harsh for my sensitive skin, but didn&#x27;t offer me any alternatives. I tried this (based on a recommendation from Sephora) and haven&#x27;t gone back since. My skin feels clean and the blotches have dramatically reduced. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years now. I use the face wash and ultra repair cream, and the combo works well for me.</li>
            <li> We got a sample of this at our local Sephora when we purchased some other things and my daughter fell in love with it.  You use very little to wash your face and it takes off makeup too.  She loves the way it clears her skin and keeps her face very fresh.  It&#x27;s rather expensive at Sephora so we did some research and found it here for the best price</li>
            <li> GREAT for sensitive skin. My go-to cleanser. cleared up my eczema better than anything my dermatologist prescribed. I use it int eh morning and at night and recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works well, is hydrating, and creamy, and has a descent scent.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin and this is the best cleanser I have ever used. It is extremely lightweight and all you need is a tiny bit for your entire face. This bottle lasts FOREVER. It leaves my face feeling smooth, and also gets rid of my makeup, including eye makeup. It doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes at all. Will definitely continue to purchase this cleanser!</li>
            <li> I wanted to start getting in the habit of washing my face twice a day since the warm weather is coming  this makes my face clear, clean, soft, and makes a perfect canvas for makeup. Really good face wash:)</li>
            <li> I bought this facial cleanser recommended by a beauty guru youtuber.  I don&#x27;t regret it!  Very gentle cleanser, yet effective.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cleaner as it&#x27;s on sale. Another reason would be it&#x27;s from First Aid, so I thought it would be very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the clean wasn&#x27;t that good, and actually kind of oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for this price, worth it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone skin.  Prescription creams and pills keep my acne (mostly) at bay, but I still struggle with skin redness, especially in the wintertime.  Accordingly, I&#x27;ve been trying to choose products specifically meant for my skin type.  I&#x27;ve had great experiences with other First Aid Beauty products (their mask is AMAZING and one of my go-to&#x27;s along with GlamGlow for keeping my skin hydrated and glowing in the winter months).  I hadn&#x27;t tried any of their cleansers though so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the texture is rich and creamy. It works well with my Clarisonic as I found no traces of makeup when I followed up my cleaning with a toner.  I also like that although it is rich, it feels light and gentle on my face while I&#x27;m cleaning.  No stinging, burning, or itching, which is great.  It also washes clean without much effort, neither overdrying my skin or leaving a residue behind.  I&#x27;m also not sure if it is my imagination, but my skin looked less pink after cleaning it with this cleanser than it does with most I have tried.  Those who are sensitive to added fragrances and perfumes will also appreciate that this seems to have no added fragrances.  The scent is quite mild and benign, neither good nor bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also worked very well with the First Aid Beauty Dual Repair Face Cream I applied after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really, really like this cleanser.  Having tried several of the FAB products it is clear they really understand sensitive skin and this product shows that understanding and commitment</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product does not bother my face. It actually appears to add some glow and vibrancy. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled with acne for most of my life. I went on Accutane a few years ago, and it helped a little, but I still break out more than I should for someone who &amp;#34;completed&amp;#34; Accutane. My face tends to be dry with slight rosacea. This cleanser has been amazing. I use it with my Mia 2, and the combination has produced great results. The cleanser does not dry me out (Cetaphil was too harsh for my face) and has cleared up most of my acne. &amp;#34;Breaking out&amp;#34; for me now is one, maybe two pimples that disappear in a few days. I&#x27;m hopeful that with continued use my breakouts will be few and far between. I only wish I found this product sooner.</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser I use. It is not pricey and completely dissolved makeup - including stubborn mascara and liner. I have not had any reaction and believe me I react to EVERYTHING. I like it&#x27;s non-drying formulation. I also like foaming rather than creamy formulas. Was glad I found this after the other manufacturer stopped making the one I used for years. I also use their moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nothing to say except - cleans and leaves no residue. Gentle on skin and goes well with other First Air Products</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say my skin has gotten worse because of this product, but it has not improved after a months use. I understand that facial  cleansers aren&#x27;t going to magically work overnight, but this doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. If someone handed me this in an unmarked bottle &amp; said &amp;#34;what&#x27;s this?&amp;#34; I would guess unscented hand soap. It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel tingles &amp; jingles after cleansing &amp; it doesn&#x27;t appear to make a drastic difference. I guess I&#x27;m just bummed that I stopped using a $5 cleanser for this that was more effective. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because I would say my skin stayed the same, luckily it did not get worse.</li>
            <li> No fragrance or harsh chemicals. It removes all my eye makeup and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft. The is perfect for everyday use. I love the whole FAB line.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser, it feels really gentle, do not have perfume (which is a plus for me). The skin feels clean but not tight or anything.</li>
            <li> Easy use , clean well and not dry after used.</li>
            <li> I remember having used this once before and it clearing up my acne. Not this time around! Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that reacts to most cleansers. This one doesn&#x27;t bother me. It removes make up without drying too.</li>
            <li> This has worked really well for me. It foams up nicely- similar to the consistency of shaving pot cream. With a pea-sized amount, it is able to remove makeup and bring my face back to its (almost squeaky) clean state. I haven&#x27;t tried removing eye makeup with this, but it does a great job at removing foundation, blush, eyebrow pencil -- don&#x27;t have residual makeup on the cotton pad when I apply toner afterward. Will add this to my list of favorite beauty products.</li>
            <li> Love this product, really gross with my red areas on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 with oily/acne prone skin that is very sensitive and prone to redness and peeling. This cleanser is the most soothing thing I have ever put on my face. It is mild, moisturizing without leaving me oily, and actually feels good on the skin as you use it. I use this as my morning face wash and my skin is so soft, smooth, and even toned since I added it to my routine. It is winter where I live right now and my face is much less flaky and irritated than it normally is this time of year, and my skin actually looks smooth.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser. I double cleanse with my clarisonic and it yes all my makeup off.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it! I love this product soo much !</li>
            <li> Background:&lt;br /&gt;I have oily T-zone and normal cheeks. Always had great skin then I got the Nexplanon (3 yr b.c stays in your arm). My face went crazy. Waited 6 months took it out waited another 6 months skin never got better. I spent all of 2011 &amp; 2012 trying to get my face back I&#x27;be had two different dermatologist and between them everything was tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More pimples and now dark spots I was loosing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now:&lt;br /&gt;I saw a review about this product and a girl said it worked in 5 days. I give you 2!! My face is already looks so much better!  I problem I kept having with other products is they would over dry and burn my face up. This feels so different.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m soo happy i found it and I hope others do too.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Have bought twice already.  Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have ordered all their skincare products.</li>
            <li> I love that this face wash is gentle without scary chemicals in it and compared to a lot of other high end non-drugstore brands, I love the price too. You get a pretty hefty bottle for twenty bucks. I think it&#x27;s worth the money. It leaves my face super soft. My skin feels clean without being dried out. I have finally found a face wash I will buy over and over again.</li>
