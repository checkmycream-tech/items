            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Seche Vite fast-dry top coat has literally changed my life!  </li>
            <li>It works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I own a lot of polishes, so this larger bottle of thinner is great!</li>
            <li>This helps keep my polishes thinner and more useable.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast service.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seche Vite Restore Thinner is essential for keeping your S.V. top coat at ideal consistency.  </li>
            <li>My husband bought this for me a few weeks ago and it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful way to thin out my nail polishes that have thickened up.</li>
            <li>If, however, you do paint your nails, say, every other week, this is a good investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really brings the top coat back to its original consistency.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t paint your nails often, the smaller bottles should be good enough.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I received fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite&#x27;s top coat for quite some time and one of the things I noticed early on is that it gets thick and goopy very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to restore the seche vite top coat and base coat  consistency.</li>
            <li>I usually need about 2-4 full squeezes from the dropper, which is why I like this 2 oz bottle, which is more cost-effective than the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li>few drops&amp;#34; of Restore to get my bottle to even close to the original consistency... I have an even older bottle that I decided was beyond hope, if it was going to need that much Restore.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I was about to throw my bottle of top coat out because it was just to thick to work with it.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend it for any nail polish especially nail strengtheners that have thickened beyond use.</li>
            <li>My only complaint was that it took a lot more than &amp;#34;a</li>
            <li>However, I did have a couple of old bottles that were starting to dry up, so I decided to try Restore.</li>

            <li> This worked great. I was about to throw my bottle of top coat out because it was just to thick to work with it.</li>
            <li> Great Item! A must have for all Nail Aficionado&#x27;s! Great Seller! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful way to thin out my nail polishes that have thickened up. Polish remover left the polish dull, and this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Recieved the Restore Thinner in just a couple of day after my order. Works great. Thanks</li>
            <li> I own a lot of polishes, so this larger bottle of thinner is great! It comes with an angled dropper tool, however it is a little short for the 2 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second refill bottle of Seche, and I even using Restore liberally, I haven&#x27;t used even 1/4 of the bottle. Good value.</li>
            <li> This helps keep my polishes thinner and more useable. Great product and fast service. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Excelent product.  I received fast.</li>
            <li> I love the Seche Vite topcoat with a passion! That stuff works like a charm! However, I did have a couple of old bottles that were starting to dry up, so I decided to try Restore. My only complaint was that it took a lot more than &amp;#34;a few drops&amp;#34; of Restore to get my bottle to even close to the original consistency... I have an even older bottle that I decided was beyond hope, if it was going to need that much Restore. Still, the product DOES work, you just have to be patient in rolling the bottle and getting the Vite and Restore to mix properly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all, total waste of money. I like the shine that Sache Vite gives but what the polish itself turns into makes me frustrated.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to restore the seche vite top coat and base coat  consistency. Thanks</li>
            <li> works as stated seche vite is an excellent product I will buy it again for sure was also a good price</li>
            <li> This is a great way to prolong the life of your polish. It works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite&#x27;s top coat for quite some time and one of the things I noticed early on is that it gets thick and goopy very quickly. So I figured I&#x27;d get a thinner and after some research, landed on Seche Restore. Love it! It really brings the top coat back to its original consistency. I usually need about 2-4 full squeezes from the dropper, which is why I like this 2 oz bottle, which is more cost-effective than the smaller bottles. If you don&#x27;t paint your nails often, the smaller bottles should be good enough. If, however, you do paint your nails, say, every other week, this is a good investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I can&#x27;t stand is the smell. Wow! It is toxic! I try to get around it by opening up all of my windows when using it, but it takes a while for everything to ventilate.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite fast-dry top coat has literally changed my life!  Being able to apply nail art to a base polished manicure which is dry in 10 min. vs. 2 hrs. is a dream come true!&lt;br /&gt;Seche Vite Restore Thinner is essential for keeping your S.V. top coat at ideal consistency.  Get it, use it, be happy :-)</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me a few weeks ago and it is a wonderful product. HIGHLY recommend it for any nail polish especially nail strengtheners that have thickened beyond use.</li>
