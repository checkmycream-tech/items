            <li> Lightweight, a little goes a long way and smells great (subtle).</li>
            <li> It should not be referred to as a spray, as it is a heavy bodied liquid and a spare few drops are used on clean damp hair.</li>
            <li> Only a small drop is all that was needed.</li>
            <li> less in this bottle.</li>
            <li> When I colored my hair it dried out the ends.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find in my area</li>
            <li> A little too thick for me</li>
            <li> It took away the frizzy look that I usually had after drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> few drops to do the trick!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not read carefully!</li>
            <li> This was very expensive, but Ilove the product</li>
            <li> I have used it before, but I was disappointed in the size.  </li>

            <li> It worked,looked and did what they said it would with no problems. It arrived quick and was easy and good to use. Would definitely order again. Thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works great with my hair to keep it shiny and frizz free without feeling like I&#x27;ve put this product in my hair.  I buy Purology Shinemax all the time and I love it.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. It took away the frizzy look that I usually had after drying my hair.  Only a small drop is all that was needed.</li>
            <li> On time nd have always love pureology leaves my hair soft nd shiny ......I will never stop buying it ......love it</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  I have been using this for years.  Works great.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair shinny and healthy looking and when you use it with pureology shampoo your hair will look great. I get compliments on my hair all the time.</li>
            <li> Love the shine, silkiness and smell of this product. It&#x27;s a new favorite. Be careful to use it sparingly on fine hair though or it will become a oily treatment.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love shopping Amazon.com.  The transactions are easy and secure!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, but it isn&#x27;t a spray.  It&#x27;s a liquid that only takes&lt;br /&gt;a few drops to do the trick!</li>
            <li> When I colored my hair it dried out the ends. This leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell. Otherwise great product!</li>
            <li> Works great; nice smell, too.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.  Still, this was the cheapest place I could find it after WEEKS of checking various online and brick-and-mortar stores.  If you love Pureology, this is the place to get it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products I cannot live without! I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> This product works especially well with the Pureology Hydrating Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  It makes your hair super soft &amp; shiny!</li>
            <li> A little too thick for me</li>
            <li> This was very expensive, but Ilove the product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and I love how my hair feels. It should not be referred to as a spray, as it is a heavy bodied liquid and a spare few drops are used on clean damp hair. It is not easy to find in my area so I now order it on line.</li>
            <li> Wish I still could get this - I&#x27;m running out again - Yikes.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  I have used it before, but I was disappointed in the size.  The picture makes it look just like the size I had ordered before, but it is about 2 oz. less in this bottle.</li>
            <li> If you want great base shine and color protection this is a super product. Started using from my hairdresser but so much cheaper on Amazon. Only suggestion is more is not better unless you want your hair to look greasy.</li>
            <li> The Shine Max product that I was looking for was actually a \\&quot;smoother\\&quot; not the spray. (This product has been discontinued by Pureology.) SO... when I saw the picture of the product, I was thrilled. Unfortunately I did not read carefully! The product that was being sold was a spray- but that is not what is pictured!&lt;br /&gt;I really feel that it was a misrepresentation of the product.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, a little goes a long way and smells great (subtle).</li>
