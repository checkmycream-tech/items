            <li>The smell, the feel, and the amazing shine and softness</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo for the money.</li>
            <li>This is a luxurious shampoo--lathers fast, smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>But I feel very strongly about this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It smells exotic and leaves my hair shiny and tangle free for days at a time!!</li>
            <li>By far the best shampoo and conditioner I have come across.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try something more affordable.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I tried it one more time and</li>
            <li>I love both the suave moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner..</li>
            <li>I have more course , dryish hair and cant use just anything. .</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo because it cleans my hair but still makes it feel healthy.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve avoided most of the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible or anything</li>
            <li>I am very happy to use Suave Professionals, it is nothing like the regular Suave line which is satisfactory but</li>
            <li>Try this shampoo, I think you will love it.</li>
            <li>Favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>My cheap shampoo worked much better.</li>
            <li>I love the lush, pleasant smelling lather.  </li>
            <li>Kinda strong smelling, wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li>Just wish this was available as subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does add a nice shine and silky feeling to my hair without making it greasy.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how good this product was.</li>
            <li>For the price it is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>When I first used this shampoo along with the conditioner I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect it was a 3 dollar shampoo that i found in Wal-mart</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure you will feel as I do about</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell and my hair was noticeably more shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I have never written a review about shampoo, but this is a special product.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and works so well that i actually use at as a body soap.</li>
            <li>it does not have the sweet Moroccan scent I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>This has become my new favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Shampoo works well and gives my fine, straight hair some body.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say that speaks pretty highly of this product :)</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and it leaves it smooth and moisturized after every wash!</li>
            <li>I rarely take the time to review a household product.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I was expecting more than I actually felt - I think if you had hair that was not colored it might make a tremendous difference</li>
            <li>and I am well past 40, and it still worked great.</li>
            <li>This product was surprisingly effective when it came to moisturizing and healing my dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Liking the subcription plan very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried high end and low end products to see the similarities, and honestly.</li>
            <li>But other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li>First of all, it is affordable.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner makes your hair feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Be careful as it is very strongly scented.</li>
            <li>and the one time I did use it, I certainly didn&#x27;t see any infusion shine.  </li>
            <li>This product really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>and I really like the combination.</li>
            <li>I was hopeful that this would help smooth out my hair but had the opposite effect.</li>
            <li>so nothing to compare it to, but for a Suave-priced product, I really like it.</li>
            <li>I like it better than more expensive salon brands.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair which dries out quick and with this shampoo and conditioner they work wonders.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried really high end argan oil products</li>
            <li>But many of these products are bulky or heavy.</li>
            <li>But not this one; it is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>I like this new shampoo</li>
            <li>it felt a lot more coarse than normal, then when I dried and combed through my hair it was very frizzy</li>
            <li>the exact same thing happened</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot out of Suave, but it actually worked better than some of the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not harsh on your hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>it smells like old granny house.</li>
            <li>You get shiny and soft hair from this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The smell does take a little to get used to, but worth the price!</li>
            <li>For anyone who needs a bottle that isn&#x27;t oversized and is easy to grip, this receives 4 stars - the flip top can be a little hard to open.</li>
            <li>Seriously $2-$3 and works better than shampoos that cost 100X&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li>Especially with new product ideas that we can try without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>You choose how long it takes  you to use the shampoo, and then a new one shows up at your door when you need it.</li>
            <li>so i went back to my other shampoo and conditioner and now my hair is back to normal.</li>

            <li> You choose how long it takes  you to use the shampoo, and then a new one shows up at your door when you need it.</li>
            <li> so i went back to my other shampoo and conditioner and now my hair is back to normal.</li>
            <li> I was running low on shampoo/conditioner because my 4 year old decided to dump my $26 dollar shampoo down the drain to make bubbles in the bath.</li>
            <li> A little heavy on the scent but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my course, dry hair feel wonderful, but broke me out in a terrible rash along my hairline and neck.</li>
            <li> So not only is it inexpensive, it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This set leaves my hair very soft and shiny, more so than the other expensive brands I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I was a little skeptical when I purchased this because it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over dry it</li>
            <li> I have dry color treated hair</li>
            <li> As an African American shampoos can be very harsh on our hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to dislike about that.</li>
            <li> To name a few: toilet paper, tissue, paper towels, trash bags, dishwasher soap tabs, dish soap, hand soap, washing machine tablets  </li>
            <li> I have long thick somewhat coarse hair and for some reason this seems to leave a film on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have read others who have had this problem with this product, and the other Moroccan Infusion products.  </li>
            <li> This product does the same thing as the salon versions I bought at a small fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This one is works the same and if not better.</li>
            <li> I color my hair regularly, and I have been growing it out for a few years, so the ends get pretty unhappy.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that my roots tend to get somewhat oily, and I found that after using it for a few weeks, I accumulated some greasy build up and had to switch to a less heavy product.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is that the smell will start to irritate you after a while.</li>
            <li> I usually really like Suave shampoo, but I&#x27;m not impressed with this one.  </li>
            <li> I was so upset because that was a lot of money that literally went down the drain.</li>
            <li> I have notices that I use less of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My family has long thick hair prone to tangles.  </li>
            <li> Price a little less than at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I look forward to showering with this everyday.</li>
            <li> This makes it so soft and I&#x27;m addicted to the smell!</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair come out in the shower, and after it dried it ended up frizzy and looking like steel wool.</li>
            <li> but after a few washes it seems to build up this film.  </li>
            <li> I usually grab shampoo/conditioner from my salon.</li>
            <li> but this was small clumps instead of strands.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair very fluffy and shiny.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft without the conditioner combo that I hate.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it caused a TERRIBLE red, scaly and itchy rash all over my head , along my forehead and around my ears.  </li>
            <li> but the scent gave me a bad headache.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Ok, so I was a little skeptical when I purchased this because it was so inexpensive. I usually grab shampoo/conditioner from my salon. I have used so many high-end, expensive shampoo/conditioners. I was running low on shampoo/conditioner because my 4 year old decided to dump my $26 dollar shampoo down the drain to make bubbles in the bath. I was so upset because that was a lot of money that literally went down the drain. I decided to try something more affordable. It said it was the &amp;#34;professional salon&amp;#34; line and I also loved the smell. It was on rollback at my local store and I tried it on a whim. I  am so glad I did!!! I was blown away by this product, and I am not even kidding. The smell, the feel, and the amazing shine and softness my hair has. I look forward to showering with this everyday. I literally have it stockpiled because I don&#x27;t want to run out of this. I color treat my hair to cover grays and this doesn&#x27;t fade my color. They also have a color care version of this, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this. This is my Holy Grail!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best Suave brand shampoo I have ever used!. It smells exotic and leaves my hair shiny and tangle free for days at a time!!</li>
            <li> This has become my new favorite shampoo and conditioner. I love it. I have well water with no softener so my hair is fried. This makes it so soft and I&#x27;m addicted to the smell!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how good this product was. It cleans well, leaves hair silky and shiny. A little heavy on the scent but not unpleasant. The price is great!</li>
            <li> By far the best shampoo and conditioner I have come across. This set leaves my hair very soft and shiny, more so than the other expensive brands I have used in the past. Contains no sulfate si it&#x27;s not harsh on your hair. Also, smells absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo along with the matching Moroccan conditioner from Suave and I am very pleased. I LOVE the smell and my hair was noticeably more shiny and soft. For the price it is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells like heaven, I wish I could get a spray of that. I washed my hair and it works great. My hair smells beautiful too.</li>
            <li> Seriously $2-$3 and works better than shampoos that cost 100X&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of this product and how it made my hair look and feel!  HOWEVER, it caused a TERRIBLE red, scaly and itchy rash all over my head , along my forehead and around my ears.  I have read others who have had this problem with this product, and the other Moroccan Infusion products.  I HOPE SUAVE CHANGES their formula since so many are having a reaction!!  I used them for about a month, and within about two weeks of switching back, it finally went away.  Back to using the Humectant products they make - no problems there ever, and I have used them for years.</li>
            <li> When I first used this shampoo along with the conditioner I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect it was a 3 dollar shampoo that i found in Wal-mart it said it was infused with Keratin so i decided to give it a shot. The first time i used it I noticed when  lathering my hair with it a lot of hair was falling out, strands of hair do usually come out in the shower but this was small clumps instead of strands. When i got out of the shower i could feel the difference it felt a lot more coarse than normal, then when I dried and combed through my hair it was very frizzy which is the opposite as advertized. I tried it one more time and the exact same thing happened so i went back to my other shampoo and conditioner and now my hair is back to normal. I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love both the suave moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner.. I have more course , dryish hair and cant use just anything. . I use redken , matrix , and this .. and I&#x27;d say that speaks pretty highly of this product :)</li>
            <li> Kinda strong smelling, wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> My family has long thick hair prone to tangles.  This product does the same thing as the salon versions I bought at a small fraction of the price.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Price, cleaning power, size, pleasant scent and Amazon subscribe and save. There&#x27;s not much to dislike about that. For anyone who needs a bottle that isn&#x27;t oversized and is easy to grip, this receives 4 stars - the flip top can be a little hard to open.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my course, dry hair feel wonderful, but broke me out in a terrible rash along my hairline and neck. Be careful as it is very strongly scented. I gave it away to a friend.</li>
            <li> Suave Professionals is my Go To shampoo!! I have natural hair and it leaves it smooth and moisturized after every wash! And a little goes a long way! The only negative thing is that the smell will start to irritate you after a while. But other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> Good Product and good seller, recommended</li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting more than I actually felt - I think if you had hair that was not colored it might make a tremendous difference --with colored hair it add some shine.</li>
            <li> What a surprise! This product really makes a difference. My hair is definitely shinier, silkier. Price a little less than at Walmart. A nice pleasant scent, on the warm side, rather than refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because it cleans my hair but still makes it feel healthy. It doesn&#x27;t over dry it and it smells great. I also use the conditioner and the hair mask from the same line and I really like the combination.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair come out in the shower, and after it dried it ended up frizzy and looking like steel wool. I was hopeful that this would help smooth out my hair but had the opposite effect. My cheap shampoo worked much better.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo for the money.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does add a nice shine and silky feeling to my hair without making it greasy. I tend to oily hair so I&#x27;ve avoided most of the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; based shampoos and treatments. I bought this at the drugstore once when it was on sale and have been using it ever since. I haven&#x27;t tried really high end argan oil products so nothing to compare it to, but for a Suave-priced product, I really like it.</li>
            <li> This product was surprisingly effective when it came to moisturizing and healing my dry and damaged hair. I color my hair regularly, and I have been growing it out for a few years, so the ends get pretty unhappy. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot out of Suave, but it actually worked better than some of the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried. The only downside is that my roots tend to get somewhat oily, and I found that after using it for a few weeks, I accumulated some greasy build up and had to switch to a less heavy product.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Suave, does the trick!  Not too pricey and provides the fullness and shine I&#x27;m looking for in a shampoo.  The smell does take a little to get used to, but worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this shampoo and the smell is delightful.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and works so well that i actually use at as a body soap.</li>
            <li> stinky! had to give it away.  it does not have the sweet Moroccan scent I was hoping for.  it smells like old granny house. and the one time I did use it, I certainly didn&#x27;t see any infusion shine.  will stick with my Garnier Fructis products.</li>
            <li> I usually really like Suave shampoo, but I&#x27;m not impressed with this one.  I have long thick somewhat coarse hair and for some reason this seems to leave a film on my hair.  It&#x27;s not horrible or anything but after a few washes it seems to build up this film.  It does smell very nice though so that&#x27;s a plus but I think I&#x27;ll try something different next time.</li>
            <li> Suave, good product for the money</li>
            <li> This is an excellent buy.  You get shiny and soft hair from this shampoo.  I am very happy to use Suave Professionals, it is nothing like the regular Suave line which is satisfactory but nothing special.  This shampoo is really great.</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo!  no tangles, frizz or gross build up</li>
            <li> I use the Moroccan line of hair products.</li>
            <li> As an African American shampoos can be very harsh on our hair. After using Carol&#x27;s Daughter products I did not think any could compare. This shampoo and conditioner makes your hair feel soft and clean. I have it on auto delivery every month so that there is always plenty to share with granddaughters house.</li>
            <li> Shine Shine Shine.  This is great.  Suave is the best at giving us good products at fair prices.  Especially with new product ideas that we can try without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this shampoo and my hair looks very nice but the scent gave me a bad headache.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> This is a luxurious shampoo--lathers fast, smells wonderful.  It leaves your hair very fluffy and shiny. I have dry color treated hair and I am well past 40, and it still worked great. I have never written a review about shampoo, but this is a special product.</li>
            <li> Shampoo works well and gives my fine, straight hair some body.</li>
            <li> I rarely take the time to review a household product.  But I feel very strongly about this shampoo. First of all, it is affordable. I have always thought suave was a cheep watery shampoo. But not this one; it is nice and thick. It lathers up very nicely, and it cleans great. I have a pump dispenser in my shower, so I always count the number of pumps.  I have notices that I use less of this shampoo. So not only is it inexpensive, it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not tried this shampoo, you should. I&#x27;m pretty sure you will feel as I do about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I should probably mention that I purchase this product on Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; program. This program sends you your subscribed products on a schedule.  You choose how long it takes  you to use the shampoo, and then a new one shows up at your door when you need it. You do not pay shipping, and there is a discounted price for the products.  I probably have around 40 products on this program. To name a few: toilet paper, tissue, paper towels, trash bags, dishwasher soap tabs, dish soap, hand soap, washing machine tablets  multiple varieties of cookies, soup, canned and bottled goods. This is just a sampling. But many of these products are bulky or heavy. It is a pleasure not to have to go to the store and get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is helpful. Try this shampoo, I think you will love it.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product! I&#x27;ve tried high end and low end products to see the similarities, and honestly. This one is works the same and if not better. I have blonde hair which dries out quick and with this shampoo and conditioner they work wonders. Plus way cheaper.</li>
            <li> These are on my subscription plan for my son at college.  He receives them every so often without me having to go to store and ship to him.  Liking the subcription plan very much.</li>
            <li> Favorite shampoo. Leaves hair soft without the conditioner combo that I hate.</li>
