    <ol>
            <li>I was hoping this mascara would be awesome</li>
            <li>but this product is best for fanning and lengthening without the clumping.</li>
            <li>Best of both worlds.</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>Very good ink, book it 2 times.</li>
            <li>I feel it is a great product for the money.  </li>
            <li>It works great to separate and lengthen - emphasis on separate.</li>
            <li>and it really is a good mascara.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara- as recommended by allure!</li>
            <li>Gotta make sure its water resistant!</li>
            <li>It sure isn&#x27;t water PROOF!  </li>
            <li>I use the waterproof, but when I wash my face, it comes off nicely.  </li>
            <li>Works really nicely on my sparse eyelashes.</li>
            <li>but off the bat I would say its great and worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>What more can I say...</li>
            <li>I can take smudges more than flakes.  </li>
            <li>love the wand.</li>
            <li>It is easy to wash off and lasts forver without flaking.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t run or smudge easily.</li>
            <li>Makes a super long and beautiful lashes!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth &amp; easy with the curved brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>the mascara goes on clean and stays on.</li>
            <li>The wand is really comb-y which is great for not leaving clumps, but it pulls my eyelashes too much and makes them straight.</li>
            <li>Luckily I needed to buy some things that added on to this.</li>
            <li>Just warm water and soap will be enough.</li>
            <li>And if I remember right it was an ADD ON ITEM.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really matter anymore because I have found my new favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>really is clump free, really.  </li>
            <li>My lashes stay soft &amp; its easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty mascara.</li>
            <li>This has become the most recent must-have makeup product.</li>
            <li>To mitigate flaking, I simply cover with a top coat of my fave upscale mascara:</li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone who wants a good everyday mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I have straight eyelashes, like straight straight.</li>
            <li>It did not cost to much.</li>
            <li>The mascara made my eyelashes go totally straight.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s why my eyelashes went straight.</li>
            <li>That stays creamy and lustrous all day, feels very conditioning - and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li>There are other mascaras that lengthen better</li>
            <li>This is my new fav!  </li>
            <li>Okay, so it doesn&#x27;t clump, but that&#x27;s because you get so little mascara out of the tube, there&#x27;s not enough to clump!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it for almost 5 hors and my lashes are still soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>This quickly became my favorite mascara - and I&#x27;ve tried numerous expensive brands.</li>
            <li>but at the same time it&#x27;s easy to take off the mascara without the use of harsh makeup removers.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara because it totally lets each individual lash shine.</li>
            <li>I never expected to like a cosmetic product at this price level.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my mascara because my eyes water a lot due to allergies.  </li>

            <li> not sure if it will be discontinued.  </li>
            <li> At least smudges don&#x27;t get in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But waterproof is drying and can be difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> So I guess Ill look else where.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This quickly became my favorite mascara - and I&#x27;ve tried numerous expensive brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty mascara. Very black. The formula isn&#x27;t soaking wet which I can&#x27;t stand. It doesn&#x27;t get all over your face. The reason I gave it four stars is that it doesn&#x27;t hold my curl. That&#x27;s a bummer in a &amp;#34;water resistant&amp;#34; mascara. It is easy to wash off and lasts forver without flaking.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara- as recommended by allure!</li>
            <li> I always wear waterproof mascara; something about my eyes makes regular mascara smudge no matter what the brand.  But waterproof is drying and can be difficult to remove.  So in my search for a non-waterproof mascara that doesn&#x27;t end up under my eyes, I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It is water resistant, not water proof, but it does stay on all day and comes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;It really is clump free, really.  I have not had to use the little comb thing to separate clumps even once while putting this on.&lt;br /&gt;Great brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It does not thicken or lengthen, not on me anyway even though I did a couple of coats.  For a dramatic look I will go back to Maybelline waterproof heavy duty mascara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who wants a good everyday mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Does not run, and does not clump.  I use the waterproof, but when I wash my face, it comes off nicely.  I feel it is a great product for the money.  I am on my 4th one.</li>
            <li> This is my new fav!  I wear contacts and have oily skin so I prefer waterproof as it doesn&#x27;t run by the end of the day. This accomplishes the task and doesn&#x27;t clump too!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Works really nicely on my sparse eyelashes. It thickens and builds them up without clumping. I love it...What more can I say...</li>
            <li> My friend wanted this and since this is an add on item I had to decide what other things to buy to add it on. Luckily I needed to buy some things that added on to this. Gotta make sure its water resistant!</li>
            <li> Opened it and it is was already dry. Have not contacted company. Figure I tried It. It did not cost to much. And if I remember right it was an ADD ON ITEM. So I guess Ill look else where.</li>
            <li> Very good ink, book it 2 times. Makes a super long and beautiful lashes! I recommend 100%!</li>
            <li> Okay, so it doesn&#x27;t clump, but that&#x27;s because you get so little mascara out of the tube, there&#x27;s not enough to clump!  I even tried the warm-it-with-the-blow-dryer trick.  Still couldn&#x27;t get enough mascara on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube/applicator is too fat to handle.  Plus it&#x27;s a marketing ploy to make you think you&#x27;re getting a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And dummy me - I should have noticed it was water &amp;#34;resistant&amp;#34; rather than water &amp;#34;proof.&amp;#34;  Not sure what resistant means to Cover Girl - maybe it stays on in humid weather?  It sure isn&#x27;t water PROOF!  My fault though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it flakes off during the day.  I can take smudges more than flakes.  At least smudges don&#x27;t get in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li> You guys realize it says water resistant and not water proof. This means it won&#x27;t smudge or make those raccoon eyes but at the same time it&#x27;s easy to take off the mascara without the use of harsh makeup removers. Just warm water and soap will be enough.</li>
            <li> love the wand. the mascara goes on clean and stays on. I&#x27;ve worn it for almost 5 hors and my lashes are still soft to the touch. lets see how it holds up over the weekend. but off the bat I would say its great and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this mascara would be awesome but I was disappointed. I have straight eyelashes, like straight straight. I have to use an eyelash curler to get them to curl at all. The first time I used this, I curled my eyelashes per usual and applied the mascara. The mascara made my eyelashes go totally straight. Ugh. So the next time I tried wiping some of the mascara off the wand thinking it was too wet and that&#x27;s why my eyelashes went straight. No luck. The wand is really comb-y which is great for not leaving clumps, but it pulls my eyelashes too much and makes them straight. I don&#x27;t usually have this problem with mascara.&lt;br /&gt;So anyways, I just thought I&#x27;d help a straight-eyelashed sister out. This mascara doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I saw this on a tutorial on YouTube and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot and it really is a good mascara. It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t run or smudge easily.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my mascara because my eyes water a lot due to allergies.  I need something waterproof that does not harden on my lashes.  I saw a commercial for this featuring Pink...and as crazy as this sounds, I just love her.  I decided I wanted to try this since the only mascara I like is sold out through Avon...not sure if it will be discontinued.  It doesn&#x27;t really matter anymore because I have found my new favorite mascara.  It goes on smooth &amp; easy with the curved brush.  My lashes stay soft &amp; its easy to wash off.  I definitely recommend giving this mascara a try!</li>
            <li> This has become the most recent must-have makeup product. I was skeptical at first but I decided to try it because it seemed like a low risk investment at this price. I really like this mascara because it totally lets each individual lash shine. It works great to separate and lengthen - emphasis on separate. There are other mascaras that lengthen better but this product is best for fanning and lengthening without the clumping.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that it flakes (and I also didn&#x27;t purchase on amazon), but I love CG clump crusher as a base coat to separate and volumize my lashes. To mitigate flaking, I simply cover with a top coat of my fave upscale mascara: Hypnose by Lancome. That stays creamy and lustrous all day, feels very conditioning - and doesn&#x27;t flake. Best of both worlds. CG clump crusher to start and Lancome Hypnose to finish. I get compliment on my lashes all the time. Go for it!</li>
            <li> It does what it advertises it will do. I&#x27;m very satisfied and pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product. I never expected to like a cosmetic product at this price level.</li>
