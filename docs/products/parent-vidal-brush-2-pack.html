            <li>The best thing is the brush isn&#x27;t destroyed - it&#x27;s still intact after you get done brushing.    </li>

            <li>While the Vidal Sassoon Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush is great for keeping my ends from curling up, if I use it on the rest of my hair, I get flyaway hair.  </li>

            <li>It is nice to find a brush that is inexpensive (some on this site are $40!)</li>

            <li>/&gt;Brush looks good with a nice handle and good weight distribution.</li>

            <li>This is my favorite brush ever!  </li>
            <li>PRODUCT WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MORE!</li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This hair brush is amazing..</li>
            <li>I bought this brush for my wife as a gift after reading all the reviews touting it&#x27;s amazing ability.</li>
            <li>It looks really nice and sleek.</li>
            <li>so I will probably just purchase another and make sure it is in good shape before I use it.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it is a nice brush, but not 5</li>
            <li>With that being said I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a nice brush that can handle my hair.</li>
            <li>* Has nice weight in the handle</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush ...</li>
            <li>This brush does an effective job of stimulating the scalp and brushing the hair, without breaking the hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush is nicely balanced.</li>
            <li>that others I already own.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even made an offhand comment that he likes using my brush more than his because it feels so much better than his brush, so that should give you an idea of how good it</li>
            <li>i loveeeee this brush although the handle fell off very easily</li>
            <li>This brush is nice, but the bristles are more flexible than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality parts, a nice heft to it, and finger indentations on either side for a better grip on the handle.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the feel, it has a good grip</li>
            <li>More amazing</li>
            <li>The catcher is...is that if you honestly believe that any of this is true....then you need to get out more......</li>
            <li>It does a nice job, but it could be better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good hair brush with light weight.</li>
            <li>It still feels pretty good, with good substance.  </li>
            <li>I bought the gift for my granddaughter who also has very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect brush for me nice solid build.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and works great.  </li>
            <li>This is a very cheaply made product.  </li>
            <li>Bristle tips just fell off within a month of very light use.</li>
            <li>I love that it helps to prevent static electricity.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I opted for this one.</li>
            <li>Ok I have to admit, I read the reviews more than the description...</li>
            <li>and the brush did not work for me in regard to static.</li>
            <li>It caused more static.      </li>
            <li>Well, I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I am planning to buy another one for on the go &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a reason to spend more than $5 on a brush</li>
            <li>and i love this brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 300 pounds and 5&#x27;2 and just by using this brush I was able to pick up not 1 but 2 playboy models that just can&#x27;t seem to keep their hands off me after I brush my hair..</li>
            <li>I love the design and the color.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a very good product!</li>
            <li>This brush does a much better job.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that this brush will work better than everybody&#x27;s brushes</li>
            <li>but I guess there&#x27;s something about this that makes it better than the rest.</li>
            <li>This brush is all synthetic and all the better for it.  </li>
            <li>I thought OK, for the price, why not try it.  </li>
            <li>It was everything and more.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it feels in my hands.</li>
            <li>Not the best build quality, I&#x27;ve only had the thing for a couple months and already it&#x27;s falling apart.</li>
            <li>love love it</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Okay so I&#x27;m Blk and Hawaiian</li>
            <li>I lose more hair.  </li>
            <li>, that works well, doesn&#x27;t snag, and gives me that \\&quot;all the way to the scalp\\&quot; rub I so love.  </li>
            <li>Find sth better.</li>
            <li>It looks elegant.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>11/7/2008&lt;br /&gt;Again bought 2 more.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t, so I love it.</li>
            <li>Nice n smooth to brush the hair.</li>
            <li>static&#x27;y at all, and so minimizes frizzing by brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it if you want healthy looking hair again.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with it</li>
            <li>I love the brush.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I will not use it any more.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t get static-y from using this, which I love.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of these to have when it comes time to replace the one I just got.</li>
            <li>The brush is well made and I&#x27;m satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I just hope the magic doesn&#x27;t wear off or run out because I&#x27;m clueless as to how to refill it.</li>
            <li>My dogs love it</li>
            <li>and I also Love it</li>
            <li>The bristles are fabulous!</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush b/c of it&#x27;s claim to reduce static.  </li>
            <li>All the good reviews are right.  </li>
            <li>My daughter brought me the Bass brush and it&#x27;s been the best of the 3 with nice bristles and a somewhat ergonomic handle</li>
            <li>It was a pretty good hair brush otherwise,</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s breaking was pretty surprising.    </li>
            <li>pretty good</li>
            <li>All Purpose Brush this was a reasonably priced gift and my daughter really liked it!</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think that the kind of brush you have could really change the way your hair looks so drastically.</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to handle, this brush has no problem with my hair and makes the task easy to manage!</li>
            <li>Very good brush overall</li>
            <li>my old hairdryer died I happily purchased another one from Amazon, this brush was a tag-a-long product and cost almost nothing.  </li>
            <li>My daughter who has much thicker hair than me used it, and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>It turned out the reviewers who kept mentioning still having static and mentioning they had fine hair were accurate, I have &#x27;&#x27;fine hair but alot of it&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>Makes curling with a blowdrier easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to comb hair without fuzzy the end.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tangle and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>The brush feels sturdy and is easy to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>The Bristles bend easily though.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>At first, I really liked this brush and would have given it 5 stars -- lots of bristles and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>I passed it on to my daughter who has fine hair</li>
            <li>This is an amazing brush for pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li>As a brush, it is perfect for using on my hair, but less than a month after I bought it and started using it, the handle separated from the brush piece.  </li>
            <li>This brush causes static in my hair, I don&#x27;t feel that I get the shine and quick drying that was described.</li>
            <li>Its not painful, I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE HUGE difference in static.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great brush, and I do in fact recommend you buying it if you want to easily untangle your hair in a short period of time, without pulling out an excess of hair.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t have that -- I just clean my hair out of it every so often and it looks good as new.</li>
            <li>it is so light weight.</li>
            <li>Hair comes out smooth when used with hairdryer.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair shiny and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m trying to learn to be &#x27;&#x27;detailed and specific\\&quot; and write what I would have wanted to know before purchase, hence the length and detail)     </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for about a month, but just last week the handle snapped off and I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; brush and decided to pick this up because of 1) the price, and 2) free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Well made, comfortable, no prickly bristles.</li>
            <li>The handle broke after one month of light use.  </li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>BRUSH IS WELL MADE, EASY TO CLEAN</li>
            <li>It was a cheap brush</li>
            <li>My sister liked it so much I had to get her one too.</li>
            <li>The handle is sturdy and comfortable to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great quality brush</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is  light</li>
            <li>It feels fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Soft but feel good on the scalp, protected ends as not to tare your hair or your scalp.  </li>
            <li>This one does not only withstand the high temperatures but also tends to smoothen and soften your hair during drying and reduces static greatly, even more if you use an ionic hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the tangles but not so great for really brushing the hair smoothly or getting down to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using it, as it is the best brush I have for straightening with a blow dryer right now, and it does work--just takes longer due to size and shape--</li>
            <li>While I use this brush most during my \\&quot;blow dry\\&quot; sessions, the brush also works nicely with dry hair and helps to control static.  </li>
            <li>brush is also SUPER easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth buying this brush for $6.00!</li>
            <li>This was a great brush, as long as you don&#x27;t use it while blow drying your hair.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it at some department store because I needed one</li>
            <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t tear it out like many others, even if your hair is pretty tangled (which mine gets quite a bit).</li>
            <li>my hair is fine and straight and lots of brushes put static in my hair.</li>
            <li>* today because it is a great brush as long as it&#x27;s not overpriced!</li>
            <li>I got it and tried it out and not only did it work really well, but it felt good!</li>
            <li>I can hardly believe I&#x27;m writing a review about a hair brush, but this brush is so awesome</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and straight, but it still tangles easily.</li>
            <li>All the reviews for this brush are true.</li>
            <li>This is not the best brush for thick hair.  </li>
            <li>but if you are looking for a good brush, I will definitely recommned the Vidal Sassoon brush.</li>
            <li>I hear it&#x27;s even responsible for free health care, so support your country!</li>
            <li>It feels good in the hand and works well on my fragile permed hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for styling while blow drying  my medium length thick hair.</li>
            <li>This brush is the perfect firmness for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Feels more gentle on my hair too.</li>
            <li>The other two were great but</li>
            <li>It detangles hair quickly and painlessly while keeping frizz to a minimum.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush of many years finally needed to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly fine/ thin hair, so I can&#x27;t imagine this being good for anyone.</li>
            <li>It would be great if I just wanted to brush my hair, but I want to use it to blow dry my hair straight!  </li>
            <li>making dandruff worse, you&#x27;ll be happy to hear that this will be better than the cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>I am sure it would have worked on my hair a lot better if it was half-rounded instead of flat.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I did because the brush is really solid.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good hair brush that doesn&#x27;t leave lines from the brush in my hair when I put it in a ponytail for who knows how long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an attractive brush, black and &#x27;&#x27;chrome&#x27;&#x27; color.  </li>
            <li>I know this brush has all kinds of claims for it (ionic, thermal, etc.), and that may all be true, but for me the part that makes a huge difference is that it really IS an \\&quot;all purpose\\&quot; brush.     </li>
            <li>My hair gets easily frizzy and this brush is an absolute god send.</li>
            <li>All the individual pegs are resilient and the brush gives my hair a nice shine and full look when used along with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>As funny as it sounds, I got a scalp massager and a brush in one purchase!</li>
            <li>It is well constructed and the tips of the bristles are soft and very comfortable...</li>
            <li>What a difference it makes compared to my old brush (that was not ionic and more money).</li>
            <li>and it will be well worth it.</li>
            <li>It is great to blow dry with and is also great on dry hair, less static.</li>
            <li>I loved it until it started to fall apart, which was way sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li>Nice and low damage for hair.</li>
            <li>I returned this twice and decided to just get a different kind.  </li>
            <li>Nice rubberized handle and feels solid and well made.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and does not create static while brushing.</li>
            <li>I liked the brush but it only lasted about a year.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping/assuming it would be useful for brush styling my hair with my blowdryer.  </li>
            <li>i added this brush to the cart to go with the new blow dryer i was getting and while it worked it was pretty okay...</li>
            <li>Size of brush head is good (not too big and not too small) and the weight and grip feel good in my hand.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about this brush is the small brush tips allow you to clean the shed hair out of the brush easily.</li>
            <li>Its $7 right now</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel right returning it</li>
            <li>right where the handle joins the brush head.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li>They break right where the silver ring is.</li>
            <li>The bristles are long enough to be ideal for an all-purpose hair brush.</li>
            <li>and it looked like it wasn&#x27;t total junk, and it quickly became my favorite brush ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the anti frizz claims, but it does a great job.</li>
            <li>I have long kind of curly hair</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair and this brush makes my hair straight and shine immediately.</li>
            <li>So on the whole, this is a pretty good hair brush on the cheap side for everyday hair brushing.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>I find it is easy to clean out all the hair compared to my last brush</li>
            <li>I was really impressed with the sturdiness of this brush, the bristles are just stiff enough to hold up all the way to the scalp.</li>
            <li>In summary, I like this brush very much, would buy it again for myself, and/or purchase it for friends and family.</li>
            <li>How hard is it to make a great brush.  </li>
            <li>In my search for better hair I have purchased more and more expensive shampoos, conditioners and styling products.  </li>
            <li>As brushes go, this is pretty good one for all around everyday use.     </li>
            <li>What M. Wolf said in her review is exactly on point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently lost it somewhere in my house, went on a frantic search through amazon for a replacement, and was incredibly pleased to find this exact brush on here.</li>
            <li>I like this brush, it would be better if it has vent holes in the back.  </li>
            <li>the item is exactly as it was advertised.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for my wife.</li>
            <li>Okay, I don&#x27;t get my hair cut regularly, and I don&#x27;t spend hours in front of the mirror.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see it lasting more than a year</li>
            <li>Dries my hair so much faster!</li>
            <li>and all in all so does this product ;)</li>
            <li>This is the first brush that I have ever used that did this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a brush that would keep the static out of my hair, especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that i remember in the description it says removes static or no static and its the most static I have ever seen a brush produce.</li>
            <li>This brush is exactly how it is described.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good everyday brush.  </li>
            <li>I have black nappy hair and this brush is very good on it, especially after i spray my hair with oil and water.</li>
            <li>I love this brush air flows throught for a super fast dry time.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see that this brush was such a good value and a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>Pretty hard actually; think of the brushes that combed your hair perfectly...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looked like a quality brush at first, good handle, nice bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a month and I noticed little black dots in my sink.</li>
            <li>She has a drawer full of hairbrushes; some are ten years old and are in better shape than this junk.</li>
            <li>I basically bought this product because I wanted to get the free shipping if you spend over $25 and had a few more dollars to go.</li>
            <li>Very durable; I&#x27;ve had the first one for 4+ years</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t tangle and that&#x27;s a great advantage over other similarly- designed brushes!!</li>
            <li>The nylon bristles don&#x27;t tug my hair out and they&#x27;re actually pretty gentle.</li>
            <li>Still... finding a brush that gets down to the root and gives a nice massage on the scalp instead of a scratching is a rarity.</li>
            <li>Whereas with my Maxius I would need to pull out a nylon bristle brush to get my ponytail neat, this brush easily transitioned as there are just enough bristles to function as a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brush as well.  </li>
            <li>* Does not cause static when brushing dry</li>
            <li>Would strongly recommend it - especially with longer hair</li>
            <li>A good buy that should last a long time.</li>
            <li>Pure junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I like to use a brush with a large diameter, to keep the hair straighter --</li>
            <li>Great brush for wet or dry</li>
            <li>I was so excited the first time I brushed my hair with this brush just after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty particular about my brush...</li>
            <li>I have a metal round brush that has bigger ball things on the ends that works a little better to pull my hair straight, so I use that one most of the time, but this one is nice b/c</li>
            <li>This is a great basic, everyday brush.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on this brush, I decided to purchase it, but didn&#x27;t expect much for $6.oo.  </li>
            <li>Anyone relate to my &#x27;&#x27;wanting to really like this brush but...\\&quot;???  </li>
            <li>I read all the existing reviews at the time of purchase (very recently) and I&#x27;m giving this 5-stars because it&#x27;s durably constructed and comfortable to hold</li>
            <li>&#x27;s the measurements in-case anyone wants to know if it&#x27;s a take-along brush for them or a stay-at-home or both...    BRUSH DIMENSIONS:  </li>
            <li>This brush really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I really like the weight and the material it was made from.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Definitely highly recommended!</li>
            <li>so much so that my husband uses it as well.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and it does tend to get real tangled.  </li>
            <li>In comparison, I have had brushes for years, and they have not broken.  </li>
            <li>the description for this product does not lie; compared to my $1 brushes, it really isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>and i am falling asleep in a lecture at the moment, haha.</li>
            <li>But for now, after about a month, the brush performs very well.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s held up very well.</li>
            <li>It really works as described.</li>
            <li>My girl really says that it removes knots in her hair effortlessly.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable as well.</li>
            <li>but my guess is that it would work very well with shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really vouch for its thermal, shine characteristics.</li>
            <li>Seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It is well made and doesn&#x27;t seem to snag my hair as much.  </li>
            <li>Random side note, the handle is made of awesome soft rubbery stuff.</li>
            <li>So, I was pleasantly surprised to see that so many found the same qualities in this brush that I did.  </li>
            <li>I hope this brush last longer than the last ones so far so good.</li>
            <li>When your friends walk into the room while your brushing your hair they will say WOW !!!</li>
            <li>Gets all the way down to the roots, pulls through the hair easily, and doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li>Anywhoo, it goes right through tangled hair, and it&#x27;s soft to your scalp, and if you are worried about it</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with this brush at first, but after 6 months of light usage the adhesive joining the handle to the brush head disintegrated, and most of the bristle tips fell off (making brushing a somewhat painful experience).</li>
            <li>CONs:  - Contrary to some other reviews, I do get static when I brush my hair sometimes.</li>
            <li>Seems like most other brushes to me.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, many other bristles are bent over from what appears to be heat damage from her hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This is the best brush ever my daughter have thick long natural curly hair and lets me say it dont take forever to brush her hair now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the very high end expensive brushes, but this one actually works the best so far above all the others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, long hair.</li>
            <li>The first month I feel I finally find the right comb, but</li>
            <li>- Is good with both wet and dry hair  </li>
            <li>Good on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>For five bucks and change (what I spent), it&#x27;s a good, basic, and useful brush if you have long hair and value your tresses.</li>
            <li>I liked this at first, but after a few months several of the rounded tips at the end of each bristle came off, creating a brush that is very scratchy.  </li>
            <li>came in on time, and make my hair smooth, would just be easier to blow dry with if it had vents.</li>
            <li>After looking at many brushes both in local stores and online (reading countless reviews), I decided to purchase this brush ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I knocked one star off of my rating because I think the price is high for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Weird to get excited about a hairbrush, but this leaves my hair perfect with no static or flyways.  </li>
            <li>It seems to smooth my hair better than other more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going for a more straightened sleeker look, then I use this brush during the bulk of my blow drying time and finish off my styling efforts with a round brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also highly recommend my new dryer</li>
            <li>This is a very affordable brush that helps control static, fits the hand, and is neither to soft nor too stiff.</li>
            <li>Use it with my ionic ceramic hair dryer and the result is straight, smooth hair in half the time.</li>
            <li>because I don&#x27;t see any difference in it from any other cheap brush you&#x27;d get at the store.</li>
            <li>God forbid the hairdressing shop have a new product in that</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t return it for a new one.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush - gentle on hair when it is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>but it still isn&#x27;t my Vidal Sassoon, which I never had problems with physically and left my hair smooth and silky.    </li>
            <li>It far exceeded all expectations and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I bought one last year, lost it and bought another one, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I went back online to by another one only to find that the price went from $6.99 to $25.46 in less than one month.  </li>
            <li>It leaves her hair looking so pretty that it is the only brush she uses.</li>
            <li>my hair looks shiny and soft using this brush!  </li>
            <li>But this brush has worked awesomely (no static and smooth shiny hair!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same brush I bought almost one year ago (again, at 6.24)</li>
            <li>I gave the brush 4* with my original review due to the price gouge.</li>
            <li>Overall the look &amp; feel is different than the original brush.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nearly indistinguishable from the new one.</li>
            <li>Again, I wanted to like this brush but evidently having alot of fine hair versus dense, thick hair combined with a sensitive scalp won&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>The brush is now still pretty effective but uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Finish with a small dab of Glass or any other silicone product for fabulous smooth tresses</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re kinda sensitive, it&#x27;s going to either take getting used to</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp and it doesn&#x27;t bother it at all.</li>
            <li>I am a young girl with natural hair</li>
            <li>I have been using it for at least a month and am well pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and the bristles are still complete and intact.</li>
            <li>Gives a soft massaging feel when brushing.</li>
            <li>Its not heavy, doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair.</li>
            <li>This brush goes through my hair nicely, however the handle had completely broken off after 8 or 9 months of use.</li>
            <li>good quality, but expensive</li>
            <li>I then brushed the left side of my head with this brush and the right side with my old brush.</li>
            <li>- Wide bristle mean that it doesn&#x27;t snag or pull my hair that often (but will still do a good job)    </li>
            <li>I have very long thick hair and this vent brush is great to quickly dry my hair before heading to work.</li>
            <li>Been using this brush for several months and it easily has outlasted the previous brush I bought at Ulta.</li>
            <li>To be serious, the &#x27;shark brush&#x27; is much, much better quality.</li>
            <li>I usually buy cheap brushes at the store but decided to splurge and buy this fancier brush off amazon.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new brush after losing my last one after a move.</li>
            <li>and I really recomend this product for men hair blow dry and styling.</li>
            <li>wish i can find a better everyday long lasting brush.</li>
            <li>So i recently had to buy a new brush because my old one got left in a hotel room.</li>
            <li>Use the brush with my new hair dryer and then use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>My general hairstyle is a sleek bob with the ends turned under and curling towards my face on the sides.  </li>
            <li>I was constantly getting snags and tangles with my old brush.</li>
            <li>I bet they did, especially if they were natural.  </li>
            <li>Now barely usable.</li>
            <li>But apparently my daughter likes it too.</li>
            <li>I can totally relate now to the rave reviews about those with thick, dense hair...and to the reviewers who kinda told me &#x27;&#x27;not for fine hair&#x27;&#x27;.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles are spaced far enough apart to lift the hair, but close enough to style it in whatever fashion you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wanted to replace a similar brush ive had for 10 years, but I went back to using the old brush.</li>
            <li>B0046HJM5M Bass Large Oval Nylon Hair Brush -- 1 Brush]] ]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through several brushes where either the heft of my hair pulls the pins out of the brushes, or the brushes have needles so close together that pulling them through my hair is torture and a major cause of split</li>
            <li>While there is not much that is to be said about it, I have to say it is the high quality that one would expect from a Vidal Sassoon brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush was amazing when it was new, but after a few months of using it the rounded tips started coming off the individual bristles leaving behind bristles that scratch your scalp.</li>
            <li>Take the other reviewer&#x27;s advice and keep it in cart for when the price drops back to a reasonable amount.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used the brush, it was working well.</li>
            <li>The plastic tips on the bristles started coming off in the first few uses, in my hair and all over my bathroom.</li>
            <li>it brushes each strand of my hair straight down without pulling out any hair from knots.</li>
            <li>My hair is really a lot shinier and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have chin length hair that is fine textured, but very thick.  </li>
            <li>I used super-glue to re-attach the broken halves together, and it worked fine for another 3 months.</li>
            <li>The little balls on the top of the bristles were falling off, so it became hard on my scalp.</li>
            <li>She excitedly told me that it dried her hair in half the time, smoothed out tangles easier than any brush she&#x27;s ever used before, and left her hair with an extra shine</li>

            <li> It is nice to find a brush that is inexpensive (some on this site are $40!)</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking at my review for that kind of use, look elsewhere!  </li>

            <li> It looks good</li>
            <li> but as it is on the picture, and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> Keeps hair looking good from shampoo to shampoo.  </li>
            <li> good well made sturdy brush.</li>
            <li> She asked if she could keep it because it made her scalp feel good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that detangles without snaging my very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Brush looks good with a nice handle and good weight distribution.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find it at this price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it worked great.</li>
            <li> Love this because it works great on my hair during humidity.  </li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  </li>
            <li> Keeps me looking like an outright respectable mountain man!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed!</li>
            <li> I love this for straightening with a blow dryer!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush ever!  </li>
            <li> PRODUCT WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MORE!</li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> This hair brush is amazing..</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my wife as a gift after reading all the reviews touting it&#x27;s amazing ability.</li>
            <li> It looks really nice and sleek.</li>
            <li> so I will probably just purchase another and make sure it is in good shape before I use it.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it is a nice brush, but not 5</li>
            <li> With that being said I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a nice brush that can handle my hair.</li>
            <li> * Has nice weight in the handle</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush ...</li>
            <li> This brush does an effective job of stimulating the scalp and brushing the hair, without breaking the hair.  </li>
            <li> This brush is nicely balanced.</li>
            <li> that others I already own.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even made an offhand comment that he likes using my brush more than his because it feels so much better than his brush, so that should give you an idea of how good it</li>
            <li> i loveeeee this brush although the handle fell off very easily</li>
            <li> This brush is nice, but the bristles are more flexible than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality parts, a nice heft to it, and finger indentations on either side for a better grip on the handle.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the feel, it has a good grip</li>
            <li> More amazing</li>
            <li> The catcher is...is that if you honestly believe that any of this is true....then you need to get out more......</li>
            <li> It does a nice job, but it could be better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good hair brush with light weight.</li>
            <li> It still feels pretty good, with good substance.  </li>
            <li> I bought the gift for my granddaughter who also has very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for me nice solid build.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and works great.  </li>
            <li> This is a very cheaply made product.  </li>
            <li> Bristle tips just fell off within a month of very light use.</li>
            <li> I love that it helps to prevent static electricity.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad I opted for this one.</li>
            <li> Ok I have to admit, I read the reviews more than the description...</li>
            <li> and the brush did not work for me in regard to static.</li>
            <li> It caused more static.      </li>
            <li> Well, I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I am planning to buy another one for on the go &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a reason to spend more than $5 on a brush</li>
            <li> and i love this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 300 pounds and 5&#x27;2 and just by using this brush I was able to pick up not 1 but 2 playboy models that just can&#x27;t seem to keep their hands off me after I brush my hair..</li>
            <li> I love the design and the color.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a very good product!</li>
            <li> This brush does a much better job.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this brush will work better than everybody&#x27;s brushes</li>
            <li> but I guess there&#x27;s something about this that makes it better than the rest.</li>
            <li> This brush is all synthetic and all the better for it.  </li>
            <li> I thought OK, for the price, why not try it.  </li>
            <li> It was everything and more.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it feels in my hands.</li>
            <li> Not the best build quality, I&#x27;ve only had the thing for a couple months and already it&#x27;s falling apart.</li>
            <li> love love it</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;m Blk and Hawaiian</li>
            <li> I lose more hair.  </li>
            <li> , that works well, doesn&#x27;t snag, and gives me that \\&quot;all the way to the scalp\\&quot; rub I so love.  </li>
            <li> Find sth better.</li>
            <li> It looks elegant.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> 11/7/2008&lt;br /&gt;Again bought 2 more.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t, so I love it.</li>
            <li> Nice n smooth to brush the hair.</li>
            <li> static&#x27;y at all, and so minimizes frizzing by brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it if you want healthy looking hair again.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with it</li>
            <li> I love the brush.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I will not use it any more.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t get static-y from using this, which I love.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of these to have when it comes time to replace the one I just got.</li>
            <li> The brush is well made and I&#x27;m satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I just hope the magic doesn&#x27;t wear off or run out because I&#x27;m clueless as to how to refill it.</li>
            <li> My dogs love it</li>
            <li> and I also Love it</li>
            <li> The bristles are fabulous!</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush b/c of it&#x27;s claim to reduce static.  </li>
            <li> All the good reviews are right.  </li>
            <li> My daughter brought me the Bass brush and it&#x27;s been the best of the 3 with nice bristles and a somewhat ergonomic handle</li>
            <li> It was a pretty good hair brush otherwise,</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s breaking was pretty surprising.    </li>
            <li> pretty good</li>
            <li> All Purpose Brush this was a reasonably priced gift and my daughter really liked it!</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think that the kind of brush you have could really change the way your hair looks so drastically.</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to handle, this brush has no problem with my hair and makes the task easy to manage!</li>
            <li> Very good brush overall</li>
            <li> my old hairdryer died I happily purchased another one from Amazon, this brush was a tag-a-long product and cost almost nothing.  </li>
            <li> My daughter who has much thicker hair than me used it, and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> It turned out the reviewers who kept mentioning still having static and mentioning they had fine hair were accurate, I have &#x27;&#x27;fine hair but alot of it&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Makes curling with a blowdrier easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to comb hair without fuzzy the end.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tangle and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> The brush feels sturdy and is easy to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> The Bristles bend easily though.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> At first, I really liked this brush and would have given it 5 stars -- lots of bristles and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> I passed it on to my daughter who has fine hair</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush for pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li> As a brush, it is perfect for using on my hair, but less than a month after I bought it and started using it, the handle separated from the brush piece.  </li>
            <li> This brush causes static in my hair, I don&#x27;t feel that I get the shine and quick drying that was described.</li>
            <li> Its not painful, I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE HUGE difference in static.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great brush, and I do in fact recommend you buying it if you want to easily untangle your hair in a short period of time, without pulling out an excess of hair.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t have that -- I just clean my hair out of it every so often and it looks good as new.</li>
            <li> it is so light weight.</li>
            <li> Hair comes out smooth when used with hairdryer.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair shiny and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m trying to learn to be &#x27;&#x27;detailed and specific\\&quot; and write what I would have wanted to know before purchase, hence the length and detail)     </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> It worked great for about a month, but just last week the handle snapped off and I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; brush and decided to pick this up because of 1) the price, and 2) free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Well made, comfortable, no prickly bristles.</li>
            <li> The handle broke after one month of light use.  </li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li> BRUSH IS WELL MADE, EASY TO CLEAN</li>
            <li> It was a cheap brush</li>
            <li> My sister liked it so much I had to get her one too.</li>
            <li> The handle is sturdy and comfortable to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great quality brush</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is  light</li>
            <li> It feels fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Soft but feel good on the scalp, protected ends as not to tare your hair or your scalp.  </li>
            <li> This one does not only withstand the high temperatures but also tends to smoothen and soften your hair during drying and reduces static greatly, even more if you use an ionic hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the tangles but not so great for really brushing the hair smoothly or getting down to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using it, as it is the best brush I have for straightening with a blow dryer right now, and it does work--just takes longer due to size and shape--</li>
            <li> While I use this brush most during my \\&quot;blow dry\\&quot; sessions, the brush also works nicely with dry hair and helps to control static.  </li>
            <li> brush is also SUPER easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth buying this brush for $6.00!</li>
            <li> This was a great brush, as long as you don&#x27;t use it while blow drying your hair.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought it at some department store because I needed one</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t tear it out like many others, even if your hair is pretty tangled (which mine gets quite a bit).</li>
            <li> my hair is fine and straight and lots of brushes put static in my hair.</li>
            <li> * today because it is a great brush as long as it&#x27;s not overpriced!</li>
            <li> I got it and tried it out and not only did it work really well, but it felt good!</li>
            <li> I can hardly believe I&#x27;m writing a review about a hair brush, but this brush is so awesome</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and straight, but it still tangles easily.</li>
            <li> All the reviews for this brush are true.</li>
            <li> This is not the best brush for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> but if you are looking for a good brush, I will definitely recommned the Vidal Sassoon brush.</li>
            <li> I hear it&#x27;s even responsible for free health care, so support your country!</li>
            <li> It feels good in the hand and works well on my fragile permed hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for styling while blow drying  my medium length thick hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is the perfect firmness for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Feels more gentle on my hair too.</li>
            <li> The other two were great but</li>
            <li> It detangles hair quickly and painlessly while keeping frizz to a minimum.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush of many years finally needed to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly fine/ thin hair, so I can&#x27;t imagine this being good for anyone.</li>
            <li> It would be great if I just wanted to brush my hair, but I want to use it to blow dry my hair straight!  </li>
            <li> making dandruff worse, you&#x27;ll be happy to hear that this will be better than the cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> I am sure it would have worked on my hair a lot better if it was half-rounded instead of flat.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I did because the brush is really solid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good hair brush that doesn&#x27;t leave lines from the brush in my hair when I put it in a ponytail for who knows how long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an attractive brush, black and &#x27;&#x27;chrome&#x27;&#x27; color.  </li>
            <li> I know this brush has all kinds of claims for it (ionic, thermal, etc.), and that may all be true, but for me the part that makes a huge difference is that it really IS an \\&quot;all purpose\\&quot; brush.     </li>
            <li> My hair gets easily frizzy and this brush is an absolute god send.</li>
            <li> All the individual pegs are resilient and the brush gives my hair a nice shine and full look when used along with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> As funny as it sounds, I got a scalp massager and a brush in one purchase!</li>
            <li> It is well constructed and the tips of the bristles are soft and very comfortable...</li>
            <li> What a difference it makes compared to my old brush (that was not ionic and more money).</li>
            <li> and it will be well worth it.</li>
            <li> It is great to blow dry with and is also great on dry hair, less static.</li>
            <li> I loved it until it started to fall apart, which was way sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Nice and low damage for hair.</li>
            <li> I returned this twice and decided to just get a different kind.  </li>
            <li> Nice rubberized handle and feels solid and well made.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and does not create static while brushing.</li>
            <li> I liked the brush but it only lasted about a year.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping/assuming it would be useful for brush styling my hair with my blowdryer.  </li>
            <li> i added this brush to the cart to go with the new blow dryer i was getting and while it worked it was pretty okay...</li>
            <li> Size of brush head is good (not too big and not too small) and the weight and grip feel good in my hand.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about this brush is the small brush tips allow you to clean the shed hair out of the brush easily.</li>
            <li> Its $7 right now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel right returning it</li>
            <li> right where the handle joins the brush head.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> They break right where the silver ring is.</li>
            <li> The bristles are long enough to be ideal for an all-purpose hair brush.</li>
            <li> and it looked like it wasn&#x27;t total junk, and it quickly became my favorite brush ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the anti frizz claims, but it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I have long kind of curly hair</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair and this brush makes my hair straight and shine immediately.</li>
            <li> So on the whole, this is a pretty good hair brush on the cheap side for everyday hair brushing.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I find it is easy to clean out all the hair compared to my last brush</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the sturdiness of this brush, the bristles are just stiff enough to hold up all the way to the scalp.</li>
            <li> In summary, I like this brush very much, would buy it again for myself, and/or purchase it for friends and family.</li>
            <li> How hard is it to make a great brush.  </li>
            <li> In my search for better hair I have purchased more and more expensive shampoos, conditioners and styling products.  </li>
            <li> As brushes go, this is pretty good one for all around everyday use.     </li>
            <li> What M. Wolf said in her review is exactly on point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently lost it somewhere in my house, went on a frantic search through amazon for a replacement, and was incredibly pleased to find this exact brush on here.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, it would be better if it has vent holes in the back.  </li>
            <li> the item is exactly as it was advertised.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for my wife.</li>
            <li> Okay, I don&#x27;t get my hair cut regularly, and I don&#x27;t spend hours in front of the mirror.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see it lasting more than a year</li>
            <li> Dries my hair so much faster!</li>
            <li> and all in all so does this product ;)</li>
            <li> This is the first brush that I have ever used that did this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a brush that would keep the static out of my hair, especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that i remember in the description it says removes static or no static and its the most static I have ever seen a brush produce.</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly how it is described.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good everyday brush.  </li>
            <li> I have black nappy hair and this brush is very good on it, especially after i spray my hair with oil and water.</li>
            <li> I love this brush air flows throught for a super fast dry time.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see that this brush was such a good value and a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> Pretty hard actually; think of the brushes that combed your hair perfectly...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looked like a quality brush at first, good handle, nice bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a month and I noticed little black dots in my sink.</li>
            <li> She has a drawer full of hairbrushes; some are ten years old and are in better shape than this junk.</li>
            <li> I basically bought this product because I wanted to get the free shipping if you spend over $25 and had a few more dollars to go.</li>
            <li> Very durable; I&#x27;ve had the first one for 4+ years</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t tangle and that&#x27;s a great advantage over other similarly- designed brushes!!</li>
            <li> The nylon bristles don&#x27;t tug my hair out and they&#x27;re actually pretty gentle.</li>
            <li> Still... finding a brush that gets down to the root and gives a nice massage on the scalp instead of a scratching is a rarity.</li>
            <li> Whereas with my Maxius I would need to pull out a nylon bristle brush to get my ponytail neat, this brush easily transitioned as there are just enough bristles to function as a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brush as well.  </li>
            <li> * Does not cause static when brushing dry</li>
            <li> Would strongly recommend it - especially with longer hair</li>
            <li> A good buy that should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Pure junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I like to use a brush with a large diameter, to keep the hair straighter --</li>
            <li> Great brush for wet or dry</li>
            <li> I was so excited the first time I brushed my hair with this brush just after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty particular about my brush...</li>
            <li> I have a metal round brush that has bigger ball things on the ends that works a little better to pull my hair straight, so I use that one most of the time, but this one is nice b/c</li>
            <li> This is a great basic, everyday brush.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this brush, I decided to purchase it, but didn&#x27;t expect much for $6.oo.  </li>
            <li> Anyone relate to my &#x27;&#x27;wanting to really like this brush but...\\&quot;???  </li>
            <li> I read all the existing reviews at the time of purchase (very recently) and I&#x27;m giving this 5-stars because it&#x27;s durably constructed and comfortable to hold</li>
            <li> &#x27;s the measurements in-case anyone wants to know if it&#x27;s a take-along brush for them or a stay-at-home or both...    BRUSH DIMENSIONS:  </li>
            <li> This brush really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like the weight and the material it was made from.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Definitely highly recommended!</li>
            <li> so much so that my husband uses it as well.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and it does tend to get real tangled.  </li>
            <li> In comparison, I have had brushes for years, and they have not broken.  </li>
            <li> the description for this product does not lie; compared to my $1 brushes, it really isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> and i am falling asleep in a lecture at the moment, haha.</li>
            <li> But for now, after about a month, the brush performs very well.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very durable.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s held up very well.</li>
            <li> It really works as described.</li>
            <li> My girl really says that it removes knots in her hair effortlessly.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> but my guess is that it would work very well with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really vouch for its thermal, shine characteristics.</li>
            <li> Seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li> It is well made and doesn&#x27;t seem to snag my hair as much.  </li>
            <li> Random side note, the handle is made of awesome soft rubbery stuff.</li>
            <li> So, I was pleasantly surprised to see that so many found the same qualities in this brush that I did.  </li>
            <li> I hope this brush last longer than the last ones so far so good.</li>
            <li> When your friends walk into the room while your brushing your hair they will say WOW !!!</li>
            <li> Gets all the way down to the roots, pulls through the hair easily, and doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> Anywhoo, it goes right through tangled hair, and it&#x27;s soft to your scalp, and if you are worried about it</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with this brush at first, but after 6 months of light usage the adhesive joining the handle to the brush head disintegrated, and most of the bristle tips fell off (making brushing a somewhat painful experience).</li>
            <li> CONs:  - Contrary to some other reviews, I do get static when I brush my hair sometimes.</li>
            <li> Seems like most other brushes to me.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, many other bristles are bent over from what appears to be heat damage from her hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ever my daughter have thick long natural curly hair and lets me say it dont take forever to brush her hair now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the very high end expensive brushes, but this one actually works the best so far above all the others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, long hair.</li>
            <li> The first month I feel I finally find the right comb, but</li>
            <li> - Is good with both wet and dry hair  </li>
            <li> Good on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> For five bucks and change (what I spent), it&#x27;s a good, basic, and useful brush if you have long hair and value your tresses.</li>
            <li> I liked this at first, but after a few months several of the rounded tips at the end of each bristle came off, creating a brush that is very scratchy.  </li>
            <li> came in on time, and make my hair smooth, would just be easier to blow dry with if it had vents.</li>
            <li> After looking at many brushes both in local stores and online (reading countless reviews), I decided to purchase this brush ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I knocked one star off of my rating because I think the price is high for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Weird to get excited about a hairbrush, but this leaves my hair perfect with no static or flyways.  </li>
            <li> It seems to smooth my hair better than other more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going for a more straightened sleeker look, then I use this brush during the bulk of my blow drying time and finish off my styling efforts with a round brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also highly recommend my new dryer</li>
            <li> This is a very affordable brush that helps control static, fits the hand, and is neither to soft nor too stiff.</li>
            <li> Use it with my ionic ceramic hair dryer and the result is straight, smooth hair in half the time.</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t see any difference in it from any other cheap brush you&#x27;d get at the store.</li>
            <li> God forbid the hairdressing shop have a new product in that</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t return it for a new one.  </li>
            <li> Love this brush - gentle on hair when it is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> but it still isn&#x27;t my Vidal Sassoon, which I never had problems with physically and left my hair smooth and silky.    </li>
            <li> It far exceeded all expectations and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought one last year, lost it and bought another one, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I went back online to by another one only to find that the price went from $6.99 to $25.46 in less than one month.  </li>
            <li> It leaves her hair looking so pretty that it is the only brush she uses.</li>
            <li> my hair looks shiny and soft using this brush!  </li>
            <li> But this brush has worked awesomely (no static and smooth shiny hair!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same brush I bought almost one year ago (again, at 6.24)</li>
            <li> I gave the brush 4* with my original review due to the price gouge.</li>
            <li> Overall the look &amp; feel is different than the original brush.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nearly indistinguishable from the new one.</li>
            <li> Again, I wanted to like this brush but evidently having alot of fine hair versus dense, thick hair combined with a sensitive scalp won&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> The brush is now still pretty effective but uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Finish with a small dab of Glass or any other silicone product for fabulous smooth tresses</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re kinda sensitive, it&#x27;s going to either take getting used to</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp and it doesn&#x27;t bother it at all.</li>
            <li> I am a young girl with natural hair</li>
            <li> I have been using it for at least a month and am well pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and the bristles are still complete and intact.</li>
            <li> Gives a soft massaging feel when brushing.</li>
            <li> Its not heavy, doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair.</li>
            <li> This brush goes through my hair nicely, however the handle had completely broken off after 8 or 9 months of use.</li>
            <li> good quality, but expensive</li>
            <li> I then brushed the left side of my head with this brush and the right side with my old brush.</li>
            <li> - Wide bristle mean that it doesn&#x27;t snag or pull my hair that often (but will still do a good job)    </li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair and this vent brush is great to quickly dry my hair before heading to work.</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for several months and it easily has outlasted the previous brush I bought at Ulta.</li>
            <li> To be serious, the &#x27;shark brush&#x27; is much, much better quality.</li>
            <li> I usually buy cheap brushes at the store but decided to splurge and buy this fancier brush off amazon.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new brush after losing my last one after a move.</li>
            <li> and I really recomend this product for men hair blow dry and styling.</li>
            <li> wish i can find a better everyday long lasting brush.</li>
            <li> So i recently had to buy a new brush because my old one got left in a hotel room.</li>
            <li> Use the brush with my new hair dryer and then use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> My general hairstyle is a sleek bob with the ends turned under and curling towards my face on the sides.  </li>
            <li> I was constantly getting snags and tangles with my old brush.</li>
            <li> I bet they did, especially if they were natural.  </li>
            <li> Now barely usable.</li>
            <li> But apparently my daughter likes it too.</li>
            <li> I can totally relate now to the rave reviews about those with thick, dense hair...and to the reviewers who kinda told me &#x27;&#x27;not for fine hair&#x27;&#x27;.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are spaced far enough apart to lift the hair, but close enough to style it in whatever fashion you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wanted to replace a similar brush ive had for 10 years, but I went back to using the old brush.</li>
            <li> B0046HJM5M Bass Large Oval Nylon Hair Brush -- 1 Brush]] ]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several brushes where either the heft of my hair pulls the pins out of the brushes, or the brushes have needles so close together that pulling them through my hair is torture and a major cause of split</li>
            <li> While there is not much that is to be said about it, I have to say it is the high quality that one would expect from a Vidal Sassoon brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush was amazing when it was new, but after a few months of using it the rounded tips started coming off the individual bristles leaving behind bristles that scratch your scalp.</li>
            <li> Take the other reviewer&#x27;s advice and keep it in cart for when the price drops back to a reasonable amount.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used the brush, it was working well.</li>
            <li> The plastic tips on the bristles started coming off in the first few uses, in my hair and all over my bathroom.</li>
            <li> it brushes each strand of my hair straight down without pulling out any hair from knots.</li>
            <li> My hair is really a lot shinier and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have chin length hair that is fine textured, but very thick.  </li>
            <li> I used super-glue to re-attach the broken halves together, and it worked fine for another 3 months.</li>
            <li> The little balls on the top of the bristles were falling off, so it became hard on my scalp.</li>
            <li> She excitedly told me that it dried her hair in half the time, smoothed out tangles easier than any brush she&#x27;s ever used before, and left her hair with an extra shine</li>
            <li> I used this brush in a normal fashion for less than 2 months before it broke.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have ultra-staticy hair, but I guess that I do get less static than with other brushes that I&#x27;ved owned in the past.     </li>
            <li> This is the fourth brush that i have bought within the last few months it is becoming ridiculous the last brush broke when i took the hair out if it, it just crumbled in my hands</li>
            <li> One problem I&#x27;ve noticed in the first month of using this product, are that the teeth bend if you brush too hard, which could be the beginning of potential breakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after several months of use, I rate it a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; because many of the tips on the ends of the bristles have broken off leaving a very sharp tip that scratches my scalp whenever I used it.  </li>
            <li> Well, it didn&#x27;t really matter because on the first use  the plastic bristles bent out of shape with the heat and is now useless.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair and especially if you have thick, curly hair, you&#x27;re highly likely to love the functioning and style of this brush.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this brush with a blow dryer because I&#x27;m not totally convinced that the brush will hold up as long if I do.</li>
            <li> A well made quality product that looks like it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guys with pretty thick hair and this brush does the trick.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I used it on my dry hair to brush it back into a ponytail.  </li>
            <li> The total length of the brush is nine-and-one-half inches long (9-1/2 inches long).  </li>
            <li> The brush is wide enough and contains enough bristles.</li>
            <li> With short hair I was skeptical of a brush, read that this brush was good for thin short hair.  </li>
            <li> Those little rounded tips that caress your mane completely disintegrate, leaving jagged, steel wires that rip into your scalp.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush again after those little ball tips falling off on the old model of this brush, which I used about 2 years.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to believe that the price could go up that much.</li>
            <li> I am African-American and have been using the Maxius vent brush to detangle my long, unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a brush with larger spaces between the thistles for wet hair if you have a lot of hair (like me)</li>
            <li> A must buy for those with medium or long hair lengths...</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this product to anybody with long hair.</li>
            <li> my hair&#x27;s long</li>
            <li> This brush worked well when I got it but after not too long</li>
            <li> only a few short months later i wish i knew where my combs got to :</li>
            <li> The handle did break once, but I have VERY thick hair, and amazon sent out a replacement right away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it was sturdy in my hand and managed my bouncy thick hair without too much fussing so instead of just using it to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> Due to an injury last year, I&#x27;ve been on a lot of medications and have lost about 1/3 of my hair&#x27;s thickness.</li>
            <li> on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I use it to just brush my hair, but because it&#x27;s thermal, I also use it to blow dry my hair when I want a straighter style.  </li>
            <li> Having the venting in it did make my hair dry faster</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;i have not used this brush 10 times to blow dry my hair and now almost 90% of the bristles have lost the tips-making it a pain to use.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also very light, and doesn&#x27;t get dirty in the sense that the dandruff and whatever other head dirt and hair that might come in contact with it don&#x27;t stick on the brush like they might on a cheaper brush.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced every single one I have in the house now in favor of these beauties.</li>
            <li> Wow, no more tangles.</li>
            <li> Since my last VS brush broke, I&#x27;ve tried three replacements, one each from Conair, Denman and Bass.</li>
            <li> Also the handle is a bit loose and there is no way to tighten it.</li>
            <li> It does not tangle wet or dry hair, does not frizz my dry hair when I use it, and helps style when I blow</li>
            <li> The bristles literally melted during the first few uses with my blowdryer and they are so deformed it&#x27;s hard to use as a brush now.</li>
            <li> After I brushed my hair with this brush for the first time, I realized that I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It works so well on wet or dry hair</li>
            <li> It still causes frizz and occasionally tears but a lot less of it.</li>
            <li> I noticed black Dots on my hair and the sink only to realize that the bristle tips were falling off.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> now i can finally spend less time doing her hair</li>
            <li> It only occurs during the brushing and then goes down, so its really not a problem.</li>
            <li> After several uses with my blowdryer the bristles melted into a mangled mess.  </li>
            <li> minus the head being loose.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over six months now, the only problem is the little beads at the end are now comming off.</li>
            <li> The little gap where the &#x27;brush&#x27; part meets the &#x27;handle&#x27;, simply snapped.</li>
            <li> This brush is everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> It does not tangle in my hair or rip out my hair when brusing it when wet.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair even when it wet.  </li>
            <li> /brush it wet in the shower after I&#x27;ve applied conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not much to say...</li>
            <li> I use it for styling when blow-drying wet hair and for any time I need a \\&quot;brush-up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> not much to expect from a brush however within 2 weeks of having it</li>
            <li> , I am using the wet brush to detangle my wet hair ( which works so well after 2 years of constant use) and then for everyday comb, I use a bamboo handle brush.</li>
            <li> This brush broke after only using it a few times.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use with a hair dryer to hopefully help me straighten my really thick, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Its not she has bad hair but its way better than other brushes.</li>
            <li> However, on my first use three of the bristles melted into sad little droopy bent bristles that snag my hair on future brushings.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair or tangle it like other brushes.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the cheapest brush on the market thinking that they all the same...    </li>
            <li> I have 2-3 other brushes</li>
            <li> It has done what it&#x27;s made to do and performs well as described by other 5* reviewers.</li>
            <li> It was not exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> i made it my number one brush and pushed aside all my other</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and typically don&#x27;t like the bristles on these brushes because they tend to snag my hair and hurt my head overall.</li>
            <li> The end of the teeth of the comb is little round balls, they are so fragile that after one month use they are all gone!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately once it dropped onto the floor handle came flat off and we need to buy a new one now.</li>
            <li> It does its job, but I noticed the head of the brush seems to be a little loose after owning it for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> This third brush is already missing about half of the rounded tips, but I had used it for a few days before I noticed.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and the metal plate behind the bristles heats up quickly and assists in drying and in styling.</li>
            <li> I was going to down just brushing my hair because it was like a scalp massage.</li>
            <li> It has not let me down</li>
            <li> the little balls at the end of the bristles started coming off leaving sharp bristles that hurt your scalp.  </li>
            <li> But one that arrived to me this time is made of some other material that broke just after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Three weeks ago the brush fell about 4 feet, onto our vinyl bathroom floor and broke in half.  </li>
            <li> But not with this chrome and black brush..</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews before purchasing this brush.  </li>
            <li> it broke in half.</li>
            <li> Brush snapped in half after less than two weeks of use...</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I did have a few instances of snagging when coming through my hair because of the balls on the ends of the bristle tips, but I expected that due to my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Across the head of the brush are nine (9) bristles with those little round tips, down the side of the head of the brush are twenty (20) bristles with the little rounded tips.  </li>
            <li> (I will note, however, that I use a wide-tooth comb first to comb out any bad knots in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet, and then I use this brush).  </li>
            <li> I really like this brush although I&#x27;m not sure what all of the weird technology does.</li>
            <li> so to those of you whom may be a little like me.</li>
            <li> and I was a little concerned because it&#x27;s not vented, but it held up well and did not overheat in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Looked at the brush and the little knobs at the end of the bristles were just popping off.</li>
            <li> At the the 5-month mark, the little plastic &#x27;nubs&#x27; that contact your hair, started to fall off.</li>
            <li> This brush served me well for a couple of years, but then I noticed the little beads at the ends of the bristles were disappearing.</li>
            <li> I came back today to order a new one and am shocked to find it priced at 25.46.</li>
            <li> My hair is very coarse and for my hair type it was not great.  </li>
            <li> I misplaced mine during a move and was lost without it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money at $8.71 plus tax.</li>
            <li> My other choice was a very expensive brush that I know is high quality.</li>
            <li> No snagging other than if you already have tangles, and no static build up!</li>
            <li> Her hair is very long and very thick.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not true at all, in fact if you go and buy a dollar store brush and try it, you&#x27;ll notice that it&#x27;s almost impossible to brush your hair, especially if you have thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> then this might be little hard to pull.</li>
            <li> There was very little hair in the brush when I was done</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to make of the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;thermal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Every time I bought a brush, it just seemed to work for my hair, usually because it made my hair to static-y.</li>
            <li> I believe I over-payed because I was too lazy to go to the store..</li>
            <li> I like hard bristles</li>
            <li> I hardly need a comb.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; and \\&quot;no static\\&quot; promise is a lie... at least for my head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took at least 5 mins off my morning hygiene.  </li>
            <li> At least the news Nodel ( I ordered dec 2012), donot have the separate ball tips anymore.  </li>
            <li> Moves through thick hair without ripping or snagging.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has extremely thick hair</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my wife who has thick hair.</li>
            <li> to straighten my really thick hair.</li>
            <li> If you have a thick hair.</li>
            <li> The bristle tips started falling off after a few weeks, leaving uncomfortable scratchy tips all over the brush.</li>
            <li> sorry if this review is a bit incoherent; it is 7 in the morning</li>
            <li> I know that I can use my round styling brush for blow dryer styling, but it&#x27;s fussy and annoying with my long hair.</li>
            <li> and I have tough frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get caught in my hair which is very thick.</li>
            <li> ; - you know the one I mean!  </li>
            <li> I just think it&#x27;s poorly designed and maybe should use something stronger to hold it together.</li>
            <li> The handle came in broken, the two times when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> nubs on the end of the bristles fell off leaving painful sharp points.</li>
            <li> The handle itself is a bit shy of five-inches-long (5-inches-long).</li>
            <li> I just got this brush today and was skeptical when I placed the order.</li>
            <li> I was bored one night looking for a gift for my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Needless to say this isn&#x27;t the brush.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, threw it away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> The Conair was terrible on my hair (made it frizzy) and the Denman was difficult to hold (due to dexterity issues).</li>
            <li> I used to always have those nasty bits of lint/product that I could never clean out of my brushes.  </li>
            <li> and I have crazy curly hair.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, at 5.79 today, I bought 3 Vidal Sassoon Ionic brushes today (the max allowed by Amazon)!</li>
            <li> it made it almost impossible to straighten my hair even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with Vidal Sassoon products...</li>
            <li> [example: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I assumed this would be the case because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;thermal&amp;#34; brush with the metal base.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a style that can&#x27;t be beat and will impress all your friends... seriously!!!!...</li>
            <li> All Purpose Brush has decreased from 25.46 to 5.79\\&quot;!!!!    </li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong for $6.00!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible brush, the tips all fell off.</li>
            <li> BORING!!!!  </li>
            <li> Literally the worst brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> What a piece of crap!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife enjoys this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush over 3 years ago and it still holds up just as well as when I bought it.</li>
            <li> At first, I really liked this brush and would have given it 5 stars -- lots of bristles and comfortable to hold.  But after several months of use, I rate it a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; because many of the tips on the ends of the bristles have broken off leaving a very sharp tip that scratches my scalp whenever I used it.  Had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for me nice solid build.</li>
            <li> This is a backup for a brush I have owned for years! I love that it helps to prevent static electricity. The bristles are long enough to be ideal for an all-purpose hair brush. I was very pleased to find it at this price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. My favorite. I purchased one for my sister and I can&#x27;t wait for her to use it</li>
            <li> I have a metal round brush that has bigger ball things on the ends that works a little better to pull my hair straight, so I use that one most of the time, but this one is nice b/c it is so light weight.</li>
            <li> This is a very affordable brush that helps control static, fits the hand, and is neither to soft nor too stiff. My other choice was a very expensive brush that I know is high quality. But I&#x27;m glad I opted for this one. It is up to the task and at a tiny fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Item was as described</li>
            <li> This brush is nice, but the bristles are more flexible than I was expecting.  My hair is very coarse and for my hair type it was not great.  I passed it on to my daughter who has fine hair and she is extremely happy with it.  I knocked one star off of my rating because I think the price is high for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> The best hair brush ever! Moves through thick hair without ripping or snagging. Hair comes out smooth when used with hairdryer. I misplaced mine during a move and was lost without it. The price is so good I ordered an extra one.</li>
            <li> Ok I have to admit, I read the reviews more than the description... so to those of you whom may be a little like me. FYI: There are 3 brushes in this package! I bought two sets thinking I was buying two brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok on to the review. Wow, no more tangles. I was constantly getting snags and tangles with my old brush. I&#x27;ve replaced every single one I have in the house now in favor of these beauties. Its not painful, I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE HUGE difference in static. There is none now!! I&#x27;m so happy with these I wish they&#x27;d last forever. Since I just bought them I know they will last for quite a bit longer, but still I morn in advance the day my brushes will need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick. I&#x27;ve gone through several brushes where either the heft of my hair pulls the pins out of the brushes, or the brushes have needles so close together that pulling them through my hair is torture and a major cause of split ends.    This is a great brush just to BRUSH your hair. Gets all the way down to the roots, pulls through the hair easily, and doesn&#x27;t hurt! The best thing is the brush isn&#x27;t destroyed - it&#x27;s still intact after you get done brushing.    I know this brush has all kinds of claims for it (ionic, thermal, etc.), and that may all be true, but for me the part that makes a huge difference is that it really IS an \\&quot;all purpose\\&quot; brush.     For five bucks and change (what I spent), it&#x27;s a good, basic, and useful brush if you have long hair and value your tresses.</li>
            <li> This brush goes through my hair nicely, however the handle had completely broken off after 8 or 9 months of use.</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on the reduced drying time of hair when using this brush, but I can say that it does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are spaced far enough apart to lift the hair, but close enough to style it in whatever fashion you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality parts, a nice heft to it, and finger indentations on either side for a better grip on the handle.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this brush, I decided to purchase it, but didn&#x27;t expect much for $6.oo.  It is absolutely amazing. It makes your hair shiny and silky smooth. What a difference it makes compared to my old brush (that was not ionic and more money). It far exceeded all expectations and I would highly recommend it. You cannot go wrong for $6.00!!!!</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair and especially if you have thick, curly hair, you&#x27;re highly likely to love the functioning and style of this brush.    (I&#x27;m trying to learn to be &#x27;&#x27;detailed and specific\\&quot; and write what I would have wanted to know before purchase, hence the length and detail)     It turned out the reviewers who kept mentioning still having static and mentioning they had fine hair were accurate, I have &#x27;&#x27;fine hair but alot of it&#x27;&#x27; and the brush did not work for me in regard to static. It caused more static.      Anyone relate to my &#x27;&#x27;wanting to really like this brush but...\\&quot;???  It brushes the scalp in a tingling manner (for me, anyway), so invigorating I couldn&#x27;t take it.  So, if you also like scalp wake-up, it&#x27;s a plus.  If you&#x27;re kinda sensitive, it&#x27;s going to either take getting used to or you just won&#x27;t like the sensation.      I read all the existing reviews at the time of purchase (very recently) and I&#x27;m giving this 5-stars because it&#x27;s durably constructed and comfortable to hold and yet I&#x27;m going to give to my hairdresser. Again, I wanted to like this brush but evidently having alot of fine hair versus dense, thick hair combined with a sensitive scalp won&#x27;t work for me.  I can totally relate now to the rave reviews about those with thick, dense hair...and to the reviewers who kinda told me &#x27;&#x27;not for fine hair&#x27;&#x27;.     Just to push details to the brink here&#x27;s the measurements in-case anyone wants to know if it&#x27;s a take-along brush for them or a stay-at-home or both...    BRUSH DIMENSIONS:  It&#x27;s an attractive brush, black and &#x27;&#x27;chrome&#x27;&#x27; color.  Across the head of the brush are nine (9) bristles with those little round tips, down the side of the head of the brush are twenty (20) bristles with the little rounded tips.  The total length of the brush is nine-and-one-half inches long (9-1/2 inches long).  The nine (9) bristles running across are a diameter of two-inches (2-inches).  The length of the brush head itself is four-inches (4-inches).  The handle itself is a bit shy of five-inches-long (5-inches-long).</li>
            <li> In my search for better hair I have purchased more and more expensive shampoos, conditioners and styling products.  God forbid the hairdressing shop have a new product in that I don&#x27;t have also on my shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my old hairdryer died I happily purchased another one from Amazon, this brush was a tag-a-long product and cost almost nothing.  What is another six dollars in the quest for good hair?  Well, I love this brush.  It does not tangle wet or dry hair, does not frizz my dry hair when I use it, and helps style when I blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best six dollar investment in styling tools that I have ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also highly recommend my new dryer [[ASIN:B00132ZG3U Conair  225RX 1875 Watt Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic Styling Dryer, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Styling!</li>
            <li> All the reviews for this brush are true. My hair gets easily frizzy and this brush is an absolute god send. No snagging other than if you already have tangles, and no static build up! I am planning to buy another one for on the go &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Terrible brush, the tips all fell off. Do not get this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife 11 months ago.  Three weeks ago the brush fell about 4 feet, onto our vinyl bathroom floor and broke in half.  It was a pretty good hair brush otherwise, so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars instead of 2.  I&#x27;m not sure what to make of the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;thermal&amp;#34; properties of the brush.</li>
            <li> Some people may think that a brush is a brush is a brush... That&#x27;s not true at all, in fact if you go and buy a dollar store brush and try it, you&#x27;ll notice that it&#x27;s almost impossible to brush your hair, especially if you have thick, long hair. I didn&#x27;t see a reason to spend more than $5 on a brush but I figured what the heck? It looks good and I&#x27;m sure it worked great. I got it and tried it out and not only did it work really well, but it felt good! I was going to down just brushing my hair because it was like a scalp massage. As funny as it sounds, I got a scalp massager and a brush in one purchase! lol  Anywhoo, it goes right through tangled hair, and it&#x27;s soft to your scalp, and if you are worried about it making dandruff worse, you&#x27;ll be happy to hear that this will be better than the cheap brushes. I enjoy the feel, it has a good grip and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing a review on a brush... I&#x27;m not kidding when I say this, you have to invest into this brush. You&#x27;ll thank yourself later. I don&#x27;t know if it belongs in a salon but i don&#x27;t see a reason why not.</li>
            <li> It looks really nice and sleek. When you brush your hair with it your hair does get shiny and no frizz at all. But for using it with the blow dryer I don&#x27;t recommend it. Cause of its shape (not rounded) cant work with the hair dryer to sape the hair. But left that aside and i love this brush.</li>
            <li> This is not the best brush for thick hair.  It&#x27;s good for the tangles but not so great for really brushing the hair smoothly or getting down to the scalp.  Also, the metal cover where the bristles are keeps popping off.</li>
            <li> I basically bought this product because I wanted to get the free shipping if you spend over $25 and had a few more dollars to go. But, this hair brush has made life so easier... I have long, thick hair and typically don&#x27;t like the bristles on these brushes because they tend to snag my hair and hurt my head overall. I was so excited the first time I brushed my hair with this brush just after getting out of the shower. This hair brush is amazing.. it brushes each strand of my hair straight down without pulling out any hair from knots. I haven&#x27;t used this brush with a blow dryer because I&#x27;m not totally convinced that the brush will hold up as long if I do. I can definitively tell why everyone is giving this hair brush 5 stars and it&#x27;s well worth buying this brush for $6.00!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing hair brush ever!!! .... It comes in a style that can&#x27;t be beat and will impress all your friends... seriously!!!!... When your friends walk into the room while your brushing your hair they will say WOW !!! That&#x27;s one hell of a hair brush!!....You will probably become the most popular person EVER!!!  Not to mention your hair will look amazing!!! More amazing then it would look if you used a simple wood handle brush...BORING!!!!  But not with this chrome and black brush.. NO WAY... YES WAY!!! It is just amazing how great your hair WILL look just buy using this brush. I&#x27;m 300 pounds and 5&#x27;2 and just by using this brush I was able to pick up not 1 but 2 playboy models that just can&#x27;t seem to keep their hands off me after I brush my hair.. This brush will change your life. The catcher is...is that if you honestly believe that any of this is true....then you need to get out more...... Its just a frickin hair brush</li>
            <li> As brushes go, this is pretty good one for all around everyday use.     PROs:  - Is good with both wet and dry hair  - Wide bristle mean that it doesn&#x27;t snag or pull my hair that often (but will still do a good job)    CONs:  - Contrary to some other reviews, I do get static when I brush my hair sometimes. Maybe I just have ultra-staticy hair, but I guess that I do get less static than with other brushes that I&#x27;ved owned in the past.     So on the whole, this is a pretty good hair brush on the cheap side for everyday hair brushing. Static does occur sometimes, but not everything&#x27;s perfect I guess, and I&#x27;d recommend it overall.</li>
            <li> I just got my brush in the mail today and used it.  I love it! It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair or tangle it like other brushes.  I love the design and the color.  Overall, a very good product!</li>
            <li> I just got this brush today and was skeptical when I placed the order. I usually use the cheapest brush on the market thinking that they all the same...    After I brushed my hair with this brush for the first time, I realized that I was wrong. This brush really makes a difference. I have fine straight hair and this brush makes my hair straight and shine immediately. I then brushed the left side of my head with this brush and the right side with my old brush. OMG!!! This brush does a much better job. I can&#x27;t say that this brush will work better than everybody&#x27;s brushes but if you are looking for a good brush, I will definitely recommned the Vidal Sassoon brush.</li>
            <li> I was bored one night looking for a gift for my girlfriend. Read the reviews and thought id buy it. She loves it! It looks like a standard brush and costs the same as one but I guess there&#x27;s something about this that makes it better than the rest. All the good reviews are right.  Just buy one. Its $7 right now and it will be well worth it.</li>
            <li> While the Vidal Sassoon Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush is great for keeping my ends from curling up, if I use it on the rest of my hair, I get flyaway hair.  This brush causes static in my hair, I don&#x27;t feel that I get the shine and quick drying that was described.</li>
            <li> This brush is everything I expected it to be. One problem I&#x27;ve noticed in the first month of using this product, are that the teeth bend if you brush too hard, which could be the beginning of potential breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; and \\&quot;no static\\&quot; promise is a lie... at least for my head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO WHY IN THE HELL IS THIS PRODUCT NOW ONLY $5? I paid double last month.... sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great brush, and I do in fact recommend you buying it if you want to easily untangle your hair in a short period of time, without pulling out an excess of hair.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  Makes curling with a blowdrier easy.  I love it!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has extremely thick hair and it is wavy.  This brush handles the thickness and the tangles.  It leaves her hair looking so pretty that it is the only brush she uses.</li>
            <li> How hard is it to make a great brush.  Pretty hard actually; think of the brushes that combed your hair perfectly...now did they tear hairs out?  I bet they did, especially if they were natural.  This brush is all synthetic and all the better for it.  It can be cleaned, it pulls no hair out, and it combs thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This was a great brush, as long as you don&#x27;t use it while blow drying your hair.  The bristles literally melted during the first few uses with my blowdryer and they are so deformed it&#x27;s hard to use as a brush now.</li>
            <li> This is the third one of these brushes I have purchased from Amazon. The other two were great but eventually the tiny rounded tips of the bristles come off and scratch your scalp. This third brush is already missing about half of the rounded tips, but I had used it for a few days before I noticed. I don&#x27;t feel right returning it so I will probably just purchase another and make sure it is in good shape before I use it.</li>
            <li> Very good brush overall, I am a master barber and I really recomend this product for men hair blow dry and styling.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  I bought two.  Now I can&#x27;t live without it.  Who would have believed that a hairbrush would make such a difference?</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for styling your hair.  I liked it so much that I went back online to by another one only to find that the price went from $6.99 to $25.46 in less than one month.  It is hard to believe that the price could go up that much.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have used. It does not tangle in my hair or rip out my hair when brusing it when wet. It is great to blow dry with and is also great on dry hair, less static. It has not let me down and I have tough frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews before purchasing this brush.  I thought OK, for the price, why not try it.  It was everything and more.  I would recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Yes yes yes. This brush rocks. I love the way it feels in my hands. And it a great brush for all my needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! It solves all your hair-related problems!  I&#x27;ve had two of these since 2011 and will never go back to that &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; - you know the one I mean!  I hear it&#x27;s even responsible for free health care, so support your country!</li>
            <li> What M. Wolf said in her review is exactly on point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m here to give my 5 stars review because I wholeheartedly agree. I really like the weight and the material it was made from. The price is a great value at $6.58, I would buy another one again. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see that this brush was such a good value and a high quality product.  It feels good in the hand and works well on my fragile permed hair.</li>
            <li> After several uses with my blowdryer the bristles melted into a mangled mess.  Now barely usable.</li>
            <li> The tips of this brush keep coming out in my hair. Not the best build quality, I&#x27;ve only had the thing for a couple months and already it&#x27;s falling apart.</li>
            <li> my hair looks shiny and soft using this brush!  it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair even when it wet.  love love it</li>
            <li> Great hairbrush, ended up buying 2.  Weird to get excited about a hairbrush, but this leaves my hair perfect with no static or flyways.  My daughter who has much thicker hair than me used it, and absolutely loved it.  Her hair is very long and very thick.  I bought her one also.  Feels great on my scalp also.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome. I originally bought it at some department store because I needed one and it looked like it wasn&#x27;t total junk, and it quickly became my favorite brush ever. I recently lost it somewhere in my house, went on a frantic search through amazon for a replacement, and was incredibly pleased to find this exact brush on here. As it turns out, now I have two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, long hair. This brush doesn&#x27;t tear it out like many others, even if your hair is pretty tangled (which mine gets quite a bit). Leaves your hair feeling nice and smooth. Good on wet or dry hair. Very durable; I&#x27;ve had the first one for 4+ years and it&#x27;s nearly indistinguishable from the new one. Random side note, the handle is made of awesome soft rubbery stuff. Definitely highly recommended!</li>
            <li> *Shrugs*  Seems like most other brushes to me.  I gave it 4 stars because it is a nice brush, but not 5 because I don&#x27;t see any difference in it from any other cheap brush you&#x27;d get at the store.</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for several months and it easily has outlasted the previous brush I bought at Ulta. It is well constructed and the tips of the bristles are soft and very comfortable...so much so that my husband uses it as well.</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;m Blk and Hawaiian and I have crazy curly hair. Since my hair is so curly I like to comb/brush it wet in the shower after I&#x27;ve applied conditioner. With that being said I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a nice brush that can handle my hair. Needless to say this isn&#x27;t the brush. It worked great for about a month, but just last week the handle snapped off and I had to throw it away. If your hair isn&#x27;t think this brush may work great for you, but as for me I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a brush that can stand up against my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a brush.... has nobody ever seen these?  Not much to say... once again... it is a brush!</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for perfect for me</li>
            <li> I was looking for an \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; brush and decided to pick this up because of 1) the price, and 2) free shipping.  I am African-American and have been using the Maxius vent brush to detangle my long, unruly hair. Due to an injury last year, I&#x27;ve been on a lot of medications and have lost about 1/3 of my hair&#x27;s thickness. Almost everytime I use that vent brush I lose more hair.  And, at some point (since I&#x27;m not on the meds anymore), you have to ask yourself... is it the medications, the products I use in my hair, OR the brush??  Still... finding a brush that gets down to the root and gives a nice massage on the scalp instead of a scratching is a rarity. So, I just kept using it.    I was really impressed with the sturdiness of this brush, the bristles are just stiff enough to hold up all the way to the scalp. Also, there was no tearing or snapping of hair strands which is always a plus. I used it when I blow dryed my hair and I was a little concerned because it&#x27;s not vented, but it held up well and did not overheat in my hand.  Afterwards, I used it on my dry hair to brush it back into a ponytail.  Whereas with my Maxius I would need to pull out a nylon bristle brush to get my ponytail neat, this brush easily transitioned as there are just enough bristles to function as a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brush as well.  There was very little hair in the brush when I was done AND after I straightened my hair there was no hair in it at all!      It is nice to find a brush that is inexpensive (some on this site are $40!), that works well, doesn&#x27;t snag, and gives me that \\&quot;all the way to the scalp\\&quot; rub I so love.  I jumped online to pick up a spare... just in case I lose this one.    NOTE: I didn&#x27;t read any of the reviews before I purchased this brush. So, I was pleasantly surprised to see that so many found the same qualities in this brush that I did.  This is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, it would be better if it has vent holes in the back.  came in on time, and make my hair smooth, would just be easier to blow dry with if it had vents.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  With short hair I was skeptical of a brush, read that this brush was good for thin short hair.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  Exactly what I needed and works great.  Took at least 5 mins off my morning hygiene.  Super fast shipping, couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> The first month I feel I finally find the right comb, but soon I know I&#x27;m too optimistic.  The end of the teeth of the comb is little round balls, they are so fragile that after one month use they are all gone!  Now the teeth of the comb just scrape my skalp and it hurts.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. Find sth better.</li>
            <li> my girl loves it. I like hard bristles but she enjoys this brush. It looks elegant. Unfortunately once it dropped onto the floor handle came flat off and we need to buy a new one now.</li>
            <li> This brush does it all. I use it for styling when blow-drying wet hair and for any time I need a \\&quot;brush-up\\&quot;. It works so well on wet or dry hair I hardly need a comb. Size of brush head is good (not too big and not too small) and the weight and grip feel good in my hand.</li>
            <li> It is a brush and it brushes my hair. 5/5</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I would and have recommended it to all my friends. I have a sensitive scalp and it doesn&#x27;t bother it at all. The handle did break once, but I have VERY thick hair, and amazon sent out a replacement right away.</li>
            <li> the item is exactly as it was advertised. The color, the quality and the look - exactly what I was looking for my wife.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s perfect for styling while blow drying  my medium length thick hair. I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> So i recently had to buy a new brush because my old one got left in a hotel room. Every time I bought a brush, it just seemed to work for my hair, usually because it made my hair to static-y. But this brush has worked awesomely (no static and smooth shiny hair!) on my dry hair. I would recommend using a brush with larger spaces between the thistles for wet hair if you have a lot of hair (like me) but I knew that when I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best feature is that it is non-static and a solid build, especially in the winter time!</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my wife who has thick hair. The bristle tips started falling off after a few weeks, leaving uncomfortable scratchy tips all over the brush. Additionally, many other bristles are bent over from what appears to be heat damage from her hair dryer. Also the handle is a bit loose and there is no way to tighten it. She has a drawer full of hairbrushes; some are ten years old and are in better shape than this junk. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPO</li>
            <li> Very good for fluffing the ends out.</li>
            <li> Why I like this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Bristles do not snag on my hair&lt;br /&gt;* Excellent for use with hair dryers&lt;br /&gt;* Great brush for wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;* Does not cause static when brushing dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;* Has nice weight in the handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this brush for over a year and just ordered 2 more(one for my purse and another for the office).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 11/7/2008&lt;br /&gt;Again bought 2 more.  One to give as a gift and one to replace one I have lost.  This is a great product that detangles without snaging my very fine hair.  I bought the gift for my granddaughter who also has very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love this brush - gentle on hair when it is wet or dry.  Would strongly recommend it - especially with longer hair</li>
            <li> Bought it to brush my beard. Works absolutely magnificently! Well made, comfortable, no prickly bristles. Keeps me looking like an outright respectable mountain man!</li>
            <li> This is the fourth brush that i have bought within the last few months it is becoming ridiculous the last brush broke when i took the hair out if it, it just crumbled in my hands i couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I need the brush for wrapping my weave to keep it lasting longer and so i don&#x27;t have to use heat on my hair.  I hope this brush last longer than the last ones so far so good.</li>
            <li> Okay, I don&#x27;t get my hair cut regularly, and I don&#x27;t spend hours in front of the mirror.  So if you&#x27;re looking at my review for that kind of use, look elsewhere!  I have shoulder length hair and it does tend to get real tangled.  This brush takes care of them with ease.  And my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting frazzled as a result, either.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon VS7963 Ionic Thermal All Purpose brush. It&#x27;s easy to comb hair without fuzzy the end. I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with Vidal Sassoon products...this brush is no exception.  I use it to just brush my hair, but because it&#x27;s thermal, I also use it to blow dry my hair when I want a straighter style.  A must buy for those with medium or long hair lengths...it doesn&#x27;t tangle and that&#x27;s a great advantage over other similarly- designed brushes!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Have to replace it every 2 years because the tips of the bristles gradually fall off.</li>
            <li> The handle broke after one month of light use.  In comparison, I have had brushes for years, and they have not broken.  This is a very cheaply made product.  The way that the handle attaches to the brush head is not well made.  It simply broke.  It wasn&#x27;t dropped.  I wasn&#x27;t applying any pressure. There seems to be no way to get a refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty particular about my brush...my hair is fine and straight and lots of brushes put static in my hair. This one doesn&#x27;t, so I love it.</li>
            <li> Literally the worst brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have long kind of curly hair but I straighten it every day, and this brush would catch every knot and tear it out. it made it almost impossible to straighten my hair even.</li>
            <li> I am a young girl with natural hair i added this brush to the cart to go with the new blow dryer i was getting and while it worked it was pretty okay... not much to expect from a brush however within 2 weeks of having it it broke in half. I just think it&#x27;s poorly designed and maybe should use something stronger to hold it together.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and this brush gets the job done. I&#x27;m really happy that I made this purchase and I would recommend this product to anybody with long hair.</li>
            <li> Great brush, I like the stiffness of the brush, feels good on my head.  I have been using it for over six months now, the only problem is the little beads at the end are now comming off.</li>
            <li> Brush snapped in half after less than two weeks of use...right where the handle joins the brush head.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I think I purchased this because of too much static in my hair, and I&#x27;m sorry to say that it did not help in that regard. I used it once and then stopped.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair and this vent brush is great to quickly dry my hair before heading to work. Doesn&#x27;t tangle and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> For starters, I&#x27;m a guy with ~4-6&amp;#34; hair, moderately full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looked like a quality brush at first, good handle, nice bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a month and I noticed little black dots in my sink. Then I started feeling scratching on my scalp. Looked at the brush and the little knobs at the end of the bristles were just popping off. 2 months later and they are all gone. Now it feels like a wire brush. Pure junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had cheapo brushes with the same knobs last for years. This brand name one couldn&#x27;t handle a month? Save your money.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with this brush at first, but after 6 months of light usage the adhesive joining the handle to the brush head disintegrated, and most of the bristle tips fell off (making brushing a somewhat painful experience).</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have a tender scalp and it&#x27;s like getting a message. I don&#x27;t mind brushing the 50 times or is it 100 times. No matter.</li>
            <li> I have 2-3 other brushes but I haven&#x27;t used any of them since I got this brush. It detangles hair quickly and painlessly while keeping frizz to a minimum. I ordered another one for a friend of mine, but I may buy another one for a spare.</li>
            <li> Nice n smooth to brush the hair.</li>
            <li> Love this because it works great on my hair during humidity.  Use of this brush minimizes the blow drying time for me, because of its thermal properties.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the first time i&#x27;ve bothered buying a brush for more than a dollar, and i&#x27;m not too disappointed by this one. the description for this product does not lie; compared to my $1 brushes, it really isn&#x27;t static&#x27;y at all, and so minimizes frizzing by brushing. it&#x27;s also very light, and doesn&#x27;t get dirty in the sense that the dandruff and whatever other head dirt and hair that might come in contact with it don&#x27;t stick on the brush like they might on a cheaper brush.    sorry if this review is a bit incoherent; it is 7 in the morning and i am falling asleep in a lecture at the moment, haha.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush ... at the price I paid for it! I bought this brush May 25, 2010 for 6.24. It has done what it&#x27;s made to do and performs well as described by other 5* reviewers. However, I dropped it last night and the handle broke off. It only fell about 2 feet so it&#x27;s breaking was pretty surprising.    I came back today to order a new one and am shocked to find it priced at 25.46. It&#x27;s the exact same brush I bought almost one year ago (again, at 6.24) (Vidal Sassoon VS7963 Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush) and is in stock, ships and sold by Amazon, so it&#x27;s not even a price increase imposed by a third party seller.    I&#x27;m putting it in my cart&#x27;s \\&quot;Saved Items--To Buy Later\\&quot; section to wait for the price to decrease, and I hope you do the same.    UPDATE 6/5/11:    I got the message I&#x27;ve been waiting for! \\&quot;Vidal Sassoon VS7963 Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush has decreased from 25.46 to 5.79\\&quot;!!!!    Since my last VS brush broke, I&#x27;ve tried three replacements, one each from Conair, Denman and Bass. The Conair was terrible on my hair (made it frizzy) and the Denman was difficult to hold (due to dexterity issues). My daughter brought me the Bass brush and it&#x27;s been the best of the 3 with nice bristles and a somewhat ergonomic handle [example: [[ASIN:B0046HJM5M Bass Large Oval Nylon Hair Brush -- 1 Brush]] ] but it still isn&#x27;t my Vidal Sassoon, which I never had problems with physically and left my hair smooth and silky.    Needless to say, at 5.79 today, I bought 3 Vidal Sassoon Ionic brushes today (the max allowed by Amazon)! One to use now, one to give my daughter and one to save in case I break another one.     I gave the brush 4* with my original review due to the price gouge. I increased it to 5* today because it is a great brush as long as it&#x27;s not overpriced!</li>
            <li> I needed a new brush after losing my last one after a move. For the price, it wasn&#x27;t that much more expensive than the cheapie ones you can buy at a drugstore. I really like this brush although I&#x27;m not sure what all of the weird technology does. It still causes frizz and occasionally tears but a lot less of it. Take the other reviewer&#x27;s advice and keep it in cart for when the price drops back to a reasonable amount. I&#x27;m buying another when that happens.</li>
            <li> It was not exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic. Leaves my hair smoothe and shiney. I&#x27;d recommend it if you want healthy looking hair again.</li>
            <li> I used to have this brush but as it is on the picture, and I loved it. It lasted me for years. But one that arrived to me this time is made of some other material that broke just after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think that the kind of brush you have could really change the way your hair looks so drastically. I have very thick hair and the metal plate behind the bristles heats up quickly and assists in drying and in styling. The nylon bristles don&#x27;t tug my hair out and they&#x27;re actually pretty gentle. My hair is really a lot shinier and less frizzy. I&#x27;m pretty impressed!</li>
            <li> I think the best test for a brush is how it performs over time.  But for now, after about a month, the brush performs very well.</li>
            <li> I love this for straightening with a blow dryer! Works perfectly. Maybe it&#x27;s in my head but I feel like it helps reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair. The first few times I used the brush, it was working well. I had no complaints. But, after 2 week, the tips started falling apart so I had needles combing my hair. Needless to say, threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am using the wet brush to detangle my wet hair ( which works so well after 2 years of constant use) and then for everyday comb, I use a bamboo handle brush.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush of many years finally needed to be replaced.  After looking at many brushes both in local stores and online (reading countless reviews), I decided to purchase this brush ([[ASIN:B0002YE8V6 Vidal Sassoon VS7963 Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush]]) from Amazon.  I have been using it for at least a month and am well pleased.  It is truly \\&quot;all purpose\\&quot;.  I have chin length hair that is fine textured, but very thick.  The back of my head has lots of wave, but the sides are straighter.  My general hairstyle is a sleek bob with the ends turned under and curling towards my face on the sides.  I find this brush perfect for use when I&#x27;m blow drying my hair.  I use it alone to achieve my \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; look which allows a bit of relaxed wave in the back.  If I&#x27;m going for a more straightened sleeker look, then I use this brush during the bulk of my blow drying time and finish off my styling efforts with a round brush.  While I use this brush most during my \\&quot;blow dry\\&quot; sessions, the brush also works nicely with dry hair and helps to control static.  In summary, I like this brush very much, would buy it again for myself, and/or purchase it for friends and family.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use with a hair dryer to hopefully help me straighten my really thick, naturally curly hair. It does a nice job, but it could be better. It did not seem to grip my hair well, probably because of the smaller size of the brush and the shape. I did have a few instances of snagging when coming through my hair because of the balls on the ends of the bristle tips, but I expected that due to my thick hair. Overall, it functioned as stated, and it was my mistake on not buying a semi-round brush instead of a flatter brush like this. I am sure it would have worked on my hair a lot better if it was half-rounded instead of flat. Having the venting in it did make my hair dry faster and it was a lot easier to remove the gobs of built up hair I tend to accumulate on any brush or comb I use when I brush my hair. If you have medium to thinner hair, I bet this would work wonderful for you! I will keep using it, as it is the best brush I have for straightening with a blow dryer right now, and it does work--just takes longer due to size and shape--to straighten my really thick hair.</li>
            <li> I used this brush in a normal fashion for less than 2 months before it broke. Literally. The little gap where the &#x27;brush&#x27; part meets the &#x27;handle&#x27;, simply snapped. Very poor quality. I used super-glue to re-attach the broken halves together, and it worked fine for another 3 months. At the the 5-month mark, the little plastic &#x27;nubs&#x27; that contact your hair, started to fall off. Those little rounded tips that caress your mane completely disintegrate, leaving jagged, steel wires that rip into your scalp. I have fairly fine/ thin hair, so I can&#x27;t imagine this being good for anyone. I loved it until it started to fall apart, which was way sooner than I expected. To be serious, the &#x27;shark brush&#x27; is much, much better quality. I will not buy anything made by Vidal Sasoon again.</li>
            <li> The plastic tips on the bristles started coming off in the first few uses, in my hair and all over my bathroom. It is now going in the trash! Waste of money at $8.71 plus tax.</li>
            <li> Bristle tips just fell off within a month of very light use. I noticed black Dots on my hair and the sink only to realize that the bristle tips were falling off.&lt;br /&gt;Now the brush hurts my scalp without the bristles, I have to throw the brush away.Not recommended. I cannot believe this is Vidal Sassoon product. For all I know it is a knockoff.</li>
            <li> BRUSH IS WELL MADE, EASY TO CLEAN</li>
            <li> It was a cheap brush so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. It does its job, but I noticed the head of the brush seems to be a little loose after owning it for a couple of months. For now it continues to work but I don&#x27;t see it lasting more than a year (if even) before the head of the brush falls off. I find it is easy to clean out all the hair compared to my last brush and I am pleased with it minus the head being loose.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair brush! I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and the bristles are still complete and intact. It&#x27;s very durable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now and it&#x27;s held up very well. Gives a soft massaging feel when brushing.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about this brush is the small brush tips allow you to clean the shed hair out of the brush easily. The brush feels sturdy and is easy to hold in your hand. A good buy that should last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ever my daughter have thick long natural curly hair and lets me say it dont take forever to brush her hair now and it does not hurt her. now i can finally spend less time doing her hair i recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love the brush.  I wear weaves a lot and it works great with weave hair.  It does not damage the tracks.  My sister liked it so much I had to get her one too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush ever!  It gives my hair lots of body.  I am ordering a second for me as well as one for my sister.</li>
            <li> Works well with hairdryer</li>
            <li> Nice and low damage for hair. pretty good</li>
            <li> This brush is the perfect firmness for my thick hair.  It feels great when brushing.  A well made quality product that looks like it will last a long time.  Good value.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush for pretty cheap.  I&#x27;m a guys with pretty thick hair and this brush does the trick.</li>
            <li> Helps to control fly-away hair.  Good price.  Keeps hair looking good from shampoo to shampoo.  I would order another one if necessary.</li>
            <li> It really works as described. My girl really says that it removes knots in her hair effortlessly. Its not she has bad hair but its way better than other brushes.</li>
            <li> i loveeeee this brush although the handle fell off very easily i still use it its like the perfect brush to use!!!</li>
            <li> If I could give zero stars I would.  This brush is Chinese junk.  It broke within days, the handle just snapped off.</li>
            <li> I returned this twice and decided to just get a different kind.  It came partnered with the blow dryer that I purchased.  The handle came in broken, the two times when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. Dries my hair so much faster! Use it with my ionic ceramic hair dryer and the result is straight, smooth hair in half the time.</li>
            <li> I liked this at first, but after a few months several of the rounded tips at the end of each bristle came off, creating a brush that is very scratchy.  I will not use it any more.  My husband doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it so he is using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and straight, but it still tangles easily. I use this after drying my hair after a shower and it doesn&#x27;t snag at all. My hair doesn&#x27;t get static-y from using this, which I love. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought one last year, lost it and bought another one, I like it very much. Will come back it I lose it again</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush again after those little ball tips falling off on the old model of this brush, which I used about 2 years.  At least the news Nodel ( I ordered dec 2012), donot have the separate ball tips anymore.  The ball and the bristle is one piece.  Overall the look &amp; feel is different than the original brush.  It still feels pretty good, with good substance.  It&#x27;s a good everyday brush.  I haven&#x27;t seen functionally any difference yet.</li>
            <li> A great brush! Detangles and use it to curl with heat!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good hair brush that doesn&#x27;t leave lines from the brush in my hair when I put it in a ponytail for who knows how long and I finally found it with this one. I will be ordering more of these to have when it comes time to replace the one I just got.</li>
            <li> It dose not tangle in my hair. It&#x27;s a good hair brush with light weight. The price is reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> good well made sturdy brush. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Nice rubberized handle and feels solid and well made.</li>
            <li> This brush does an effective job of stimulating the scalp and brushing the hair, without breaking the hair.  I&#x27;ve never used it when blow-drying my hair -- my hair&#x27;s long and I like to use a brush with a large diameter, to keep the hair straighter -- but my guess is that it would work very well with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> great value, good quality</li>
            <li> The brush is well made and I&#x27;m satisfied.  I believe I over-payed because I was too lazy to go to the store.. I find no fault with the brush</li>
            <li> Use the brush with my new hair dryer and then use a flat iron. Hair feels sleek and wonderful. Feels more gentle on my hair too.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush. But very fragile. They break right where the silver ring is. I bought 2 and they both in the same place. See if they will refund my money.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a brush to use that doesn&#x27;t melt(other&#x27;s bristles did) while using with a hair dryer. This one does not only withstand the high temperatures but also tends to smoothen and soften your hair during drying and reduces static greatly, even more if you use an ionic hair dryer. Once you&#x27;re done, it shines...err your hair does....and all in all so does this product ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my wife as a gift after reading all the reviews touting it&#x27;s amazing ability. Wife used it without me telling her anything about the brush. She excitedly told me that it dried her hair in half the time, smoothed out tangles easier than any brush she&#x27;s ever used before, and left her hair with an extra shine she&#x27;s not used to seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how this all works, but it does. I just hope the magic doesn&#x27;t wear off or run out because I&#x27;m clueless as to how to refill it.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hopes of using it to style my hair with a blow dryer. Since it has a metal backing I thought might hold some of the heat from the blow dryer to help with styling.  Well, it didn&#x27;t really matter because on the first use  the plastic bristles bent out of shape with the heat and is now useless.  This is the first brush that I have ever used that did this.</li>
            <li> I love this brush air flows throught for a super fast dry time. My dogs love it and I also Love it</li>
            <li> This brush is nicely balanced. I like that it has the metal under the bristles that will hold the heat to help style my hair when blow drying.  I can get my hair straighter with this brush! The bristles are fabulous! Soft but feel good on the scalp, protected ends as not to tare your hair or your scalp.  Excellent brush!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great basic, everyday brush. The handle is sturdy and comfortable to hold in your hand. The brush is wide enough and contains enough bristles. The bristles are soft and does not create static while brushing. I haven&#x27;t experience any pulling with the brush. Overall, it&#x27;s a great quality brush and I use it every day. It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> nubs on the end of the bristles fell off leaving painful sharp points. Wanted to replace a similar brush ive had for 10 years, but I went back to using the old brush. It was great until it fell apart!</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MORE!</li>
            <li> If you have a thick hair. then this might be little hard to pull.</li>
            <li> Works great to calm those fly aways. The Bristles bend easily though. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Excellect brush, when used with ionic blowdryer and Redken blow drying silk, leaves my chemically straightened hair feeling like silk. Finish with a small dab of Glass or any other silicone product for fabulous smooth tresses</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon VS7963 Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush this was a reasonably priced gift and my daughter really liked it!</li>
            <li> This brush worked well when I got it but after not too long the little balls at the end of the bristles started coming off leaving sharp bristles that hurt your scalp.  Definitely not made to last.</li>
            <li> I just use this as a brush. I can&#x27;t really vouch for its thermal, shine characteristics. Durability is good.&lt;br /&gt;Brush looks good with a nice handle and good weight distribution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a brush that would keep the static out of my hair, especially during the winter months. This is that brush and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have black nappy hair and this brush is very good on it, especially after i spray my hair with oil and water. It smooths my hair. However it looks like the tips of the brush start sticking on my hair after a while</li>
            <li> I had have many hair brushes on my life and this is the best. It is  light and I recommend you.</li>
            <li> This brush works well enough for an every day brush. Seems very sturdy. The only thing is that i remember in the description it says removes static or no static and its the most static I have ever seen a brush produce. It only occurs during the brushing and then goes down, so its really not a problem.</li>
            <li> This brush broke after only using it a few times.  The handle completly came off from the brush.  What a piece of crap!  Unfortunately, the brush lasted more than 30 days so I can&#x27;t return it for a new one.  Junk.</li>
            <li> As a brush, it is perfect for using on my hair, but less than a month after I bought it and started using it, the handle separated from the brush piece.  I can glue it back myself, but what a pain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the very high end expensive brushes, but this one actually works the best so far above all the others.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this item.  Light weight and easy to handle, this brush has no problem with my hair and makes the task easy to manage!</li>
            <li> good quality, but expensive</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly how it is described.  I use it for blow drying my hair and I just love it.</li>
            <li> I brought this brush to use on my hair because I like the way it felt and didn&#x27;t pull my hair out while blow drying. But apparently my daughter likes it too. She used it once and I never got it back. She asked if she could keep it because it made her scalp feel good.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush b/c of it&#x27;s claim to reduce static.  Unfortunately I still have the same amount of static with this brush as before.  It is well made and doesn&#x27;t seem to snag my hair as much.  A great product for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush served me well for a couple of years, but then I noticed the little beads at the ends of the bristles were disappearing. The brush is now still pretty effective but uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> While there is not much that is to be said about it, I have to say it is the high quality that one would expect from a Vidal Sassoon brush.  I have had zero issues with it, feels sturdy, and it appears that it will last quite some time.</li>
            <li> This is just a brush. Named &amp;#34;Ionic.&amp;#34; I threw it away as it is poorer quality that others I already own.</li>
            <li> Its not heavy, doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair. I&#x27;m not sure about the anti frizz claims, but it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. It doesn&#x27;t get caught in my hair which is very thick. It seems to smooth my hair better than other more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I liked the brush but it only lasted about a year. The little balls on the top of the bristles were falling off, so it became hard on my scalp.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this brush. I hope it is never discontinued! Perfect, I Love it! :)</li>
            <li> I can hardly believe I&#x27;m writing a review about a hair brush, but this brush is so awesome, I had to do it.  This brush is great!  It glides through my hair so well, and doesn&#x27;t tangle it.  It feels fantastic.  (I will note, however, that I use a wide-tooth comb first to comb out any bad knots in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet, and then I use this brush).  My boyfriend even made an offhand comment that he likes using my brush more than his because it feels so much better than his brush, so that should give you an idea of how good it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is also SUPER easy to clean.  I used to always have those nasty bits of lint/product that I could never clean out of my brushes.  This one doesn&#x27;t have that -- I just clean my hair out of it every so often and it looks good as new.</li>
            <li> I usually buy cheap brushes at the store but decided to splurge and buy this fancier brush off amazon.  I am very glad I did because the brush is really solid.  All the individual pegs are resilient and the brush gives my hair a nice shine and full look when used along with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This brush was amazing when it was new, but after a few months of using it the rounded tips started coming off the individual bristles leaving behind bristles that scratch your scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping/assuming it would be useful for brush styling my hair with my blowdryer.  I assumed this would be the case because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;thermal&amp;#34; brush with the metal base.  However, on my first use three of the bristles melted into sad little droopy bent bristles that snag my hair on future brushings.  It would be great if I just wanted to brush my hair, but I want to use it to blow dry my hair straight!  The hunt for the perfect styling brush continues.  PS: I know that I can use my round styling brush for blow dryer styling, but it&#x27;s fussy and annoying with my long hair.</li>
            <li> sometimes i try to do reviews as soon as i get the product but in this case i am happy i waited a while.&lt;br /&gt;in the beginning i was definitely going to say this is a 5 star brush.&lt;br /&gt;it was sturdy in my hand and managed my bouncy thick hair without too much fussing so instead of just using it to blow dry my hair i made it my number one brush and pushed aside all my other combs.&lt;br /&gt;now only a few short months later i wish i knew where my combs got to :(&lt;br /&gt;i have not used this brush 10 times to blow dry my hair and now almost 90% of the bristles have lost the tips-making it a pain to use.&lt;br /&gt;i wish i can find a better everyday long lasting brush.</li>
