            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>and my gums are great.</li>
            <li>Both, the rotary brush and the water pick are great; four stars.</li>
            <li>Mine is going on 3 1/2 years and works great.  </li>
            <li>I love this!!</li>
            <li>Very kind of Oral-B (P&amp;G)</li>
            <li>The two types of spray angles is a nice feature!</li>
            <li>I used to have a Sonicare that I liked, but this Oral B 9800 blows it away!</li>
            <li>It has helped me more thenany product on the market and my dentist and oral hygienis think it is the best thing for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, just not as great as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>It is the best way to clean your teeth!</li>
            <li>But up until then, it is the best quality irregator available.</li>
            <li>The Oral B is good for saving space while including the toothbrush and irrigator in one unit.  </li>
            <li>efficiency.electric toothbrush is also a good add-on.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because I loved the idea of having a toothbrush/waterjet combination.</li>
            <li>i wanted to like this thing--but every once-in-awhile, even a good company put&#x27;s out a POS.  </li>
            <li>Good power.</li>
            <li>I bought this unit primarily for the OxyJet water pick, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with that.</li>
            <li>The really superior part is the oral irrigator.</li>
            <li>I have always had good check-ups, with no plaque or gum problems since I have used the Oral B devices, so</li>
            <li>Though, there is a question about how good it can prevent water gets inside.  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE MY TOOTHBRUSH/WATER JET COMBINATION!  </li>
            <li>easy to use and a great price</li>
            <li>It does a very good job at cleaning around your teeth and leaving your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>After 1 day of use, I could already see an amazing</li>
            <li>We were thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is nice to find a product that does that.</li>
            <li>The OxyJet irrigator is nice, as well, and can extract some food particles from underneath the gumline.</li>
            <li>I prefer this product because you can get a good \\&quot;power wash\\&quot; for your teeth and gums and makes sure the brush did not miss anything.  </li>
            <li>I liked the concept of a combined unit.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice, smooth feel and does not irritate the gums.</li>
            <li>The waterpic isnt very strong, but seems to do the job.  </li>
            <li>OxyJet is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This professional station is absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>OxyJet DLX 8900 is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The spray diffusion and force are powerful, while the toothbrush appears very effective.  </li>
            <li>and we were amazed by how much better it worked than the old style that we were perfectly happy with!!!!  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using electric tootbrush and irrigator, and I am 100% happy with this product.</li>
            <li>My last dental check up was great, my dentist told me that my gums had greatly improved, were in great shape and that \\&quot;I was doing very well\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Oral B has always been top notch for me and this 8900 DLX is just fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it...</li>
            <li>I also have the same toothbrush which is excellent too.</li>
            <li>Ultrasonex is a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This product does a thorough job in cleaning and refreshing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed the irrigator&#x27;s performance...while it works.  </li>
            <li>I just love mine.</li>
            <li>Eliminates need for 2nd appliance on the counter, and works perfectly!</li>
            <li>I love the 4 quadrant warning and the speed at which the brush vibrates.</li>
            <li>My dentist was very happy that I had finally switched toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>I started using it and because of its ease of use I find that I brush and jet much more often than before.  </li>
            <li>We always remove our brush/jet and store it in the compartments inside the top.  </li>
            <li>We love this Oral-B cleaning tool for our teeth.</li>
            <li>I love this machine.  </li>
            <li>Our grandkids enjoy using it also and love that they can have their own color coded pick and brush.  </li>
            <li>toothbrush is okay, reminds me to brush in quadrants which i guess is helpful.  </li>
            <li>The water irrigator has silver in it to make sure that there is no bacteria in it to get into your mouth.</li>
            <li>The water jet cleans his teeth well enough, no complaints from the hygentist or orthodontist :)  Toothbrush works great!</li>
            <li>you must turn it on with the flossing part in your mouth, or it will spray all over the place :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d know I&#x27;d be getting a shower, which would cover me and most of the bathroom.</li>
            <li>It is better than a water pick.</li>
            <li>It is an outstanding value with the water OxyJet as well as the Oral B tooth  brush system and charger.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS.  </li>
            <li>but I have been able to maintain the depths with even some improvement with this equipment (and floss).      </li>
            <li>Since changing to the Braun, my cleaning and gums look much better, according to my dentist and hygenist as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE HAD MANY ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES AND WATER PIKS</li>
            <li>ALSO, THE DIFFERENT BRUSH HEADS ARE GREAT!  </li>
            <li>housing looks more updated, fashionable.  </li>
            <li>7900, on the contrary, wears a rubber outwear covers the button, which looks more water proof to me.    </li>
            <li>8900 is designed to be able to customize to user&#x27;s preferred rotation speed.  </li>
            <li>The rotating head in the device also very effectively sweeps out food from between the teeth and the gums in a gentle manner and does not \\&quot;blast\\&quot;</li>
            <li>worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>Lose the pin wheel and design the irrigator head more like Water Pic&#x27;s so you can get a good, powerful stream to clean gum lines.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone who wants to be sure they do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for becoming a one stop shop...</li>
            <li>The top tends to get stuck when it is opened for insertion of the filled water tank.</li>
            <li>This product is great, because it combines a fantastic mechanical toothbrush with a fantastic dental irrigator in one package, which is very well built and put together with the care that Braun and Oral-B are known for.</li>
            <li>YOU ENJOY THE MOST.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really reliable and good.</li>
            <li>I had one cavity, and I&#x27;m sure that my next visit will be a lot more successful.    </li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; phenomenon</li>
            <li>, the water reservoir is easy to fill.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to store.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had about a half dozen Oral B irrigation/toothbrush devices over the years and this one is the best yet.  </li>
            <li>The battery is still strong after 10 years, and battery replacements are available.</li>
            <li>, this is not a bad thing, as most people associate that with clean teeth.</li>
            <li>and they saw a huge improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope they&#x27;re still available then.</li>
            <li>overall we are happy with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I had always had a cheap electric toothbrush that I paid $10.00 for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is great but the water pik doesn&#x27;t have quite enough power as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend running the irrigator with 1/2-1/4 cheap mouthwash and water.  </li>
            <li>THAT I ENJOY  AND LINGER OVER THE PROCESS.  </li>
            <li>The Oral B provides great cleaning action with a more gentle spray.  </li>
            <li>The whole unit looks great and dosn&#x27;t take up that much room.</li>
            <li>Same wonderful round toothbrush that gets in all the corners so nicely!      </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for your overall dental cleaning needs as it addresses every aspect of tooth-care perfectly.    </li>
            <li>The new 8900 DLX has a more aggressive brush design, and seems to produce more vibration.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electronic toothbrush  I have purchased, I love it.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B OxyJet is a unique oral irrigator.</li>
            <li>The irrigator is what makes this unique.  </li>
            <li>It makes dental care almost fun!  </li>
            <li>You can clean your teeth, massage your gums, refresh your mouth...    </li>
            <li>With floss it gets teeth as clean as the dentist.</li>
            <li>The speed control on the Toothbrush is easy, just hold the button until right.</li>
            <li>The Oral B center is nice, new and the toothbrush works great.</li>
            <li>When the toothbrush finally charged up, I loved it.</li>
            <li>This provides good dental hygiene if used properly.</li>
            <li>The  product (above) arrived as scheduled in good condition.  </li>
            <li>My gums and teeth our healthy thanks to this</li>
            <li>I do recommend the new 8900 DLX for anyone who wants to maintain good oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>This product is super and I deffinately recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you love your teeth.</li>
            <li>We were even able to use the brushes from the old machine!!   </li>
            <li>Since I bought my first one, I feel it is indispensable for keeping my teeth in my head.</li>
            <li>I feel that it&#x27;s more hygienic than just leaving them mounted and exposed to the normal stuff floating around in a bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The product is very useful and performs exactly as a tooth obsessor would want.  </li>
            <li>He felt he was ready for a replacement (mine is still going strong) and couldn&#x27;t find one in any store.</li>
            <li>This unit is pretty good with the following caveats.  </li>
            <li>There is no doubt that brush is excellent but the water pic is really really really weak.</li>
            <li>/&gt;do remember that if you turn it on without it in your mouth, you spray water everywhere and the spin setting really makes a fine mist with some power but</li>
            <li>If you need a nightlite in your bathroom, that&#x27;s great, otherwise it&#x27;s just wasted energy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using the Floss Action brush heads, they are much better at cleaning.</li>
            <li>I am a bit hesitant to use either irrigator setting around my implant as they both feel a bit too powerful.      </li>
            <li>NOW HIS DENTIST IS NOTING THE SAME KIND OF IMPROVEMENTS.  </li>
            <li>Product is easy to use and to date has been high quality.</li>
            <li>Simple, easy to use, easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>It is all you need, other than flossing, to take good care of your teeth and Gums.</li>
            <li>really an improvement over the original...</li>
            <li>At least the toothbrush was good while it lasted!</li>
            <li>The general clean feeling after brushing with the oral-b brush made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet, smooth, and comfortable to use--with the right tooth paste, teeth whitening at the dentist is not nessecary.</li>
            <li>I prefer the action of the OxyJet as it is much gentler and yet achieves the same result and most importantly because I find it comfortable to use</li>
            <li>Fabulous product, really cleans the whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>This one  has all the same stuff I loved about the old one, but is quieter and now has adjustable speed control.  </li>
            <li>The battery operated brush seems very much like the Sonicare unit in its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s NOT an environmental friendly way to push new sales).    </li>
            <li>When I switched to the new one, I was very surprised at how much more power it had.</li>
            <li>I am sure this little unit will keep me out of the surgeons chair and my boyfriend wants to be sure never to end up with gum disease again.  </li>
            <li>At first I was diligently using the Oxy jet 2 times a day after brushing.  </li>
            <li>My friend and I both bought one of these when they first came out about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>Works exactly like it says it does.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different oral irrigators and a couple of electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>, I use it much more often (daily) than I did the WaterPik</li>
            <li>I just love this combination of toothbrush with all its different heads and water pik.  </li>
            <li>The first is still working, but noisey.  </li>
            <li>I wore the first one out.</li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t come under the \\&quot;too much information\\&quot; category !</li>
            <li>The first lasted 15 years.</li>
            <li>never knew what I was missing in terms of having a good toothbrush and my oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We both have noticed that the OxyJet really does a good job of getting stuff down under the gum line that is often missed.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t an easy way to get it fixed and, in the end, the projected cost is almost as much as replacing it.  </li>
            <li>I have been wanting to upgrade my old original Oral B electric toothbrush to the newer higher speed versions out now....    </li>
            <li>convenient, compact cleaning machine with multi-speed choices for the brush or waterjet, different brush heads and a tongue cleaner create smooth teeth and a fresh mouth....</li>
            <li>and you feel confident that you can skip a dentist appointment or two...but not completely since the dentist is the expert.    </li>
            <li>Using the device in the non-rotating straight stream only mode is not anywhere near as effective as the rotating head mode.  </li>
            <li>I love their personal live person contact availability.</li>
            <li>Last year I wrote:  Love my new Oral B (Braun) toothbrush</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is the same one that can be purchased separately and is very efficient, thorough and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Both the electric Tooth Brush and the Irrigator are great aids in eliminating poor tooth care and Gum Diseases.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He calls me by my name now thanks to this product haha&lt;</li>
            <li>I keep it on the spinning setting which really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is by no means a replacment for my old trusty Water Pik...which is far more powerful and gets in between my teeth and into the spots where only floss was thought to go!    </li>
            <li>so I am replacing the whole system.  </li>
            <li>Our teeth are much cleaner and even our dentist has noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use that manual cleaners.  </li>
            <li>The OxyJet uses a much lower water pressure but with the addition of pressurised micro-air-bubbles which \\&quot;attack\\&quot; the bacteria.     </li>
            <li>To me it felt very unnatural and I just could not get used to it.    </li>
            <li>The handle of the toothbrush has a blue light that stays on all the time (it blinks when charging).</li>
            <li>But I would caution anyone who has dental implants, to consult their dental practitioner, and take reasonable care when using the 8900 DLX.</li>
            <li>Having it all in one makes it so much easier not to skip a step in oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still amazed at how much the water jet gets stuff out from between your teeth</li>
            <li>But the whole package is flimsy.</li>
            <li>Oral-B products are made and, presumably, designed in Germany where they have 220V a-c power just like in much of the rest of the world.</li>
            <li>I also purchased a Oral-B Pro-Care and really like it.  </li>
            <li>That really helped my gums.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is fine, nothing special, and it only comes with brushes for one person (a regular brush and one for polishing).</li>
            <li>A week before my next checkup, I noticed some significant plaque buildup on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Much improved over older models.</li>
            <li>Your mouth definitely feels clean.  </li>
            <li>The last set of Oral-B Precision Clean Brush heads  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t to particular at this point.</li>
            <li>The selling point of this particular unit is the water jet.  </li>
            <li>The difference is like rinsing your car with a high pressure hose (waterpik) versus rinsing your car with a pressurized sprayer.</li>
            <li>I highly HIGHLY recomend it.  </li>
            <li>The WaterPik relies on high water pressure to remove food debris and bacteria from in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>With the new irrigator, the monojet-stream emits from a wider, low-profile tip, making it more difficult to aim, and, even though it has a wide-stream jet setting, this setting produces a more intense, shower-head type spray of water than the old model.</li>
            <li>It lasts about two years after normal wear and tear.</li>
            <li>All in all, 8900 is pretty much the same as 7900.  </li>
            <li>I previously owned a Rotadent electric toothbrush and this brush works FAR better.    </li>
            <li>Although some reviews say here that irrigator works weak, I am ok with it, it is strong enough for me at the level 4 or 5.</li>
            <li>Now I have this brand new one for when I&#x27;m in New York.</li>
            <li>You will need to buy new heads on a periodic basis.</li>
            <li>Cost to repair is almost as much as a new unit.</li>
            <li>but I do with the new equipment.</li>
            <li>My husband would never use an electric toothbrush, but after seeing my new one he wanted to try it too.  </li>
            <li>So my wife decides to have a new one, coz it cost $40+ to replace a new pipe for that one</li>
            <li>Personally I prefer the OxyJet, while it is true that on the first initial use you do not get that immediate clean feeling (i.e. a sharp defined edge to each tooth when sweeping your tongue across the back of your teeth) with continuous use (and in conjunction with regular brushing) that clean feeling does come about as the micro-bubbles work on the bacteria and plaque.    </li>
            <li>7 weeks ago I had my gums charted as they appeared to be in rough shape and after many areas around my teeth that were being charted in the double digits</li>
            <li>the main reason we purchased this item was for the water pik - we had an old sonic toothbrush that was worn out so</li>
            <li>She seemed very surprised</li>
            <li>The first lasted several years.    </li>
            <li>We have had Braun electric toothbrushes in the past and have always been pleased.  </li>
            <li>that will definitely bake the tubing to a crisp.</li>
            <li>REALLY SURPRISED MY DENTIST!  </li>
            <li>The water jet definitely removes stuff that the brush misses, and leaves your teeth feeling just left the dentist clean.</li>
            <li>The two different devices clean interdentally in two very different ways.     </li>
            <li>The last one held up for almost 10 years and this one seems to be pretty much the same high quality.</li>
            <li>Shipping the entire unit back will cost more then the missing part is worth.</li>
            <li>I have always maxed out oral irrigators in the past and never found much to get excited about.  </li>
            <li>I learned this the hard way, and I&#x27;m really glad I switched.  </li>
            <li>The OXY JET is down right wimpy!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clear what Braun and Oral-B&#x27;s customer service job is.    </li>
            <li>I have a 5 year old almost identical</li>
            <li>I set to level 5 and it is even weaker the level 1 of my old one.</li>
            <li>With my old Oral B I did not need to floss</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the rotating brush and replaced it with the Sonic Complete brush.</li>
            <li>The plastic became old and brittle.</li>
            <li>It requires two button pushes to activate (unlike the old design), one on the side of the unit and one on the irrigator handle.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]]  </li>
            <li>So far, I have not have had any problems  with the electric tootbrush and the \\&quot;Water-Pik\\&quot; portion of the unit.  </li>
            <li>So far I have not had any problem with the water part.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for my 12 year old Braun Oral B OC-9525, Model 4714 that had served me well, but eventually its battery stopped holding a charge, and the pump began to leak.  </li>
            <li>, looks like my old model with added bonuses.  </li>
            <li>The old one lasted over 4.5 years.  </li>
            <li>It is way too big and kept coming on when you hit the button on the right side by accident.&lt;br /&gt;Taking this one BACK!</li>
            <li>would not only replace my old brush but also replace my old \\&quot;WATER PIK\\&quot;    NO WAY!!</li>
            <li>Since the older one still worked, I used it until it finally died after owning it for about 10 years.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 1 1/2 years and the 2nd one lasted 3 years so maybe this will last 6 years!?</li>
            <li>The old model had a single little jet that was easy to guide around gum-line and spaces between teeth, and it had a feature where the nozzle could be retracted in order to get a low-intensity flush.  </li>
            <li>There is no other product on the market that I have found that compares to this devise.</li>
            <li>There is no comparison, the OxyJet wins hands down in effectiveness!  </li>
            <li>I think I still have another 5 years left on my old one.</li>
            <li>the water pik did not have near enough power even set a 5 the highest level.</li>
            <li>The OxyJet is NOT a replacement for flossing regularly, but if you use the OxyJet with any regularity you can probably put off flossing as frequently.</li>
            <li>The only aspect that is troubling to me is that the water pic does not have the force that the old model had.</li>
            <li>Recently the hose of the irrigation system broke near the handle.</li>
            <li>Oops, we can&#x27;t tell you how long it&#x27;ll take to get the new one.  </li>
            <li>After starting use with this unit my gums went from bad to great.</li>
            <li>I felt really frustrated as I had taken great care to brush thoroughly since my last dentist visit.    </li>
            <li>Finally, it would be prudent of me to note that I am not a Medical Professional, dental or otherwise</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that the power of the jet, which is not quite strong enough sometimes, but still acceptable.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ORAL CARE CENTER.  </li>
            <li>I bought are junk, the brush heads got really sloppy and then fell off, two were less than two weeks old and the second two only lasted a month at the most!  </li>
            <li>It really made my teeth feel dentist-office clean, so I decided to keep the machine even with the lame waterjet.</li>
            <li>When it works, it&#x27;s fine, but when it doesn&#x27;t (and that&#x27;s about 90% of the time), the stream is so weak</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my existing Oral B center which was very old.</li>
            <li>The life expectancy of the irrigator (based on owning three) is about 2 years for a single adult using it.  </li>
            <li>she told me it only has an expected lifetime of three years anyway, but they&#x27;d send me a new one if I sent them the receipt.  </li>
            <li>I expected the new model, which looks very similar, to perform like its predecessor.      </li>
            <li>Most of the negative reviews that it has received have been from previous WaterPik users, who complain about the OxyJet&#x27;s low water pressure.    </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great job cleaning.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> and my gums are great.</li>
            <li> Both, the rotary brush and the water pick are great; four stars.</li>
            <li> Mine is going on 3 1/2 years and works great.  </li>
            <li> I love this!!</li>
            <li> Very kind of Oral-B (P&amp;G)</li>
            <li> The two types of spray angles is a nice feature!</li>
            <li> I used to have a Sonicare that I liked, but this Oral B 9800 blows it away!</li>
            <li> It has helped me more thenany product on the market and my dentist and oral hygienis think it is the best thing for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, just not as great as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> It is the best way to clean your teeth!</li>
            <li> But up until then, it is the best quality irregator available.</li>
            <li> The Oral B is good for saving space while including the toothbrush and irrigator in one unit.  </li>
            <li> efficiency.electric toothbrush is also a good add-on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I loved the idea of having a toothbrush/waterjet combination.</li>
            <li> i wanted to like this thing--but every once-in-awhile, even a good company put&#x27;s out a POS.  </li>
            <li> Good power.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit primarily for the OxyJet water pick, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with that.</li>
            <li> The really superior part is the oral irrigator.</li>
            <li> I have always had good check-ups, with no plaque or gum problems since I have used the Oral B devices, so</li>
            <li> Though, there is a question about how good it can prevent water gets inside.  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE MY TOOTHBRUSH/WATER JET COMBINATION!  </li>
            <li> easy to use and a great price</li>
            <li> It does a very good job at cleaning around your teeth and leaving your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> After 1 day of use, I could already see an amazing</li>
            <li> We were thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is nice to find a product that does that.</li>
            <li> The OxyJet irrigator is nice, as well, and can extract some food particles from underneath the gumline.</li>
            <li> I prefer this product because you can get a good \\&quot;power wash\\&quot; for your teeth and gums and makes sure the brush did not miss anything.  </li>
            <li> I liked the concept of a combined unit.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice, smooth feel and does not irritate the gums.</li>
            <li> The waterpic isnt very strong, but seems to do the job.  </li>
            <li> OxyJet is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This professional station is absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> OxyJet DLX 8900 is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The spray diffusion and force are powerful, while the toothbrush appears very effective.  </li>
            <li> and we were amazed by how much better it worked than the old style that we were perfectly happy with!!!!  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using electric tootbrush and irrigator, and I am 100% happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My last dental check up was great, my dentist told me that my gums had greatly improved, were in great shape and that \\&quot;I was doing very well\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Oral B has always been top notch for me and this 8900 DLX is just fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love it...</li>
            <li> I also have the same toothbrush which is excellent too.</li>
            <li> Ultrasonex is a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product does a thorough job in cleaning and refreshing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed the irrigator&#x27;s performance...while it works.  </li>
            <li> I just love mine.</li>
            <li> Eliminates need for 2nd appliance on the counter, and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love the 4 quadrant warning and the speed at which the brush vibrates.</li>
            <li> My dentist was very happy that I had finally switched toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> I started using it and because of its ease of use I find that I brush and jet much more often than before.  </li>
            <li> We always remove our brush/jet and store it in the compartments inside the top.  </li>
            <li> We love this Oral-B cleaning tool for our teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this machine.  </li>
            <li> Our grandkids enjoy using it also and love that they can have their own color coded pick and brush.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush is okay, reminds me to brush in quadrants which i guess is helpful.  </li>
            <li> The water irrigator has silver in it to make sure that there is no bacteria in it to get into your mouth.</li>
            <li> The water jet cleans his teeth well enough, no complaints from the hygentist or orthodontist :)  Toothbrush works great!</li>
            <li> you must turn it on with the flossing part in your mouth, or it will spray all over the place :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d know I&#x27;d be getting a shower, which would cover me and most of the bathroom.</li>
            <li> It is better than a water pick.</li>
            <li> It is an outstanding value with the water OxyJet as well as the Oral B tooth  brush system and charger.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS.  </li>
            <li> but I have been able to maintain the depths with even some improvement with this equipment (and floss).      </li>
            <li> Since changing to the Braun, my cleaning and gums look much better, according to my dentist and hygenist as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE HAD MANY ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES AND WATER PIKS</li>
            <li> ALSO, THE DIFFERENT BRUSH HEADS ARE GREAT!  </li>
            <li> housing looks more updated, fashionable.  </li>
            <li> 7900, on the contrary, wears a rubber outwear covers the button, which looks more water proof to me.    </li>
            <li> 8900 is designed to be able to customize to user&#x27;s preferred rotation speed.  </li>
            <li> The rotating head in the device also very effectively sweeps out food from between the teeth and the gums in a gentle manner and does not \\&quot;blast\\&quot;</li>
            <li> worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Lose the pin wheel and design the irrigator head more like Water Pic&#x27;s so you can get a good, powerful stream to clean gum lines.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone who wants to be sure they do a good job.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for becoming a one stop shop...</li>
            <li> The top tends to get stuck when it is opened for insertion of the filled water tank.</li>
            <li> This product is great, because it combines a fantastic mechanical toothbrush with a fantastic dental irrigator in one package, which is very well built and put together with the care that Braun and Oral-B are known for.</li>
            <li> YOU ENJOY THE MOST.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really reliable and good.</li>
            <li> I had one cavity, and I&#x27;m sure that my next visit will be a lot more successful.    </li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; phenomenon</li>
            <li> , the water reservoir is easy to fill.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had about a half dozen Oral B irrigation/toothbrush devices over the years and this one is the best yet.  </li>
            <li> The battery is still strong after 10 years, and battery replacements are available.</li>
            <li> , this is not a bad thing, as most people associate that with clean teeth.</li>
            <li> and they saw a huge improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope they&#x27;re still available then.</li>
            <li> overall we are happy with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I had always had a cheap electric toothbrush that I paid $10.00 for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is great but the water pik doesn&#x27;t have quite enough power as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend running the irrigator with 1/2-1/4 cheap mouthwash and water.  </li>
            <li> THAT I ENJOY  AND LINGER OVER THE PROCESS.  </li>
            <li> The Oral B provides great cleaning action with a more gentle spray.  </li>
            <li> The whole unit looks great and dosn&#x27;t take up that much room.</li>
            <li> Same wonderful round toothbrush that gets in all the corners so nicely!      </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for your overall dental cleaning needs as it addresses every aspect of tooth-care perfectly.    </li>
            <li> The new 8900 DLX has a more aggressive brush design, and seems to produce more vibration.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electronic toothbrush  I have purchased, I love it.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B OxyJet is a unique oral irrigator.</li>
            <li> The irrigator is what makes this unique.  </li>
            <li> It makes dental care almost fun!  </li>
            <li> You can clean your teeth, massage your gums, refresh your mouth...    </li>
            <li> With floss it gets teeth as clean as the dentist.</li>
            <li> The speed control on the Toothbrush is easy, just hold the button until right.</li>
            <li> The Oral B center is nice, new and the toothbrush works great.</li>
            <li> When the toothbrush finally charged up, I loved it.</li>
            <li> This provides good dental hygiene if used properly.</li>
            <li> The  product (above) arrived as scheduled in good condition.  </li>
            <li> My gums and teeth our healthy thanks to this</li>
            <li> I do recommend the new 8900 DLX for anyone who wants to maintain good oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li> This product is super and I deffinately recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you love your teeth.</li>
            <li> We were even able to use the brushes from the old machine!!   </li>
            <li> Since I bought my first one, I feel it is indispensable for keeping my teeth in my head.</li>
            <li> I feel that it&#x27;s more hygienic than just leaving them mounted and exposed to the normal stuff floating around in a bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The product is very useful and performs exactly as a tooth obsessor would want.  </li>
            <li> He felt he was ready for a replacement (mine is still going strong) and couldn&#x27;t find one in any store.</li>
            <li> This unit is pretty good with the following caveats.  </li>
            <li> There is no doubt that brush is excellent but the water pic is really really really weak.</li>
            <li> /&gt;do remember that if you turn it on without it in your mouth, you spray water everywhere and the spin setting really makes a fine mist with some power but</li>
            <li> If you need a nightlite in your bathroom, that&#x27;s great, otherwise it&#x27;s just wasted energy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using the Floss Action brush heads, they are much better at cleaning.</li>
            <li> I am a bit hesitant to use either irrigator setting around my implant as they both feel a bit too powerful.      </li>
            <li> NOW HIS DENTIST IS NOTING THE SAME KIND OF IMPROVEMENTS.  </li>
            <li> Product is easy to use and to date has been high quality.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use, easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> It is all you need, other than flossing, to take good care of your teeth and Gums.</li>
            <li> really an improvement over the original...</li>
            <li> At least the toothbrush was good while it lasted!</li>
            <li> The general clean feeling after brushing with the oral-b brush made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet, smooth, and comfortable to use--with the right tooth paste, teeth whitening at the dentist is not nessecary.</li>
            <li> I prefer the action of the OxyJet as it is much gentler and yet achieves the same result and most importantly because I find it comfortable to use</li>
            <li> Fabulous product, really cleans the whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> This one  has all the same stuff I loved about the old one, but is quieter and now has adjustable speed control.  </li>
            <li> The battery operated brush seems very much like the Sonicare unit in its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s NOT an environmental friendly way to push new sales).    </li>
            <li> When I switched to the new one, I was very surprised at how much more power it had.</li>
            <li> I am sure this little unit will keep me out of the surgeons chair and my boyfriend wants to be sure never to end up with gum disease again.  </li>
            <li> At first I was diligently using the Oxy jet 2 times a day after brushing.  </li>
            <li> My friend and I both bought one of these when they first came out about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Works exactly like it says it does.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different oral irrigators and a couple of electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> , I use it much more often (daily) than I did the WaterPik</li>
            <li> I just love this combination of toothbrush with all its different heads and water pik.  </li>
            <li> The first is still working, but noisey.  </li>
            <li> I wore the first one out.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t come under the \\&quot;too much information\\&quot; category !</li>
            <li> The first lasted 15 years.</li>
            <li> never knew what I was missing in terms of having a good toothbrush and my oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We both have noticed that the OxyJet really does a good job of getting stuff down under the gum line that is often missed.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t an easy way to get it fixed and, in the end, the projected cost is almost as much as replacing it.  </li>
            <li> I have been wanting to upgrade my old original Oral B electric toothbrush to the newer higher speed versions out now....    </li>
            <li> convenient, compact cleaning machine with multi-speed choices for the brush or waterjet, different brush heads and a tongue cleaner create smooth teeth and a fresh mouth....</li>
            <li> and you feel confident that you can skip a dentist appointment or two...but not completely since the dentist is the expert.    </li>
            <li> Using the device in the non-rotating straight stream only mode is not anywhere near as effective as the rotating head mode.  </li>
            <li> I love their personal live person contact availability.</li>
            <li> Last year I wrote:  Love my new Oral B (Braun) toothbrush</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is the same one that can be purchased separately and is very efficient, thorough and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Both the electric Tooth Brush and the Irrigator are great aids in eliminating poor tooth care and Gum Diseases.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He calls me by my name now thanks to this product haha&lt;</li>
            <li> I keep it on the spinning setting which really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is by no means a replacment for my old trusty Water Pik...which is far more powerful and gets in between my teeth and into the spots where only floss was thought to go!    </li>
            <li> so I am replacing the whole system.  </li>
            <li> Our teeth are much cleaner and even our dentist has noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use that manual cleaners.  </li>
            <li> The OxyJet uses a much lower water pressure but with the addition of pressurised micro-air-bubbles which \\&quot;attack\\&quot; the bacteria.     </li>
            <li> To me it felt very unnatural and I just could not get used to it.    </li>
            <li> The handle of the toothbrush has a blue light that stays on all the time (it blinks when charging).</li>
            <li> But I would caution anyone who has dental implants, to consult their dental practitioner, and take reasonable care when using the 8900 DLX.</li>
            <li> Having it all in one makes it so much easier not to skip a step in oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still amazed at how much the water jet gets stuff out from between your teeth</li>
            <li> But the whole package is flimsy.</li>
            <li> Oral-B products are made and, presumably, designed in Germany where they have 220V a-c power just like in much of the rest of the world.</li>
            <li> I also purchased a Oral-B Pro-Care and really like it.  </li>
            <li> That really helped my gums.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is fine, nothing special, and it only comes with brushes for one person (a regular brush and one for polishing).</li>
            <li> A week before my next checkup, I noticed some significant plaque buildup on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Much improved over older models.</li>
            <li> Your mouth definitely feels clean.  </li>
            <li> The last set of Oral-B Precision Clean Brush heads  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t to particular at this point.</li>
            <li> The selling point of this particular unit is the water jet.  </li>
            <li> The difference is like rinsing your car with a high pressure hose (waterpik) versus rinsing your car with a pressurized sprayer.</li>
            <li> I highly HIGHLY recomend it.  </li>
            <li> The WaterPik relies on high water pressure to remove food debris and bacteria from in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> With the new irrigator, the monojet-stream emits from a wider, low-profile tip, making it more difficult to aim, and, even though it has a wide-stream jet setting, this setting produces a more intense, shower-head type spray of water than the old model.</li>
            <li> It lasts about two years after normal wear and tear.</li>
            <li> All in all, 8900 is pretty much the same as 7900.  </li>
            <li> I previously owned a Rotadent electric toothbrush and this brush works FAR better.    </li>
            <li> Although some reviews say here that irrigator works weak, I am ok with it, it is strong enough for me at the level 4 or 5.</li>
            <li> Now I have this brand new one for when I&#x27;m in New York.</li>
            <li> You will need to buy new heads on a periodic basis.</li>
            <li> Cost to repair is almost as much as a new unit.</li>
            <li> but I do with the new equipment.</li>
            <li> My husband would never use an electric toothbrush, but after seeing my new one he wanted to try it too.  </li>
            <li> So my wife decides to have a new one, coz it cost $40+ to replace a new pipe for that one</li>
            <li> Personally I prefer the OxyJet, while it is true that on the first initial use you do not get that immediate clean feeling (i.e. a sharp defined edge to each tooth when sweeping your tongue across the back of your teeth) with continuous use (and in conjunction with regular brushing) that clean feeling does come about as the micro-bubbles work on the bacteria and plaque.    </li>
            <li> 7 weeks ago I had my gums charted as they appeared to be in rough shape and after many areas around my teeth that were being charted in the double digits</li>
            <li> the main reason we purchased this item was for the water pik - we had an old sonic toothbrush that was worn out so</li>
            <li> She seemed very surprised</li>
            <li> The first lasted several years.    </li>
            <li> We have had Braun electric toothbrushes in the past and have always been pleased.  </li>
            <li> that will definitely bake the tubing to a crisp.</li>
            <li> REALLY SURPRISED MY DENTIST!  </li>
            <li> The water jet definitely removes stuff that the brush misses, and leaves your teeth feeling just left the dentist clean.</li>
            <li> The two different devices clean interdentally in two very different ways.     </li>
            <li> The last one held up for almost 10 years and this one seems to be pretty much the same high quality.</li>
            <li> Shipping the entire unit back will cost more then the missing part is worth.</li>
            <li> I have always maxed out oral irrigators in the past and never found much to get excited about.  </li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way, and I&#x27;m really glad I switched.  </li>
            <li> The OXY JET is down right wimpy!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clear what Braun and Oral-B&#x27;s customer service job is.    </li>
            <li> I have a 5 year old almost identical</li>
            <li> I set to level 5 and it is even weaker the level 1 of my old one.</li>
            <li> With my old Oral B I did not need to floss</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the rotating brush and replaced it with the Sonic Complete brush.</li>
            <li> The plastic became old and brittle.</li>
            <li> It requires two button pushes to activate (unlike the old design), one on the side of the unit and one on the irrigator handle.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]]  </li>
            <li> So far, I have not have had any problems  with the electric tootbrush and the \\&quot;Water-Pik\\&quot; portion of the unit.  </li>
            <li> So far I have not had any problem with the water part.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my 12 year old Braun Oral B OC-9525, Model 4714 that had served me well, but eventually its battery stopped holding a charge, and the pump began to leak.  </li>
            <li> , looks like my old model with added bonuses.  </li>
            <li> The old one lasted over 4.5 years.  </li>
            <li> It is way too big and kept coming on when you hit the button on the right side by accident.&lt;br /&gt;Taking this one BACK!</li>
            <li> would not only replace my old brush but also replace my old \\&quot;WATER PIK\\&quot;    NO WAY!!</li>
            <li> Since the older one still worked, I used it until it finally died after owning it for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 1 1/2 years and the 2nd one lasted 3 years so maybe this will last 6 years!?</li>
            <li> The old model had a single little jet that was easy to guide around gum-line and spaces between teeth, and it had a feature where the nozzle could be retracted in order to get a low-intensity flush.  </li>
            <li> There is no other product on the market that I have found that compares to this devise.</li>
            <li> There is no comparison, the OxyJet wins hands down in effectiveness!  </li>
            <li> I think I still have another 5 years left on my old one.</li>
            <li> the water pik did not have near enough power even set a 5 the highest level.</li>
            <li> The OxyJet is NOT a replacement for flossing regularly, but if you use the OxyJet with any regularity you can probably put off flossing as frequently.</li>
            <li> The only aspect that is troubling to me is that the water pic does not have the force that the old model had.</li>
            <li> Recently the hose of the irrigation system broke near the handle.</li>
            <li> Oops, we can&#x27;t tell you how long it&#x27;ll take to get the new one.  </li>
            <li> After starting use with this unit my gums went from bad to great.</li>
            <li> I felt really frustrated as I had taken great care to brush thoroughly since my last dentist visit.    </li>
            <li> Finally, it would be prudent of me to note that I am not a Medical Professional, dental or otherwise</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the power of the jet, which is not quite strong enough sometimes, but still acceptable.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ORAL CARE CENTER.  </li>
            <li> I bought are junk, the brush heads got really sloppy and then fell off, two were less than two weeks old and the second two only lasted a month at the most!  </li>
            <li> It really made my teeth feel dentist-office clean, so I decided to keep the machine even with the lame waterjet.</li>
            <li> When it works, it&#x27;s fine, but when it doesn&#x27;t (and that&#x27;s about 90% of the time), the stream is so weak</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my existing Oral B center which was very old.</li>
            <li> The life expectancy of the irrigator (based on owning three) is about 2 years for a single adult using it.  </li>
            <li> she told me it only has an expected lifetime of three years anyway, but they&#x27;d send me a new one if I sent them the receipt.  </li>
            <li> I expected the new model, which looks very similar, to perform like its predecessor.      </li>
            <li> Most of the negative reviews that it has received have been from previous WaterPik users, who complain about the OxyJet&#x27;s low water pressure.    </li>
            <li> The water container grows black mold in the small holes on the bottom and there is no way to clean it well.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I can say on this machine is the water pressure is 1/2 what the first one was.</li>
            <li> I expect this one to last as long.</li>
            <li> The OxyJet is a little messy (splashes water everywhere) but the end result is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon.com does not appear to have a phone number (I could not find it) to call for customer support and their online form only allows for a complete return of the product instead of offering the ability to get the missing part.</li>
            <li> But the water pic device has about half the output pressure of the older Oral B center.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t re-charge no matter how long I leave</li>
            <li> I looked for a long time to find this product and Amazon helped me get it.</li>
            <li> Looking foward to our next dentist visit (not really).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have lived so long without this product.  </li>
            <li> This is the third Care Center I have purchased.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used irrigators and electric toothbrushes for a long time and like the way they add to the dental cleaning process.  </li>
            <li> With power supplies like this being basically commodities, they don&#x27;t even have the excuse of cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well is rather difficult and time consuming, but the water pick really helps to clean all the in between places that are hard to get to.</li>
            <li> Unlike other irrigators that deliver a concentrated stream which can be painful to the gums, the flow from this is diffused but still quite effective at dislodging food left in the gum pockets.</li>
            <li> At my 5 week check up with a new charting process...the numbers were unbelievable lower.  </li>
            <li> The next waterpik will be from other company.</li>
            <li> The single voltage capability of the power supply is a killer in my book.</li>
            <li> Only buy this expensive model IF you really are going to use the waterpick otherwise get the basic model and save some cash.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I had an older Oral Care Center that was slowly dying on us.</li>
            <li> The water pressure is not nearly strong enough to get between your teeth, so I never used it again as it seemed a complete waste of time.</li>
            <li> In the previous one, I&#x27;d be in the midst of using it when a finger would bump into something and next thing</li>
            <li> I previously used a Sonicare and my hygenist mentioned I had extra plaque.  </li>
            <li> Even at its lowest speed setting, this has, I believe, been a bit too rough for my single dental implant.  </li>
            <li> With the OxyJet I went from terrible gum problems to clean and healthy gums with no more \\&quot;pockets\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Oxy Jet care center over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> The Oral B ProfessionalCare 8900 DLX OxyJet Oral Care Center    is a combo unit that I had hoped</li>
            <li> The only downside is it is not available in retail stores that I can tell, &amp; it tends to wear out after 6ish months.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get heavy use and sat in the same place for two years.  </li>
            <li> just be careful when using the water jet side.</li>
            <li> The lid hinges have long since broken during normal handling while traveling.</li>
            <li> Overall, it seems to work well -- just less pressure!</li>
            <li> After I groused about the bad design (you can easily see why it sprang a leak)</li>
            <li> I also had about half a dozen other oral irrigators.</li>
            <li> I thkink those with tube cracking issues must have hard water or possibly leave the unit on a countertop in the sun?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I love the functionality, but the broken lid hinge is bad enough.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the rotating head will wear out in about 3 months and will not rotate anymore.  </li>
            <li> Luckily it has the same footprint and charges on this base.</li>
            <li> Just press down the button and hold it, the brush will start from the highest speed and gradually lower its speed, release the button at the speed you want it.  </li>
            <li> Although I read reviews of the water pic device being weaker than previous models, I didn&#x27;t heed the advice.     </li>
            <li> Well, I have now had the Oral B 8900 for about 2 and a half months, and the battery is completely dead.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth are not clean.  </li>
            <li> Add a little mouth wash to the water container also.  </li>
            <li> Each one seems to have some little improvements over the one before.</li>
            <li> and it takes up so little room compared to having 2 separate appliances.</li>
            <li> Worse, and these days totally inexcusable, is the fact that the power supply is limited to 110V a-c, which makes the package totally useless for the, even occasional traveler.</li>
            <li> The water pik device started leaking last month and I called Braun/Oral-B/Procter Gamble today and spoke to an unpleasant person and then her even more unpleasant boss.  </li>
            <li> As time went on, I&#x27;d skip a few days of using the oxy jet but of course continued to brush.  </li>
            <li> The water \\&quot;switch\\&quot; is giving me some trouble</li>
            <li> I have tried waterpiks and find that they are too harsh on the gums.  </li>
            <li> , I knew I was in trouble.</li>
            <li> Well, after finding this item sold out in a few stores-</li>
            <li> I have had some pain develop at my implant a few hours after use, and have since then stopped using the brush over the implant.  </li>
            <li> I use this center at least twice per day.</li>
            <li> I had beginning stages of gum disease and after using it for a few weeks the bleeding stopped and no more problems.</li>
            <li> Messy!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be foolish enough to buy this...too expensive and too flimsy.</li>
            <li> While not sure this machine did it, I figure no need to vibrate those teeth</li>
            <li> Whenever I used to use my WaterPik, the cleaning felt very harsh, as if I had just visited my Oral Hygienist</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the hose is not very good quality and once it tears to replace it you need to ship or take to a service center.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> I found it hard to find the brush and water pick unit together.  </li>
            <li> I had to go through an unpleasant scaling procedure to do a deep gum cleaning.  </li>
            <li> this unit&#x27;s not a good value by my estimation.</li>
            <li> weak...</li>
            <li> I just want to say DO NOT BUY THIS if you want to test how weak the water pic is.</li>
            <li> The water pressure is weak even on the highest setting 5.  </li>
            <li> If you are buying the OxyJet hoping that it will have the same \\&quot;power\\&quot; (i.e. psi) as any of the WaterPiks&#x27; you will be severely disappointed.    </li>
            <li> whatever it is, was weak out of the gate and got worse over time.  </li>
            <li> Bought this because my dental hygenist suggested i try this to help with my cleanings and improve my poor gum condition.</li>
            <li> My only concern is the brush vibrates so darn violently, I concerned it will loosen my capped front teeth.  </li>
            <li> All in all, my boyfriend just spent over 4K and some VERY unpleasant days in periodontal agony.   </li>
            <li> it truly is poor!</li>
            <li> Difficult to install.</li>
            <li> Awfully expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I threw the box away once I decided to keep it, so I guess I&#x27;m stuck with a lemon product.</li>
            <li> I told him I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing wrong, since I flosh, use listerine, and use an electronic toothbrush twice a day.  </li>
            <li> No matter how thoroughly you brush, if you&#x27;re using the wrong tool, you could be wasting your time.  </li>
            <li> Really mad as I couldn&#x27;t use it even after one month of buying online.</li>
            <li> Impossible to control when the bristle head is flopping around like crazy,</li>
            <li> teeth are so bad the Dentist always called me the plaque</li>
            <li> so disappointed i cant get anymore.</li>
            <li> We had used an Oral B for years, but the switch went bad on the water pick and it would turn on in standby!  </li>

            <li> Both the electric Tooth Brush and the Irrigator are great aids in eliminating poor tooth care and Gum Diseases. I add a bit of mouthwash to the rinse water and it cleans my breath as it removes residue betwween my teeth. The timer allows for a through cleaning/brushing of the teeth and Gums by quadrant. It is all you need, other than flossing, to take good care of your teeth and Gums.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oxy Jet care center over a year ago.  I had found out from my dentist that my gum line was receding and if it progressed, I would be faced with surgery and who knows what else? (Pain, dentures, etc)  I under went a deep cleaning and purchased the Oral B Oxy Jet.  At first I was diligently using the Oxy jet 2 times a day after brushing.  As time went on, I&#x27;d skip a few days of using the oxy jet but of course continued to brush.  My last dental check up was great, my dentist told me that my gums had greatly improved, were in great shape and that \\&quot;I was doing very well\\&quot;.  She seemed very surprised and I told her what I had been using.  She said that she recommends any water jet cleaning in addition to brushing to her patients.    I am very happy with this product.  I would recommend using the Floss Action brush heads, they are much better at cleaning.</li>
            <li> The Oral B ProfessionalCare 8900 is a great machine.    This is my second one. The first lasted several years.    The only negative I can say on this machine is the water pressure is 1/2 what the first one was.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com does not appear to have a phone number (I could not find it) to call for customer support and their online form only allows for a complete return of the product instead of offering the ability to get the missing part. Shipping the entire unit back will cost more then the missing part is worth. After several hours on the phone with P&amp;G, they offered to replace the entire unit and cover shipping both ways. Very kind of Oral-B (P&amp;G). I love their personal live person contact availability.</li>
            <li> Oral B has always been top notch for me and this 8900 DLX is just fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are so bad the Dentist always called me the plaque king  lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but after 6 months on this I went to the next cleaning and they saw a huge improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He calls me by my name now thanks to this product haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been putting this thing to the test for about a year now and I love it...I keep it on the spinning setting which really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do remember that if you turn it on without it in your mouth, you spray water everywhere and the spin setting really makes a fine mist with some power but its still a top notch product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks Oral B!!!</li>
            <li> Amazon asked me to review it because I ordered it. However, I never received it since it seems to be permanently out of stock. So I ended up canceling my order. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;NOTE. I have a 5 year old almost identical OxyJet  irrigator which is excellent although I had to repair its leaking plastic tube. I also have the same toothbrush which is excellent too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;NOTE. I also had about half a dozen other oral irrigators. OxyJet is by far the best. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;NOTE. Ultrasonex is a better toothbrush. It&#x27;s hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to upgrade my old original Oral B electric toothbrush to the newer higher speed versions out now....    Solicited via email by AMAZON/Oral B to spend $129 on Oral B Braun products and receive a $50 AMAZON gift credit during the month of August.( have yet to receive it 8/23 today)      I bit...    The Oral B ProfessionalCare 8900 DLX OxyJet Oral Care Center    is a combo unit that I had hoped would not only replace my old brush but also replace my old \\&quot;WATER PIK\\&quot;    NO WAY!! the brush is excellent! really an improvement over the original...but the \\&quot;OXY JET\\&quot; irrigator? is by no means a replacment for my old trusty Water Pik...which is far more powerful and gets in between my teeth and into the spots where only floss was thought to go!    The OXY JET is down right wimpy! weak...no matter which head or speed setting I choose...It just does not have the blasting power I need!    Franlkly I should fwd this to the company...it truly is poor!</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral B Prof Care 8900 for about 5 years.  The water \\&quot;switch\\&quot; is giving me some trouble so I am replacing the whole system.  I have tried waterpiks and find that they are too harsh on the gums.  The Oral B provides great cleaning action with a more gentle spray.  Despite the lower water pressure, the system cleans thoroughly and pleasurably.  The difference is like rinsing your car with a high pressure hose (waterpik) versus rinsing your car with a pressurized sprayer.</li>
            <li> Quite simply when oral care is needed this product is quite reliable. The only downside is it is not available in retail stores that I can tell, &amp; it tends to wear out after 6ish months. But up until then, it is the best quality irregator available.</li>
            <li> Difficult to install. Lack of instructions on how to install. Awfully expensive. Really mad as I couldn&#x27;t use it even after one month of buying online. I placed order at the recommendation of a friend &amp; now I have a deep buyer&#x27;s remorse. The manufacturer is not reachable.</li>
            <li> A great product with the seriousness of visiting the dentist without leaving the house.    Today its all about smarter and progress.  This product does a thorough job in cleaning and refreshing and you feel confident that you can skip a dentist appointment or two...but not completely since the dentist is the expert.    I recommend it for anyone who wants to be sure they do a good job.  You can clean your teeth, massage your gums, refresh your mouth...    Thank you Amazon for becoming a one stop shop...I found this browsing for a book....</li>
            <li> Much improved over older models. I wish now I had ordered sooner.    Does a great job on teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Wish we had a video to show the difference.  We had used an Oral B for years, but the switch went bad on the water pick and it would turn on in standby!  Messy!  I found it hard to find the brush and water pick unit together.  Did find it on Amazon, ordered it and we were amazed by how much better it worked than the old style that we were perfectly happy with!!!!  We were even able to use the brushes from the old machine!!   I suggest getting both kinds of brushes.  The thing for cleaning the tongue,neither the wife nor I have tried!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now owned three of these units.  I like the idea of combining the electric toothbrush and irrigator instruments in one, lower profile, presence on the bathroom counter.  The toothbrush is terrific.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed the irrigator&#x27;s performance...while it works.  The life expectancy of the irrigator (based on owning three) is about 2 years for a single adult using it.  With each unit, the toothbrush performed flawlessly.  At the 2 year mark, the irrigator would stop working.  There isn&#x27;t an easy way to get it fixed and, in the end, the projected cost is almost as much as replacing it.  I&#x27;m considering moving to a stand alone irrigator by a competitor.  My experience with Oral B is that they make terrific toothbrushes, but not irrigators.</li>
            <li> The Oral B is good for saving space while including the toothbrush and irrigator in one unit.  No store carried the product.  The top tends to get stuck when it is opened for insertion of the filled water tank.</li>
            <li> My friend and I both bought one of these when they first came out about 10 years ago. He felt he was ready for a replacement (mine is still going strong) and couldn&#x27;t find one in any store. We were thrilled to find it on Amazon. I bought it for him for Christmas. I think I still have another 5 years left on my old one. The battery is still strong after 10 years, and battery replacements are available. I hope they&#x27;re still available then. I just love mine.</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve purchased.  Eliminates need for 2nd appliance on the counter, and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> We got one of these in middle of September, 2007 through Amazon.  It didn&#x27;t get heavy use and sat in the same place for two years.  The water pik device started leaking last month and I called Braun/Oral-B/Procter Gamble today and spoke to an unpleasant person and then her even more unpleasant boss.  After I groused about the bad design (you can easily see why it sprang a leak) she told me it only has an expected lifetime of three years anyway, but they&#x27;d send me a new one if I sent them the receipt.  I (amazingly enough) found the email receipt and called back with the reference number she&#x27;d given me.  Oops, no reference number.  Oops, the supervisor who gave me the info is on the phone.  Oops, you can&#x27;t email it, you have to fax it.  Oops, we can&#x27;t tell you how long it&#x27;ll take to get the new one.  Oops, the warranty is out anyway because we only have a record of this call...it&#x27;s clear what Braun and Oral-B&#x27;s customer service job is.    Don&#x27;t be foolish enough to buy this...too expensive and too flimsy.</li>
            <li> I am totally convinced that this product saved me from having to go to a periodontist.  7 weeks ago I had my gums charted as they appeared to be in rough shape and after many areas around my teeth that were being charted in the double digits, I knew I was in trouble. I immediately went home and ordered this product from Amazon.  Over a 2 week period of having deep cleansing done on my gums, I started faithfully using this product every morning and night, along with dental brushes.  At my 5 week check up with a new charting process...the numbers were unbelievable lower.  I would recommend this product for anyone who has gum issues and for anyone to prevent gum loss. Teeth feel and look great.</li>
            <li> This set of toothbrush and water jet is the best I have ever seen.  It will revolutionize the industry (Waterpik should take notice).  The product is very useful and performs exactly as a tooth obsessor would want.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  (And I loved the price!) Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Works exactly like it says it does.  It is nice to find a product that does that.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use &amp; phenomenon efficiency.electric toothbrush is also a good add-on. The only complaint is that the power of the jet, which is not quite strong enough sometimes, but still acceptable.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I loved the idea of having a toothbrush/waterjet combination. When it arrived, I immediately tried the waterjet while the toothbrush was charging. The water pressure is not nearly strong enough to get between your teeth, so I never used it again as it seemed a complete waste of time. When the toothbrush finally charged up, I loved it. It really made my teeth feel dentist-office clean, so I decided to keep the machine even with the lame waterjet. Well, I have now had the Oral B 8900 for about 2 and a half months, and the battery is completely dead. It won&#x27;t re-charge no matter how long I leave it plugged in. Unfortunately, I threw the box away once I decided to keep it, so I guess I&#x27;m stuck with a lemon product. At least the toothbrush was good while it lasted!</li>
            <li> My husband and I had an older Oral Care Center that was slowly dying on us. When we purchased this item, we kept both of them in the bathroom. Since the older one still worked, I used it until it finally died after owning it for about 10 years. When I switched to the new one, I was very surprised at how much more power it had. I love the 4 quadrant warning and the speed at which the brush vibrates. It is the best way to clean your teeth!</li>
            <li> Well, after finding this item sold out in a few stores- I thought, maybe this is the the one...everyone is buying them because they are so great!&lt;br /&gt;BUT the main reason we purchased this item was for the water pik - we had an old sonic toothbrush that was worn out so the 2 in this package seemed like a great fit.&lt;br /&gt;NOT!!! the water pik did not have near enough power even set a 5 the highest level. It is way too big and kept coming on when you hit the button on the right side by accident.&lt;br /&gt;Taking this one BACK! ($120.00) Today! STILL LOOKING!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a fancy Sonicare toothbrush for about a year when my dentist told me I had gum disease.  I had to go through an unpleasant scaling procedure to do a deep gum cleaning.  Afterwards, we talked about my brushing habits.  I told him I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing wrong, since I flosh, use listerine, and use an electronic toothbrush twice a day.  He asked me if it was a sonic toothbrush.  When I said yes, he told me to get rid of it and to buy an oral-b mechanical toothbrush.  He said that sonic toothbrushes just don&#x27;t get the job done.  I was hesitant to do so, and continued using my Sonicare for another 6 months.  A week before my next checkup, I noticed some significant plaque buildup on my teeth.  I felt really frustrated as I had taken great care to brush thoroughly since my last dentist visit.    I finally decided to buy this toothbrush set.  The difference was immediate.  The general clean feeling after brushing with the oral-b brush made a huge difference.  Within a couple of days, I started noticing a lot of the plaque built up was being brushed away.  The OxyJet irrigator is nice, as well, and can extract some food particles from underneath the gumline. My dentist was very happy that I had finally switched toothbrushes.  I had one cavity, and I&#x27;m sure that my next visit will be a lot more successful.    No matter how thoroughly you brush, if you&#x27;re using the wrong tool, you could be wasting your time.  I learned this the hard way, and I&#x27;m really glad I switched.  My teeth feel cleaner than ever since I&#x27;ve switched, and I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> Bought this because my dental hygenist suggested i try this to help with my cleanings and improve my poor gum condition. I love this!! Vast improvement in my teeth and dental visits! worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> With floss it gets teeth as clean as the dentist. Like the water part and you can get 4 types of brushes for it. Wife likes the speed control on both the spray and the brush. Will see what Doc has to say.</li>
            <li> I think they are discontinuing this appliance.  Since I bought my first one, I feel it is indispensable for keeping my teeth in my head.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I am what you call a \\&quot;Snowbird\\&quot;.  Purchased one several years ago and brought it to Florida.  It still works.  Now I have this brand new one for when I&#x27;m in New York. I looked for a long time to find this product and Amazon helped me get it.</li>
            <li> Feels like I just stepped out of the dentist&#x27;s chair!  I had beginning stages of gum disease and after using it for a few weeks the bleeding stopped and no more problems.</li>
            <li> Because of being on vacation, etc.,I did not use the product for about two weeks.  I used it two times and the irrigator would not work.  The water pours from the bottom of the handle.    I will try to fix this, but if not, I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> This professional station is absolutely wonderful. The speed control on the Toothbrush is easy, just hold the button until right. The water pressure could be a bit stronger for the irrigation but it does do well, the water reservoir is easy to fill. The whole unit looks great and dosn&#x27;t take up that much room. Dental Hygiene has nevere been easier.</li>
            <li> overall we are happy with this toothbrush.  The waterpic isnt very strong, but seems to do the job.  When this needs replacement in the future I will probably go back to and Oral B tooth brush and a separate waterpic.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to use and to date has been high quality. It does a very good job at cleaning around your teeth and leaving your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Both parts of this system work great. The water jet definitely removes stuff that the brush misses, and leaves your teeth feeling just left the dentist clean.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  This is the first electronic toothbrush  I have purchased, I love it.  The two types of spray angles is a nice feature!</li>
            <li> Only buy this expensive model IF you really are going to use the waterpick otherwise get the basic model and save some cash.  Our teeth are much cleaner and even our dentist has noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product after my last visit to the dentist.  He said there were signs of gum disease and recommended a water jet type of device as well as a power toothbrush.  Well I got both in one unit.  I started using it and because of its ease of use I find that I brush and jet much more often than before.  My wife also started using it so we have two brushes and two jets.  We always remove our brush/jet and store it in the compartments inside the top.  I feel that it&#x27;s more hygienic than just leaving them mounted and exposed to the normal stuff floating around in a bathroom.  We both have noticed that the OxyJet really does a good job of getting stuff down under the gum line that is often missed.  Looking foward to our next dentist visit (not really).</li>
            <li> I prefer this product because you can get a good \\&quot;power wash\\&quot; for your teeth and gums and makes sure the brush did not miss anything.  Just washes it all away.</li>
            <li> We love this Oral-B cleaning tool for our teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this machine.  We have 2 in our house.  If you have never used a water pik you will be amazed at what is left after brushing your teeth.  Those stray bits of food that are caught are flushed out.  Of course this does not take the place of regular flossing.  Add a little mouth wash to the water container also.  Remember to rinse the water container after.  Our grandkids enjoy using it also and love that they can have their own color coded pick and brush.  This provides good dental hygiene if used properly.</li>
            <li> i wanted to like this thing--but every once-in-awhile, even a good company put&#x27;s out a POS.  toothbrush is okay, reminds me to brush in quadrants which i guess is helpful.  the irrigator / water-pik whatever it is, was weak out of the gate and got worse over time.  all in all ... this unit&#x27;s not a good value by my estimation.</li>
            <li> I just want to say DO NOT BUY THIS if you want to test how weak the water pic is. There is no doubt that brush is excellent but the water pic is really really really weak. I set to level 5 and it is even weaker the level 1 of my old one.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Sonicare that I liked, but this Oral B 9800 blows it away! This is great! The OxyJet is NOT a replacement for flossing regularly, but if you use the OxyJet with any regularity you can probably put off flossing as frequently. Simple, easy to use, easy to maintain. Excellent results. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used.  When it broke I purchased another one and couldonly find it on Amazon. It has helped me more thenany product on the market and my dentist and oral hygienis think it is the best thing for me. It&#x27;s the only thing that has helped.  Thank you great product</li>
            <li> Reviewers compare the OxyJet to the WaterPik.  There is no comparison, the OxyJet wins hands down in effectiveness!  The key is that this unit injects millions of air bubbles in the water stream.  Try this experiment.  Fill a glass of water and stick the head of the device in the water and turn it on.  You will see millions of tiny air bubbles.  The oxygen in the air bubbles attacks the plaque.  With the OxyJet I went from terrible gum problems to clean and healthy gums with no more \\&quot;pockets\\&quot;.  Nothing else changed in my brushing and flossing routine except for the use of the OxyJet.  After starting use with this unit my gums went from bad to great. The rotating head in the device also very effectively sweeps out food from between the teeth and the gums in a gentle manner and does not \\&quot;blast\\&quot; it out like the WaterPik.  Using the device in the non-rotating straight stream only mode is not anywhere near as effective as the rotating head mode.  So don&#x27;t use it in that mode! My only complaint is the rotating head will wear out in about 3 months and will not rotate anymore.  You will need to buy new heads on a periodic basis.</li>
            <li> I liked the concept of a combined unit. Both do an acceptable job. Unfortunately the hose is not very good quality and once it tears to replace it you need to ship or take to a service center. Cost to repair is almost as much as a new unit. So you are left with a toothbrush only. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used many different oral irrigators and a couple of electric toothbrushes.  I wasn&#x27;t to particular at this point. Then my boyfriend was told he had to have \\&quot;scaling and planing\\&quot; to correct his gum disease and we both freaked.  We knew that we had to improve our program. We did the research.  After reviewing and reading and asking around, we come up with the Oral B 8900.  The battery operated brush seems very much like the Sonicare unit in its effectiveness.  The selling point of this particular unit is the water jet.  It is awesome and I recommend it to anyone.  The settings of pressure are from 1 to 5...I have always maxed out oral irrigators in the past and never found much to get excited about.  With this unit I have yet to go over a 3 and may in time work up to a 4 or 5 level, but only with consultation with my hygenist.  The unit also come with a tongue cleaner that is attached to the battery unit.  Much easier to use that manual cleaners.  All in all, my boyfriend just spent over 4K and some VERY unpleasant days in periodontal agony.   I am sure this little unit will keep me out of the surgeons chair and my boyfriend wants to be sure never to end up with gum disease again.  \\&quot;an once of prevention......\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products to use for oral hygiene.  The water irrigator has silver in it to make sure that there is no bacteria in it to get into your mouth.</li>
            <li> This is the best investment I have ever made.  I can&#x27;t believe I have lived so long without this product.  My teeth were whiter within one week of use.  I highly HIGHLY recomend it.  The OxyJet is a little messy (splashes water everywhere) but the end result is worth it.  When I am traveling away from home and I have to use a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; toothbrush, I feel horrible.  I feel like my teeth are not clean.  BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> My son had orthodontic work done and we bought this because of the water jet.  We have had Braun electric toothbrushes in the past and have always been pleased.  This was no different.  The water jet cleans his teeth well enough, no complaints from the hygentist or orthodontist :)  Toothbrush works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my existing Oral B center which was very old. Although I read reviews of the water pic device being weaker than previous models, I didn&#x27;t heed the advice.     The Oral B center is nice, new and the toothbrush works great. But the water pic device has about half the output pressure of the older Oral B center. I have tested both, and can&#x27;t determine if the reduce pressure on the newer model severely effects it&#x27;s cleaning ability, as it uses \\&quot;micro bubbles\\&quot; to help with the cleaning process. Maybe Oral B came to this determination but I haven&#x27;t researched that fact. Overall, it seems to work well -- just less pressure!</li>
            <li> Oral B has been part of my daily hygene for 30 years. This product is super and I deffinately recommend it to others.  The only aspect that is troubling to me is that the water pic does not have the force that the old model had. With my old Oral B I did not need to floss but I do with the new equipment.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using electric tootbrush and irrigator, and I am 100% happy with this product. Electric toothbrush is awesome, my gums became healthier. Although some reviews say here that irrigator works weak, I am ok with it, it is strong enough for me at the level 4 or 5. You can buy toothbrush head refills also, so that you can use it with your family. I highly recommend this product if you love your teeth.</li>
            <li> Good power. Great job cleaning.  Easy to use.  Easy to store.  Excellent product, good price.</li>
            <li> I used it for a number of years.  I didn&#x27;t like the rotating brush and replaced it with the Sonic Complete brush. Luckily it has the same footprint and charges on this base. So, no need to keep 2 bases.  The water container grows black mold in the small holes on the bottom and there is no way to clean it well.  The water pressure is weak even on the highest setting 5.  Recently the hose of the irrigation system broke near the handle. The plastic became old and brittle. They should have used the material like in IV tubes. The next waterpik will be from other company.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B OxyJet is a unique oral irrigator. Most of the negative reviews that it has received have been from previous WaterPik users, who complain about the OxyJet&#x27;s low water pressure.    If you are buying the OxyJet hoping that it will have the same \\&quot;power\\&quot; (i.e. psi) as any of the WaterPiks&#x27; you will be severely disappointed.    The two different devices clean interdentally in two very different ways.     1. The WaterPik relies on high water pressure to remove food debris and bacteria from in between your teeth.  2. The OxyJet uses a much lower water pressure but with the addition of pressurised micro-air-bubbles which \\&quot;attack\\&quot; the bacteria.     Understand the difference and you can make an informed decision. Personally I prefer the OxyJet, while it is true that on the first initial use you do not get that immediate clean feeling (i.e. a sharp defined edge to each tooth when sweeping your tongue across the back of your teeth) with continuous use (and in conjunction with regular brushing) that clean feeling does come about as the micro-bubbles work on the bacteria and plaque.    Whenever I used to use my WaterPik, the cleaning felt very harsh, as if I had just visited my Oral Hygienist, this is not a bad thing, as most people associate that with clean teeth. To me it felt very unnatural and I just could not get used to it.    I prefer the action of the OxyJet as it is much gentler and yet achieves the same result and most importantly because I find it comfortable to use, I use it much more often (daily) than I did the WaterPik (weekly).    This product is great, because it combines a fantastic mechanical toothbrush with a fantastic dental irrigator in one package, which is very well built and put together with the care that Braun and Oral-B are known for. I would highly recommend this product for your overall dental cleaning needs as it addresses every aspect of tooth-care perfectly.    Finally, it would be prudent of me to note that I am not a Medical Professional, dental or otherwise and I have no affiliations to Braun, Oral-B or to [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had about a half dozen Oral B irrigation/toothbrush devices over the years and this one is the best yet.  The spray diffusion and force are powerful, while the toothbrush appears very effective.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. a friend told me about it. i finally decided to get one. i had bleeding gums. in two weeks of regular use, bleeding has stopped and i can see that my teeth is getting whiter and and my gums are great. just be careful when using the water jet side. you must turn it on with the flossing part in your mouth, or it will spray all over the place :)</li>
            <li> The toothbrush and waterpik are both excellent. I previously owned a Rotadent electric toothbrush and this brush works FAR better.    I bought this unit primarily for the OxyJet water pick, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with that. I have braces so flossing well is rather difficult and time consuming, but the water pick really helps to clean all the in between places that are hard to get to.</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun oral irrigator system. The last one held up for almost 10 years and this one seems to be pretty much the same high quality. The toothbrush is fine, nothing special, and it only comes with brushes for one person (a regular brush and one for polishing). The handle of the toothbrush has a blue light that stays on all the time (it blinks when charging). If you need a nightlite in your bathroom, that&#x27;s great, otherwise it&#x27;s just wasted energy. The really superior part is the oral irrigator. It has a very nice, smooth feel and does not irritate the gums. It requires two button pushes to activate (unlike the old design), one on the side of the unit and one on the irrigator handle. It took me a while to figure that out! The irrigator has color-coded tips for four users. All-in-all, a \\&quot;best in class\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]]  The  product (above) arrived as scheduled in good condition.  It performs as well as it is  advertised.  So far, I have not have had any problems  with the electric tootbrush and the \\&quot;Water-Pik\\&quot; portion of the unit.  I would recommend the product to others, if asked.  Don Bailey</li>
            <li> I had a braun/oral B electric toothbrush for about 8 years and wanted to upgrade.  I just love this combination of toothbrush with all its different heads and water pik.  Your mouth definitely feels clean.  My husband would never use an electric toothbrush, but after seeing my new one he wanted to try it too.  Well, I ordered another set just for him and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I had always had a cheap electric toothbrush that I paid $10.00 for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded to this system as my husband has the same toothbrush.  After 1 day of use, I could already see an amazing difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never knew what I was missing in terms of having a good toothbrush and my oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist is going to be happy!</li>
            <li> This is the third one of these i&#x27;ve had.The first one lasted 1 1/2 years and the 2nd one lasted 3 years so maybe this will last 6 years!? Each one seems to have some little improvements over the one before. The on/off button on the tooth brush part is still in a spot which, while convenient, may be too convenient and my finger sometimes bumps into it accidentally and shuts it off. So far I have not had any problem with the water part. In the previous one, I&#x27;d be in the midst of using it when a finger would bump into something and next thing I&#x27;d know I&#x27;d be getting a shower, which would cover me and most of the bathroom. However, since this is the third one I&#x27;ve gotten, I guess I like them well enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my 12 year old Braun Oral B OC-9525, Model 4714 that had served me well, but eventually its battery stopped holding a charge, and the pump began to leak.  I expected the new model, which looks very similar, to perform like its predecessor.      This is a case, I believe, of a product&#x27;s design being \\&quot;over-improved\\&quot;.  The new 8900 DLX has a more aggressive brush design, and seems to produce more vibration.  Even at its lowest speed setting, this has, I believe, been a bit too rough for my single dental implant.  I have had some pain develop at my implant a few hours after use, and have since then stopped using the brush over the implant.  This complicates my brushing procedure.      Another difference is in the design of the irrigator nozzle.  The old model had a single little jet that was easy to guide around gum-line and spaces between teeth, and it had a feature where the nozzle could be retracted in order to get a low-intensity flush.  With the new irrigator, the monojet-stream emits from a wider, low-profile tip, making it more difficult to aim, and, even though it has a wide-stream jet setting, this setting produces a more intense, shower-head type spray of water than the old model. I am a bit hesitant to use either irrigator setting around my implant as they both feel a bit too powerful.      I have always had good check-ups, with no plaque or gum problems since I have used the Oral B devices, so I do recommend the new 8900 DLX for anyone who wants to maintain good oral hygiene.  But I would caution anyone who has dental implants, to consult their dental practitioner, and take reasonable care when using the 8900 DLX.</li>
            <li> I have been using this electric toothbrush for over 5 years. It&#x27;s really reliable and good.</li>
            <li> convenient, compact cleaning machine with multi-speed choices for the brush or waterjet, different brush heads and a tongue cleaner create smooth teeth and a fresh mouth....the waterjet sends a swirling stream which reaches under the gumline or a jet to loosen the flossable particles.....no need to struggle with breaking floss or sore fingers, the actions of the brush and waterjet stimulate the gums...easy to use and a great price</li>
            <li> I use this center at least twice per day. This is the third Care Center I have purchased. It lasts about two years after normal wear and tear. It is better than a water pick. It is an outstanding value with the water OxyJet as well as the Oral B tooth  brush system and charger. I hope they keep making them. There is no other product on the market that I have found that compares to this devise. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the second same product that I&#x27;ve owned.  The first is still working, but noisey.  I am expecting this one to last 12 years also. It is quiet, smooth, and comfortable to use--with the right tooth paste, teeth whitening at the dentist is not nessecary.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product, really cleans the whole mouth.  Problem for me was that the irrigation part (they call it OxyJet) stopped working WAAY TOO SOON.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is great but the water pik doesn&#x27;t have quite enough power as I&#x27;d like.  It&#x27;s good, just not as great as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS.  Having it all in one makes it so much easier not to skip a step in oral hygiene.  I&#x27;m still amazed at how much the water jet gets stuff out from between your teeth and you are unaware of.  My gums and teeth our healthy thanks to this and it takes up so little room compared to having 2 separate appliances.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used irrigators and electric toothbrushes for a long time and like the way they add to the dental cleaning process.  This unit is pretty good with the following caveats.  Like one reviewer stated, cleaning mold is an issue.  It forms not just on external surfaces but inside the body of the irrigator handle.  I have to assume it&#x27;s also in the water tube leading to the handle.  The company should provide a cleaning solution or suggestions for a homemade cleaner.  Bleach will damage the unit; don&#x27;t use it!  Also, the irrigator heads have a pinwheel design that is supposed to improve the unit.  When it works, it&#x27;s fine, but when it doesn&#x27;t (and that&#x27;s about 90% of the time), the stream is so weak, you might as well just swish water around in your mouth.  Lose the pin wheel and design the irrigator head more like Water Pic&#x27;s so you can get a good, powerful stream to clean gum lines.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have purchased. I wore the first one out. The toothbrush is the same one that can be purchased separately and is very efficient, thorough and easy to use.  The irrigator is what makes this unique.  Unlike other irrigators that deliver a concentrated stream which can be painful to the gums, the flow from this is diffused but still quite effective at dislodging food left in the gum pockets. I was warned by my dentist over 15 years ago that I could have problems with deepening gum pockets but I have been able to maintain the depths with even some improvement with this equipment (and floss).      Hope this doesn&#x27;t come under the \\&quot;too much information\\&quot; category !</li>
            <li> Last year I wrote:  Love my new Oral B (Braun) toothbrush, looks like my old model with added bonuses.  The old one lasted over 4.5 years.  This one  has all the same stuff I loved about the old one, but is quieter and now has adjustable speed control.  Same wonderful round toothbrush that gets in all the corners so nicely!      One year later: the on/off button is fussy and does not always work.  The last set of Oral-B Precision Clean Brush heads  I bought are junk, the brush heads got really sloppy and then fell off, two were less than two weeks old and the second two only lasted a month at the most!  These are not inexpensive brushes.  Impossible to control when the bristle head is flopping around like crazy, and then they fall apart!</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever and it seems to have been discontinued. My irrigaror side stopped working and im so disappointed i cant get anymore. Im calling oral b tomorrow to see what they have to say. If anyone knows anything about this please respond to my review.</li>
            <li> Both, the rotary brush and the water pick are great; four stars. But the whole package is flimsy. The lid hinges have long since broken during normal handling while traveling. The designers need a refresher in up-to-date materials science. Worse, and these days totally inexcusable, is the fact that the power supply is limited to 110V a-c, which makes the package totally useless for the, even occasional traveler. Oral-B products are made and, presumably, designed in Germany where they have 220V a-c power just like in much of the rest of the world. One would think that those German designers would use a 110 - 220V power supply as a matter of course. With power supplies like this being basically commodities, they don&#x27;t even have the excuse of cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I love the functionality, but the broken lid hinge is bad enough. The single voltage capability of the power supply is a killer in my book.</li>
            <li> I have used various oral irrigation products for over twenty years and the Oral B OxyJet DLX 8900 is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I also purchased a Oral-B Pro-Care and really like it.  I also occasionaly remove the brush head from the handle and run the handle for about 30 minutes.  That helps \\&quot;exercise\\&quot; the battery.  Mine is going on 3 1/2 years and works great.  I do recommend running the irrigator with 1/2-1/4 cheap mouthwash and water.  That really helped my gums.  I previously used a Sonicare and my hygenist mentioned I had extra plaque.  Since changing to the Braun, my cleaning and gums look much better, according to my dentist and hygenist as well.  I thkink those with tube cracking issues must have hard water or possibly leave the unit on a countertop in the sun?  that will definitely bake the tubing to a crisp.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY TOOTHBRUSH/WATER JET COMBINATION!  I&#x27;VE HAD MANY ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES AND WATER PIKS BUT NEVER COMBINED, AND NEVER HAD ANYTHING THAT MAKES ORAL HYGIENE SO PLEASURABLE THAT I ENJOY  AND LINGER OVER THE PROCESS.  MY HYGIENIST NOTED IMPROVEMENT IN MY GUM HEALTH AFTER JUST 6 MONTHS USE!  RECEDING GUMS WERE REVERSING AND REALLY SURPRISED MY DENTIST!  SO, BEING THE CARING MOTHER THAT I AM, I ORDERED ONE FOR MY SON IN TEXAS.  NOW HIS DENTIST IS NOTING THE SAME KIND OF IMPROVEMENTS.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ORAL CARE CENTER.  ORAL-B IS THE BEST!  ALSO, THE DIFFERENT BRUSH HEADS ARE GREAT!  YOU MAY NOT PREFER THE ONE I DO, BUT I RECOMMEND TRYING ALL AND STICKING TO THE ONE YOU ENJOY THE MOST.</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun-Oral B oral care product. The first lasted 15 years. I expect this one to last as long. It makes dental care almost fun!  Check it out.     J Karr</li>
            <li> There is a 7900 in our house for years, works like a charm.  But the tiny pipe for irrigator was cracked month ago (no reason or cause to it, just crack?!).  So my wife decides to have a new one, coz it cost $40+ to replace a new pipe for that one (that&#x27;s NOT an environmental friendly way to push new sales).    All in all, 8900 is pretty much the same as 7900.  the noticeable difference are two, the brush housing and the control button.    8900&#x27;s housing looks more updated, fashionable.  Though, there is a question about how good it can prevent water gets inside.  7900, on the contrary, wears a rubber outwear covers the button, which looks more water proof to me.    8900 is designed to be able to customize to user&#x27;s preferred rotation speed.  Just press down the button and hold it, the brush will start from the highest speed and gradually lower its speed, release the button at the speed you want it.  7900 has only off, highest and low mode.</li>
            <li> They function as designed.  My only concern is the brush vibrates so darn violently, I concerned it will loosen my capped front teeth.  It happened to a friend shortly after starting to use this and cost several thousand to replace.  While not sure this machine did it, I figure no need to vibrate those teeth so violently.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using mine.</li>
            <li> I just bought one at a Corte Ingles store.</li>
