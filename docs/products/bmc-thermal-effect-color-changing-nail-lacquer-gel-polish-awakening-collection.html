            <li>Awesome Product BMC!!!!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise great!</li>
            <li>AWESOME!</li>
            <li>no smearing even using the bright colors!  </li>
            <li>I have worn all five colors since purchase and all 5 are beautiful.  </li>
            <li>You get an ombre look that looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>Colors aren&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the options of colors.  </li>
            <li>Most of the colors required 3 coats, rather than 2 coats, for best coverage.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the quick service from Bundle Monster!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering again for sure!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and changes colors wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>These polish colors are absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>It stays 2-3 weeks and the colors looks amazing on longer nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would buy again and recommend for those who like to do their own nails from home</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; almost looks neon-ish, which is a color I would normally use on my toes but for summer, looks awesome!  </li>
            <li>Plus, the bottles have a nice amount of product in them, more than if you bought a name-brand gel nail lacquer from a drug store.</li>
            <li>I get more complements from these polishes than every before.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait till more colors are released.....</li>
            <li>I love them this colors are so cute</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments when wearing this...</li>
            <li>The colors were lighter than I thought they would be needing more coats.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and easily and STAYS on for weeks!  </li>
            <li>The color of the polish is very true to what is shown.  </li>
            <li>You will need a light to set the color.</li>
            <li>Goes on better than when Bundle Monster first came out.</li>
            <li>Fun colors!  </li>
            <li>Since I do my own gel nails, this went on very smooth, didn&#x27;t really notice an odor, and was able to clean areas before final setting -</li>
            <li>A couple of the colors weren&#x27;t complimenting my skin tone, BUT I ended up layering them with some of the other colors in the set and created really beautiful jewel hues as a result.</li>
            <li>it arrived in time and are just right!</li>
            <li>Super Quick Delivery, nail polish lasts 2 weeks, and colors are very vibrant!</li>
            <li>My 5 year old daughter and 60 year old mother loved the colors of these.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors, the orange doesn&#x27;t seem to change much but the other colors are great, so far, for me the nail polish have las</li>
            <li>First, the seller(s) shipped the item right away, shipping was included (even though it wasn&#x27;t a Prime item), and it arrived in sufficient packaging.</li>
            <li>so it was really funny when people would tell her that her nails wear brighter</li>
            <li>i love this collection, i am a big fan of colors that change with temperature, its like getting 2 colors in one!!</li>
            <li>I like it so much!</li>
            <li>Are exactly what I&#x27;m expecting</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>REALLY -</li>
            <li>It also DOES change color with your temperature which is really neat to see...</li>
            <li>Too much glitter.</li>
            <li>The others are pretty much the same no matter the temperature.</li>
            <li>Love these colors and they go on smooth and thick at the same time.</li>
            <li>Goes on kind of thick, though.</li>
            <li>Dark when cold and light when warm.</li>
            <li>gel polish BMC offers (11 total) and could not be happier.</li>
            <li>the pink is a pretty, deep dark pink when cold and a see through light pink when warm.  </li>
            <li>(they thought she had a super power or something) kinda thick polish</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I actually received this a couple of days earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> Lasted quite a long time too!</li>
            <li> Red goes light pink when cold and brown goes light tan when cold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Removing the gels takes a typical amount of time, and they flake off easily enough when soaked in acetone.</li>
            <li> Also, the blue polish was dried out when I received it.  </li>

            <li> They last a LONG time, about 12-14 days on average, at which point I&#x27;m either tired of the color or my nails grew out</li>
            <li> Like I have to send a video or something of the bottle held upside down?  </li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all 5 gels and found that the colors are thick in texture, but can still be applied thinly.</li>

            <li> As long as you use a base coat, they will NOT discolor your nails.</li>
            <li> The colors are not as advertised, they are pale and ugly.</li>
            <li> My mother is blind</li>
            <li> so she didn&#x27;t know they would change colors when you get cold</li>
            <li> about 10 days, which is not to bad</li>
            <li> Disappointing!</li>

            <li> My 5 year old daughter and 60 year old mother loved the colors of these.  My mother is blind so she didn&#x27;t know they would change colors when you get cold so it was really funny when people would tell her that her nails wear brighter (they thought she had a super power or something) kinda thick polish so just play around with the coats</li>
            <li> Love it! And I&#x27;d buy it all the time.</li>
            <li> Awesome colors.  Envy of all my coworkers.  They change shades all through the day depending on my temperature and that of the room.  Dark when cold and light when warm. Sometimes I even have french tips.  Love it!  My coworker has ordered some now.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Super Quick Delivery, nail polish lasts 2 weeks, and colors are very vibrant! Packaged well also. I will be ordering again for sure!</li>
            <li> Discontinued. ..Over sold</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and changes colors wonderfully! Lasted quite a long time too!</li>
            <li> These polish colors are absolutely amazing.  I have worn all five colors since purchase and all 5 are beautiful.  The color change from cold to warm is very dramatic. I have let my nails grow and the effect is a french manicure, the tips are cold and the nail beds are warm.  I have since purchased ALL the thermal effect color change gel polish BMC offers (11 total) and could not be happier. I get more complements from these polishes than every before. For people who don&#x27;t know they change colors, they are completely confused, then I get the question....&amp;#34;are your nails changing colors???&amp;#34;  Awesome Product BMC!!!!  Can&#x27;t wait till more colors are released.....I will buy them all!!</li>
            <li> For it to be a gel polish, it wore off the same as regular polish.  Also, the blue polish was dried out when I received it.  They told me I had to provide evidence of this to be compensated.  Like I have to send a video or something of the bottle held upside down?  REALLY - I have no reason to try and beat you out of 1 bottle of polish!</li>
            <li> Colors aren&#x27;t great. Nearly impossible to get them to last the normal 2 weeks. After just a few months they&#x27;re too thick to use.</li>
            <li> I love them this colors are so cute</li>

            <li> I love it!  I received so many compliments when wearing this... I&#x27;ve not seen anything else like it! It goes on smoothly and easily and STAYS on for weeks!  It also DOES change color with your temperature which is really neat to see...the pink is a pretty, deep dark pink when cold and a see through light pink when warm.  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> it arrived in time and are just right! I like it so much!</li>

            <li> The colors were lighter than I thought they would be needing more coats. Otherwise great!</li>
            <li> The red and brown actually change colors to noticeable shades. Red goes light pink when cold and brown goes light tan when cold. The others are pretty much the same no matter the temperature. They also go on so thick that it takes forever to soak of compared to gelish.</li>

            <li> Love these colors and they go on smooth and thick at the same time.</li>
