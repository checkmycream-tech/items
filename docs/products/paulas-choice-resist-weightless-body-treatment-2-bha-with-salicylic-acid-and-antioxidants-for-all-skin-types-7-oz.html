            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>After reading all the great review, I thought I gave this a try</li>
            <li>and its really good for KP.</li>
            <li>but It stil a good bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my face with good results.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Will order again, for sure!</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon Paula&#x27;s Choice and this is by far the best product that I have found that minimizes the effects within minutes of using it.</li>
            <li>Have been trying many products</li>
            <li>:)  (posting on my hubby&#x27;s account)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Wanted to love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found better results with products like AmLactin.</li>
            <li>Smooth texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic cream.</li>
            <li>Great for dry shins on your legs.</li>
            <li>I have found it works better if you really message it into the skin at the area effected.</li>
            <li>: it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as quickly on my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>This smells like fresh cucumbers.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>I will probably get the higher strength version when this runs out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s embarrassing to me to have even one blemish on my back when wearing a strapless top or swimsuit</li>
            <li>Wow this stuff really works and lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t completely solve it, it was about 90% effective in soothing the red bumps.</li>
            <li>Big big difference in my skin&#x27;s happiness.</li>
            <li>Either way, I don&#x27;t have to use it much anymore.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, doesnt have a bad odor, easy to apply, LARGE tube.</li>
            <li>It is very effective and cleared up small acne bumps on chest and back within a week.</li>
            <li>Non irritating--wouldn&#x27;t use on face--and a decent value.</li>
            <li>I particularly like that it doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable smell.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and dry skin and very mild outbreaks, though.</li>
            <li>I am so excited that this is working, especially going into bare arm clothing season!</li>
            <li>; very useful in clearing up rough skin, including hyperkeratosis.</li>
            <li>and wow!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others and they didn&#x27;t work nearly this well.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t ever been sensitive to lotions before.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am not going to recommend it, but I have had success using this on my face (tiny, tiny amount every other day) to clear up the first signs of a outbreak.</li>
            <li>I have hyperkeratosis, and this lotion is definitely helping to clear it up!</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t clear only arms just my legs ?</li>
            <li>I have only used the product once so far</li>
            <li>However, I lathered the stuff on 2-3 times a day and used my regular (organic &amp; natural) body lotion for added moisturizer throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I have fickle oily and sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to various kinds of break outs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been fighting Keratosis Pilaris for nearly a year now, and scrubbing my arms where it flares up helped until a while ago when it came back.</li>
            <li>I have used it consistently for a few weeks and have not seen an improvement.</li>

            <li> The reason I gave this 2 stars because it doesn&#x27;t help my keratosis pilaris at all, in fact it even make it worse, and I don&#x27;t like the scent when you first put it on.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smooths my red bumps instantly.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a recurring rash.  Every time it flairs up she starts to use the lotion, and the rash starts clearing up within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> A while ago I had chronic acne all over my chest and back. It looked horrible, and nothing really helped it, so I started applying this BHA morning and night where the breakouts were. A couple months later, it had improved enough that I reduced the application to just nightly. Then to my delight, all the acne vanished, and I have since then stopped using this, and none of the acne has returned.</li>
            <li> I have hyperkeratosis, and this lotion is definitely helping to clear it up! I have used it for only three weeks and can already see the change in my skin. Since I have problems with roughness/dryness, I loofah the daylights out of my skin in the shower then put this on as soon as I get out. I&#x27;ve used other lotions in the past, most commonly Amlactin, without the same results. I think what sets this one apart is the 2%BHA and salicylic acid, two ingredients found in skin peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR; very useful in clearing up rough skin, including hyperkeratosis. Slight chemically smell that fades in around 15 minutes. Non irritating--wouldn&#x27;t use on face--and a decent value.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Smooth texture. Not sure if it solves the red problem</li>
            <li> This smells like fresh cucumbers. It&#x27;s fantastic cream. Great for dry shins on your legs.</li>
            <li> I get really bad ketosis pilaris and this is the only thing that helps. Lil bottle of miracles!</li>
            <li> ive tried it. and its really good for KP. but it didn&#x27;t clear only arms just my legs ? but It stil a good bottle</li>
            <li> I initially bought this product to test it out as a replacement for my product of 20 years that deeply moisturizes skin.  It had just become too expensive at 48.00 a tube.  Have been trying many products but none had the same moisturizing affect and I have very dry skin.  This one did the trick and is now my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; at half the price..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, doesnt have a bad odor, easy to apply, LARGE tube. I will probably get the higher strength version when this runs out. I&#x27;ve used it on my face with good results. Does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and have a hard time with exfoliation products but also suffer from keratosis pilaris.  I ordered this product to give it a shot and wow!  After 1 week of use it has helped immensely. i apply in only once a day but may start applying twice.  I am so excited that this is working, especially going into bare arm clothing season! :)  (posting on my hubby&#x27;s account)</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my kp that is on my upper arms and legs. I have used it consistently for a few weeks and have not seen an improvement.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Works great I put it on once a day for about 3 days in a row and by the 2nd day I noticed a difference. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give it 100%</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month and did not really see any difference on my upper arms.  I decided to stop using the product.  I will switch to another one.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Will order again, for sure!</li>
            <li> Works great for those annoying little bumps on the upper arm. Makes for super-smooth skin. I&#x27;ve tried others and they didn&#x27;t work nearly this well.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and i HATE shaving, especially &amp;#34;down there,&amp;#34; because I always break out horribly the next day and it continues with itching and ingrown hairs for a week. I actually bought this to replace my miracle Neutrogena stress face stuff, which of course they discontinued. Ive been using it on my face, and ended up trying it out after shaving on the areas that are usually prone to ingrown hairs. While it didn&#x27;t completely solve it, it was about 90% effective in soothing the red bumps. Not only that, but I don&#x27;t itch like ten billion fire ants crawled up my pants.... Its a miracle!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used the product once so far but i did notice it seemed to work at once. I cant wait to see the results after a couple weeks. Keeping my fingers crossed it does the trick.</li>
            <li> I applied once and broke out in a rash all over where I applied it. I haven&#x27;t ever been sensitive to lotions before.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff really works and lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> For years I have battled with bumps on my arms (clogged pores) and after using this for a week there was a noticeable difference. My arms are not perfectly smooth, but there is less to pick at. A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion for a week straight, my skin started itching really bad and I eventually broke out in welts. Wanted to love it but this was a horrible reaction. I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve encountered that actually helps with KP. After years of frustration, no more body acne! (seriously). I don&#x27;t like some products by this brand, but this one is tops! PS: it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as quickly on my boyfriend. However, I lathered the stuff on 2-3 times a day and used my regular (organic &amp; natural) body lotion for added moisturizer throughout the day. He might remember to use it a few times a week. Either way, I don&#x27;t have to use it much anymore. Only when my skin seems irritated. I am not going to recommend it, but I have had success using this on my face (tiny, tiny amount every other day) to clear up the first signs of a outbreak. I have extremely sensitive skin and dry skin and very mild outbreaks, though. Almost no zits so keep that in mind. If you are an acne sufferer this might not work for you.</li>
            <li> As advertised, this lotion is lightweight. It is very effective and cleared up small acne bumps on chest and back within a week. I particularly like that it doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable smell. I sometimes add an essential oil to it for the aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> I have fickle oily and sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to various kinds of break outs. It&#x27;s embarrassing to me to have even one blemish on my back when wearing a strapless top or swimsuit so I usually don&#x27;t and if I do I let it upset me. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 2.5 months now and I&#x27;ve been wearing strapless summer dresses for the last 1.5 months. Big big difference in my skin&#x27;s happiness. Even obnoxious old spots for years past are starting to fade over my hips! Yay!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting Keratosis Pilaris for nearly a year now, and scrubbing my arms where it flares up helped until a while ago when it came back. I bought this product and only had to use it for about 2 days when I could notice improvements: the bumps were going down and my skin was less irritated. It also helped with my excema, which occurs in the same places. Great product! Would definitely recommend this to anyone who suffers from this condition!</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money. I had no results. Its a over priced lotion and not a good one.</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris and was using cera-ve per recommendation of my dermatologist, which wasn&#x27;t working at all. I stumbled upon Paula&#x27;s Choice and this is by far the best product that I have found that minimizes the effects within minutes of using it. Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> The raving reviews of this product working in the first time use is just not true (at least for me). I have been using daily for 2 weeks and am noticing some improvement but not &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; results. I have found it works better if you really message it into the skin at the area effected.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this 2 stars because it doesn&#x27;t help my keratosis pilaris at all, in fact it even make it worse, and I don&#x27;t like the scent when you first put it on. After reading all the great review, I thought I gave this a try but I&#x27;m so disappointed after using it for almost 3 weeks. It makes my skin drier and irritated, I guess this is not for my skin.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I was optimistic about this product. Unfortunately, it made my the back of my arms feel drier/rougher. I&#x27;ve found better results with products like AmLactin.</li>
