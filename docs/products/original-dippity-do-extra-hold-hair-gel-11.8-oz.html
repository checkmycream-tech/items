            <li>I love it a lot!!</li>
            <li>But still good.</li>
            <li>how much better can you get than the greatest stand by dippity do holds great and just love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My wife has used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>Works better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>I used this product most of my adult life and loved it.  </li>
            <li>but this bottle states that this is light hold.</li>
            <li>bottle contradicts it self by saying it is light hold on the front</li>
            <li>The original ad said: Original, Extra-hold dippity do, #1.</li>
            <li>Just as good as back in the day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d happily show this to my clients and love seeing how surprised they were to see an old favorite is still available, get this product for old time&#x27;s sake it really works and will put a smile on your face, Cheri</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find this product for a while and was surprised to see it listed again.  </li>
            <li>The item received is NOT Extra hold, it is Light hold.  </li>
            <li>It was much as I remembered it except for the packaging.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight and resistant to holding curl but with Dippity-Do</li>
            <li>Extra, light, #7.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find Dippity Do, I thought they stopped making it, I find it works very well with no build up in the hair just  long lasting style, as a hair dresser with more years behind the chair than I care to admit,</li>
            <li>I remember using Dippity Do in high school and part of college.</li>
            <li>This did not turn out to be like the old stuff</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m sure this is the same product, just different color, I wanted the other.  </li>
            <li>Instead was some blue new and improved gel.</li>
            <li>One note: it works better if hair is at least slightly damp when using this product.</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find this product for a while and was surprised to see it listed again.  It&#x27;s suppose to be the \\&quot;original\\&quot; but think it is slightly different from what we use to get.  But still good.</li>
            <li> Love it. Just as good as back in the day!</li>
            <li> Said &amp;#34;Extra&amp;#34;, but it must have meant ounces or something.  In smaller print it says &amp;#34;Lite Hold&amp;#34;.  Just the opposite of what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have the same complaint as others regarding this product..  The item received is NOT Extra hold, it is Light hold.  The bottle is completely different from what is pictured.  I am very disappointed as I am certain this will not hold the curls that I want.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Product does not perform like the old formula and is too expensive for what you receive.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for many years. It is hard to obtain, except on Amazon. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife but when it arrived it was not what I ordered.  She wanted extra hold gel but this bottle states that this is light hold.This is not what we ordered.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle contradicts it self by saying it is light hold on the front but it is a flexible hold on the back of the bottle.  We ordered the greenish bottle but when it arrived it was a blue formulae.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles of the Green DIPPITY DO, as shown in the picture on their page.  What I received was the blue bottle, which can be had in any store for less than the price from this seller.  When I contacted the seller, they told me that Amazon would not let them take down the picture.  I explained to them that this was not what I ordered.  They sent me to the website for the haircare company.  Although I&#x27;m sure this is the same product, just different color, I wanted the other.  They told me I can return it and they will cover all costs, which I appreciate.  However, because of their misprint, I don&#x27;t feel I should have to take time out of my day to return this.&lt;br /&gt;I had an issue with another company sending me the wrong product and they apologized for the mistake, said throw it out or keep it, and they refunded my money.&lt;br /&gt; I would not order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I used this product most of my adult life and loved it.  Then I moved to the Rocky Mountains and was unable to find it.  Imagine my surprise when I stumbled across it on Amazon.  It was much as I remembered it except for the packaging.  Please keep your relationship with the Canadian manufacturer cause you will be getting future orders from me!</li>
            <li> Not what was promised. Was not original dippity do. Instead was some blue new and improved gel. Very disappointed and would not recommend. Also overpriced.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and resistant to holding curl but with Dippity-Do it is manageable ... I love it a lot!!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating as it was the same as it was before with the exception of the color and bottle.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find Dippity Do, I thought they stopped making it, I find it works very well with no build up in the hair just  long lasting style, as a hair dresser with more years behind the chair than I care to admit, I&#x27;d happily show this to my clients and love seeing how surprised they were to see an old favorite is still available, get this product for old time&#x27;s sake it really works and will put a smile on your face, Cheri</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought it would.  Will buy it again when my supply runs out.  Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I have used this product since the 40&#x27;s. I would recommend it to everyone. Other products have failed to give me the results I want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  one of those dinosaurs, I guess, who still use products like this, hair rollers and hair tape. I remember using Dippity Do in high school and part of college. I like that it helps hold my hair in place  while it is rolled up. One note: it works better if hair is at least slightly damp when using this product.</li>
            <li> This did not turn out to be like the old stuff but I am using it</li>
            <li> how much better can you get than the greatest stand by dippity do holds great and just love it yippy</li>
            <li> The original ad said: Original, Extra-hold dippity do, #1. It had a picture of the THAT bottle which is green.  This one just isn&#x27;t the same - AND it cost me a lot of money!  The one that came is in the blue bottle and says: Extra, light, #7.</li>
            <li> Less than what I expected</li>
