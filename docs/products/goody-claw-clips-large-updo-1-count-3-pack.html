            <li>This is, without a doubt, the best product of this type on the market, so it baffles me as to why Goody&#x27;s no longer makes them available in stores.  </li>

            <li>Okay, so here is the deal.  </li>
            <li>So I will order another set for safe keeping.  </li>
            <li>Love these clips.</li>
            <li>Plan to order more.</li>
            <li>I love having 3 colors.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m able to wear with side styling or completely on top of my head...</li>
            <li>I will order more.</li>
            <li>I love them and would buy more.</li>
            <li>Super-secure, comfortable, attractive, and reasonably priced - what more could a girl want?  </li>
            <li>These clips are the absolute best for holding up a large amount of hair.  </li>
            <li>I got my clips and I was so excited!</li>
            <li>These are great when the weather is hot and you need a quick way to cool off by getting your hair off your neck.  </li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>The side clips also work great for the bath as they don&#x27;t interfere when you put your head back to relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems a mighty spring has been matched with a plastic grade that isn&#x27;t up to the task.</li>
            <li>The fact that they&#x27;re mostly flat is great.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted and bought several clips!  </li>
            <li>The design can&#x27;t be beat though for cute and fast updo&#x27;s</li>
            <li>However I must also say that the seller lived up to his promise and was quite quick to deliver.</li>
            <li>Very nice large hair clips that do not hurt your head when you lean back.</li>
            <li>- it lays almost flat against your head, creating a much more sophisticated look, as well as reducing the annoyance factor by about 90%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very pleased with this product and I purchased numerous clips to give away as gifts</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fast, easy to use clip that holds anything.</li>
            <li>but this claw clip is fabulous how it gathers a large portion of my hair</li>
            <li>Holds hair very well and is so comfortable.</li>
            <li>received the package today and tried them on and they are nice and big and hold all of my hair and stay in place.  </li>
            <li>This fell right off within minutes</li>
            <li>I love these clips but the last batch I got broke before I could even use them.</li>
            <li>Colors were off at first to me, but they seem to go with everything.</li>
            <li>Of course these are my absolute favortie and now cannot find them in a store anywhere!</li>
            <li>These clips are large and will hold all my hair.</li>
            <li>These are large enuf to work in my hair.</li>
            <li>They hold my longer hair really well and surprise no headache at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>They really hold your hair in place.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I have five, and all broke within several months, most in exactly the same place.</li>
            <li>These are the only kind of clips that I like and for some unknown reason every couple of years they disappear from store shelves and that it.  </li>
            <li>The color is a little bit metallic which is not my favorite - hence 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>and I needed a new clip.  </li>
            <li>But even though one may only last a month, it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li>I love the tortoise and black clips but the brown is a bit dull.  </li>
            <li>your hair is especially fine or thin, I&#x27;m not sure this would work well for you, but if you have thick hair that normally can&#x27;t be contained by a clip, THIS IS FOR YOU.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I use these particular clips is because they go in sideways instead of up and down.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;The reason I use these particular clips is because they go in sideways instead of up and down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long hair that is fine/thinning and most clips do a lousy job</li>
            <li> The last one is showing multiple cracks around the spring, and isn&#x27;t long for this world.</li>
            <li> This clip holds a lot of hair neatly and fits flat against your head so that if you&#x27;re driving and you hit your head against the headrest, it doesn&#x27;t hurt like the claw-type clips.</li>
            <li> and my hair is pretty thick</li>
            <li> I was not aware they would be three different colors.  </li>
            <li> They were very hard to find at first.</li>
            <li> Never gets loose in your hair</li>
            <li> You can actually lay your head down without killing yourself.  </li>
            <li> I like them because strangely enuf they allow me to lean my head back on a plane and that is where I usually wear them because of the comfort.</li>
            <li> The profile is narrow, so your head doesn&#x27;t get any bigger because you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder to find them in stores</li>
            <li> It hurts, the clip shifts, and your &#x27;do is suddenly askew.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t normally pay anywhere near this price for them but am forced to because it&#x27;s the only game in town!</li>
            <li> all the other similar products are MED and too small.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I searched Target, Wal-Mart and other stores and could never locate these.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try and file the ends down a bit</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I do wish they were a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and only these hold.</li>
            <li> These are heavy duty and seem to be well made.  </li>
            <li> But the tips of the comb part are kinda ragged not smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexplicable why they stop making them all of the sudden for no apparent reason!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you use the claw-type clips that you find in the store, then you know how annoying it is when the back of your head touches ANYTHING - a car head-rest, the back of the couch or chair.  </li>
            <li> Why are they so hard to find at the moment?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product is so hard to get.</li>
            <li> WAY overpriced, but I am desperate to find a clip/claw that will actually hold my hair up off my neck.</li>
            <li> They hold my thick hair but don&#x27;t stick out</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t hold up my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have 3 feet long hair and was desperately looking for a hair clip before summer comes.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s seriously flawed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these clips but the last batch I got broke before I could even use them. The prongs broke off. Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Very nice large hair clips that do not hurt your head when you lean back. They hold my longer hair really well and surprise no headache at the end of the day. The color is a little bit metallic which is not my favorite - hence 4 instead of 5 stars. However I must also say that the seller lived up to his promise and was quite quick to deliver.</li>
            <li> These were just as described. I was happy with the purchase. I do wish they were a little cheaper. They were well packaged to avoid damage as well. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> And of course, they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em anymore. Now I have to go around and stockpile them, like Elaine and The Sponge.</li>
            <li> Very good and cannot find in stores. I have very thick hair and only these hold. Side clip doesn&#x27;t pull on head!</li>
            <li> This clip holds a lot of hair neatly and fits flat against your head so that if you&#x27;re driving and you hit your head against the headrest, it doesn&#x27;t hurt like the claw-type clips. I love it.</li>
            <li> Okay, so here is the deal.  I have long thick hair.  These are the only kind of clips that I like and for some unknown reason every couple of years they disappear from store shelves and that it.  They are just gone.  And then... The search is on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I use these particular clips is because they go in sideways instead of up and down.  I travel a lot for work and these clips do not get in the way of my headrest as they go in sideway.  The side clips also work great for the bath as they don&#x27;t interfere when you put your head back to relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the package today and tried them on and they are nice and big and hold all of my hair and stay in place.  So I will order another set for safe keeping.  In a year or so they will start making them again.  It&#x27;s inexplicable why they stop making them all of the sudden for no apparent reason!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally pay anywhere near this price for them but am forced to because it&#x27;s the only game in town!</li>
            <li> These are so great hair clamps. They were very hard to find at first. They really hold your hair in place.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the good things reported here. It&#x27;s a fast, easy to use clip that holds anything. The profile is narrow, so your head doesn&#x27;t get any bigger because you&#x27;re wearing it. But it&#x27;s seriously flawed. I have five, and all broke within several months, most in exactly the same place. The last one is showing multiple cracks around the spring, and isn&#x27;t long for this world. Seems a mighty spring has been matched with a plastic grade that isn&#x27;t up to the task. Why does this always happen? Perfect, attractive, well-designed and engineered solution, ruined by crummy materials. Wish Goody would recall and fix it.</li>
            <li> Back in school as a student and my hair needs to be up. The Claw clips work great. Also use it for when I need/want an up-do when I go out.</li>
            <li> The fact that they&#x27;re mostly flat is great.  You can actually lay your head down without killing yourself.  Colors were off at first to me, but they seem to go with everything.</li>
            <li> These are the best hair \\&quot;clamps\\&quot; on the planet!! Although Goody could make them a bit stronger as the teeth tend to break off, they hold hair and look great. Why are they so hard to find at the moment? Is GOODY listening to their clients?? Please bring them back in numbers!!</li>
            <li> These clips are the absolute best for holding up a large amount of hair.  It is getting harder to find them in stores so stock up so you don&#x27;t run out.  Even with exercising they stay in place.</li>
            <li> I cant find these in stores anymore!  I would have NEVER paid this price but they are the only ones that work in my hair!!! Gotta have em!!!</li>
            <li> I love the tortoise and black clips but the brown is a bit dull.  These clips are large and will hold all my hair.</li>
            <li> This is, without a doubt, the best product of this type on the market, so it baffles me as to why Goody&#x27;s no longer makes them available in stores.  I suppose I should be grateful I can still get them at all, and stock up before they disappear forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use the claw-type clips that you find in the store, then you know how annoying it is when the back of your head touches ANYTHING - a car head-rest, the back of the couch or chair.  It hurts, the clip shifts, and your &#x27;do is suddenly askew.  Not a problem with this clip - it lays almost flat against your head, creating a much more sophisticated look, as well as reducing the annoyance factor by about 90%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is especially fine or thin, I&#x27;m not sure this would work well for you, but if you have thick hair that normally can&#x27;t be contained by a clip, THIS IS FOR YOU.  Super-secure, comfortable, attractive, and reasonably priced - what more could a girl want?  Get &#x27;em before they&#x27;re gone!</li>
            <li> I was not aware they would be three different colors.  That didn&#x27;t thrill me, but they will serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> Love these clips. They hold my thick hair but don&#x27;t stick out so I can lay my head against a pillow without the clip digging into my scalp.  Plan to order more.</li>
            <li> These are large enuf to work in my hair. all the other similar products are MED and too small. I like them because strangely enuf they allow me to lean my head back on a plane and that is where I usually wear them because of the comfort. I love having 3 colors. I agree with the other reviews. Great product.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t hold up my thick hair.  I have 3 feet long hair and was desperately looking for a hair clip before summer comes.  This fell right off within minutes</li>
            <li> I used to have a couple of these hair clips and I loved them.  Over time the comb teeth broke and I needed a new clip.  I searched Target, Wal-Mart and other stores and could never locate these.  By chance I one day typed my request in to Amazon and there they were.  I was delighted and bought several clips!  These are great when the weather is hot and you need a quick way to cool off by getting your hair off your neck.  Thank you Amazon!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love these!!!</li>
            <li> Of course these are my absolute favortie and now cannot find them in a store anywhere! I think I bought 3 packs because I will warn you they break within a month. But even though one may only last a month, it&#x27;s totally worth it to have that month when I can put my hair up and it stay up and not give me a headache!!</li>
            <li> holds well, keeps my hair up and my hair is pretty thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long hair that is fine/thinning and most clips do a lousy job but this claw clip is fabulous how it gathers a large portion of my hair and i&#x27;m able to wear with side styling or completely on top of my head... i&#x27;m very pleased with this product and I purchased numerous clips to give away as gifts</li>
            <li> These are heavy duty and seem to be well made.  The \\&quot;claw\\&quot; part is HUGE!!  The problem is that the hole for your hair is tiny.  If you want to put an Alaskan King Crab size thing on your head--this is just the item.  If you want to hold your hair up off your neck---don&#x27;t get these.  WAY overpriced, but I am desperate to find a clip/claw that will actually hold my hair up off my neck.</li>
            <li> Best hair clip ever. I can&#x27;t find in strores anywhere. I don&#x27;t understand why this product is so hard to get. Goody should start selling everywhere. Great product. LOVE LOVE !!!! Holds all my layers up the best. I will order more. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I got my clips and I was so excited! But the tips of the comb part are kinda ragged not smooth so it catches in my hair. I am going to try and file the ends down a bit so hopefully they are smoother. The design can&#x27;t be beat though for cute and fast updo&#x27;s that don&#x27;t slip out like regular clips.</li>
            <li> Holds hair very well and is so comfortable. I love them and would buy more. Never gets loose in your hair</li>
