    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t quite stay put all day, but I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product by an excellent company!!!!</li>
            <li>and she wasn&#x27;t really impressed either.</li>
            <li>This pencil is great to apply to the undereye waterline...</li>
            <li>and I am happy that I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>My eyes look bright</li>
            <li>Like magic!    </li>
            <li>but I honestly don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner goes on very smooth and does brighten the whites of the eye when worn on the water line.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>, more awake.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love to use it on the waterline to enhance, &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>also, applied to the inside of the bridge of the nose, it neutralizes the bluish discoloration and brightens eyes better than any concealer.</li>
            <li>great, natural color.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good eye liner product and it works very well when applied properly to her own eyes.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this eye liner, and thank goodness it was free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good natural color.</li>
            <li>The color is perfect for my pale skin tone.</li>
            <li>Although the color is a nice bright shade the formula left MUCH to be desired.  </li>
            <li>I have blue eyes and fair skin.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me, so gave to my daughter to see if it worked better for her</li>
            <li>is that it was a twist up but other than that I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also the only product that I know of that looks amazing when applied along the inside edge of the lower lash line.</li>
            <li>Definitely not the smooth, easy gliding application that you hope for with the name \\&quot;baby eyes\\&quot; in the name.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars just because it was a pretty color and didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes...</li>
            <li>I also use a similar one by Cargo, but this one works even better and at a lower price point too.  </li>
            <li>I use this every day on my top lid like eyeliner and on my bottom lid, either just below the lashes or on the \\&quot;waterline,\\&quot; the inner rim of the eye.</li>
            <li>This does look pretty on, but I will be returning it because it causes a film on my eyes.</li>
            <li>really opens the eye up...</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers say that it irritates your eye too much</li>
            <li>However, I feel as if this would be better if you used it with more dramatic makeup.</li>
            <li>Used in the corners of your eyes, and lightly smudged, it goes a long way to making your eyes look brighter.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use dark brown or gray eyeliner on my top lid, but most days just go with this on the top, and below the eye every day without fail.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, there must be a better product out there.</li>
            <li>I wish more stores carried Paula Dorf - not sure who does now.</li>
            <li>I use mine nearly every day now!</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve noticed the inner rim of my eye is more red than pink (look at a child&#x27;s eyes and you&#x27;ll see the difference).</li>
            <li>I basically take away my natural lip line and either re-line my lips with a natural colored lip liner</li>
            <li>Having worked as a professional makeup artist at Nordstrom</li>
            <li>I was able to compare this pencil to all other brands, but it&#x27;s the only shade that truly blends around the lip area creating a more distinct lip line without also looking &#x27;artificial&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty peachy-pink and does give my eyes that wide awake look.</li>
            <li>This opens them up to look larger, and instantly makes me look awake and polished but natural.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Baby Eyes, I now look wide awake even on days when I didn&#x27;t get enough rest.</li>
            <li>It creates the effect of more vibrant eyes, especially for those whose white area is not bright due to illness, or age.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Makeup Tip: use this pencil to line just outside of the actual lip line (beyond where a colored liner would go), then blend in Before actually applying the colored liner, you will use less product that way, and will find that the colored liner will stay in place</li>
            <li> Not too fleshy pink and not too white either.</li>
            <li> The color is just right - beige or white look fake on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I can absolutely NO effect whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I wear a cat-eye liquid liner on my top lid and mascara everyday, and when I put this on I still feel like it looks a little fake!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced, but since my prior pencil lasted me 6 years, it&#x27;s hard to complain!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have blue eyes and pale skin, and my eyes are on the small side.</li>
            <li> so I can define my lips the way I want without them looking fake and then fill them in with a lip color or gloss, or just not use any colored lip liner and color my lips with lip color or gloss for a very natural look.</li>
            <li> This is subtle but \\&quot;life changing,\\&quot; as another reviewer said.</li>
            <li> I find I do have to apply it a little heavy because I have terrible allergies and</li>
            <li> A little disappointed in the eye liner.  </li>
            <li> that ran out and was sadly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick to the TARTE emphasEYES. :(</li>

            <li> I received a free sample of this eye liner, and thank goodness it was free. It did not even show up on my waterline. I have blue eyes and fair skin. Maybe that makes a difference in its lack of visibility. Don&#x27;t waste your money, there must be a better product out there.</li>
            <li> I tried it in my lower waterline, upper waterline, and lining both lids...I can absolutely NO effect whatsoever.  I gave it 2 stars just because it was a pretty color and didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes...</li>
            <li> This eyeliner goes on very smooth and does brighten the whites of the eye when worn on the water line. I find I do have to apply it a little heavy because I have terrible allergies and my eyes water a lot so it doesn&#x27;t quite stay put all day, but I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I also use a similar one by Cargo, but this one works even better and at a lower price point too.  I use it to line the lower rims of my eyes. It makes my eyes look brighter, more awake.  Also, I use it to line the outside of my lips. I basically take away my natural lip line and either re-line my lips with a natural colored lip liner so I can define my lips the way I want without them looking fake and then fill them in with a lip color or gloss, or just not use any colored lip liner and color my lips with lip color or gloss for a very natural look. Excellent product by an excellent company!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this every day on my top lid like eyeliner and on my bottom lid, either just below the lashes or on the \\&quot;waterline,\\&quot; the inner rim of the eye. I have blue eyes and pale skin, and my eyes are on the small side. This opens them up to look larger, and instantly makes me look awake and polished but natural. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve noticed the inner rim of my eye is more red than pink (look at a child&#x27;s eyes and you&#x27;ll see the difference). This erases the red and makes me look younger. Like magic!    Another plus: It&#x27;s quicker than eyeliner. I sometimes use dark brown or gray eyeliner on my top lid, but most days just go with this on the top, and below the eye every day without fail. The color is just right - beige or white look fake on my skin tone. This is subtle but \\&quot;life changing,\\&quot; as another reviewer said. I just ordered two of them! I wish more stores carried Paula Dorf - not sure who does now.</li>
            <li> Love it. My eyes look bright</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me, so gave to my daughter to see if it worked better for her and she wasn&#x27;t really impressed either.</li>
            <li> This pencil is great to apply to the undereye waterline... really opens the eye up... great, natural color.  I would buy it again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> yes! it does work! I love to use it on the waterline to enhance, &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; eyes - especially in the morning. also, applied to the inside of the bridge of the nose, it neutralizes the bluish discoloration and brightens eyes better than any concealer. definite staple.</li>
            <li> Ive&#x27; been using this item for decades and keep one at home and in my purse.  It stays put, covers flaws, brightens corner of eyes.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Baby Eyes, I now look wide awake even on days when I didn&#x27;t get enough rest. I&#x27;m a makeup junkie, who has tried hundreds of products, yet never used anything like this. The color is perfect for my pale skin tone. Used in the corners of your eyes, and lightly smudged, it goes a long way to making your eyes look brighter. I use mine nearly every day now!</li>
            <li> I bought this to highlight the waterline. It&#x27;s a pretty peachy-pink and does give my eyes that wide awake look. This does look pretty on, but I will be returning it because it causes a film on my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a very good eye liner product and it works very well when applied properly to her own eyes.</li>
            <li> bought it years ago...Paulas&#x27; baby eyes still does the trick around the eyes though I am no longer a baby.....</li>
            <li> I bought this product to compare with my TARTE emphasEYES that ran out and was sadly disappointed.  Although the color is a nice bright shade the formula left MUCH to be desired.  This liner goes on like razor blades to your waterline.  Definitely not the smooth, easy gliding application that you hope for with the name \\&quot;baby eyes\\&quot; in the name.  By the time I was finished I had blood shot, watery eyes that still didn&#x27;t have the liner on them.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to the TARTE emphasEYES. :(</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait and try this out before I reviewed it and I am happy that I made this purchase. It&#x27;s a good natural color. Not too fleshy pink and not too white either. However, I feel as if this would be better if you used it with more dramatic makeup. I wear a cat-eye liquid liner on my top lid and mascara everyday, and when I put this on I still feel like it looks a little fake! But don&#x27;t let that discourage you, I think it might be because I wear no eyeliner/mascara on the bottom so it&#x27;s very noticeable. Anyways, the hardness of the pencil is bearable. Some reviewers say that it irritates your eye too much but I honestly don&#x27;t think so. The only thing I wish was different about this is that it was a twist up but other than that I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed in the eye liner.  Pulls quite a bit on eyes.</li>
            <li> Having worked as a professional makeup artist at Nordstrom I was able to compare this pencil to all other brands, but it&#x27;s the only shade that truly blends around the lip area creating a more distinct lip line without also looking &#x27;artificial&#x27;.  I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced, but since my prior pencil lasted me 6 years, it&#x27;s hard to complain!&lt;br /&gt;Makeup Tip: use this pencil to line just outside of the actual lip line (beyond where a colored liner would go), then blend in Before actually applying the colored liner, you will use less product that way, and will find that the colored liner will stay in place better.&lt;br /&gt;This is also the only product that I know of that looks amazing when applied along the inside edge of the lower lash line.
