            <li>&lt;br /&gt;And not the best quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found this one &amp; it was perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>so that was perfect in my situation.</li>
            <li>The material isn&#x27;t fraying anywhere and the zipper is still working perfectly.</li>
            <li>Beautifully made, with sturdy protectors.</li>
            <li>&amp; I know eventually it will break but all in all it was still a great buy</li>
            <li>Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice case, holds all my plates.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good quality&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li>And plates from Bundle Monster fit perfectly inside.</li>
            <li>But good for organizing and not scratching the pueen plates</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, all in all good product.</li>
            <li>Good quality and Shipping about a  month.</li>
            <li>I have a bunch of plates from bundle monster, mash and shany and they fit perfectly in here.</li>
            <li>Daughter loved it for her nail stamping collection.</li>
            <li>Very nice, and it holds many plates.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>&amp; I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>There is room for so many too!</li>
            <li>looks nice too.  </li>
            <li>Nice case for my girlfriends plates.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice, pretty case with a sturdy construction.</li>
            <li>and I love the design.</li>
            <li>Adorable, fits so many plates.</li>
            <li>and it keeps them organized and safe from damage.</li>
            <li>Would have preferred if looked more like the picture-</li>
            <li>Cute case for holding all of your stamping plates</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s held together with three metal rivits that are nice and secure.</li>
            <li>thought it was going to be kind of cheap</li>
            <li>IS ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING OK, RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>Absolutely love my PUEEN stamp organizer.</li>
            <li>, it looks more like a mauve color; I love it.</li>
            <li>The Pueen ones are better than the Bundle Monster ones (in my opinion) because they have an opening/slot to place plates on both sides of the sheet/page.</li>
            <li>With that being said my collection of nail plates grew quickly &amp; I wanted to have a nicely organized, safe place to store them.</li>
            <li>Perfect storage for my PUEEN and other same-sized plates.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love, so far so good.  </li>
            <li>All my plates fit</li>
            <li>The plate protectors are fantastic quality.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited I have somewhere to store them.</li>
            <li>The inside is nice &amp; sturdy &amp; I love that the pages are double sided to maximize storage space.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit octagonal plates very well but is perfect for square or round ones!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t fit two of my octagon plates, but that&#x27;s ok all of my other plates fit fine.  </li>
            <li>There are actually a good number of pages, 14 to be exact front and back.</li>
            <li>does the job, kinda pretty.</li>
            <li>I will be repurchasing (probably in a different color) when I need more room.</li>
            <li>&amp; I would buy another if I need more storage in the future.</li>
            <li>While this one doesn&#x27;t have sleeves in which to slide the larger plates, you can still put them in there easily (between pages of sleeves rather than in one sleeve) and zip it up</li>
            <li>My book didn&#x27;t have the little crown on it that says &amp;#34;Pueen&amp;#34; but it honestly doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I really like it, but it has some beauty imperfections.&lt;br</li>
            <li>inner surfaces wasn&#x27;t smooth and it has bubbles .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Metal logo on the front fell off (not glued on very well)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really sturdy and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to start coming apart</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve filled one completely and it is holding up nicely so far.</li>
            <li>It is very classy looking, the lace looks like it is real.  </li>
            <li>It is just has described, very durable, you can see the plates very clearly through the clear vinyl slots, both sides.  </li>
            <li>and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>It seems like it will break in the near future because it feels flimsy &amp; gets stuck around the whole way of the case &amp; never is anything blocking the zipper.</li>
            <li>was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Although many of her other brands will not fit in the sleeves.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light pink with a black lace overlay.</li>
            <li>I used to waste so much time going through all of my plates; now I keep them all in one--this thing holds A LOT of plates!</li>
            <li>I really love this holder for my small round plates.</li>
            <li>I got this one because I have both round and large plates, and I wanted to store them in the same case.</li>

            <li> will only hold round plates, this is the only negative thing</li>
            <li> I love the way the black lace looks over the nude/pink base color.</li>
            <li> graat holder for your round plates.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint (&amp; reason for my giving 4 out of 5 stars) is that the zipper is a bit questionable.</li>
            <li> I have to tug hard sometimes to keep the zipper going</li>

            <li> All my plates fit and I love the design. It protects them from scratching like when my daughter is &amp;#34;looking&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t  have to worry she is scraping them agains each other or getting cut with the sharp metal.</li>

I love it!</li>
            <li> does the job, kinda pretty. Would have preferred if looked more like the picture- like having the metal crown in the corner (it doesnt have it in person).</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Cute case for holding all of your stamping plates</li>
            <li> LOVE! Beautifully made, with sturdy protectors. I love the way the black lace looks over the nude/pink base color. My book didn&#x27;t have the little crown on it that says &amp;#34;Pueen&amp;#34; but it honestly doesn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s held together with three metal rivits that are nice and secure. No movement from them at all. The plate protectors are fantastic quality. No flaws whatsoever. I will be repurchasing (probably in a different color) when I need more room.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice case, holds all my plates.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was going to be kind of cheap&lt;br /&gt;And not the best quality.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised. Good quality&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and keeps my small plates organized!</li>
            <li> Very nice, and it holds many plates. The fabric on the outside is a tad bit loose/wrinkly though.</li>
            <li> IS ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING OK, RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I love it!  I used to waste so much time going through all of my plates; now I keep them all in one--this thing holds A LOT of plates!</li>
            <li> graat holder for your round plates.  looks nice too.  will only hold round plates, this is the only negative thing</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, pretty case with a sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my PUEEN stamp organizer. It is so sturdy and the plastic pages aren&#x27;t flimsy at all. There are actually a good number of pages, 14 to be exact front and back. And plates from Bundle Monster fit perfectly inside. I can&#x27;t wait to fill it up. Also the silver PUEEN emblem pictured on Amazon was not actually on my case. No big deal but just part of the review.</li>
            <li> I just received this case.  It is my valentine gift from my husband, he purchase it through amazon.  It is very classy looking, the lace looks like it is real.  I couldn&#x27;t fit two of my octagon plates, but that&#x27;s ok all of my other plates fit fine.  It is just has described, very durable, you can see the plates very clearly through the clear vinyl slots, both sides.  I&#x27;m in love, so far so good.  Hope it holds up well.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice case for my girlfriends plates.  Although many of her other brands will not fit in the sleeves.  But good for organizing and not scratching the pueen plates</li>
            <li> I recently started nail stamping &amp; I love it! With that being said my collection of nail plates grew quickly &amp; I wanted to have a nicely organized, safe place to store them. I found this one &amp; it was perfect for my needs. It&#x27;s light pink with a black lace overlay. The inside is nice &amp; sturdy &amp; I love that the pages are double sided to maximize storage space. It did not have the Pueen logo on the front cover as it is pictured but I preferred not to have anything at all on it so that was perfect in my situation. The only complaint (&amp; reason for my giving 4 out of 5 stars) is that the zipper is a bit questionable. It seems like it will break in the near future because it feels flimsy &amp; gets stuck around the whole way of the case &amp; never is anything blocking the zipper. I have to tug hard sometimes to keep the zipper going &amp; I know eventually it will break but all in all it was still a great buy &amp; I would buy another if I need more storage in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like it, but it has some beauty imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;The inner surfaces wasn&#x27;t smooth and it has bubbles .&lt;br /&gt;However, all in all good product.</li>
            <li> Metal logo on the front fell off (not glued on very well)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit octagonal plates very well but is perfect for square or round ones!</li>
            <li> Good quality and Shipping about a  month. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this! I have a bunch of plates from bundle monster, mash and shany and they fit perfectly in here. There is room for so many too! I just bought another 25pc stamp plate collection and I&#x27;m excited I have somewhere to store them. I chose the pink with black lace and it&#x27;s not very pink at all, it looks more like a mauve color; I love it. It&#x27;s also really sturdy and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to start coming apart anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve had this for a while now and I added some pictures of it, I use it a lot and it still looks brand new. The material isn&#x27;t fraying anywhere and the zipper is still working perfectly. I&#x27;ll definitely get another one when I run out of space in this one.</li>
            <li> Daughter loved it for her nail stamping collection.</li>
            <li> Perfect storage for my PUEEN and other same-sized plates. What a relief to have them all in one place!</li>
            <li> I really love this holder for my small round plates. The Pueen ones are better than the Bundle Monster ones (in my opinion) because they have an opening/slot to place plates on both sides of the sheet/page. In the BM ones, you have to put them both into the same slot (just facing different directions). The binder is sturdy. I&#x27;ve filled one completely and it is holding up nicely so far.</li>
