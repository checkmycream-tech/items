            <li>Will be buying more of this product when I run out!</li>

            <li>The smell is AMAZING.</li>

            <li>I saw TONS of amazing reviews on this</li>

            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It feels really nice going on and doesnt leave the feel of tanning after.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like a berry pear or something.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the date matters when they expire honestly.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance also.  </li>
            <li>(nice and fruity) and doesn&#x27;t leave me with a greasy feel</li>
            <li>so I was really happy when this lotion was able to make my tan hold a color for more than just a couple days.</li>
            <li>Kind of sticky and stinky.  </li>
            <li>The week before buying this one I bought another kind of lotion and it poured out like water as well.</li>

            <li>Nice smell too.</li>

            <li>This is a nice bronzer.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I went tanning yesterday, and i didnt use my lotion and my legs</li>
            <li>This lotion may not smell the greatest, but it gives you great color in only one use!</li>
            <li>Nice but don&#x27;t forget to put some sunscreen on also</li>
            <li>Nice lotion for the price.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, and you can get it so much cheaper on Amazon than at the salon.</li>
            <li>and I got a nice glow.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t any better and no way does it smell as good.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Works good, however I noticed more or an &amp;#34;orange tan&amp;#34; as opposed to browning &amp; bronzing.</li>
            <li>I have my own tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>knowing just how expired would be nice .</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>It also smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I think the way it smells AFTER you tan is nice.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion has a nice bronzer that doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes after you tan</li>
            <li>and it smells nice to.</li>
            <li>I guess it depends on what kind of bed you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li>I love all of Jwowws lotions and this one is just as good as all of her others.</li>
            <li>I got a nice tan from using it, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy it again.</li>
            <li>Its a nice lotion.. works</li>
            <li>So worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>- it smells really good, goes on great, dries fairly quick, leaves my skin feeling WAY more softer and smoother than before.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and always burn first before tanning.</li>
            <li>This product gave me a beautiful golden color that I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>But I can promise you will turn a beautiful golden heathy glow.</li>
            <li>uses :) i am very pleased with the product and will repurchase</li>
            <li>This lotion feels great on the skin, delivers fast results and smells good to boot.</li>

            <li>Much better than most!</li>
            <li>Best tanning lotion by far!</li>
            <li>New favorite tanning lotion!!!</li>
            <li>works very well at the tanning salon and a very good price compared to the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I was expecting so awesome bronzing action from this lotion.</li>
            <li>This product is by far the best lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Gave me a wonderful glow that was natural and not &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It smells better than most lotions, but be sure you rub it in good and wash your hands.</li>
            <li>but cheap I would buy again, and it does smell really good</li>
            <li>Wow this stuff smells great!</li>
            <li>I have all the Jwoww lotions and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Fresh scent and works great.</li>
            <li>By far the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used yet!</li>
            <li>Wish I could like this more cuz the lotion smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky however every time I use it</li>
            <li>well worth the money, great price.</li>
            <li>I really Loved this lotion, you get a good tan with this after the first time.</li>
            <li>Worked pretty good, not as good as the Worship.</li>
            <li>They checked the lotion at the salon and it was authintic and full!!</li>
            <li>Plus, it came very quickly in the mail!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this lotion!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>Ok, first off this lotion is great on its own or if you mix it with another product.</li>
            <li>Not only is this product amazing it smells and works great too!</li>
            <li>It works great smekks good and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I like to think I am a pretty experienced tanner.</li>
            <li>It has no tingle factor, but a GREAT bronzer in it, plus it keeps your skin pretty well moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li>Great price and delivered fast!</li>
            <li>It works really well, but you have to make sure you rub it in really good!</li>
            <li>Now, the lotion in general is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>I am very light skinned</li>
            <li>The smell has a nice scent and isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>This lotion starts to give you color quickly and smells good too.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say as soon as I received it (very quick shipment 4 days)</li>
            <li>Just started using...nice scent, and good color in first three tans!</li>
            <li>Perfect thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after tanning but nothing too huge!</li>
            <li>Like I keep saying, a huge step up from the cheapo stuff!</li>
            <li>and after that one use I saw a huge difference!</li>
            <li>(but does NOT drip) makes it seem more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered to try it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will use up the bottle and probably move on to better lotions.</li>
            <li>Makes my tan last and gives me a wonderful bronze tan.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d rather not like the smell to be tan. :)</li>

            <li>It sells for $100.00 in my salon :)</li>

            <li>love love love....</li>
            <li>Much better pricing than going to the salon and buying it.</li>

            <li>This is my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>That is just my experience with it. :)</li>
            <li>I have tried TONS of lotions and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was ok with it</li>
            <li>but I believe it&#x60;s the best currently being offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The scent is ok, not my fav but its alright.</li>
            <li>However i think there are better lotions out there</li>
            <li>Love the bronzer in this lotion.</li>
            <li>I ilike Ed Hardy products much better .The</li>

            <li>Have tried all the JWOWW lotions and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion</li>
            <li>This product is more of a stainer than a bronzer.  </li>
            <li>In love with this stuff&lt;br /&gt;💛</li>
            <li>Mostly because I didn&#x27;t burn this time (my tush has a tendency to burn in the booth, even at 4-5 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Although, the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>I wasnt sure what tanning lotion to buy.</li>
            <li>Could tell a difference after laying just once, I love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with how it turned out and the smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I actually kind of enjoy smelling it :]</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t smell like burnt skin and it makes me darker than most lotions.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Better off with something else, preferably something designed for men..</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>It helps keep your skin moist and helps you to get a more even tan.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love tanning, and I realize the damage that ultraviolet rays can cause to my skin.  </li>

            <li>This tanning lotion gives me much more color faster.</li>

            <li>i have been using spellbound and this tanning lotion is so much better</li>
            <li>Love love love jwoww.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this Jwoww one and done lotion.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of the lotion, it&#x27;s like a berry/pear scent.  </li>

            <li>leaves skin moist love it</li>
            <li>Its a ok lotion.</li>

            <li>I still like snookie&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>The lotion smelled ok..</li>
            <li>I love the product Jwoww one and done.</li>
            <li>But I know a lot of people love it.</li>
            <li>how many times I shook it up.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the lotion and had no after tan scent which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>The smell is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>This product is just ok for me</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the smell!</li>
            <li>I just bought this product and I am in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite lotion, will always use this one tried switching but ended up giving it away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product, it gives a lovely tan, moisturizers the skin and smells divine</li>
            <li>so I purchased this one and am so pleased.</li>
            <li>It says there is a fruity scent to it , doesn&#x27;t really smell all that great.</li>
            <li>This lotion is just okay.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a floral smell to me.  </li>
            <li>It gives me great color, much like all of the JWOWW products.</li>
            <li>It smells ok, I&#x27;ve smelled better lotions</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li>the smell of the lotion in the bottle is not my favorite</li>
            <li>but once you put it on and get heated up in your tanning bed it smells phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought cheaper ones that work better.</li>
            <li>and I love the smoothness of it.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to give it more time?</li>
            <li>could see better results in just two uses.</li>
            <li>but since I have not used it more then 2 times had to give it a 4.</li>
            <li>and i absolutly love it</li>
            <li>love it and this is my go to lotion</li>
            <li>Love this product....</li>
            <li>Smell is ok, but I felt like I smelled like burnt skin after.</li>
            <li>I love all of her products.</li>
            <li>I love the way this lotion smells but after a couple weeks of use</li>
            <li>This honestly is my favorite tanning lotion of all</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it and probably will again.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>I felt sexy.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It really is a good tanning lotion, I&#x27;ve been going tanning for years and this really gives a nice tan glow to your skin.</li>
            <li>love JWOWW tanning lotions</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m not a Jersey Shore fan.  </li>
            <li>Smells better, works better.</li>
            <li>and of course it takes more than one session to be done</li>
            <li>And the smell is okay going intot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product!!!💋</li>
            <li>All in all I still love this lotion</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love almost all of the snooki and jwoww lotion.</li>
            <li>The smell is not my favorite</li>
            <li>but I love it otherwise..</li>
            <li>the top of the lotion was sealed.&lt;br /&gt;Lots</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have the time to go tanning too often, this is the product you need : )</li>
            <li>8)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:) :)</li>
            <li>Unlike others, I love the scent of the lotion.  </li>
            <li>Much more affordable than salon lotion.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this Bronzer.  </li>
            <li>but over all we were satisfied with the results it gives for a starter.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Bronzer works well, but there is better lotion than this one.</li>
            <li>Used better lotions.</li>
            <li>I have tried several lotions, this is my favorite !!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen more change in one tanning session with NO lotion than I did using this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wipe it off your palms and apply to your skin in a circular motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I knew I would get a better price here</li>
            <li>I like tingler more</li>
            <li>I love the out come of it</li>
            <li>Love it.....</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Its more of a tanning lotion smell...</li>
            <li>Just make sure to wipe off your hands after you apply it - the bronzer in it will stain your hands if they are not washed after applying it</li>
            <li>Love this lotion it really gets my tan going!!!!</li>
            <li>The consistency of the lotion goes on very nicely, don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot.</li>
            <li>It smells good, easy to blend and darkens quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s better lotions out there, this one isn&#x27;t exactly a miracle worker, but it&#x27;s a good lotion.</li>
            <li>Used this one first and smells great with very fast results!!</li>
            <li>This lotion smells awesome and helps you get a really nice dark even tan.</li>
            <li>One of the best with fast results and no fake bronzer look.</li>
            <li>Its decent but nothing great.</li>
            <li>First off they charge twice as much at any tanning salon so this was at great price !</li>
            <li>Quick shipping AND absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>It gives great color and is my new favorite lotion</li>
            <li>Lotion goes on very smoothly, and the smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as some of the reviewers said.</li>
            <li>All in all, I am happy with this purchase and will be looking to this seller in the future for more product!</li>
            <li>Great to be able to not pay majorly marked up Salon prices for this product!</li>
            <li>At first, I LOVED this lotion.</li>
            <li>Defiantly would recommend to anyone I have fair skin and got really tan!</li>
            <li>The lotion is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>The lotion for one, smells greaaaat and for two, it really does do a nice job with the bronzing of your skin!</li>
            <li>I looked darker after the first tan and it gives me really good color.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, smells pretty good, paraben free, great skin care benefits.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product and could tell a difference right away with one use.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have very long to get the tan she wanted and this worked perfect.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion, it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>However, after I tan, the smell is so incredibly strong and overwhelming</li>
            <li>For those of us that like something more natural this is a great kick start to a tan.</li>
            <li>matter how much I put on it rubs in so nicely like a nice lotion</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I got color the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Great product, no problems, quick to ship, Item exactly as explained in the description.</li>
            <li>It certainly does not smell good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smells great and is a decent price but for advanced tanners I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying at this at all.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells good, fresh and clean, in the bottle and when applied.</li>
            <li>this is a very good product especially if Ur starting to tan.  </li>
            <li>okay when you first put it on but after using the tanning bed it makes your skin smell like warm cheese.</li>
            <li>Works great, gives me a even natural tan.</li>
            <li>My tan looks really great and natural.</li>
            <li>Great if you&#x27;re looking for a natural and not orange looking tan.</li>
            <li>This lotion came to me in excellent condition and sooner than expected the lotion</li>
            <li>Has a smooth feeling when put on, better than lotion.</li>
            <li>but this one is light and fruity, I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>The smell is great before and after tanning, and it leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that much, but as I said it is good</li>
            <li>I just try to keep a nice golden glow</li>
            <li>I am nice and golden bronzed with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells good, just didn&#x27;t bronze as fast as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t darkened that much at all and the bottle is almost gone - smells good though</li>
            <li>and I loved it its works so fast</li>
            <li>The best bronzing/tanning lotion for a super white chick!!</li>
            <li>Great product and super fast shipping</li>
            <li>Smells great, goes on smooth and leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>but this, so far, is my favorite!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it gives me great color!</li>
            <li>Overall its good!</li>
            <li>So excited to order more.</li>
            <li>And compared to the other JWOWW lotions it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>I loved this product, it got me dark fast and had a great smell!</li>
            <li>I have medium skin and tan easily, If I burn, it turns tan within 24-48 hours.</li>
            <li>I ordered it on here and it was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The name surely does justify how great it actually works; I&#x27;ve tanned with this lotion three times</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and it&#x27;s by far the best tanning lotion I have used yet.</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t streak or make me look orange.  </li>
            <li>like really strong pear perfume.</li>
            <li>quick shipping, great product, I would recommend this product to anyone that wants a good dark tan and it smells good too.</li>
            <li>I was however pleasantly and greatly surprised!  </li>
            <li>My honest option is that at first it smelled really strong and I was like</li>
            <li>When I was first putting on the lotion it smelled amazing</li>
            <li>You can see your tan after the first use and you skin feels and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>It gets me a nice color (not orange at all) pretty quickly...and it doesn&#x27;t stink (before, during, or AFTER the tanning process).  </li>
            <li>Not the best for getting dark and not drying out your skin.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t to thrilled with the smell at first but after tanning with it I didn&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li>I really liked this lotion when I first started tanning for the season</li>
            <li>and if they do water it down, it is still the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>but this one is for sure my new favorite!</li>
            <li>Tanning lotion doesnt have a STRONG perfumey smell, very light and fresh.</li>
            <li>Smells great, you tan pretty fast with this lotion.</li>
            <li>I could have gotten it at mine for $65, but I chose to get it off Amazon instead, for less than $30. :D</li>
            <li>She assured me I would be fine using the bottle I had because the shelf life was still in tact.</li>
            <li>It is expired but seems fine.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, after buying black at the tanning salon</li>
            <li>Absolute great bronzer, and blends very well!</li>
            <li>Smell is fine, nothing overpowering.</li>
            <li>I just rubbed it in when I got into sunlight and was fine.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not 18 months you are fine.</li>
            <li>I can tell a difference after one use, its not a drastic change, but its a difference, but when I mix it with something like pauly d&#x27;s the after party, its like a super bronzing cocktail!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already super tan!</li>
            <li>I am not super fair skin but would still be considered fair skin.</li>
            <li>This product is really good lt came in so quick and works really well for me</li>
            <li>It smells very strong when you first put it on, but once soaked into your skin</li>
            <li>and I was excited about the prospect of getting a tan more quickly.</li>
            <li>What I love most is that it leaves your skin not only soft but smelling very good.  </li>
            <li>I also was already tan when using this product and noticed a huge difference in color after two times.</li>
            <li>, haven&#x27;t noticed a HUGE change in color.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic, flowery.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and smells tropical with the texture of yogurt.</li>
            <li>Smells tood and leaves skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>this is a cheap alternative vs. paying $70 in a salon.</li>
            <li>Overall I have been happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered multiple bottles from Amazon where you can get it for a great price.</li>
            <li>It smells like someone broke a bottle of cheap, spoiled wine all over me.</li>
            <li>but I know why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to any tanner, beginner or advanced.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth like lotion.</li>
            <li>nice smell and really enhances your tanning glow.</li>
            <li>This lotion seems to give me great color in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an advanced tanner</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and it really makes you a shade darker every time you use it.</li>
            <li>You will have great color after using only a couple of times.</li>
            <li>Deff worth it :)</li>
            <li>It has a tropical like scent, it&#x27;s light and not overpowering,  and goes on well.  </li>
            <li>and it actually smells great after tanning.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make you feel dried out and it makes you smell good instead of smelling like burnt skin!!</li>
            <li>Smells okay, but worth the tan.</li>
            <li>I just used it a few times and had great results!!</li>
            <li>and it leaves your skin smooth</li>
            <li>I have used lots of products and this leaves your skin feeling silky smooth, it feels like it tightens your skin</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their skin nice while tanning.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the way it feels.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works and smells amazing which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>The lotuon went on smooth and even.</li>
            <li>I used it again about 48 hours later, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>I actually went to a coffee place after tanning and got a compliment from the guy taking my order about how great I smelled.  </li>
            <li>Gave it 2 stars because it does make your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does it smells decliious but it has some really attractive ingredients</li>
            <li>the one from the tanning salon was light tan</li>
            <li>The shipping is awesome, so if anyone needs it within a few days, they are the bomb.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>for the color, maybe I am just to light skinned.</li>
            <li>Smells really good and makes my skin baby soft anfter showering, so when they said it has moisterizers in it they aren&#x27;t lying.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>The lotion is thick and doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but it gets the job done for sure.</li>
            <li>I am a fair skin redhead and it doesnt burn me and its a really natural tan.</li>
            <li>I am all golden tan and ready for summer smell is good to.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and gives a natural tan color!!!</li>
            <li>This lotion has given me the best color out of all previous products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the New Jwoww Tanning Lotion.  </li>
            <li>cute, right?</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not an overwhelming fragrance, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent and no orange tint like many other lotions.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34; but either way I love it and its very very very good for the price.</li>
            <li>I really like the color it gives me especially right</li>
            <li>Its a good lotion an my daughter really likes it but for me i need somthing hot to get tan started</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, and gives me a pretty good tan.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned with blonde hair and do not tan easily.</li>
            <li>I love love love the smell of it and the overall feeling of it on my skin.</li>
            <li>I was always so excited to go tan and put on this delectable smelling lotion, one and done.</li>
            <li>OMG I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>I am not to excited about the smell</li>
            <li>After reading all reviews of this product and going tanning and not seeing any results in darkening.. I asked the girl at the tanning salon, who is familiar with a lot of tanning product.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $24!</li>
            <li>buy this noticed first day of use how much better I tanned and the difference in my skin</li>
            <li>It always takes me a while to brown, but I defiantly noticed more color after using this product for the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting such a nice color with in just a week or two of using the product!</li>
            <li>This just came out this week and has gotten me excited about JWOWW products again.  </li>
            <li>which is what the original JWOWW did</li>
            <li>What is nice also is that with the bronzers in this one it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks between your fingers like normal bronzers do, and it&#x27;s not orange or streaky.</li>
            <li>the bronzer is great and the scent is not overwhelmingly sweet like most.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell good, but as a fair skinned lady it has done wonders (so far).</li>
            <li>Within 3 uses of this product there was a significant change in my coloring.</li>
            <li>Was ok at first.</li>
            <li>I have tried every JWOWW Bronzer on the market and I am NEVER disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li>:)  Works very well!</li>
            <li>Now, I am so excited literally my face is glowing, shiny and</li>
            <li>I was excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It lasted me 2 months worth!</li>
            <li>I have always used (past 25 yrs) that I buy in a Salon size and it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li>As an experienced tanner, this lotion seemed to make me get lighter, very strange.</li>
            <li>Because this lotion smells more \\&quot;girly\\&quot; than the 50X Black Bronzer lotion, I won&#x27;t be able to share it with my husband, but I&#x27;m okay with that!</li>
            <li>THIS is - by far - my favorite!  </li>
            <li>not too great right in the middle when I compare to others.  </li>
            <li>I feel that if I was able to go in a little longer like you can at most tanning salons, my results may have been even better!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, gives you a nice, bronze color fast that truly lasts, makes your skin so soft and smooth, and makes your tattoos really pop!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but not as good as some of the other JWOWW lotions.</li>
            <li>Man was she right!</li>
            <li>smells great but not sure if its working the best - I have gotten a lot tanner faster with other lotions.</li>
            <li>Came faster than I expected and was packaged great.</li>
            <li>Great color after my first use, only tanned for 10 minutes and saw a difference.</li>
            <li>Works well and fast two thumbs up :)</li>
            <li>Good lotion, I have only used it twice and have noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>This is good stuff overall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good lotion and definitely helps with the tanning process.</li>
            <li>Just nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Gives you a beautiful dark color...</li>
            <li>it said but it took for tje second time to see a difference.doesnt smell good after you get out</li>
            <li>Needs more bronzers but very moisturizing</li>
            <li>or I look like snooki, if that&#x27;s the goal then sweet, you&#x27;ve got it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay full price and know it works .</li>
            <li>I went straight to the tanning bed to compare theres to mine AUTHENTIC.</li>
            <li>I went through the tanning lotion results on Amazon for a good hour or two before i finally made my choices.</li>
            <li>From all the reviews that I read before purchasing this product, I was pleased with the way that it really did increase my tan.  </li>
            <li>AND ITS TRUE</li>
            <li>I love this lotion it really works.</li>
            <li>And the thick yogurt based texture feels awesome!</li>
            <li>I would never pay full price for it.</li>
            <li>I have red hair and am fairly fair skinned.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t explain enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion is true to its name</li>
            <li>I love this so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this lotion one star and that&#x27;s simply because it smells good before and after tanning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad .</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, I have never been this dark &amp; I have fair skin</li>
            <li>the after tan smell is NOT bad like some lotions, the bronzer has never ever turned me streaky or odd-colored..</li>
            <li>No bad after smell after a tanning session.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it could be as good as the JWOW Black bronzier, but it is.  </li>
            <li>If you like super fruity and sweet scents, you may not have a problem.  </li>
            <li>so I brown pretty easy in the sun.</li>
            <li>I will try her other products now after being happy with this one.</li>
            <li>I tried it anyways and the smell is great but other than that I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Even tanning in my 12 minute bed with all new bronzing lamps has not given me such a gorgeous bronze look!  </li>
            <li>This lotion smells great, and my favorite thing about it is that it really does cut down on the after tan smell.</li>
            <li>I am the whitest girl out there, but after just a week of using this in the tanning bed I am really seeing significant color!</li>
            <li>Makes me feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Ive used many different lotions and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone who loves to save a quick buck.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this lotion was how soft and smooth it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>IT QUICK SHIPPING</li>
            <li>I am now on the lookout for a better local salon with hotter beds to see just how much more this lotion can give me.</li>
            <li>Born in NY and near Nicole&#x27;s hometown (Pleasant Valley for me), I love this lotion and cannot wait to tan darker and bring my Italian side out!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite lotions, the smell is amazing but not intense.  </li>
            <li>it came in at a decent time and the price is way better than what the tan salon has it for.</li>
            <li>If you love Australian Gold products, looks for some Almost Famous.</li>
            <li>One and done definitely smells better than most of the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li>It works quickly as it says and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or a burnt skin smell which nobody likes</li>
            <li>The delivery was SUPER QUICK.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned one that got me tan so quick</li>
            <li>Works quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my daughter, she really likes this product and does recomend it especially at this great price.</li>
            <li>I really was happy with this purchase especially for the price</li>
            <li>I got tanned pretty fast with this lotion and the tan lasts! :)</li>
            <li>You can see results fairly quickly, but once you take a shower, a lot of the color washes off.</li>
            <li>I must say that I received this so quickly.</li>
            <li>If you were looking for a beautiful summer dark glow, don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li>After reading such great reviews of this lotion, I had to try it, but it  normally retails for almost $70 in my salon!</li>
            <li>;, which is pretty cheap lotion, to this.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have used for tanning &amp; by far much cheaper on amazon than I&#x27;m my local tanning salon where it was priced at $160...</li>
            <li>Literally just opened up my package with my bottle of this lotion inside and the very first thing I checked was the expiration date.</li>
            <li>My experience with this lotion has been a great one I have gotten really dark with this lotion alone.</li>
            <li>Within 3 uses I&#x27;m unbelievably tan, and it smells incredible.</li>
            <li>Now the new Jwoww 2014 is much better..</li>
            <li>AT THE FROUNT TOLD ME ABOUT HER NEW FAVORITE LOTION....</li>
            <li>Works pretty good but the smell it leaves after tanning is gross.</li>
            <li>This product is the second tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried and it does a pretty good job for me when tanning.  </li>
            <li>Overall still a pretty good tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already on my second bottle of this stuff, it lasts a pretty good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Smells great, an has gotten me super dark!</li>
            <li>No weird after tanning smell either!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very fair-skinned person and have used other Jwoww lotions but by far this lotion is the best, my absolute favorite, and has given quicker results.</li>
            <li>I just bought this lotion and used it for the first time today!</li>
            <li>this is my favorite so far of the tanning lotions i&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>You see results the first time!</li>
            <li>and I got exactly what was described!</li>
            <li>Seen results after first tan!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>Love my natural looking tan!</li>
            <li>There was immediate results, I was a darker color after the first time using it!</li>
            <li>I noticed I was getting noticeably darker after the first three days of tanning!</li>
            <li>The paint it black lotions I have found work the best so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad lotion..just not as good as her other lotions.</li>
            <li>Shipper was great to issue a prompt return but the product itself is just not worth the money!</li>
            <li>Smells great when applying but does get a little of that smelly post-tan smell</li>
            <li>I have tired many lotions and this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this amazing lotion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the purchase; since Amazon is a lot cheaper then my tanning salon.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for some looking for a nice bronze tan.</li>
            <li>if you wanted a more natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>my favorite lotions by far.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite tanning lotion</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Wanted a dark tan, which it works and smells nice as well !</li>
            <li>im already pretty dark so this product is great to me</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite tanning lotions by far.</li>
            <li>But the One and Done is my favorite so far out of those 3.  </li>
            <li>Nice big bottle,  squeeze lotion into ur hand to apply.</li>
            <li>Its well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite tanning lotions so far</li>
            <li>I like it so far. :)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite by far of all the tanning lotions I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Nice deep tan, not orange AT ALL.  </li>
            <li>Might or might not purchase same kind again.</li>
            <li>the smell is pleasant, no bad after smell, it does rub off on the clothes a little</li>
            <li>No I strongly believe the Sellers who have great ratings, who are trusted do not put anything else in it.</li>
            <li>I love this does not leaves marks makes you dark fast, it leaves nice smell not sticky, was alot cheaper then buying a salon</li>
            <li>Not too marky on your hands after, its good to wipe your hands off anyway after any lotion, but nothing extreme like orange hands or anything.</li>
            <li>but there are other brands  cheaper that are even betterr or as good.</li>
            <li>The product smells good not like the other that leave your skin smelling burnt.</li>
            <li>Because of the reviews I had really high expectations for this lotion, but honestly I&#x27;m not quite as impressed as I&#x27;d like to be.</li>
            <li>just the right amount of bronzes</li>
            <li>People are right though, it is expired.</li>
            <li>, you couldn&#x27;t tell right away</li>
            <li>My order arrived right on time</li>
            <li>The lotion was sent right away in the mail</li>
            <li>As of right now, I&#x27;m going to continue using it until its gone, but I am looking for an accelerator.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not my favorite, but it leaves you with very little ATO, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I had a pretty nice tan before I bought this, and I definitely noticed a difference with just one use!</li>
            <li>I think its a nice fruity left over smell, but it is pretty slimy after.</li>
            <li>100X tanning and Matahari Dark Sexy legs and love them both.</li>
            <li>, the smell is just ok its fruity and sweet not a basic tanning lotion smell</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have full results till more like the second use.</li>
            <li>Kind of amazed that one session or a short time used in the sun really does show a noticeably difference!</li>
            <li>Really works and will brown you right up!  </li>
            <li>It left a clean fresh scent!!</li>
            <li>I usually love Jwoww&#x27;s lotions her black bronzer is my favorite</li>
            <li>Really can tell after one tanning session so true to the name.</li>
            <li>The smell is fruity and nice, the lotion leaves my skin feeling smooth and never dried out, and after I tan, it&#x27;s obvious that I went tanning that day.</li>
            <li>My color is more complete and more lasting in between sessions.</li>
            <li>This is a good lotion, it does get you dark.</li>
            <li>The lotion was average, but for that price its a good deal.</li>
            <li>I was a good dark Color</li>
            <li>I tried it today and long story short, I loved it!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this recently and have really grown to love it!</li>
            <li>great lotion smells good last a long time get super dark with this lotion some times</li>
            <li>Smooths on nicely (although it is much thinner than the Australian Gold Fierce D-fense lotion I was using before).</li>
            <li>I will rather spend a few more dollars on a better product.</li>
            <li>its awesome, it smells alittle weird, but I can stand it so the lotion is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Not as good as her black bronzer to me.</li>
            <li>Smells good and you get dark results even after the first time using it.</li>
            <li>I had run out of jwowws black bronzer lotion which I loved.</li>
            <li>Great lotion to build a base tan, but not so great to get you that \\&quot;dark\\&quot; summer color I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I only had to tan a few times to get the perfect tone I wanted!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am very pale and it helped me get a great tan</li>
            <li>Most tanning/bronzing lotions don&#x27;t show results right after using them but this one definitely does!</li>
            <li>, I love the smell of this lotion (not strong like most tanning lotions and everyone can telltell that you just went</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced on Amazon as well.</li>
            <li>I have decently good tanning skin in itself, but I like a little help.</li>
            <li>It does take a little while to build a good tan though.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this new tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Definitely a one and done product, I tan quickly and easily</li>
            <li>it made me very dark and it smelled good too</li>
            <li>pay more for the same thing?!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that its way better than the private reserve jwow 50x bronzing lotion too.</li>
            <li>Web both love it, but one of our two bottles was getting low</li>
            <li>I have tanned just 3 times, the first two using the 50X Bronzer</li>
            <li>Love it, would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>On a side note, my husband loves and uses it too but is too embarrassed to walk in with it, haha!</li>
            <li>I had better lotion in the past that I used, but this one just smelled much better.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Tonight was my first time using it, I can already tell I&#x27;m darker</li>
            <li>im getting pretty tan</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying the lotion.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t make you turn funny shades</li>
            <li>I use this in my tanning bed, and I saw a difference the first time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks JWOWW and Amazon!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It does it exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>first time I used it</li>
            <li>, i thought id see color after first time using like</li>
            <li>I was never skeptical about buying items online, but now I am.</li>
            <li>helps me tan so much faster!</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>:) I will buy again especially at this price!</li>
            <li>I have gotten the same results or better with cheaper brands</li>
            <li>When I first got my lotion</li>
            <li>the only reason I went with one and done is because of the moisturizing factor which I LOVE..</li>
            <li>Smells MUCH better than her White Wedding.</li>
            <li>First of all; the date on this bottle in Fall 2012.</li>
            <li>This stuff got me tan really fast!</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>And Amazon is MUCH cheaper than the salon prices!</li>
            <li>I finally got the chance to use this today and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Definitely will order it again when I finish the first bottle. :)</li>
            <li>Jwoww one and done is exactly that, &amp;#34;ONE and DONE!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty tan as it is.</li>
            <li>A must buy for avid indoor tanners.  </li>
            <li>exactly where I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, definitely grab this product :)</li>
            <li>This was my first jwoww tanning lotion...</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>consistency is almost runny,not very moisturizing at all!</li>
            <li>Soo fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Over all I love this lotion and would definitely purchase again!!!</li>
            <li>The color it gives me is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>Thank you soooo much!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li>Noticeable difference after first time.</li>
            <li>This is the first JWOWW lotion I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference the first time i tanned.</li>
            <li>It said 1/7/2014 which at first was discouraging, but decided to go ask my local Planet Beach just to be sure.</li>
            <li>but more likely around when the lot of that lotion had been made.</li>
            <li>today was my first day using this product.</li>
            <li>I immediately saw results after my first session.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>this product does exactly what they said.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would tan me pretty fast and this lotion did NOT!</li>
            <li>I noticed color within the first couple visits.</li>
            <li>and I can tell I&#x27;m 2shades darker after the first time I used it  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>This is the first yr  </li>
            <li>I love the JWoww line and will go back to her products again and again!</li>
            <li>Today was the first day i tried this lotion</li>
            <li>Especially after the tanning bed, most lotions leave a burnt skin smell</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my tan the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>Ive used many different lotions</li>
            <li>It does not give you an instant color like more bronzers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Today was the first time I used this product while tanning in a tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>It worked pretty well</li>
            <li>After using this product within the first week, there were notices.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews it was the first bottle I purchased when I started using tanning beds.  </li>
            <li>After my first session with this I was literally 4 shades darker, I also was in a bronzing bed</li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>for the delivery it came before the expected date in a nice protected cushioned package and</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I put a lot on because it was so runny</li>
            <li>This was my first time tanning and my first tan ever</li>
            <li>As a Tanning Salon owner for 10 years I thought a review from someone who has not only sold many different lotions but has also tried many might be helpful.  </li>
            <li>If you purchase the one that is fulfilled by Amazon, it is definitely NOT fake.</li>
            <li>My daughter &amp; I use it and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion because it instantly makes me look darker without turning me orange.</li>
            <li>And was very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>Private Reserve by Jwoww is much better.</li>
            <li>I noticed my tan the first time.</li>
            <li>but it definitely gives a nice golden natural tan</li>
            <li>It does work but didn&#x27;t start seeing color change for a few weeks it does smell good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is just a smidge runnier than Glam Slam, but it went only easily and quickly absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>It gives a more natural color and maintains my tan better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>Other then that its amazing</li>
            <li>Overall a good lotion, I&#x27;m not disappointed by any means, I just prefer the other bronzers.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best lotion for instant bronzing action.</li>
            <li>and I could actually see a significant improvement!</li>
            <li>As a plain lotion I am sure it is fine</li>
            <li>But, due to a quickly upcoming event and my need to tan for a summer dress I plan to wear to the event, I decided to give this Jwoww tanning product a try since it had so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing tanning lotion if you wish to get dark fast!</li>
            <li>The Solid Black does the job way better for those who want a nice brown tan.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a nice lotion (I like Solid Black by Millennium better.)</li>
            <li>Our salon has a lot of expensive lotions, and this one is one of the more fair priced--</li>
            <li>By far my favorite tanning lotion so far.</li>
            <li>and i got a beautiful dark tan after only a couple of tanning sessions.</li>
            <li>Not nearly as bad as the JWOWW wedding white, but not as good as some other products out there.</li>
            <li>It is not slimy or uses too much bronzer where it turns your fingers colors, it has just the right amount to really enhance your tan.</li>
            <li>however I do want to try a few other brands as well just to see what works best for me</li>
            <li>;) I highly recommend the JWoww line of tanning lotions!</li>
            <li>I am very suspicious that it isn&#x27;t the exact formula I paid for.</li>
            <li>After tan smell is pretty much non-exitent with this lotion.</li>
            <li>First off, I am very please with Sunless Deals.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it works as a good bronzer.</li>
            <li>The scent is good and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It smells good and it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I have purchased JWoww tanning products in the past and loved them</li>
            <li>and i got a nice bronze and dark tan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just being honest, not putting the product down.</li>
            <li>I do tan easily but have never found a lotion that works this well after only 2 uses.</li>
            <li>I am white as casper and do not tan easily by any means.</li>
            <li>It absorbs rather quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Glam Slam and although it has been working very well on the majority of my body, my legs weren&#x27;t getting as dark as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>but a few hours later the tan came out beautifully.</li>
            <li>skin was so much softer after using it, I highly recommend this product, definitely getting this again! :)</li>
            <li>but i certainly have gotten color in  3</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to any one and im pretty pale when I started never made me orange and has nice smell.</li>
            <li>This is weak and doesn&#x27;t smell great.  </li>
            <li>It gives me such a deep tan, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>used it one time on a cloudy day for one and half hours it is the best stuff ive ever used considering im redheaded and extremly pale</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing especially being nearly half off the original price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale and pasty and burn super easy.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after one use and a HUGE difference after about the third use.</li>
            <li>and Done did not seem to get me much darker yet.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Not so much..</li>
            <li>I feel like it is the real deal</li>
            <li>and I am very noticeably tanner just after one use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and you really do see results after one use</li>
            <li>Got the product on time and it is working very well.</li>
            <li>The one thing I wasn&#x27;t really a fan about was the smell.</li>
            <li>I think this tanning lotion really works well.</li>
            <li>Really runny.</li>
            <li>It really holds my tan in I</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>It pained me buying anything from the Jersey Shore people, but this tanning lotion really works.  </li>
            <li>but this isn&#x27;t really \\&quot;typical.\\</li>
            <li>This product worked very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>I feel cooler when I go under the lamp and don&#x27;t sweat as much.  </li>
            <li>Also its so much cheaper on Amazon than at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>It smells very tropical.</li>
            <li>This came sealed in a bag, I have no doubt it is the real thing.</li>
            <li>I also have olive skin tone, and tend to tan fast.</li>
            <li>If you buy here, you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than the salons will sell it for.</li>
            <li>Nothing to really compare it to yet.</li>
            <li>I thought it would get me much darker, but it did not at all make me any darker.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to indoor tanners!</li>
            <li>She was tan an ready for summer when summer came.  </li>
            <li>This lotion absolutely does NOT meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to go tanning as much.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Seriously it really does work.</li>
            <li>Also, it really beats the prices at tanning salons.</li>
            <li>It smells really</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell you how it works in a tanning bed</li>
            <li>This product works very well..  </li>
            <li>, YOU KNOW GETTING READY FOR SWIMMING SEASON.</li>
            <li>I tan very well, but</li>
            <li>HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest it!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>The date on the bottom of the bottle is not so much an expiration date</li>
            <li>Seeing as its named one &amp; done, you&#x27;d think it would work fast.</li>
            <li>Really upset that my product is expired.</li>
            <li>It was very runny no matter</li>
            <li>I am very pale.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It didnt do much for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li>Came fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really moisturized my skin.</li>
            <li>This one really works in one tan</li>
            <li>you can see a real difference.  </li>
            <li>Four stars because I don&#x27;t really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and it really helps boost your tan.</li>
            <li>no matter how fast you wash them off after applying.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;after tan slime&amp;#34; is minimal. :)</li>
            <li>have been very...</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t put it on your face, it made my skin breakout and too much color.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>not so much.</li>
            <li>he bed, but coming out of the bed not so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion...</li>
            <li>Ive gotten really dark.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really like pairs</li>
            <li>my scars are fading so fast</li>
            <li>, I got the real deal.</li>
            <li>so i got a knock off bottle that some one tampered with im very pissed</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it as much as silicone lotions.  </li>
            <li>Unlike silicone lotions, it doesn&#x27;t spread over my skin very well</li>
            <li>It is very fruity.</li>
            <li>Like the smell of it and works really well.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t really care for the after smell.</li>
            <li>I really put wayyy too much on thank the streaks</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to have much of an effect.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>For only using it two times I really love the color I got so far.</li>
            <li>Delivers a nice color without leaving a harsh after tanning smell.</li>
            <li>Gets you to a nice tan overall, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>And I love that it keeps my skin moisturized and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of different tanning lotion but by far this is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>And Done has a pleasant none tropical scent which to me smells like a subtle perfume.  </li>
            <li>AND THIS MAKES MY SKIN FEEL BABY SOFT!!!</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>Other lotions smell good in the bottle but soon after tanning you smell like a dirty sock, this stuff makes you smell really yummy :) I highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li>Smells good and it seemed to get me darker than I usually get!  </li>
            <li>I have previously used Designer Skin&#x27;s BLACK Tanning Lotion and found it to be much more effective.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my two cents on what most of the other reviews mention:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>read other reviews to make sure this wasn&#x27;t a knock-off, and think I got one.</li>
            <li>Wish it smelt better like the other JWOWW items.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion works better than any other I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like it have had much better tanning results from other lotions</li>
            <li>Just didnt seem to do much more than the other one I used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not EXTREMELY noticeable the first time you use it, but I burned pretty well.</li>
            <li>Other people might in fact love it.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Product is not the same as original.</li>
            <li>&quot; smell that it has, other then that i love it.</li>
            <li>would recommend this to other tanners out there :)</li>
            <li>I have used other Jwoww products and have been pleased with them as well.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Might be okay for new tanners, but beware as it will turn you orange if you use it daily, and it gives you a golden tan instead of a deep tan.</li>
            <li>It got me dark so quick!!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m super confused as to why there are recent reviews saying it&#x27;s so great.</li>
            <li>; I was SUPER skeptical at first because the strong fragrance and light color of the lotion and not sold sealed.</li>
            <li>You have to rub in the product to get the full effect or other wise it will leave your tan uneven.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend showering right after you tan!</li>
            <li>I only had a month an half to get a good tan before my trip to jamaica.</li>
            <li>does leave a little stain between fingers after applying BUT does wash off easily!</li>
            <li>Goes on nice, smells good, and my sensitive skin has never had a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li>Out of all my lotions, this one is the only bottle mostly full.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin pretty soft though.</li>
            <li>so normally it doesn&#x27;t take much to impress me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used JWoww lotion in the past and I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using Glam Slam for the rest of my body because I don&#x27;t want to be too dark up top, but I do like my legs darker</li>
            <li>I definitely love the smell of this bronzer way better than the Jwoww Black Bronzer Dark Tanning Lotion.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion, it arrives fast and in new packaging so you don&#x27;t have to wonder if it has been watered down.</li>
            <li>I plan on trying a few other lotions to see which one works best, so there is a possibility I might come back to this.</li>
            <li>well im very disapointed in this new jwoww!i</li>
            <li>I go tanning for two to three months out of the year for the past 5 years and have never seen such amazing results before!</li>
            <li>I was able to get it through Amazon for half the price that it would have cost me at my tanning salon.  </li>
            <li>Black Koi is my favorite</li>
            <li>I love the Jwoww brands of lotions black, gold and this one and done.  </li>
            <li>Will use this lotion as I have previously used and love JWoww&#x27;s tanning products.</li>
            <li>but i love the black bronzers in this</li>
            <li>* about the bronzer staining your hands: I take makeup wipes into the tanning room to wipe my makeup off before tanning &amp; use a makeup wipe to wipe my hands off &amp; then one of the dispensable paper towels my salon provides to QUICKLY wipe my hands of any excess bronzer (my salon has only 3 minutes before the bed</li>
            <li>Decent I guess.</li>
            <li>I had been using another product for a couple of months and wasn&#x27;t getting any decent results.  </li>
            <li>the main things I look for in a lotion is smell, bronzers, and after tan smell.</li>
            <li>I did get a decent tan with it though.</li>
            <li>and I mainly purchase lotion containing bronzer.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the $30 price especially if you&#x27;re willing to spend a little more than what you usually spend for a better product with quick results &amp;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all her products</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>And I am highly dissatisfied with the &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;lack of color&amp;#34; this lotion brought me.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it, as well as any of the JWOWW lotions.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Smells old!!</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like the bronzing effect - its not long enough lasting and it can be kind of streaky.</li>
            <li>It has good bronzers and is very thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The small amount of color I get doesn&#x27;t last; my ran fades very quickly even though I tan easily.</li>
            <li>(A little goes a long way) and it smells so good even after tanning.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try another tanning lotion, since I got sick of the smell on the one I knew worked great</li>
            <li>it smeels a bit wierd but get you very dark :)</li>
            <li>this lotion does not have any bad sents it works perfectly</li>
            <li>It is not thick and greasy.</li>
            <li>This one smells and feels like normal lotion.</li>
            <li>I love JWoWW tanning products and I have used quite a few of them</li>
            <li>If you want a great dark tan that last a long time I would recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>which normally takes it 1-2weeks.</li>
            <li>Not runny, pretty thick which i love...</li>
            <li>My skin feels nourished afterwards and after a few hours you are able to tell a difference.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, I feel it was worth the price</li>
            <li>Wish I would have purchased it sooner to use it a few more times befor my vacation.  </li>
            <li>I noticed after a few uses my tan looked more saturated and deeper in color.</li>
            <li>I got this because of all of the good reviews, but I was not happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li>bronzer seemed a little weak, but its still a great lotion!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just saying that my daughter is allergic to both Jwoww tanning lotions she ordered and is perfectly fine using other products.</li>
            <li>Although, I didn&#x27;t really notice a huge difference as some people claimed they did, I did notice I looked slightly darker after a couple hours but keep in mind</li>
            <li>/&gt;I usually tan pretty easily</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if all tanning lotions smell super sweet and fruity,</li>
            <li>This worked right away, after a couple tans I was asked if I had just come back from vacation!</li>
            <li>it is much more tame.</li>
            <li>I am unsure what to think and will not really have a true opinion until I use this a few more times but has anyone else heard of these type of things happening?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to tanning</li>
            <li>After just 3 uses it took my tan to a new level.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to tanning</li>
            <li>Lotion is okay, but i feel its not very effective for me.</li>
            <li>It always seems to be the genuine product and this works great to give me a base bronze.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this lotion for paler tanners (especially ones that tan easily) because it gives you natural looking bronze tones.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this stuff is fantastic and will be purchasing a big bottle.  </li>
            <li>It smells decent it leaves you soft.</li>
            <li>burnt&#x27; and this is like a nice subtle perfume.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re needing a tan fast of wanting a base tan, this is a great lotion for that!</li>
            <li>I thought the smell was a little odd at first, but I have gotten used to it and love it!</li>
            <li>I like the smell and it leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the first time I used it and it won&#x27;t be the last</li>
            <li>At salons it sells for $70 or higher; It&#x27;s definitely a steal on here.</li>
            <li>and I can tell a pretty big change in my level of darkness.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the wedding white bronzer, but this just seems to have a better fragrance and post tanning scent.</li>
            <li>Better used mixed with any other lotion.  </li>
            <li>First tanning lotion I used and definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li>After only 3 uses I am SO much darker!</li>
            <li>WAAAAY cheaper here than at the salon and EXACTLY the same product!</li>
            <li>It has an ok smell, not exactly my favorite fragrance, but tolerable.  </li>
            <li>Well, all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>this is exactly what you need to buy, finally after 20 years a product that works</li>
            <li>the first and last jwoww product I will ever use.</li>
            <li>disappointed because it claimed to be the best.</li>
            <li>but like an old pear!</li>
            <li>I tried this when it first came out last fall at my tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Helps my skin get a natural sun tan look vs a burnt look!</li>
            <li>We checked the color, smell, and texture of my lotion compared to their bottles of JWoww One and Done on the shelves and they were exactly the same.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t does smell a bit different than the first one I bought at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I like the smell, it is different, but love the bronzer in it!  </li>
            <li>Also, even though I put too much on my first time, I recieved ZERO streaks which is totally rad</li>
            <li>so I have to use more than usual.  </li>
            <li>The backs of my hands finally have some real color!  </li>
            <li>I usually go for the top 2 at the salon.</li>
            <li>Used for the first time today, and I could see almost instant results by the time I got home!</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if most of the expired claims are tanning salon owners looking to make a profit, as usual.</li>
            <li>For dramatic results you will need to use more, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>The smell is not my favorite because I like the coconut smelling lotions and this one is like a very strong floral perfume but you don&#x27;t smell bad after tanning.  </li>
            <li>If you typically have used the cheaper tanning lotions than this is A HUGE step up.</li>
            <li>Now, I am extremely dark and this lotion also makes my skin really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The little symbol on the back that shows how long this lotion is good for shows 18 months.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the positive reviews and I totally agree with them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale and need something powerful to give me a tan</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde with a very red/fair skin tone normally.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overly pleasant, but I am not impressed with any tanning lotion smells this far.</li>
            <li>and it makes your skin silky smooth while making you dark, quickk!</li>
            <li>I recommend this lotion to anyone who wants a rich dark brown tan and it being a bronzer lotion getting into a actual bronzing bed</li>
            <li>It has a tendency to leave you a little orangey rather bronzed looking and most definitely stains the heck out of your hands</li>
            <li>The smell, however, is a little different than most lotions I&#x27;ve used....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to find such a nice bronzer that doesn&#x27;t give me the skin sensitivities.</li>
            <li>The lotion came sealed in clear packaging and I also checked the expiration date.</li>
            <li>You can clearly see it is a bronzer.</li>
            <li>Gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m sure it gives great color but didn&#x27;t even want to use it cause it smelled so bad!!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to achieve a level of darkness that they don&#x27;t have the ability to achieve naturally.</li>
            <li>definitely the real thing</li>
            <li>but I feel like it shouldnt completely wash off.</li>
            <li>Helped me establish a natural tan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft coconut/fruity smell, but not an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that this is meant to get you tan fast</li>
            <li>Everyone always like wow</li>
            <li>Maybe it was old.</li>
            <li>I returned to buying on the shelf drug store brands that really work and instantly at 1/2 the cost.</li>
            <li>It also doesnt seem to bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My 23 year old daughter wanted me to order this on Amazon, cheaper than buying in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I have gotten a deep tan that has help very well.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>And it leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I tan frequently, like, 3 times a week, and I have been for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li>I seem to be liking it so far</li>
            <li>it is too early to tell for any color yet</li>
            <li>My bottle does not have an expiration date marked on it.</li>
            <li>I work for a tanning salon, and this lotion is by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Last year I used Ed Hardy tanning lotion with bronzers and I had to use it for almost a month to really even see any color results.</li>
            <li>but actually seeing color not so much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate it, but reduced it by about 75-80% compared to others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased lotions at the salon, which I was told would completely eliminate the after tan smell.</li>
            <li>n does make ur skin soft</li>
            <li>The only problem i have with this lotion is the very over powering \\&quot;perfume\\</li>
            <li>and I have seen somewhat of a difference so far.</li>
            <li>Makes you skin soft, but as far as making me tan?</li>
            <li>skinned naturally  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money buying this lotion.</li>
            <li>my skin is completely even.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than buying in stores, however was near expiration date.</li>
            <li>and I could see my skin getting much darker after only 3 uses.  </li>
            <li>After 3 weeks in a bed ( and I even used it on the beach in the natural sun)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tanned with it probably 10 times recently and haven&#x27;t seen much color.</li>
            <li>It does make me really soft and the smell is citrus-y</li>
            <li>Just enough bronzer to notice but not too much to leave streaks.  </li>
            <li>It has been nearly 9 hours since I tanned</li>
            <li>far as moisturizing goes, that&#x27;s where I found this lotion to be lacking.</li>
            <li>far as the expired bottles go.</li>
            <li>I also got a nice dark tan an its long lasting too!!! 😀</li>
            <li>plus, it&#x27;s not quite as thick as most</li>
            <li>and I get super dark with this lotion.</li>
            <li>I was instantly super dark and it never made me break out or got me itchy.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how dark I got so quickly.</li>
            <li>To be honest I was not expecting to see a dramatic change in the level of my tan.  </li>
            <li>I only use it on my legs and stomach (my hardest places to tan) and there is a significant difference from there and my other areas like arms.</li>
            <li>I literally can only use this particular lotion once a week</li>
            <li>I brought mine to the salon and compared the smell and color to see if they were the same and they exactly the same!</li>
            <li>But definitely not this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think it is an older version but have tried others and go back to this.  </li>
            <li>Just started back up tanning and this is the first lotion I used, three days later</li>
            <li>The next day i noticed my legs had a color to them and not pale like they were getting!!</li>
            <li>I go about two to three times a week until I hit the optimum shade then slow it down to once a week.</li>
            <li>I used this on a Fusion bed (high and low pressure combined).</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, and the seller shipped it in less time than I expected.</li>
            <li>I have a beautiful naturally dark tan in only a few tanning sessions!!!</li>
            <li>The scent is not overwhelming, like a light pear scent.</li>
            <li>The one minor thing to know is that if you put too much on,  it can become streaky.</li>
            <li>I am a very white person, and I went into my normal tanning bed in town</li>
            <li>and last, but not least, 3.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for a great quality, less expensive option.</li>
            <li>I think the color wears off pretty quickly, but it&#x27;s a good lotion to start your base tan!</li>
            <li>My husband and I both have used the original JWoww tanning lotion and do currently use the JWoww 50X Black Bronzer.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to new tanners as well as people looking to boost a tan.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how you get so many people confirming that they got the real deal and then 1 out of 100 says it is fake</li>
            <li>I am impatient and I like to see results quickly--</li>
            <li>when you take a shower afterward&#x27;s your money goes right down the drain ...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I would buy it again as I usually never purchase the same lotion twice.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after having gone through two bottle of the Jwoww Black Bronzer Dark Tanning Lotion, which I also love.</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep an ear open for new products!</li>
            <li>The initial smell is decent, it smells like fruit mixed with beer..?</li>
            <li>expired 1/14 not sure if this is really new or mixed with other things and sold again because this should have worked better than it has.</li>
            <li>It Does smell amazing tho and it beats the expensive price from tanning salons.</li>
            <li>I got shingles last year and have been struggling to clear up blotches and scars.</li>
            <li>I have only used the lotion two times so far</li>
            <li>Can barely tell I&#x27;ve been tanning after using for a month.</li>
            <li>The bronzer was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once so far and can already tell a difference in my tan.</li>
            <li>I just started tanning, and have only used it 3 times, so far.</li>
            <li>I tan 3-4 days/week and was fairly dark when I tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>achieve a deep dark golden tan fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What would normally take me several tanning bed visits, only took me two to get noticeably tanner.</li>
            <li>Everything usually makes me orange because I have fair skin, and this amped up my color to what would usually take several weeks to get.</li>
            <li>Not horrible but not great either.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, it smelled nice, but I was not impressed at all.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!!</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not really into heavily perfumed lotions, and this one is no exception, although it wasn&#x27;t any more heavily perfumed than 9 out of 10 other tanning lotions, and at least the smell was pleasant.</li>
            <li>I never wash my hands right after applying bronzeror even a few hours after (sometimes), just use those wipes &amp; a papertowel &amp; have never had stains.</li>
            <li>I have used it a couple times, and the first time I tanned for four minutes and literally already has slight color on me afterwards.</li>
            <li>Also, as other reviewers have said, buying this lotion of amazon will save you A LOT of money, tanning salons make a lot of profit on tanning lotion sales and usually triple their wholesale price (aka this is a WAY better deal).</li>
            <li>so I am going to use it every other time I tan until I can decide if it really does have an orange tint.</li>
            <li>I do have to say I don&#x27;t see much of a difference between this and the other one.</li>
            <li>For the price had hoped for more dramatic results.</li>
            <li>No dry skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I did have a little higher expectations with this one.</li>
            <li>I have started getting pretty dark in just a week!</li>
            <li>Product great... disappointed about scent.</li>
            <li>Got me dark fast..</li>
            <li>My whole body is really dark....</li>
            <li>Works really fast dark tan</li>
            <li>I would recommend this tanning lotion to anyone that wants dark, even color.</li>
            <li>all i recommend this lotion to anyone who wants to be dark.</li>
            <li>Left me much darker after one use then other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>Not too sure why some are saying its fake or expired, was the complete opposite for me.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, you can really see the difference in color!</li>
            <li>I think maybe 3 times and had a beautiful base tan started.</li>
            <li>I am a pretty pale person, and started tanning for my senior pictures.</li>
            <li>JWOW Black works so much btter</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel flaky or itchy or dry after but it definitely did not feel moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Usually tanning lotions with bronzers smell horrible after a tanning session, but I am able to get the bronzing and smell great at the same time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to more heavily perfumed lotions and the fragrance isn&#x27;t bad for this one but isn&#x27;t strong either.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t tell much difference from any other tanning lotions I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I am very pale by nature, but tend not to burn as most pale people would.</li>
            <li>but even in high intensity beds I&#x27;m not getting a dark color with this lotion..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it especially since I only have to tan once a week now and still get dark.</li>
            <li>Feels amazing, I was afraid of looking Orange</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Will be buying more of this product when I run out!</li>

            <li> It smells kind of like a berry pear or something.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the date matters when they expire honestly.</li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance also.  </li>
            <li> (nice and fruity) and doesn&#x27;t leave me with a greasy feel</li>
            <li> so I was really happy when this lotion was able to make my tan hold a color for more than just a couple days.</li>
            <li> Kind of sticky and stinky.  </li>
            <li> The week before buying this one I bought another kind of lotion and it poured out like water as well.</li>
            <li> Really liked it.</li>

            <li> To be honest, I went tanning yesterday, and i didnt use my lotion and my legs</li>

            <li> Nice lotion for the price.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, and you can get it so much cheaper on Amazon than at the salon.</li>
            <li> and I got a nice glow.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t any better and no way does it smell as good.  </li>
            <li> and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Works good, however I noticed more or an &amp;#34;orange tan&amp;#34; as opposed to browning &amp; bronzing.</li>
            <li> I have my own tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> knowing just how expired would be nice .</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> It also smells nice.  </li>
            <li> I think the way it smells AFTER you tan is nice.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion has a nice bronzer that doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes after you tan</li>
            <li> and it smells nice to.</li>
            <li> I guess it depends on what kind of bed you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> I love all of Jwowws lotions and this one is just as good as all of her others.</li>
            <li> I got a nice tan from using it, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Its a nice lotion.. works</li>
            <li> So worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> - it smells really good, goes on great, dries fairly quick, leaves my skin feeling WAY more softer and smoother than before.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and always burn first before tanning.</li>
            <li> This product gave me a beautiful golden color that I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> But I can promise you will turn a beautiful golden heathy glow.</li>
            <li> uses :) i am very pleased with the product and will repurchase</li>
            <li> This lotion feels great on the skin, delivers fast results and smells good to boot.</li>

            <li> Best tanning lotion by far!</li>
            <li> New favorite tanning lotion!!!</li>
            <li> works very well at the tanning salon and a very good price compared to the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I was expecting so awesome bronzing action from this lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Gave me a wonderful glow that was natural and not &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It smells better than most lotions, but be sure you rub it in good and wash your hands.</li>
            <li> but cheap I would buy again, and it does smell really good</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff smells great!</li>
            <li> I have all the Jwoww lotions and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent and works great.</li>
            <li> By far the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used yet!</li>
            <li> Wish I could like this more cuz the lotion smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky however every time I use it</li>
            <li> well worth the money, great price.</li>
            <li> I really Loved this lotion, you get a good tan with this after the first time.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty good, not as good as the Worship.</li>
            <li> They checked the lotion at the salon and it was authintic and full!!</li>
            <li> Plus, it came very quickly in the mail!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this lotion!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> Ok, first off this lotion is great on its own or if you mix it with another product.</li>
            <li> Not only is this product amazing it smells and works great too!</li>
            <li> It works great smekks good and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I like to think I am a pretty experienced tanner.</li>
            <li> It has no tingle factor, but a GREAT bronzer in it, plus it keeps your skin pretty well moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great price and delivered fast!</li>
            <li> It works really well, but you have to make sure you rub it in really good!</li>
            <li> Now, the lotion in general is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li> I am very light skinned</li>
            <li> The smell has a nice scent and isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> This lotion starts to give you color quickly and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say as soon as I received it (very quick shipment 4 days)</li>
            <li> Just started using...nice scent, and good color in first three tans!</li>
            <li> Perfect thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after tanning but nothing too huge!</li>
            <li> Like I keep saying, a huge step up from the cheapo stuff!</li>
            <li> and after that one use I saw a huge difference!</li>
            <li> (but does NOT drip) makes it seem more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered to try it</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I will use up the bottle and probably move on to better lotions.</li>
            <li> Makes my tan last and gives me a wonderful bronze tan.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d rather not like the smell to be tan. :)</li>
            <li> They call it One and Done for a reason :)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> This product provides great color fast, price is cheaper than any tanning shop.</li>

            <li> The smell is also not bad at all!!</li>
            <li> SOOO MUCH better than spending four times the price at the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it because it&#x27;s better than no tanning lotion.</li>

            <li> It sells for $100.00 in my salon :)</li>
            <li> Smells great and is very blendable.</li>
            <li> love love love....</li>
            <li> Much better pricing than going to the salon and buying it.</li>
            <li> and I have used many over the years.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> That is just my experience with it. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried TONS of lotions and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was ok with it</li>
            <li> but I believe it&#x60;s the best currently being offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The scent is ok, not my fav but its alright.</li>
            <li> However i think there are better lotions out there</li>
            <li> Love the bronzer in this lotion.</li>
            <li> I ilike Ed Hardy products much better .The</li>

            <li> Love it will buy again</li>
            <li> Have tried all the JWOWW lotions and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion</li>
            <li> This product is more of a stainer than a bronzer.  </li>
            <li> In love with this stuff&lt;br /&gt;💛</li>
            <li> Mostly because I didn&#x27;t burn this time (my tush has a tendency to burn in the booth, even at 4-5 minutes.)</li>
            <li> Although, the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure what tanning lotion to buy.</li>
            <li> Could tell a difference after laying just once, I love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with how it turned out and the smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I actually kind of enjoy smelling it :]</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t smell like burnt skin and it makes me darker than most lotions.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Better off with something else, preferably something designed for men..</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> It helps keep your skin moist and helps you to get a more even tan.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love tanning, and I realize the damage that ultraviolet rays can cause to my skin.  </li>

            <li> This tanning lotion gives me much more color faster.</li>

            <li> Absolutely satisfied with that.</li>
            <li> I have to say I do like it, I just feel like DS Obsidian or Luminary work better for me.</li>
            <li> So for I think believe and Swedish beauty are better.</li>
            <li> i have been using spellbound and this tanning lotion is so much better</li>
            <li> Love love love jwoww.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Jwoww one and done lotion.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the lotion, it&#x27;s like a berry/pear scent.  </li>
            <li> and if I had more time would probably try out another product, but I&#x27;ll stick with this one for now.</li>
            <li> leaves skin moist love it</li>
            <li> Its a ok lotion.</li>

            <li> Will be ordering again :-)</li>
            <li> I still like snookie&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> The lotion smelled ok..</li>
            <li> I love the product Jwoww one and done.</li>
            <li> But I know a lot of people love it.</li>
            <li> how many times I shook it up.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the lotion and had no after tan scent which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> The smell is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is just ok for me</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the smell!</li>
            <li> I just bought this product and I am in love with it.  </li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite lotion, will always use this one tried switching but ended up giving it away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product, it gives a lovely tan, moisturizers the skin and smells divine</li>
            <li> so I purchased this one and am so pleased.</li>
            <li> It says there is a fruity scent to it , doesn&#x27;t really smell all that great.</li>
            <li> This lotion is just okay.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a floral smell to me.  </li>
            <li> It gives me great color, much like all of the JWOWW products.</li>
            <li> It smells ok, I&#x27;ve smelled better lotions</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li> the smell of the lotion in the bottle is not my favorite</li>
            <li> but once you put it on and get heated up in your tanning bed it smells phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought cheaper ones that work better.</li>
            <li> and I love the smoothness of it.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to give it more time?</li>
            <li> could see better results in just two uses.</li>
            <li> but since I have not used it more then 2 times had to give it a 4.</li>
            <li> and i absolutly love it</li>
            <li> love it and this is my go to lotion</li>
            <li> Love this product....</li>
            <li> Smell is ok, but I felt like I smelled like burnt skin after.</li>
            <li> I love all of her products.</li>
            <li> I love the way this lotion smells but after a couple weeks of use</li>
            <li> This honestly is my favorite tanning lotion of all</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it and probably will again.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li> I felt sexy.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It really is a good tanning lotion, I&#x27;ve been going tanning for years and this really gives a nice tan glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> love JWOWW tanning lotions</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not a Jersey Shore fan.  </li>
            <li> Smells better, works better.</li>
            <li> and of course it takes more than one session to be done</li>
            <li> And the smell is okay going intot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product!!!💋</li>
            <li> All in all I still love this lotion</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love almost all of the snooki and jwoww lotion.</li>
            <li> The smell is not my favorite</li>
            <li> but I love it otherwise..</li>
            <li> the top of the lotion was sealed.&lt;br /&gt;Lots</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have the time to go tanning too often, this is the product you need : )</li>
            <li> 8)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :) :)</li>
            <li> Unlike others, I love the scent of the lotion.  </li>
            <li> Much more affordable than salon lotion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Bronzer.  </li>
            <li> but over all we were satisfied with the results it gives for a starter.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Bronzer works well, but there is better lotion than this one.</li>
            <li> Used better lotions.</li>
            <li> I have tried several lotions, this is my favorite !!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen more change in one tanning session with NO lotion than I did using this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wipe it off your palms and apply to your skin in a circular motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew I would get a better price here</li>
            <li> I like tingler more</li>
            <li> I love the out come of it</li>
            <li> Love it.....</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Its more of a tanning lotion smell...</li>
            <li> Just make sure to wipe off your hands after you apply it - the bronzer in it will stain your hands if they are not washed after applying it</li>
            <li> Love this lotion it really gets my tan going!!!!</li>
            <li> The consistency of the lotion goes on very nicely, don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot.</li>
            <li> It smells good, easy to blend and darkens quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s better lotions out there, this one isn&#x27;t exactly a miracle worker, but it&#x27;s a good lotion.</li>
            <li> Used this one first and smells great with very fast results!!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells awesome and helps you get a really nice dark even tan.</li>
            <li> One of the best with fast results and no fake bronzer look.</li>
            <li> Its decent but nothing great.</li>
            <li> First off they charge twice as much at any tanning salon so this was at great price !</li>
            <li> Quick shipping AND absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> It gives great color and is my new favorite lotion</li>
            <li> Lotion goes on very smoothly, and the smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as some of the reviewers said.</li>
            <li> All in all, I am happy with this purchase and will be looking to this seller in the future for more product!</li>
            <li> Great to be able to not pay majorly marked up Salon prices for this product!</li>
            <li> At first, I LOVED this lotion.</li>
            <li> Defiantly would recommend to anyone I have fair skin and got really tan!</li>
            <li> The lotion is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> The lotion for one, smells greaaaat and for two, it really does do a nice job with the bronzing of your skin!</li>
            <li> I looked darker after the first tan and it gives me really good color.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, smells pretty good, paraben free, great skin care benefits.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product and could tell a difference right away with one use.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have very long to get the tan she wanted and this worked perfect.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> However, after I tan, the smell is so incredibly strong and overwhelming</li>
            <li> For those of us that like something more natural this is a great kick start to a tan.</li>
            <li> matter how much I put on it rubs in so nicely like a nice lotion</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I got color the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Great product, no problems, quick to ship, Item exactly as explained in the description.</li>
            <li> It certainly does not smell good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smells great and is a decent price but for advanced tanners I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying at this at all.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells good, fresh and clean, in the bottle and when applied.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product especially if Ur starting to tan.  </li>
            <li> okay when you first put it on but after using the tanning bed it makes your skin smell like warm cheese.</li>
            <li> Works great, gives me a even natural tan.</li>
            <li> My tan looks really great and natural.</li>
            <li> Great if you&#x27;re looking for a natural and not orange looking tan.</li>
            <li> This lotion came to me in excellent condition and sooner than expected the lotion</li>
            <li> Has a smooth feeling when put on, better than lotion.</li>
            <li> but this one is light and fruity, I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> The smell is great before and after tanning, and it leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that much, but as I said it is good</li>
            <li> I just try to keep a nice golden glow</li>
            <li> I am nice and golden bronzed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells good, just didn&#x27;t bronze as fast as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t darkened that much at all and the bottle is almost gone - smells good though</li>
            <li> and I loved it its works so fast</li>
            <li> The best bronzing/tanning lotion for a super white chick!!</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast shipping</li>
            <li> Smells great, goes on smooth and leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> but this, so far, is my favorite!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it gives me great color!</li>
            <li> Overall its good!</li>
            <li> So excited to order more.</li>
            <li> And compared to the other JWOWW lotions it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I loved this product, it got me dark fast and had a great smell!</li>
            <li> I have medium skin and tan easily, If I burn, it turns tan within 24-48 hours.</li>
            <li> I ordered it on here and it was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The name surely does justify how great it actually works; I&#x27;ve tanned with this lotion three times</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and it&#x27;s by far the best tanning lotion I have used yet.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t streak or make me look orange.  </li>
            <li> like really strong pear perfume.</li>
            <li> quick shipping, great product, I would recommend this product to anyone that wants a good dark tan and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> I was however pleasantly and greatly surprised!  </li>
            <li> My honest option is that at first it smelled really strong and I was like</li>
            <li> When I was first putting on the lotion it smelled amazing</li>
            <li> You can see your tan after the first use and you skin feels and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> It gets me a nice color (not orange at all) pretty quickly...and it doesn&#x27;t stink (before, during, or AFTER the tanning process).  </li>
            <li> Not the best for getting dark and not drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t to thrilled with the smell at first but after tanning with it I didn&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lotion when I first started tanning for the season</li>
            <li> and if they do water it down, it is still the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> but this one is for sure my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Tanning lotion doesnt have a STRONG perfumey smell, very light and fresh.</li>
            <li> Smells great, you tan pretty fast with this lotion.</li>
            <li> I could have gotten it at mine for $65, but I chose to get it off Amazon instead, for less than $30. :D</li>
            <li> She assured me I would be fine using the bottle I had because the shelf life was still in tact.</li>
            <li> It is expired but seems fine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, after buying black at the tanning salon</li>
            <li> Absolute great bronzer, and blends very well!</li>
            <li> Smell is fine, nothing overpowering.</li>
            <li> I just rubbed it in when I got into sunlight and was fine.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not 18 months you are fine.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference after one use, its not a drastic change, but its a difference, but when I mix it with something like pauly d&#x27;s the after party, its like a super bronzing cocktail!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already super tan!</li>
            <li> I am not super fair skin but would still be considered fair skin.</li>
            <li> This product is really good lt came in so quick and works really well for me</li>
            <li> It smells very strong when you first put it on, but once soaked into your skin</li>
            <li> and I was excited about the prospect of getting a tan more quickly.</li>
            <li> What I love most is that it leaves your skin not only soft but smelling very good.  </li>
            <li> I also was already tan when using this product and noticed a huge difference in color after two times.</li>
            <li> , haven&#x27;t noticed a HUGE change in color.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic, flowery.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and smells tropical with the texture of yogurt.</li>
            <li> Smells tood and leaves skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> this is a cheap alternative vs. paying $70 in a salon.</li>
            <li> Overall I have been happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered multiple bottles from Amazon where you can get it for a great price.</li>
            <li> It smells like someone broke a bottle of cheap, spoiled wine all over me.</li>
            <li> but I know why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to any tanner, beginner or advanced.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth like lotion.</li>
            <li> nice smell and really enhances your tanning glow.</li>
            <li> This lotion seems to give me great color in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an advanced tanner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and it really makes you a shade darker every time you use it.</li>
            <li> You will have great color after using only a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Deff worth it :)</li>
            <li> It has a tropical like scent, it&#x27;s light and not overpowering,  and goes on well.  </li>
            <li> and it actually smells great after tanning.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you feel dried out and it makes you smell good instead of smelling like burnt skin!!</li>
            <li> Smells okay, but worth the tan.</li>
            <li> I just used it a few times and had great results!!</li>
            <li> and it leaves your skin smooth</li>
            <li> I have used lots of products and this leaves your skin feeling silky smooth, it feels like it tightens your skin</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their skin nice while tanning.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the way it feels.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works and smells amazing which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> The lotuon went on smooth and even.</li>
            <li> I used it again about 48 hours later, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> I actually went to a coffee place after tanning and got a compliment from the guy taking my order about how great I smelled.  </li>
            <li> Gave it 2 stars because it does make your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does it smells decliious but it has some really attractive ingredients</li>
            <li> the one from the tanning salon was light tan</li>
            <li> The shipping is awesome, so if anyone needs it within a few days, they are the bomb.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> for the color, maybe I am just to light skinned.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and makes my skin baby soft anfter showering, so when they said it has moisterizers in it they aren&#x27;t lying.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> The lotion is thick and doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but it gets the job done for sure.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skin redhead and it doesnt burn me and its a really natural tan.</li>
            <li> I am all golden tan and ready for summer smell is good to.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and gives a natural tan color!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion has given me the best color out of all previous products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the New Jwoww Tanning Lotion.  </li>
            <li> cute, right?</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not an overwhelming fragrance, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent and no orange tint like many other lotions.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34; but either way I love it and its very very very good for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like the color it gives me especially right</li>
            <li> Its a good lotion an my daughter really likes it but for me i need somthing hot to get tan started</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, and gives me a pretty good tan.  </li>
            <li> I am fair skinned with blonde hair and do not tan easily.</li>
            <li> I love love love the smell of it and the overall feeling of it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was always so excited to go tan and put on this delectable smelling lotion, one and done.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> I am not to excited about the smell</li>
            <li> After reading all reviews of this product and going tanning and not seeing any results in darkening.. I asked the girl at the tanning salon, who is familiar with a lot of tanning product.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $24!</li>
            <li> buy this noticed first day of use how much better I tanned and the difference in my skin</li>
            <li> It always takes me a while to brown, but I defiantly noticed more color after using this product for the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting such a nice color with in just a week or two of using the product!</li>
            <li> This just came out this week and has gotten me excited about JWOWW products again.  </li>
            <li> which is what the original JWOWW did</li>
            <li> What is nice also is that with the bronzers in this one it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks between your fingers like normal bronzers do, and it&#x27;s not orange or streaky.</li>
            <li> the bronzer is great and the scent is not overwhelmingly sweet like most.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell good, but as a fair skinned lady it has done wonders (so far).</li>
            <li> Within 3 uses of this product there was a significant change in my coloring.</li>
            <li> Was ok at first.</li>
            <li> I have tried every JWOWW Bronzer on the market and I am NEVER disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> :)  Works very well!</li>
            <li> Now, I am so excited literally my face is glowing, shiny and</li>
            <li> I was excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It lasted me 2 months worth!</li>
            <li> I have always used (past 25 yrs) that I buy in a Salon size and it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li> As an experienced tanner, this lotion seemed to make me get lighter, very strange.</li>
            <li> Because this lotion smells more \\&quot;girly\\&quot; than the 50X Black Bronzer lotion, I won&#x27;t be able to share it with my husband, but I&#x27;m okay with that!</li>
            <li> THIS is - by far - my favorite!  </li>
            <li> not too great right in the middle when I compare to others.  </li>
            <li> I feel that if I was able to go in a little longer like you can at most tanning salons, my results may have been even better!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, gives you a nice, bronze color fast that truly lasts, makes your skin so soft and smooth, and makes your tattoos really pop!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not as good as some of the other JWOWW lotions.</li>
            <li> Man was she right!</li>
            <li> smells great but not sure if its working the best - I have gotten a lot tanner faster with other lotions.</li>
            <li> Came faster than I expected and was packaged great.</li>
            <li> Great color after my first use, only tanned for 10 minutes and saw a difference.</li>
            <li> Works well and fast two thumbs up :)</li>
            <li> Good lotion, I have only used it twice and have noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> This is good stuff overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion and definitely helps with the tanning process.</li>
            <li> Just nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Gives you a beautiful dark color...</li>
            <li> it said but it took for tje second time to see a difference.doesnt smell good after you get out</li>
            <li> Needs more bronzers but very moisturizing</li>
            <li> or I look like snooki, if that&#x27;s the goal then sweet, you&#x27;ve got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay full price and know it works .</li>
            <li> I went straight to the tanning bed to compare theres to mine AUTHENTIC.</li>
            <li> I went through the tanning lotion results on Amazon for a good hour or two before i finally made my choices.</li>
            <li> From all the reviews that I read before purchasing this product, I was pleased with the way that it really did increase my tan.  </li>
            <li> AND ITS TRUE</li>
            <li> I love this lotion it really works.</li>
            <li> And the thick yogurt based texture feels awesome!</li>
            <li> I would never pay full price for it.</li>
            <li> I have red hair and am fairly fair skinned.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t explain enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is true to its name</li>
            <li> I love this so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this lotion one star and that&#x27;s simply because it smells good before and after tanning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad .</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I have never been this dark &amp; I have fair skin</li>
            <li> the after tan smell is NOT bad like some lotions, the bronzer has never ever turned me streaky or odd-colored..</li>
            <li> No bad after smell after a tanning session.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it could be as good as the JWOW Black bronzier, but it is.  </li>
            <li> If you like super fruity and sweet scents, you may not have a problem.  </li>
            <li> so I brown pretty easy in the sun.</li>
            <li> I will try her other products now after being happy with this one.</li>
            <li> I tried it anyways and the smell is great but other than that I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Even tanning in my 12 minute bed with all new bronzing lamps has not given me such a gorgeous bronze look!  </li>
            <li> This lotion smells great, and my favorite thing about it is that it really does cut down on the after tan smell.</li>
            <li> I am the whitest girl out there, but after just a week of using this in the tanning bed I am really seeing significant color!</li>
            <li> Makes me feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Ive used many different lotions and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone who loves to save a quick buck.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this lotion was how soft and smooth it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> IT QUICK SHIPPING</li>
            <li> I am now on the lookout for a better local salon with hotter beds to see just how much more this lotion can give me.</li>
            <li> Born in NY and near Nicole&#x27;s hometown (Pleasant Valley for me), I love this lotion and cannot wait to tan darker and bring my Italian side out!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions, the smell is amazing but not intense.  </li>
            <li> it came in at a decent time and the price is way better than what the tan salon has it for.</li>
            <li> If you love Australian Gold products, looks for some Almost Famous.</li>
            <li> One and done definitely smells better than most of the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> It works quickly as it says and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or a burnt skin smell which nobody likes</li>
            <li> The delivery was SUPER QUICK.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned one that got me tan so quick</li>
            <li> Works quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter, she really likes this product and does recomend it especially at this great price.</li>
            <li> I really was happy with this purchase especially for the price</li>
            <li> I got tanned pretty fast with this lotion and the tan lasts! :)</li>
            <li> You can see results fairly quickly, but once you take a shower, a lot of the color washes off.</li>
            <li> I must say that I received this so quickly.</li>
            <li> If you were looking for a beautiful summer dark glow, don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> After reading such great reviews of this lotion, I had to try it, but it  normally retails for almost $70 in my salon!</li>
            <li> ;, which is pretty cheap lotion, to this.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have used for tanning &amp; by far much cheaper on amazon than I&#x27;m my local tanning salon where it was priced at $160...</li>
            <li> Literally just opened up my package with my bottle of this lotion inside and the very first thing I checked was the expiration date.</li>
            <li> My experience with this lotion has been a great one I have gotten really dark with this lotion alone.</li>
            <li> Within 3 uses I&#x27;m unbelievably tan, and it smells incredible.</li>
            <li> Now the new Jwoww 2014 is much better..</li>
            <li> AT THE FROUNT TOLD ME ABOUT HER NEW FAVORITE LOTION....</li>
            <li> Works pretty good but the smell it leaves after tanning is gross.</li>
            <li> This product is the second tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried and it does a pretty good job for me when tanning.  </li>
            <li> Overall still a pretty good tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already on my second bottle of this stuff, it lasts a pretty good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Smells great, an has gotten me super dark!</li>
            <li> No weird after tanning smell either!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very fair-skinned person and have used other Jwoww lotions but by far this lotion is the best, my absolute favorite, and has given quicker results.</li>
            <li> I just bought this lotion and used it for the first time today!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite so far of the tanning lotions i&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> You see results the first time!</li>
            <li> and I got exactly what was described!</li>
            <li> Seen results after first tan!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Love my natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> There was immediate results, I was a darker color after the first time using it!</li>
            <li> I noticed I was getting noticeably darker after the first three days of tanning!</li>
            <li> The paint it black lotions I have found work the best so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad lotion..just not as good as her other lotions.</li>
            <li> Shipper was great to issue a prompt return but the product itself is just not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Smells great when applying but does get a little of that smelly post-tan smell</li>
            <li> I have tired many lotions and this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this amazing lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the purchase; since Amazon is a lot cheaper then my tanning salon.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for some looking for a nice bronze tan.</li>
            <li> if you wanted a more natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> my favorite lotions by far.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite tanning lotion</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Wanted a dark tan, which it works and smells nice as well !</li>
            <li> im already pretty dark so this product is great to me</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite tanning lotions by far.</li>
            <li> But the One and Done is my favorite so far out of those 3.  </li>
            <li> Nice big bottle,  squeeze lotion into ur hand to apply.</li>
            <li> Its well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite tanning lotions so far</li>
            <li> I like it so far. :)</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite by far of all the tanning lotions I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Nice deep tan, not orange AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> Might or might not purchase same kind again.</li>
            <li> the smell is pleasant, no bad after smell, it does rub off on the clothes a little</li>
            <li> No I strongly believe the Sellers who have great ratings, who are trusted do not put anything else in it.</li>
            <li> I love this does not leaves marks makes you dark fast, it leaves nice smell not sticky, was alot cheaper then buying a salon</li>
            <li> Not too marky on your hands after, its good to wipe your hands off anyway after any lotion, but nothing extreme like orange hands or anything.</li>
            <li> but there are other brands  cheaper that are even betterr or as good.</li>
            <li> The product smells good not like the other that leave your skin smelling burnt.</li>
            <li> Because of the reviews I had really high expectations for this lotion, but honestly I&#x27;m not quite as impressed as I&#x27;d like to be.</li>
            <li> just the right amount of bronzes</li>
            <li> People are right though, it is expired.</li>
            <li> , you couldn&#x27;t tell right away</li>
            <li> My order arrived right on time</li>
            <li> The lotion was sent right away in the mail</li>
            <li> As of right now, I&#x27;m going to continue using it until its gone, but I am looking for an accelerator.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not my favorite, but it leaves you with very little ATO, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I had a pretty nice tan before I bought this, and I definitely noticed a difference with just one use!</li>
            <li> I think its a nice fruity left over smell, but it is pretty slimy after.</li>
            <li> 100X tanning and Matahari Dark Sexy legs and love them both.</li>
            <li> , the smell is just ok its fruity and sweet not a basic tanning lotion smell</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have full results till more like the second use.</li>
            <li> Kind of amazed that one session or a short time used in the sun really does show a noticeably difference!</li>
            <li> Really works and will brown you right up!  </li>
            <li> It left a clean fresh scent!!</li>
            <li> I usually love Jwoww&#x27;s lotions her black bronzer is my favorite</li>
            <li> Really can tell after one tanning session so true to the name.</li>
            <li> The smell is fruity and nice, the lotion leaves my skin feeling smooth and never dried out, and after I tan, it&#x27;s obvious that I went tanning that day.</li>
            <li> My color is more complete and more lasting in between sessions.</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion, it does get you dark.</li>
            <li> The lotion was average, but for that price its a good deal.</li>
            <li> I was a good dark Color</li>
            <li> I tried it today and long story short, I loved it!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this recently and have really grown to love it!</li>
            <li> great lotion smells good last a long time get super dark with this lotion some times</li>
            <li> Smooths on nicely (although it is much thinner than the Australian Gold Fierce D-fense lotion I was using before).</li>
            <li> I will rather spend a few more dollars on a better product.</li>
            <li> its awesome, it smells alittle weird, but I can stand it so the lotion is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Not as good as her black bronzer to me.</li>
            <li> Smells good and you get dark results even after the first time using it.</li>
            <li> I had run out of jwowws black bronzer lotion which I loved.</li>
            <li> Great lotion to build a base tan, but not so great to get you that \\&quot;dark\\&quot; summer color I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I only had to tan a few times to get the perfect tone I wanted!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am very pale and it helped me get a great tan</li>
            <li> Most tanning/bronzing lotions don&#x27;t show results right after using them but this one definitely does!</li>
            <li> , I love the smell of this lotion (not strong like most tanning lotions and everyone can telltell that you just went</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced on Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> I have decently good tanning skin in itself, but I like a little help.</li>
            <li> It does take a little while to build a good tan though.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this new tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Definitely a one and done product, I tan quickly and easily</li>
            <li> it made me very dark and it smelled good too</li>
            <li> pay more for the same thing?!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that its way better than the private reserve jwow 50x bronzing lotion too.</li>
            <li> Web both love it, but one of our two bottles was getting low</li>
            <li> I have tanned just 3 times, the first two using the 50X Bronzer</li>
            <li> Love it, would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> On a side note, my husband loves and uses it too but is too embarrassed to walk in with it, haha!</li>
            <li> I had better lotion in the past that I used, but this one just smelled much better.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Tonight was my first time using it, I can already tell I&#x27;m darker</li>
            <li> im getting pretty tan</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying the lotion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make you turn funny shades</li>
            <li> I use this in my tanning bed, and I saw a difference the first time.  </li>
            <li> Thanks JWOWW and Amazon!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It does it exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> first time I used it</li>
            <li> , i thought id see color after first time using like</li>
            <li> I was never skeptical about buying items online, but now I am.</li>
            <li> helps me tan so much faster!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> :) I will buy again especially at this price!</li>
            <li> I have gotten the same results or better with cheaper brands</li>
            <li> When I first got my lotion</li>
            <li> the only reason I went with one and done is because of the moisturizing factor which I LOVE..</li>
            <li> Smells MUCH better than her White Wedding.</li>
            <li> First of all; the date on this bottle in Fall 2012.</li>
            <li> This stuff got me tan really fast!</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> And Amazon is MUCH cheaper than the salon prices!</li>
            <li> I finally got the chance to use this today and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Definitely will order it again when I finish the first bottle. :)</li>
            <li> Jwoww one and done is exactly that, &amp;#34;ONE and DONE!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty tan as it is.</li>
            <li> A must buy for avid indoor tanners.  </li>
            <li> exactly where I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, definitely grab this product :)</li>
            <li> This was my first jwoww tanning lotion...</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> consistency is almost runny,not very moisturizing at all!</li>
            <li> Soo fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Over all I love this lotion and would definitely purchase again!!!</li>
            <li> The color it gives me is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Thank you soooo much!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference after first time.</li>
            <li> This is the first JWOWW lotion I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference the first time i tanned.</li>
            <li> It said 1/7/2014 which at first was discouraging, but decided to go ask my local Planet Beach just to be sure.</li>
            <li> but more likely around when the lot of that lotion had been made.</li>
            <li> today was my first day using this product.</li>
            <li> I immediately saw results after my first session.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> this product does exactly what they said.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would tan me pretty fast and this lotion did NOT!</li>
            <li> I noticed color within the first couple visits.</li>
            <li> and I can tell I&#x27;m 2shades darker after the first time I used it  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This is the first yr  </li>
            <li> I love the JWoww line and will go back to her products again and again!</li>
            <li> Today was the first day i tried this lotion</li>
            <li> Especially after the tanning bed, most lotions leave a burnt skin smell</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my tan the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> Ive used many different lotions</li>
            <li> It does not give you an instant color like more bronzers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Today was the first time I used this product while tanning in a tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> It worked pretty well</li>
            <li> After using this product within the first week, there were notices.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews it was the first bottle I purchased when I started using tanning beds.  </li>
            <li> After my first session with this I was literally 4 shades darker, I also was in a bronzing bed</li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> for the delivery it came before the expected date in a nice protected cushioned package and</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I put a lot on because it was so runny</li>
            <li> This was my first time tanning and my first tan ever</li>
            <li> As a Tanning Salon owner for 10 years I thought a review from someone who has not only sold many different lotions but has also tried many might be helpful.  </li>
            <li> If you purchase the one that is fulfilled by Amazon, it is definitely NOT fake.</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; I use it and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion because it instantly makes me look darker without turning me orange.</li>
            <li> And was very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Private Reserve by Jwoww is much better.</li>
            <li> I noticed my tan the first time.</li>
            <li> but it definitely gives a nice golden natural tan</li>
            <li> It does work but didn&#x27;t start seeing color change for a few weeks it does smell good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is just a smidge runnier than Glam Slam, but it went only easily and quickly absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li> It gives a more natural color and maintains my tan better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> Other then that its amazing</li>
            <li> Overall a good lotion, I&#x27;m not disappointed by any means, I just prefer the other bronzers.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best lotion for instant bronzing action.</li>
            <li> and I could actually see a significant improvement!</li>
            <li> As a plain lotion I am sure it is fine</li>
            <li> But, due to a quickly upcoming event and my need to tan for a summer dress I plan to wear to the event, I decided to give this Jwoww tanning product a try since it had so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing tanning lotion if you wish to get dark fast!</li>
            <li> The Solid Black does the job way better for those who want a nice brown tan.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a nice lotion (I like Solid Black by Millennium better.)</li>
            <li> Our salon has a lot of expensive lotions, and this one is one of the more fair priced--</li>
            <li> By far my favorite tanning lotion so far.</li>
            <li> and i got a beautiful dark tan after only a couple of tanning sessions.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as bad as the JWOWW wedding white, but not as good as some other products out there.</li>
            <li> It is not slimy or uses too much bronzer where it turns your fingers colors, it has just the right amount to really enhance your tan.</li>
            <li> however I do want to try a few other brands as well just to see what works best for me</li>
            <li> ;) I highly recommend the JWoww line of tanning lotions!</li>
            <li> I am very suspicious that it isn&#x27;t the exact formula I paid for.</li>
            <li> After tan smell is pretty much non-exitent with this lotion.</li>
            <li> First off, I am very please with Sunless Deals.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works as a good bronzer.</li>
            <li> The scent is good and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It smells good and it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have purchased JWoww tanning products in the past and loved them</li>
            <li> and i got a nice bronze and dark tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just being honest, not putting the product down.</li>
            <li> I do tan easily but have never found a lotion that works this well after only 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I am white as casper and do not tan easily by any means.</li>
            <li> It absorbs rather quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Glam Slam and although it has been working very well on the majority of my body, my legs weren&#x27;t getting as dark as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> but a few hours later the tan came out beautifully.</li>
            <li> skin was so much softer after using it, I highly recommend this product, definitely getting this again! :)</li>
            <li> but i certainly have gotten color in  3</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to any one and im pretty pale when I started never made me orange and has nice smell.</li>
            <li> This is weak and doesn&#x27;t smell great.  </li>
            <li> It gives me such a deep tan, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> used it one time on a cloudy day for one and half hours it is the best stuff ive ever used considering im redheaded and extremly pale</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing especially being nearly half off the original price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale and pasty and burn super easy.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after one use and a HUGE difference after about the third use.</li>
            <li> and Done did not seem to get me much darker yet.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> Not so much..</li>
            <li> I feel like it is the real deal</li>
            <li> and I am very noticeably tanner just after one use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and you really do see results after one use</li>
            <li> Got the product on time and it is working very well.</li>
            <li> The one thing I wasn&#x27;t really a fan about was the smell.</li>
            <li> I think this tanning lotion really works well.</li>
            <li> Really runny.</li>
            <li> It really holds my tan in I</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion</li>
            <li> It pained me buying anything from the Jersey Shore people, but this tanning lotion really works.  </li>
            <li> but this isn&#x27;t really \\&quot;typical.\\</li>
            <li> This product worked very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent</li>
            <li> I feel cooler when I go under the lamp and don&#x27;t sweat as much.  </li>
            <li> Also its so much cheaper on Amazon than at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> It smells very tropical.</li>
            <li> This came sealed in a bag, I have no doubt it is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I also have olive skin tone, and tend to tan fast.</li>
            <li> If you buy here, you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than the salons will sell it for.</li>
            <li> Nothing to really compare it to yet.</li>
            <li> I thought it would get me much darker, but it did not at all make me any darker.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to indoor tanners!</li>
            <li> She was tan an ready for summer when summer came.  </li>
            <li> This lotion absolutely does NOT meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to go tanning as much.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Seriously it really does work.</li>
            <li> Also, it really beats the prices at tanning salons.</li>
            <li> It smells really</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell you how it works in a tanning bed</li>
            <li> This product works very well..  </li>
            <li> , YOU KNOW GETTING READY FOR SWIMMING SEASON.</li>
            <li> I tan very well, but</li>
            <li> HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest it!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> The date on the bottom of the bottle is not so much an expiration date</li>
            <li> Seeing as its named one &amp; done, you&#x27;d think it would work fast.</li>
            <li> Really upset that my product is expired.</li>
            <li> It was very runny no matter</li>
            <li> I am very pale.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It didnt do much for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> Came fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Really moisturized my skin.</li>
            <li> This one really works in one tan</li>
            <li> you can see a real difference.  </li>
            <li> Four stars because I don&#x27;t really like the smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and it really helps boost your tan.</li>
            <li> no matter how fast you wash them off after applying.</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;after tan slime&amp;#34; is minimal. :)</li>
            <li> have been very...</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put it on your face, it made my skin breakout and too much color.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> not so much.</li>
            <li> he bed, but coming out of the bed not so much.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion...</li>
            <li> Ive gotten really dark.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really like pairs</li>
            <li> my scars are fading so fast</li>
            <li> , I got the real deal.</li>
            <li> so i got a knock off bottle that some one tampered with im very pissed</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it as much as silicone lotions.  </li>
            <li> Unlike silicone lotions, it doesn&#x27;t spread over my skin very well</li>
            <li> It is very fruity.</li>
            <li> Like the smell of it and works really well.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t really care for the after smell.</li>
            <li> I really put wayyy too much on thank the streaks</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to have much of an effect.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> For only using it two times I really love the color I got so far.</li>
            <li> Delivers a nice color without leaving a harsh after tanning smell.</li>
            <li> Gets you to a nice tan overall, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> And I love that it keeps my skin moisturized and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different tanning lotion but by far this is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> And Done has a pleasant none tropical scent which to me smells like a subtle perfume.  </li>
            <li> AND THIS MAKES MY SKIN FEEL BABY SOFT!!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Other lotions smell good in the bottle but soon after tanning you smell like a dirty sock, this stuff makes you smell really yummy :) I highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good and it seemed to get me darker than I usually get!  </li>
            <li> I have previously used Designer Skin&#x27;s BLACK Tanning Lotion and found it to be much more effective.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my two cents on what most of the other reviews mention:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> read other reviews to make sure this wasn&#x27;t a knock-off, and think I got one.</li>
            <li> Wish it smelt better like the other JWOWW items.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion works better than any other I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it have had much better tanning results from other lotions</li>
            <li> Just didnt seem to do much more than the other one I used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not EXTREMELY noticeable the first time you use it, but I burned pretty well.</li>
            <li> Other people might in fact love it.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Product is not the same as original.</li>
            <li> &quot; smell that it has, other then that i love it.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to other tanners out there :)</li>
            <li> I have used other Jwoww products and have been pleased with them as well.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Might be okay for new tanners, but beware as it will turn you orange if you use it daily, and it gives you a golden tan instead of a deep tan.</li>
            <li> It got me dark so quick!!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m super confused as to why there are recent reviews saying it&#x27;s so great.</li>
            <li> ; I was SUPER skeptical at first because the strong fragrance and light color of the lotion and not sold sealed.</li>
            <li> You have to rub in the product to get the full effect or other wise it will leave your tan uneven.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend showering right after you tan!</li>
            <li> I only had a month an half to get a good tan before my trip to jamaica.</li>
            <li> does leave a little stain between fingers after applying BUT does wash off easily!</li>
            <li> Goes on nice, smells good, and my sensitive skin has never had a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> Out of all my lotions, this one is the only bottle mostly full.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin pretty soft though.</li>
            <li> so normally it doesn&#x27;t take much to impress me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used JWoww lotion in the past and I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using Glam Slam for the rest of my body because I don&#x27;t want to be too dark up top, but I do like my legs darker</li>
            <li> I definitely love the smell of this bronzer way better than the Jwoww Black Bronzer Dark Tanning Lotion.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion, it arrives fast and in new packaging so you don&#x27;t have to wonder if it has been watered down.</li>
            <li> I plan on trying a few other lotions to see which one works best, so there is a possibility I might come back to this.</li>
            <li> well im very disapointed in this new jwoww!i</li>
            <li> I go tanning for two to three months out of the year for the past 5 years and have never seen such amazing results before!</li>
            <li> I was able to get it through Amazon for half the price that it would have cost me at my tanning salon.  </li>
            <li> Black Koi is my favorite</li>
            <li> I love the Jwoww brands of lotions black, gold and this one and done.  </li>
            <li> Will use this lotion as I have previously used and love JWoww&#x27;s tanning products.</li>
            <li> but i love the black bronzers in this</li>
            <li> * about the bronzer staining your hands: I take makeup wipes into the tanning room to wipe my makeup off before tanning &amp; use a makeup wipe to wipe my hands off &amp; then one of the dispensable paper towels my salon provides to QUICKLY wipe my hands of any excess bronzer (my salon has only 3 minutes before the bed</li>
            <li> Decent I guess.</li>
            <li> I had been using another product for a couple of months and wasn&#x27;t getting any decent results.  </li>
            <li> the main things I look for in a lotion is smell, bronzers, and after tan smell.</li>
            <li> I did get a decent tan with it though.</li>
            <li> and I mainly purchase lotion containing bronzer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the $30 price especially if you&#x27;re willing to spend a little more than what you usually spend for a better product with quick results &amp;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all her products</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> And I am highly dissatisfied with the &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;lack of color&amp;#34; this lotion brought me.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it, as well as any of the JWOWW lotions.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells old!!</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like the bronzing effect - its not long enough lasting and it can be kind of streaky.</li>
            <li> It has good bronzers and is very thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The small amount of color I get doesn&#x27;t last; my ran fades very quickly even though I tan easily.</li>
            <li> (A little goes a long way) and it smells so good even after tanning.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try another tanning lotion, since I got sick of the smell on the one I knew worked great</li>
            <li> it smeels a bit wierd but get you very dark :)</li>
            <li> this lotion does not have any bad sents it works perfectly</li>
            <li> It is not thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> This one smells and feels like normal lotion.</li>
            <li> I love JWoWW tanning products and I have used quite a few of them</li>
            <li> If you want a great dark tan that last a long time I would recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> which normally takes it 1-2weeks.</li>
            <li> Not runny, pretty thick which i love...</li>
            <li> My skin feels nourished afterwards and after a few hours you are able to tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, I feel it was worth the price</li>
            <li> Wish I would have purchased it sooner to use it a few more times befor my vacation.  </li>
            <li> I noticed after a few uses my tan looked more saturated and deeper in color.</li>
            <li> I got this because of all of the good reviews, but I was not happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li> bronzer seemed a little weak, but its still a great lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just saying that my daughter is allergic to both Jwoww tanning lotions she ordered and is perfectly fine using other products.</li>
            <li> Although, I didn&#x27;t really notice a huge difference as some people claimed they did, I did notice I looked slightly darker after a couple hours but keep in mind</li>
            <li> /&gt;I usually tan pretty easily</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if all tanning lotions smell super sweet and fruity,</li>
            <li> This worked right away, after a couple tans I was asked if I had just come back from vacation!</li>
            <li> it is much more tame.</li>
            <li> I am unsure what to think and will not really have a true opinion until I use this a few more times but has anyone else heard of these type of things happening?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to tanning</li>
            <li> After just 3 uses it took my tan to a new level.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to tanning</li>
            <li> Lotion is okay, but i feel its not very effective for me.</li>
            <li> It always seems to be the genuine product and this works great to give me a base bronze.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this lotion for paler tanners (especially ones that tan easily) because it gives you natural looking bronze tones.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this stuff is fantastic and will be purchasing a big bottle.  </li>
            <li> It smells decent it leaves you soft.</li>
            <li> burnt&#x27; and this is like a nice subtle perfume.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re needing a tan fast of wanting a base tan, this is a great lotion for that!</li>
            <li> I thought the smell was a little odd at first, but I have gotten used to it and love it!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the first time I used it and it won&#x27;t be the last</li>
            <li> At salons it sells for $70 or higher; It&#x27;s definitely a steal on here.</li>
            <li> and I can tell a pretty big change in my level of darkness.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the wedding white bronzer, but this just seems to have a better fragrance and post tanning scent.</li>
            <li> Better used mixed with any other lotion.  </li>
            <li> First tanning lotion I used and definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li> After only 3 uses I am SO much darker!</li>
            <li> WAAAAY cheaper here than at the salon and EXACTLY the same product!</li>
            <li> It has an ok smell, not exactly my favorite fragrance, but tolerable.  </li>
            <li> Well, all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> this is exactly what you need to buy, finally after 20 years a product that works</li>
            <li> the first and last jwoww product I will ever use.</li>
            <li> disappointed because it claimed to be the best.</li>
            <li> but like an old pear!</li>
            <li> I tried this when it first came out last fall at my tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Helps my skin get a natural sun tan look vs a burnt look!</li>
            <li> We checked the color, smell, and texture of my lotion compared to their bottles of JWoww One and Done on the shelves and they were exactly the same.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t does smell a bit different than the first one I bought at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like the smell, it is different, but love the bronzer in it!  </li>
            <li> Also, even though I put too much on my first time, I recieved ZERO streaks which is totally rad</li>
            <li> so I have to use more than usual.  </li>
            <li> The backs of my hands finally have some real color!  </li>
            <li> I usually go for the top 2 at the salon.</li>
            <li> Used for the first time today, and I could see almost instant results by the time I got home!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if most of the expired claims are tanning salon owners looking to make a profit, as usual.</li>
            <li> For dramatic results you will need to use more, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> The smell is not my favorite because I like the coconut smelling lotions and this one is like a very strong floral perfume but you don&#x27;t smell bad after tanning.  </li>
            <li> If you typically have used the cheaper tanning lotions than this is A HUGE step up.</li>
            <li> Now, I am extremely dark and this lotion also makes my skin really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The little symbol on the back that shows how long this lotion is good for shows 18 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the positive reviews and I totally agree with them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale and need something powerful to give me a tan</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde with a very red/fair skin tone normally.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overly pleasant, but I am not impressed with any tanning lotion smells this far.</li>
            <li> and it makes your skin silky smooth while making you dark, quickk!</li>
            <li> I recommend this lotion to anyone who wants a rich dark brown tan and it being a bronzer lotion getting into a actual bronzing bed</li>
            <li> It has a tendency to leave you a little orangey rather bronzed looking and most definitely stains the heck out of your hands</li>
            <li> The smell, however, is a little different than most lotions I&#x27;ve used....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find such a nice bronzer that doesn&#x27;t give me the skin sensitivities.</li>
            <li> The lotion came sealed in clear packaging and I also checked the expiration date.</li>
            <li> You can clearly see it is a bronzer.</li>
            <li> Gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m sure it gives great color but didn&#x27;t even want to use it cause it smelled so bad!!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to achieve a level of darkness that they don&#x27;t have the ability to achieve naturally.</li>
            <li> definitely the real thing</li>
            <li> but I feel like it shouldnt completely wash off.</li>
            <li> Helped me establish a natural tan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft coconut/fruity smell, but not an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that this is meant to get you tan fast</li>
            <li> Everyone always like wow</li>
            <li> Maybe it was old.</li>
            <li> I returned to buying on the shelf drug store brands that really work and instantly at 1/2 the cost.</li>
            <li> It also doesnt seem to bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My 23 year old daughter wanted me to order this on Amazon, cheaper than buying in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a deep tan that has help very well.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> And it leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I tan frequently, like, 3 times a week, and I have been for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I seem to be liking it so far</li>
            <li> it is too early to tell for any color yet</li>
            <li> My bottle does not have an expiration date marked on it.</li>
            <li> I work for a tanning salon, and this lotion is by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Last year I used Ed Hardy tanning lotion with bronzers and I had to use it for almost a month to really even see any color results.</li>
            <li> but actually seeing color not so much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate it, but reduced it by about 75-80% compared to others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased lotions at the salon, which I was told would completely eliminate the after tan smell.</li>
            <li> n does make ur skin soft</li>
            <li> The only problem i have with this lotion is the very over powering \\&quot;perfume\\</li>
            <li> and I have seen somewhat of a difference so far.</li>
            <li> Makes you skin soft, but as far as making me tan?</li>
            <li> skinned naturally  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money buying this lotion.</li>
            <li> my skin is completely even.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying in stores, however was near expiration date.</li>
            <li> and I could see my skin getting much darker after only 3 uses.  </li>
            <li> After 3 weeks in a bed ( and I even used it on the beach in the natural sun)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tanned with it probably 10 times recently and haven&#x27;t seen much color.</li>
            <li> It does make me really soft and the smell is citrus-y</li>
            <li> Just enough bronzer to notice but not too much to leave streaks.  </li>
            <li> It has been nearly 9 hours since I tanned</li>
            <li> far as moisturizing goes, that&#x27;s where I found this lotion to be lacking.</li>
            <li> far as the expired bottles go.</li>
            <li> I also got a nice dark tan an its long lasting too!!! 😀</li>
            <li> plus, it&#x27;s not quite as thick as most</li>
            <li> and I get super dark with this lotion.</li>
            <li> I was instantly super dark and it never made me break out or got me itchy.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how dark I got so quickly.</li>
            <li> To be honest I was not expecting to see a dramatic change in the level of my tan.  </li>
            <li> I only use it on my legs and stomach (my hardest places to tan) and there is a significant difference from there and my other areas like arms.</li>
            <li> I literally can only use this particular lotion once a week</li>
            <li> I brought mine to the salon and compared the smell and color to see if they were the same and they exactly the same!</li>
            <li> But definitely not this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think it is an older version but have tried others and go back to this.  </li>
            <li> Just started back up tanning and this is the first lotion I used, three days later</li>
            <li> The next day i noticed my legs had a color to them and not pale like they were getting!!</li>
            <li> I go about two to three times a week until I hit the optimum shade then slow it down to once a week.</li>
            <li> I used this on a Fusion bed (high and low pressure combined).</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, and the seller shipped it in less time than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have a beautiful naturally dark tan in only a few tanning sessions!!!</li>
            <li> The scent is not overwhelming, like a light pear scent.</li>
            <li> The one minor thing to know is that if you put too much on,  it can become streaky.</li>
            <li> I am a very white person, and I went into my normal tanning bed in town</li>
            <li> and last, but not least, 3.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for a great quality, less expensive option.</li>
            <li> I think the color wears off pretty quickly, but it&#x27;s a good lotion to start your base tan!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have used the original JWoww tanning lotion and do currently use the JWoww 50X Black Bronzer.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to new tanners as well as people looking to boost a tan.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how you get so many people confirming that they got the real deal and then 1 out of 100 says it is fake</li>
            <li> I am impatient and I like to see results quickly--</li>
            <li> when you take a shower afterward&#x27;s your money goes right down the drain ...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I would buy it again as I usually never purchase the same lotion twice.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after having gone through two bottle of the Jwoww Black Bronzer Dark Tanning Lotion, which I also love.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep an ear open for new products!</li>
            <li> The initial smell is decent, it smells like fruit mixed with beer..?</li>
            <li> expired 1/14 not sure if this is really new or mixed with other things and sold again because this should have worked better than it has.</li>
            <li> It Does smell amazing tho and it beats the expensive price from tanning salons.</li>
            <li> I got shingles last year and have been struggling to clear up blotches and scars.</li>
            <li> I have only used the lotion two times so far</li>
            <li> Can barely tell I&#x27;ve been tanning after using for a month.</li>
            <li> The bronzer was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far and can already tell a difference in my tan.</li>
            <li> I just started tanning, and have only used it 3 times, so far.</li>
            <li> I tan 3-4 days/week and was fairly dark when I tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> achieve a deep dark golden tan fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What would normally take me several tanning bed visits, only took me two to get noticeably tanner.</li>
            <li> Everything usually makes me orange because I have fair skin, and this amped up my color to what would usually take several weeks to get.</li>
            <li> Not horrible but not great either.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it smelled nice, but I was not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!!</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not really into heavily perfumed lotions, and this one is no exception, although it wasn&#x27;t any more heavily perfumed than 9 out of 10 other tanning lotions, and at least the smell was pleasant.</li>
            <li> I never wash my hands right after applying bronzeror even a few hours after (sometimes), just use those wipes &amp; a papertowel &amp; have never had stains.</li>
            <li> I have used it a couple times, and the first time I tanned for four minutes and literally already has slight color on me afterwards.</li>
            <li> Also, as other reviewers have said, buying this lotion of amazon will save you A LOT of money, tanning salons make a lot of profit on tanning lotion sales and usually triple their wholesale price (aka this is a WAY better deal).</li>
            <li> so I am going to use it every other time I tan until I can decide if it really does have an orange tint.</li>
            <li> I do have to say I don&#x27;t see much of a difference between this and the other one.</li>
            <li> For the price had hoped for more dramatic results.</li>
            <li> No dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super moisturizing and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I did have a little higher expectations with this one.</li>
            <li> I have started getting pretty dark in just a week!</li>
            <li> Product great... disappointed about scent.</li>
            <li> Got me dark fast..</li>
            <li> My whole body is really dark....</li>
            <li> Works really fast dark tan</li>
            <li> I would recommend this tanning lotion to anyone that wants dark, even color.</li>
            <li> all i recommend this lotion to anyone who wants to be dark.</li>
            <li> Left me much darker after one use then other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> Not too sure why some are saying its fake or expired, was the complete opposite for me.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, you can really see the difference in color!</li>
            <li> I think maybe 3 times and had a beautiful base tan started.</li>
            <li> I am a pretty pale person, and started tanning for my senior pictures.</li>
            <li> JWOW Black works so much btter</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel flaky or itchy or dry after but it definitely did not feel moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> Usually tanning lotions with bronzers smell horrible after a tanning session, but I am able to get the bronzing and smell great at the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to more heavily perfumed lotions and the fragrance isn&#x27;t bad for this one but isn&#x27;t strong either.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell much difference from any other tanning lotions I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I am very pale by nature, but tend not to burn as most pale people would.</li>
            <li> but even in high intensity beds I&#x27;m not getting a dark color with this lotion..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it especially since I only have to tan once a week now and still get dark.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing, I was afraid of looking Orange</li>
            <li> I am still fairly new to tanning in a salon - I used Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow lotion, in the past</li>
            <li> I got soo dark after just one use which I was really surprised, cause this lotion is not as dark as the new snooki one!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try out the new Jwoww tanning lotion because of the great reviews but unfortunately was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but seriously after the FIRST use I looked darker!</li>
            <li> Got color on my first session, and i only laid for 10 mins due to my burnt skin from the previous lotions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good  moisturizer, and the smell isn&#x27;t horrible.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t seem to break past a certain peak of my tan.</li>
            <li> The first use I walked out and noticed I was instantly dark, not orange, but a deep dark!</li>
            <li> But I think since these were all produced in 2012 you wont get the same results that previous reviews got considering this lotion is 2 years old.</li>
            <li> So disappointed since I&#x27;ve loved all her products.</li>
            <li> I bought two different lotions at my tanning salon and they went back the very next day due</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other products that were more expensive and they didn&#x27;t seem to give me the color that Jwoww did.  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice color, a tiny bit on the orange side for my taste, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> Pale skin to golden in just a few trips to the bed.</li>
            <li> The effects are a little more exciting if you already have your base tan.</li>
            <li> At least buying from the salon you know you are getting the real thing.</li>
            <li> So I bought this a few weeks ago and got dark fast..</li>
            <li> Try to go as long as you can</li>
            <li> and I totally not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a year long tanner, about 2-3 times a week and like to rotate my bronzers with intensifiers on all level of beds.  </li>
            <li> A LONG WAY AND ALSO</li>
            <li> Get price for how long it lasts and how well it works.</li>
            <li> I had a good base tan I achieved with Label</li>
            <li> I have used it several times now and see only a slight difference.  </li>
            <li> I used the first jwow last year and got really dark like black dark brown dark</li>
            <li> , I am going to try her other lotions in the future.</li>
            <li> Plus the bronze lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to other brands of tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid of trying this out that I might look like an ompa lompa, but it gives a nice color in one tanning session.</li>
            <li> Tan lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I will definitely repurchase this item and pry try out some other J WOWW products.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not completely wowwed!</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s just the same as the other tanning lotions, your just paying for the name brand.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.</li>
            <li> so it doesnt dry out i will be buying this again soon ..</li>
            <li> Put it on then let it dry a bit.  </li>
            <li> So I also tan to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> and I did see a darker difference after a single tanning session.  </li>
            <li> I will never order this again, not sure if it was old or what</li>
            <li> She wanted to get a deep dark tan and this product gave her that tan.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lotion for a month before and I still wasn&#x27;t as dark as I am using JWOWW One and Done only three times.</li>
            <li> The lady then told me that as long as the bottles had not been tampered with or opened, the lotion has a life of 18 months shown by a small image on the back of the bottle that looks like an open container.</li>
            <li> This product truly works if you want a deep dark tan from the tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> I was completely dark after using it only 4 times.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a dark tan after using this lotion and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty annoyed.</li>
            <li> Overall this lotion is not what I expected!!</li>
            <li> It is worth it for the color, but kind of hard to get past the smell.  :(</li>
            <li> It it a ltion that actually makes you dark, and actually requires less visits to the tanning bed because the color stays with you.</li>
            <li> Not as bad as some others, and other people won&#x27;t be able to smell it, but I definitely could.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this product even less stains remain after wiping my inner palms off than with the cheaper products I&#x27;ve used, so</li>
            <li> I personally like the \\&quot;typical smell\\&quot; of tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I have definitely gotten some color but the &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34; title is slightly misleading.</li>
            <li> Once this bottle is gone I will be going back to her black bronzers.</li>
            <li> It was only my 4th time tanning (previously I had not used a lotion this year)</li>
            <li> (Solid Black).  </li>
            <li> Use less of this lotion than prior sun bed lotions.</li>
            <li> ( I was trying to order the Jwowww black, after a co worker expressed her delight) back in June 2014.</li>
            <li> The only part I could complain about is the scent could be toned down a notch, but it&#x27;s really not that intolerable.</li>
            <li> But it definitely didn&#x27;t bronze me or get me dark any faster than any other tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s done a little for my coloring, but definitely not &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The smell is ok, not too bad</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s also not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is light and doesn&#x27;t have a crazy smell to it.  </li>
            <li> disappointing, so I really didn&#x27;t want to purchase a tanning lotion or bronzer that was developed by a company that hired one of the show&#x27;s stars to put her name on their product and endorse it for them.  </li>
            <li> Smells great out of the bottle but has a horrible after smell.</li>
            <li> Everyone else loves it, so it may just be me, but I&#x27;m really not a fan.</li>
            <li> I only had to tan for a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice now (two days in a row) and definitely notice myself being a few shades darker already.</li>
            <li> everyone was raving about how they were the darkest they&#x27;ve ever been after a few uses, and I&#x27;m definitely not.</li>
            <li> I can tell I&#x27;m already a few shades darker even after only a couple of tanning sessions.</li>
            <li> I saw no real bronzing or tanning acceleration with this product at all.</li>
            <li> and I can tell sort of a difference, but not much.</li>
            <li> I noticed the color after using it only a few times.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get as bronzed as i expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy that I paid so much money for this lotion and have gotten no results.  </li>
            <li> (I always have trouble with bronzers, they give me orange stains on my hands or body from not rubbing in my lotion well enough).</li>
            <li> The money she saved buying them on Amazon, was spent for the doctor.</li>
            <li> Just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> and this lotion gave me absolutely no color whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no ATO.</li>
            <li> so dark it didnt take long at all an</li>
            <li> it is As expected.</li>
            <li> and I get the results that I expected after reading about the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much darker.</li>
            <li> Also be careful putting this on your face</li>
            <li> and I have never really tanned in a salon.</li>
            <li> when I got out of the tanning bed, I was syill kinda wet, so</li>
            <li> I really expected to see a difference when tanning.</li>
            <li> far as bronzing, I was actually a bit disappointed when I first got out the bed.</li>
            <li> Yeah i know how nerve racking it can be to find the right tanning lotion,  &amp;&amp; Buying it online does make everyone skeptical.</li>
            <li> so I went tanning again and used the last remains of my Millinum Black Storm lotion (which is half the price of One and Done)</li>
            <li> In only a few sessions, I was really dark.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> smell is a little strange, but it&#x27;s mild.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> yeah, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the smell is very much a deciding on factor with me.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in so you can go about your day without having to go home and shower to get the excess oily stuff off like other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I use this product about every other day when I go to the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t notice the after tanning smell like with other lotions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read the other reviews on this product  which is why I decided to purchase</li>
            <li> I was more than extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I switch up every other bottle.</li>
            <li> have used several other jwoww lotions in the past ..</li>
            <li> One is tingle the other is not.</li>
            <li> According to her this is just what she wanted and at the tanning salon it costs double if not more than what she paid for.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to try something other than tingles.</li>
            <li> That means this lotion is about 6 months past the actual shelf life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other lotions and they don&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> The tan seems to appear quicker compared to using other lotions.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend on the other hand, it wouldn&#x27;t seem to want to rub in at all..</li>
            <li> I just tried a packet of this One and Done this week due to the fact that it&#x27;s yogurt based</li>
            <li> Other reviews said coconut smell, and it smells NOTHING like a coconut or like a yummy tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I usually start tanning this time of year and go for several months in a row.</li>
            <li> I would pick this one over all the other ones she has.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because I wanted to love it.</li>
            <li> There is no funny during the tan smell, out of the bottle smell, after the tan smell, or in the shower smell.</li>
            <li> The way you do with other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> went to the tanning bed ever other day for a month</li>
            <li> Would recommend to other tanners.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work miracles like some of the other reviews said but it works.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using any other lotion</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get me as tan as other lotions</li>
            <li> but if I don&#x27;t get used to the smell, I may have to try other products.</li>
            <li> I would stick with their other products.</li>
            <li> All of JWOWW&#x27;s other lotions, all of Snooki&#x27;s lotions, all of Pauly D&#x27;s lotions - you get the drift.  </li>
            <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t what I expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased lots of other lotions and they have all worked well.</li>
            <li> Especially since its hard for me to tan, being such a pale person.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get as tan as I expected from a \\&quot;black bronzer.\\</li>
            <li> skin was so dry after the few times I used it.  </li>
            <li> The Jwoww products have never let me down as other bronzers have.</li>
            <li> Love it....got darker on my fake n bake ran!!</li>
            <li> I just ran out of mine and I am really sad about it, I actually came on Amazon to read reviews on a few new lotions I wanna buy from my salon to try out...</li>
            <li> (not right when you get out but over an hour or two)</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time tanning.  </li>
            <li> So we just put some of it into an empty, other JWoWW bottle and problem solved!!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it didn&#x27;t seem to be as bad, only noticed a burnt smell when I was finished.  </li>
            <li> It will give you bronze color but do not expect to get dark overnight.</li>
            <li> Buy Dark Star at Walmart for $10</li>
            <li> I get really dark from this lotion too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that I&#x27;ve gotten as dark as the reviews stated I would</li>
            <li> It has got me dark</li>
            <li> I did not know I could get this dark.</li>
            <li> It dos not give a dark tan as described.</li>
            <li> Gets you dark in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t get you dark</li>
            <li> JWoww gets you dark...</li>
            <li> I let this stay on the dark I get by the end of the day..</li>
            <li> It defitnatly gets you dark.</li>
            <li> Makes you really dark....</li>
            <li> also I did look dark but its self Tanner in it.</li>
            <li> If you want to get dark don&#x27;t buy this lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go for the dark dark muddy tan</li>
            <li> this one though gets you really dark.</li>
            <li> One and done you would think I would be really dark</li>
            <li> Gets you dark in 2 sessions.</li>
            <li> You get dark even just with one tan</li>
            <li> i glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> and I am dark, not orange</li>
            <li> and I figured it wasn&#x27;t going to be very moisturizing, but I was wrong..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a dark tan before in my life until using this product.  </li>
            <li> Gets me so dark</li>
            <li> I was sad to find it very sticky after tanning.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I am already wayy dark.</li>
            <li> I am naturally dark completed</li>
            <li> but once I was done tanning and out of the bed I smelled sour.</li>
            <li> I already have a good base but this just takes it up a notch!</li>
            <li> This product is thinner than other lotions I&#x27;ve used (a few samples at salons &amp; a few bottles from Walmart for $10 each) &amp; at first glance it would make me assume this product might be fake, but in all honesty it spread&#x27;s easier &amp; doesn&#x27;t cake on.</li>
            <li> reason for two stars instead of one.&lt;br /&gt;But pours out like watered down lotion.  </li>
            <li> of people say don&#x27;t buy lotion online because they water it down, etc.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get as dark with this lotion as you do with jwoww&#x27;s black bronzers.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m an avid tanner, just as the product promises, you DO get dark after just one tan!!!!!!</li>
            <li> (my stomache looks almost black</li>
            <li> but my face arms legs &amp; neck look half that tan).</li>
            <li> I think that is odd.</li>
            <li> I see a SLIGHT tint of orange</li>
            <li> As stated in previous reviewed the lotion I got was expired.</li>
            <li> Black</li>
            <li> Amazon charges less than $25.</li>
            <li> I saw slight results after just one tanning session.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used JWOWW Black bronzer.</li>
            <li> Once a week and then a less bronzing lotion the rest of the week.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;bronzers&amp;#34; do nothing and the DHA does less.</li>
            <li> uses/tanning sessions with the previous lotion I used.</li>
            <li> and I will be sticking to Black Storm.</li>
            <li> were i tan at its over 100 dollars an from amazon its less than 30</li>
            <li> I am going to order the Designer Skin BLACK 20x .....</li>
            <li> Although it claims to have the odor inhibitors I still had a slight immediate after-tan odor which did go away within about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I paid HALF of what my salon was asking.  </li>
            <li> I am not a super fan, but it does its job.</li>
            <li> I was using the black jwoww lotion</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the name think your going to turn black, I promise you won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have cut my trips to the salon in half</li>
            <li> I have the cheeky bronzer made by Australlian Gold and paid half the price.  </li>
            <li> her black bronzer.. does not make you orange either</li>
            <li> I read previous reviews in which people stated that they didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> It was half of what I would have paid at the salon.</li>
            <li> Advance Black Bronzer here at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month and a half</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment !</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin silly smooth thanks to the yogurt base.</li>
            <li> so I figured I would try it due to the yogurt base, light scent, and</li>
            <li> The only down is that the smell is not great..</li>
            <li> and I took a couples weeks off because of how dark I got!</li>
            <li> Just a little bit will do.</li>
            <li> but it does smell a little burnt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not read any other reviews of this product, so I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else has had a reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I was either going to buy Mad Hot Tingle by jwoww or One and Done.</li>
            <li> I found I had to rub it in for a little longer, but it did the trick..</li>
            <li> Yes, men tend to be a little thicker skinned, so I would not recommend this for a man..</li>
            <li> and my friends and coworkers have noticed that I&#x27;m getting dark!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for over 10 years and never used a lotion that got me so dark!</li>
            <li> I notice it a little in my hair, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> WITH A LITTLE GOES</li>
            <li> I wish the tint was a little darker and not as runny.</li>
            <li> It smells a little funky not my idea of a pear scent</li>
            <li> I have used her other lotions in the past and they work well too,</li>
            <li> lookin dark!</li>
            <li> It has helped me get a dark tan &amp; the smell is wondeful!</li>
            <li> Not worth what you pay!</li>
            <li> I may try something with a little bit darker bronzer</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to take me a little darker using the lowest bed at the salon.</li>
            <li> I am sooo dark just after 4 days!</li>
            <li> The smell is a little overpowering.  </li>
            <li> You had to start using it tight away , few weeks till expired so</li>
            <li> The smell of JWOWW is not very appealing - it smells like champagne.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very dark.</li>
            <li> I was VERY DARK.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to go on very dark.</li>
            <li> Very dark after just a few applications.  </li>
            <li> I just notice a little color with this lotion, i started using this when i was pale</li>
            <li> I really wished this one was real :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> The smell is artificial smelling but it does provide intense bronzing.  </li>
            <li> , I noticed I was getting tanner in just a few days of laying</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money with them when you can get it here for a way cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for 4 days</li>
            <li> I am a year round tanner</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago and it does not work.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money$$ on this jwoww lotion</li>
            <li> I got a tan in a few sessions and no burns</li>
            <li> Waste of money..</li>
            <li> I was told by a few friends to try this lotion</li>
            <li> It takes a few times to get a tan from it.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out either.</li>
            <li> Never will I waste almost 30 dollars online Again.</li>
            <li> SHe had an amzing tan in just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I was a few days over the 30 day refund policy</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan everyday</li>
            <li> U lose it if not used everyday.</li>
            <li> I have worked in a tanning salon for a few years and I have tried about every lotion under the sun.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It will help you if your pale but it wont get you very dark.</li>
            <li> Received my lotion and expired year and half ago !</li>
            <li> but I just like look darkness from insanely Black !</li>
            <li> It Black for the past 5-6 weeks</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really pale</li>
            <li> i am so pale</li>
            <li> guys was pale tan and</li>
            <li> Deep dark tan that does not look fake.</li>
            <li> I have tried other tanning lotions in the past (Masquerade, Spellbound) and they don&#x27;t compare to this one!</li>
            <li> I had run out of the Millenium Solid Black 100x and got bored of that scent.  </li>
            <li> Smells pretty bad after as well.</li>
            <li> hate trying to cup watery lotion in my hand and quickly rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> and this helped me past that peek where you can&#x27;t get any darker.</li>
            <li> i have bout this line in the past and i will continue</li>
            <li> Has a weird, alcohol-based smell and never gave me a truly deep tan like I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I usually burn when I lay but haven&#x27;t burned once since using this.</li>
            <li> not sure to give it 3 stars or 4</li>
            <li> it gave me a base tan but for someone that likes a dark tan, fast, this wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not my favorite lotion of hers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few months now and no problems!</li>
            <li> Not sure what the 7 is for though...</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to feel about this lotion being expired.</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t tan..</li>
            <li> I am not sure how i feel about product...</li>
            <li> The smell is fruity but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Not sure how legit it is buying if offline...</li>
            <li> I usually burn.</li>
            <li> I usually use Kardashian brand lotion but someone recommended this one</li>
            <li> I went 4 times in a week as opposed to my usually twice a week routine, and friends started to ask if I had vacationed to the Bahamas or something.</li>
            <li> The after smell is not exactly grand</li>
            <li> when I did it irritated the skin on just my face for some reason, I am not sure why I had this reaction  </li>
            <li> And usually the answer is no</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it has in it or even if that&#x27;s one of the things that makes this lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale and have a hard time getting color, so if you&#x27;re like me</li>
            <li> I was really pale and WA-LAH!</li>
            <li> my local tanning salon sells it for $68!&lt;br /&gt;It did not have a negative effect on my face, which is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;No weird marks where you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> I am very pale and am hard to tan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to leave streaks so to me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to ignore.</li>
            <li> The two things I do want to say are, don&#x27;t put this close to your eyes, it runs when you sweat, and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to absorb into the skin..</li>
            <li> I am hard to tan but jus after 1 week</li>
            <li> I think I look at least a shade darker before I even get into the bed.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was the scent.</li>
            <li> At least I don&#x27;t smell like a coconut.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t in at least a week.)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just made to give you a base tan fast.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t thick it pour out like milk, didnt get any color.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this lotion because I have use dither original JWOWW</li>
            <li> ; feel if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> smell is not overwhelming either!</li>
            <li> Not sure if the bottle is bad from the seller or if it&#x27;s the actual product</li>
            <li> But I seriously am in love!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> They charge you a ridiculous price through the tanning booth stores, so I recommend purchasing them through this.</li>
            <li> but they were charging ridiculous prices</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical buying this lotion after reading some of the reviews, but for the price I figured I would try it out.</li>
            <li> I was left extemly streaky, almost like I had a bad spray on tan.  </li>
            <li> No results and no good smell.</li>
            <li> was no good</li>
            <li> At least 2 shades darker!  </li>
            <li> This product sucks!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any streaking, not orange, nothing negative to say at  all!</li>
            <li> I could tell my skin was at least one shade darker with just one use!</li>
            <li> Its sticky and thick!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BAD DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> BADLY after tanning though, so showering is a must.&lt;br /&gt;definitely not what I expected</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> The lotion  is so thin and doesn&#x27;t give me a \\&quot;caked and faked\\</li>
            <li> Not happy about that</li>
            <li> Not a great bronzer.</li>
            <li> Not happy that this lotion expired in February yet</li>
            <li> Not happy with it.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get a rip-off lotion</li>
            <li> Received outdated bottle.</li>
            <li> And I have used other lotions that when done tanning you didnt smell that bad.</li>
            <li> This is not for the faint of heart, this is a serious bronzer.</li>
            <li> The smell is decent, and does not have an awful overpowering burnt smell after tanning.</li>
            <li> all worthless a waste of my hard working money</li>
            <li> I used it once and saw a dramatic tan:)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed the dramatic results like others have.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed so far</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell terrible and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s confusing!!</li>
            <li> and I found it online for at least 25$ cheaper!!</li>
            <li> YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE STUPID TO BUY THIS LOTION AT THE SALON WHEN YOU GET IT ON AMAZON FOR HALF THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> I think that it is way to expensive to buy it at the salon</li>
            <li> I think this lotion is a fake.</li>
            <li> I think I may have started to have that fake tan look.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave weird streaks.  </li>
            <li> Have tried different lotions and this is one of the worst</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I am wary of buying things like lotion online.</li>
            <li> lotion is weird the textures off and it smells</li>
            <li> And it still has yet to fail me.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I will not be using this lotion anymore</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel weird</li>
            <li> but I am a bit skeptical..</li>
            <li> so I know it wasn&#x27;t replaced with fake lotion.</li>
            <li> The product is a fake.</li>
            <li> This lotion has to be fake...</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be sad when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different lotios and they either smelled horrible or I didn&#x27;t like the way they worked!</li>
            <li> This lotion was expired by several months, very disappointed because I paid $25.00!</li>
            <li> i bought this in hopes of the &#x27;one and done&#x27; idea (i know silly.)</li>
            <li> An there was nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> It is expensive if you buy it from say Ulta, but look on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s not good, either.</li>
            <li> I was very pale before and was not using a tanning bed at all, and now, voila!!!</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t too bad either, sometimes tanning lotions can leave behind a yucky smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed I wasted money buying this product.</li>
            <li> Stinks.</li>
            <li> Shippingamount was crazy.</li>
            <li> It stinks and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I thought I was crazy, but my husband agreed with me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not too crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> BUT it is very thick and sticky!!</li>
            <li> (I worked in a tanning salon and have heard a lot of bad experiences with buying online), I tried it out at the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about smells and this one doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell after tanning.  </li>
            <li> BAD JW0WW</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> how badly i got burnt up, they were both designer skin products.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, but thats bad for business.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a bad tanning smell or anything</li>
            <li> I like it and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> Now, I will say, I don&#x27;t think the lotion itself is bad</li>
            <li> and I literally shocked my friends when i came</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed, and I am going to try to return it.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> this product says &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34; I have yet to see any results as product says, wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product either:(</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t fall for that crap anymore.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell..</li>
            <li> but I do have a base tan.</li>
            <li> The bronzing works well and the smell doesn&#x27;t leave the funky after tanning smell I hate.  </li>
            <li> I hate feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> I already have a base tan and you can still see a color difference with every use.</li>
            <li> I bought this because people rant and rave about the yogurt base.  </li>
            <li> It has a yogurt base.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My sister and I both order this tanning lotion and were both very disappointed neither of us saw a difference between using this and not using a lotion at all.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so bad!!!</li>
            <li> Worst sun tanning location I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t horrible.</li>
            <li> it smell&#x27;s bad !!!</li>
            <li> Horrible lotion.</li>
            <li> smells awful before and after tan.</li>
            <li> I find the smell horrible.  </li>
            <li> and I had a horrible smell that to me smelled like &amp;#34;beer&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Smells awful!!</li>
            <li> I get a horrible rash from it!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works amazing! Love it!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my two cents on what most of the other reviews mention:&lt;br /&gt;1. This product is thinner than other lotions I&#x27;ve used (a few samples at salons &amp; a few bottles from Walmart for $10 each) &amp; at first glance it would make me assume this product might be fake, but in all honesty it spread&#x27;s easier &amp; doesn&#x27;t cake on. It&#x27;s really hard to leave streaks so to me the fact it&#x27;s thinner &amp; a wee bit &amp;#34;runnier&amp;#34; (but does NOT drip) makes it seem more professional.&lt;br /&gt;2. The smell is AMAZING. It does smell berry like &amp; NO AFTER TANNING SMELL! If you typically have used the cheaper tanning lotions than this is A HUGE step up. It does not leave you with that &amp;#34;after tan&amp;#34; Ew feeling at all! I&#x27;m very pleased by this because I didn&#x27;t think this product could take that yucky Ew feeling away 100% but it did!! Ahh!! Yay!&lt;br /&gt;3. I noticed a difference after tanning but nothing too huge! However it&#x27;s only been about 2hrs so the fact I can already tell a difference is awesome. I wouldn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34; but definitely the closes thing to it out there! Like I keep saying, a huge step up from the cheapo stuff! I&#x27;m glad I ordered to try it, I might buy it again however I do want to try a few other brands as well just to see what works best for me (my stomache looks almost black but my face arms legs &amp; neck look half that tan). I reccomend though for sure! Can&#x27;t beat the $30 price especially if you&#x27;re willing to spend a little more than what you usually spend for a better product with quick results &amp; a great feeling afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;** about the bronzer staining your hands: I take makeup wipes into the tanning room to wipe my makeup off before tanning &amp; use a makeup wipe to wipe my hands off &amp; then one of the dispensable paper towels my salon provides to QUICKLY wipe my hands of any excess bronzer (my salon has only 3 minutes before the bed auto turns on so I&#x27;m always in a hurry with my pre tanning process lol). I never wash my hands right after applying bronzeror even a few hours after (sometimes), just use those wipes &amp; a papertowel &amp; have never had stains. With this product even less stains remain after wiping my inner palms off than with the cheaper products I&#x27;ve used, so another A+ plus for that!</li>
            <li> I love it. It wasn&#x27;t the first time I used it and it won&#x27;t be the last</li>
            <li> It makes you darker but definitely not as advertised. It will give you bronze color but do not expect to get dark overnight. It will take time. I had a good base tan I achieved with Label Me Beautiful and this JWOWW One and Done did not seem to get me much darker yet. I will use up the bottle and probably move on to better lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and freckle when tanning. This product gave me a beautiful golden color that I&#x27;ve been looking for. It took about 5 sessions. Apply evenly so it doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> My wife saw this last year where she tans. It was $60 then. Got this for a fraction of the price. Works great. Deep dark tan that does not look fake.</li>
            <li> Makes my tan last and gives me a wonderful bronze tan.  No smell at all which is noce not to smell like a coconut every time you tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this lotion twice, and can already tell a difference in my color! It really moisturizes my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I went from &amp;#34;Smile You&#x27;re Darker&amp;#34;, which is pretty cheap lotion, to this. But I seriously am in love!&lt;br /&gt;And if you don&#x27;t order this off Amazon &amp; buy it in the store its over 80 dollars!&lt;br /&gt;Why pay more for the same thing?!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the smell. Everyone else loves it, so it may just be me, but I&#x27;m really not a fan. But I&#x27;d rather not like the smell to be tan. :)</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. I had a pretty nice tan before I bought this, and I definitely noticed a difference with just one use! I recommend this lotion to anyone wanting that instant tan! They call it One and Done for a reason :)</li>
            <li> I was expecting so awesome bronzing action from this lotion. Not so much.. It smell great and does tan but not like the bottle says it well.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It gets me a nice color (not orange at all) pretty quickly...and it doesn&#x27;t stink (before, during, or AFTER the tanning process).  My skin feels awesome and stays moisturized!</li>
            <li> I get GREAT color with this product and I tan faster with it too!</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best lotion I&#x27;ve used. Smells great, keeps you moisturized, and gives you a beautiful color. At salons it sells for $70 or higher; It&#x27;s definitely a steal on here. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I was expecting so much more from such an expensive lotion.  No noticeable results, skin feels kinda slimy and the smell is nit the greatest....</li>
            <li> I LOVED this lotion! It was definitely worth the purchase; since Amazon is a lot cheaper then my tanning salon. I will be using Amazon for all my lotions! This was a great bronzer, and has a good smell&lt;br /&gt;. Gave me a wonderful glow that was natural and not &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;. If you&#x27;re looking for a great bronzer; this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> Just started using...nice scent, and good color in first three tans!</li>
            <li> Love it! Works well and fast two thumbs up :)</li>
            <li> Good lotion, I have only used it twice and have noticeable results.  The smell is ok, not too bad not too great right in the middle when I compare to others.  I feel like it is the real deal, my lotion arrived sealed did not appear to have been opened smells like it should and works like it should.  I don&#x27;t know how you get so many people confirming that they got the real deal and then 1 out of 100 says it is fake I think that is odd. I believe majority rules on this one.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing for you if you are already tan! Shipper was great to issue a prompt return but the product itself is just not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Ive used many different lotions and this is my favorite. The smell is a perfumy smell, doesn&#x27;t stink after tanning. Noticeabley darker hours after. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either. I&#x27;ve bougyht this a couple times on amazon and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Just started tanning again and this lotion smells so good. It doesn&#x27;t leave you orange or give you streaks, I noticed I was getting tanner in just a few days of laying</li>
            <li> Most tanning/bronzing lotions don&#x27;t show results right after using them but this one definitely does! For people as white as I am, that&#x27;s a miracle! Lol It&#x27;s not greasy or smelly like most tanning lotions. This one smells and feels like normal lotion. It soaks in so you can go about your day without having to go home and shower to get the excess oily stuff off like other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> This product provides great color fast, price is cheaper than any tanning shop. Shipping was quick. Have recommend this site to my friends.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the New Jwoww Tanning Lotion.  I was able to get it through Amazon for half the price that it would have cost me at my tanning salon.  Great deal!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff overall. I love love love the smell of it and the overall feeling of it on my skin. No weird after tanning smell either! It does make you darker as it says. I think that it is way to expensive to buy it at the salon and i would only buy it on amazon for this price. I&#x27;d say that its way better than the private reserve jwow 50x bronzing lotion too.</li>
            <li> I love this does not leaves marks makes you dark fast, it leaves nice smell not sticky, was alot cheaper then buying a salon</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have used the original JWoww tanning lotion and do currently use the JWoww 50X Black Bronzer. Web both love it, but one of our two bottles was getting low so I decided to order this newer One and Done lotion to try out. I am SO glad I did! I have tanned just 3 times, the first two using the 50X Bronzer and then the 3rd with the One and Done and I am very noticeably tanner just after one use. The smell is fantastic, flowery. It smells very strong when you first put it on, but once soaked into your skin it is much more tame. Because this lotion smells more \\&quot;girly\\&quot; than the 50X Black Bronzer lotion, I won&#x27;t be able to share it with my husband, but I&#x27;m okay with that! ;) I highly recommend the JWoww line of tanning lotions!</li>
            <li> This lotion feels great on the skin, delivers fast results and smells good to boot. Love it... Will buy JWoww products again.</li>
            <li> Beats those tan shop prices anytime. Don&#x27;t waste money with them when you can get it here for a way cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I have only used the lotion two times so far and I can tell a pretty big change in my level of darkness. I see a SLIGHT tint of orange so I am going to use it every other time I tan until I can decide if it really does have an orange tint. For only using it two times I really love the color I got so far. I have decently good tanning skin in itself, but I like a little help. The smell is also not bad at all!! I think its a nice fruity left over smell, but it is pretty slimy after. I would definitely recommend showering right after you tan!</li>
            <li> SOOO MUCH better than spending four times the price at the salon. This worked right away, after a couple tans I was asked if I had just come back from vacation! I have medium skin and tan easily, If I burn, it turns tan within 24-48 hours. Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Smells SO good! I was always so excited to go tan and put on this delectable smelling lotion, one and done. Plus i love Jwoww, she is awesome. All around great product.</li>
            <li> JWOW Black works so much btter</li>
            <li> Not the best tanning lotion ive ever used. It smells okay when you first put it on but after using the tanning bed it makes your skin smell like warm cheese. I would immediately shower after using this product.</li>
            <li> use it indoors and out - wouldnt suggest for the fair skin. My daughter turned me onto this and she always looks&lt;br /&gt;dark after her tanning sessions</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, and the seller shipped it in less time than I expected. A very good buy.  Tanning salons sell this way over priced.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this product so much! I wanted to buy this at the tanning salon I go to but it was a hundred dollars after tax! My best friend works at a tanning salon and with her employee discount she paid over fifty dollars for it! I received this in a matter of DAYS!!!! So happy with this purchase! I will always be ordering my tanning products from this company! The lotion works wonders! I only had to tan for a few days and I took a couples weeks off because of how dark I got! It is GREAT!!! Definitely a five star product and a five star company!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month and I really enjoy it. The smell is good, not too strong. The lotion seems to have a \\&quot;tint\\&quot; of color in it that helps you instantly feel darker, but it does not make you orange or a gross color at all! I love JWoWW tanning products and I have used quite a few of them but this, so far, is my favorite!! Love it, would definitely recommend it to anyone! I actually just purchased another bottle!! On a side note, my husband loves and uses it too but is too embarrassed to walk in with it, haha! So we just put some of it into an empty, other JWoWW bottle and problem solved!!</li>
            <li> I use this product about every other day when I go to the tanning bed. It has a nice smell, and the good smell stays with you. It it a ltion that actually makes you dark, and actually requires less visits to the tanning bed because the color stays with you. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone who loves to save a quick buck. If you&#x27;re going to go tanning at a tanning booth, order this through Amazon. They charge you a ridiculous price through the tanning booth stores, so I recommend purchasing them through this. Why not 5 stars you ask? You have to rub in the product to get the full effect or other wise it will leave your tan uneven. I had better lotion in the past that I used, but this one just smelled much better.</li>
            <li> They sent an expired bottle but it still works great! I got a really good tan.</li>
            <li> As stated in previous reviewed the lotion I got was expired. BUT for the price, I guess i figured there would be some sort of catch. It was almost 1/3 the price the salon was selling it for. I&#x27;m still using it because it&#x27;s better than no tanning lotion. I haven&#x27;t had any side effects yet.&lt;br /&gt;Just a word of caution for some....</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical buying this lotion after reading some of the reviews, but for the price I figured I would try it out. I&#x27;ve used it twice now (two days in a row) and definitely notice myself being a few shades darker already. Lotion goes on very smoothly, and the smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as some of the reviewers said. My favorite part about this lotion was how soft and smooth it made my skin feel. I didn&#x27;t feel oily at all afterwards. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This lotion is legit! It feels really nice going on and doesnt leave the feel of tanning after. I had a problem with shipping but was handled and shipped to me the next day! Smells really good and makes my skin baby soft anfter showering, so when they said it has moisterizers in it they aren&#x27;t lying. Would definitely recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for 4 days and Im for sure seeing a beautiful color! Five stars! :D</li>
            <li> definitely the real thing and you really do see results after one use</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!! Wonderful product with excellent shipping time!</li>
            <li> read other reviews to make sure this wasn&#x27;t a knock-off, and think I got one. everyone was raving about how they were the darkest they&#x27;ve ever been after a few uses, and I&#x27;m definitely not. It&#x27;s an ok lotion, whatever I got. I do smell.. BADLY after tanning though, so showering is a must.&lt;br /&gt;definitely not what I expected</li>
            <li> Got the product on time and it is working very well. Seems to produce a darker, longer tan.  Will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite JWoww tanning lotion. What I love most is that it leaves your skin not only soft but smelling very good.  This is the second bottle I buy of this specific lotion.  I&#x27;ve tried all of JWoww&#x27;s tanning lotions and they&#x27;re all amazing. Her brand is all I ever buy.  I highly recommend all her products but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo glad I came across this lotion!! I used it once and saw a dramatic tan:)&lt;br /&gt;I used it a second time &amp; it looks like I was on vacation. Love this product. No after tan smell. I smell awesome afterwards ;) I will buy this again and again. I have been raving about this lotion to all my girl friends. Awesome buy here ladies!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion. I think I look at least a shade darker before I even get into the bed. Smooths on nicely (although it is much thinner than the Australian Gold Fierce D-fense lotion I was using before). It smells kind of like a berry pear or something. Definitely recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s called One &amp; Done for a reason! I love it! Tonight was my first time using it, I can already tell I&#x27;m darker and I was complimented at the gym on how good I smelled! I will be ordering from the JWOWW line from now on! :)</li>
            <li> Smells good im getting pretty tan but im not too sure if it was from my bed upgrade or from the lotion</li>
            <li> Works great, gives me a even natural tan. Love it.</li>
            <li> Gives color with two tanning sessions</li>
            <li> The smell is great and the product is an amazingly reasonable price. Works great, and the lotion is perfect quality, will order again!</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion was tannest I&#x27;ve ever been within a week of using it very happy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the wedding white bronzer, but this just seems to have a better fragrance and post tanning scent. Recommend.</li>
            <li> No complaints. It&#x27;s a good lotion and definitely helps with the tanning process. Wish it smelt better like the other JWOWW items.</li>
            <li> This is the second JWoww tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried. JWoww&#x27;s lotions consistently provide great color, but you have to apply them perfectly or you may see streaking. The scent on this one is okay, it&#x27;s not my favorite, but it leaves you with very little ATO, which is nice.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I can tell I&#x27;m already a few shades darker even after only a couple of tanning sessions. Well worth the money. This is the cheapest I&#x27;ve seen it too.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon, so I have tried my share of tanning lotions. Our salon has a lot of expensive lotions, and this one is one of the more fair priced--But it is the best tanning lotion I have ever used! You smell amazing after your tanning session, and you see results immediately! I just ran out of mine and I am really sad about it, I actually came on Amazon to read reviews on a few new lotions I wanna buy from my salon to try out... But honestly I think I am just going to purchase One and Done again! You will not be disappointed. Suitable for all skin types!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with how well this worked!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned with blonde hair and do not tan easily. I have been using Paint it Black 100X tanning and Matahari Dark Sexy legs and love them both. My mistake for listening to a friend at the gym that recommended this product and straying from what I know works. It does have a great smell and texture but that is it. I saw no real bronzing or tanning acceleration with this product at all. As a plain lotion I am sure it is fine but if you want to tan I do not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> I do not know how I feel about this lotion. It smells better than most lotions, but be sure you rub it in good and wash your hands. I had an orange spot on my ankle and wrist. But it def makes you tanner, I am going to try her other lotions in the future.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying the lotion. It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks. The one thing I wasn&#x27;t really a fan about was the smell. It&#x27;s hard to ignore. Other than that, it gives me great color!</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion with DHA instant color !!</li>
            <li> Received my lotion and expired year and half ago ! Not happy</li>
            <li> Just like salon stuff. But I don&#x27;t fall for that crap anymore. Buy Dark Star at Walmart for $10 and I&#x27;m very dark. Even get comments.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this JWoww lotion. My salon charges $70! Amazon charges less than $25. Its a no brainer to me. It always seems to be the genuine product and this works great to give me a base bronze. I am really fair skinned so it helps to have a lotion with bronzer. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering on this lotion either which is great. It is smooth and smells tropical with the texture of yogurt. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think this tanning lotion really works well. It definitely increased the amount of tan I got from a 20 min bed each time I went. Smell isn&#x27;t too bad either, sometimes tanning lotions can leave behind a yucky smell. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Shipping was within promised time. This tanning lotion works better than any other I&#x27;ve ever used before. Scent is good, but not over powering, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky or greasy feeling. Just nice and soft. I&#x27;d recomend it to anyone who tans and also recomend this seller. :)</li>
            <li> I think this lotion is a fake. Mine doesn&#x27;t even have an expiration date. Stinks. Really runny. Doesn&#x27;t bronze. Can barely tell I&#x27;ve been tanning after using for a month.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it have had much better tanning results from other lotions</li>
            <li> This is the legit JWOW lotion. Smells so good and there&#x27;s no after tan smell. The scent is not overwhelming, like a light pear scent. I get really dark from this lotion too.</li>
            <li> Works great !!!!!!!! You can tell a difference the first time you use it !!!!</li>
            <li> You had to start using it tight away , few weeks till expired so I felt as if I didn&#x27;t have enough time to use product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works amazing in and out of a tanning bed. Smells tood and leaves skin feeling silky smooth. Definitely recommend for some looking for a nice bronze tan.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion. I am a year round tanner and this helped me past that peek where you can&#x27;t get any darker. It smells really good too.</li>
            <li> Always have good luck with this one. No streaks or spots. Don&#x27;t make you turn funny shades just the right amount of bronzes</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  Smells great, goes on smooth and leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I had been tanning awhile before using this one and I had used last years version of the gold packaged Jwoww and like that one.. Just didnt seem to do much more than the other one I used. Its OK</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion, it does get you dark. But I feel like when you take a shower it washes off. I know it&#x27;s a bronzer and it does its job but I feel like it shouldnt completely wash off. I plan on trying a few other lotions to see which one works best, so there is a possibility I might come back to this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It give you lots of color in a very short time . The smell is not bad . This is all I use.</li>
            <li> Love it! I am extremely fair skinned and I get super dark with this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of lotions and I keep coming back to this one. It gives a more natural color and maintains my tan better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> expired. And didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I have  been using this product all over my body and it works so great! The lotion  is so thin and doesn&#x27;t give me a \\&quot;caked and faked\\&quot; feeling like others do. It really holds my tan in I used to just get red then back to white now it looks like a deeper tan I love it</li>
            <li> I saw slight results after just one tanning session. Smells great! I would definitely recommend to new tanners as well as people looking to boost a tan.</li>
            <li> The lotion was average, but for that price its a good deal. However, I wont be purchasing it again I will rather spend a few more dollars on a better product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, you tan pretty fast with this lotion. The only thing was about after a month of using it I think I may have started to have that fake tan look. But that was just what one person said. Overall its good!</li>
            <li> A good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t stink! Not sure if it works as a good bronzer. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this! Feels amazing, I was afraid of looking Orange but it definitely gives a nice golden natural tan</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, this is my second year with it. The effects are a little more exciting if you already have your base tan. I&#x27;m just not starting to notice my beginning glow.</li>
            <li> Did not like at all. Did not tan well. And was expired when I received by four months</li>
            <li> This lotion has gotten me the darkest that I have been in a while.  I love lotions with bronzers and this one works great and it doesn&#x27;t leave weird streaks.  The smell is not my favorite because I like the coconut smelling lotions and this one is like a very strong floral perfume but you don&#x27;t smell bad after tanning.  I will definitely be buying this lotion again.  Such a great price!</li>
            <li> For the price had hoped for more dramatic results. Can&#x27;t say it impressed me with the quality of the bronzing ability or the smell</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago and it does not work. Didn&#x27;t see any difference.  Have tried different lotions and this is one of the worst I will not buy this again that&#x27;s for sure. The paint it black lotions I have found work the best so far so I would not recommend this at all don&#x27;t waste your money$$ on this jwoww lotion</li>
            <li> love this product it really works great !!  i have bout this line in the past and i will continue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used JWOWW Black bronzer. I tried this one and I can tell sort of a difference, but not much. It certainly does not smell good but it does not leave you orange. I will buy again... this is a cheap alternative vs. paying $70 in a salon. I don&#x27;t think the date matters when they expire honestly. I&#x27;ve tanned over 6 years ATLEAST 3 times a week.. I&#x27;ve probably reached my max tan anyways :) I&#x27;ve always bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love JWOWW tanning lotion. i tan a lot and i always try to buy good lotion. it made me very dark and it smelled good too</li>
            <li> It pained me buying anything from the Jersey Shore people, but this tanning lotion really works.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling gross. I got a tan in a few sessions and no burns</li>
            <li> It is a very nice product that seems to enhance my tanning quite a bit.  It has a nice fragrance also.  I will get it again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that I&#x27;ve gotten as dark as the reviews stated I would but I like the product!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so bad!!! Like rotten pears it does get you tan fat! Abd make sure you&#x27;re wrote between your fingers our they will be orange.</li>
            <li> works great! I can definitely tell a difference when I use this. I look tanner and it helps give an even color all over! Its the perfect consistency- its not too creamy but spreads nicely. Just a little bit will do. And the fragrance is perfect.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t as great as i had hoped. i have found better lotions.</li>
            <li> Great product! Delivered at excpected time</li>
            <li> Really great lotion! One of the best with fast results and no fake bronzer look. Plus the bronze lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> Excellent tanning lotion. Love the smell of this lotion. Works great in the tanning beds. I would recommend this item</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff, It is great!!</li>
            <li> I use this in my tanning bed, and I saw a difference the first time.  Used it at the pool because it smells great!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for instant color this is the lotion to buy. Pale skin to golden in just a few trips to the bed. Absolutely love it. And amazons price is the best around. Don&#x27;t buy at a salon.</li>
            <li> Out of all my lotions, this one is the only bottle mostly full. Better used mixed with any other lotion.  Hate the smell..very gritty feel to it.  I use it when my color needs the splash of bronze/orange...Wouldn&#x27;t use more than once a week if you wanted a more natural looking tan.  Now the new Jwoww 2014 is much better..smell and all but, not my favorite lotions by far.</li>
            <li> I love all the jwow products! I have used them all and alternate between them to obtain the best result. I have used a lot if lotions but I don&#x27;t see me using another unless they come out with something even better!!</li>
            <li> Worst sun tanning location I have ever purchased. I will never buy this product again. Waste of money.. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> I NEVER do online reviews, but I just bought this product about 30 minutes ago and it&#x27;s amazing! I needed something different so I figured I would try it due to the yogurt base, light scent, and the sales girl said it would leave me brown and not orange. Man was she right! Everything usually makes me orange because I have fair skin, and this amped up my color to what would usually take several weeks to get. Amazing product. I will definitely keep an ear open for new products!</li>
            <li> Loved this product...and price!!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I am wary of buying things like lotion online. But, after I bought a $130 lotion from a salon that ended up not working like I thought it would, I decided to give it a try. I have heard a lot of good things about the Jwoww line and wanted to try it out. The lotion came sealed in clear packaging and I also checked the expiration date. When I was sure that it had not been tampered with in some way (I worked in a tanning salon and have heard a lot of bad experiences with buying online), I tried it out at the salon. I love it. It smells great (nice and fruity) and doesn&#x27;t leave me with a greasy feel like some lotions do It went on nice and smooth and I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot. A little bit goes a long way. I saw color within an hour of getting out of the tanning bed. It was 1/4 of the price it would have been in a salon. Time will tell if the color lasts though. All in all, I am happy with this purchase and will be looking to this seller in the future for more product!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! It smells good before and after you tan. It has helped me get a darker tan as well!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tanning lotion if you wish to get dark fast! I was as white as they come and I saw results after the first use which was impressive to me. It has got me dark and I&#x27;ve been tanning for a month now. I do think I will switch to somethig that will intensify my tan even more but this has defiantly done what I wanted to do.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!! I have tired many lotions and this is the best one so far. I am not super fair skin but would still be considered fair skin. My tan looks really great and natural. I did not know I could get this dark. I am not to excited about the smell but it isn&#x27;t horrible. If you want a great dark tan that last a long time I would recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I was told by a few friends to try this lotion and I&#x27;m so happy I did! I was really pale and WA-LAH! Not even a week of tanning and I am getting some color. The smell has a nice scent and isn&#x27;t too strong. I would recommend this tanning lotion to anyone!</li>
            <li> Not nearly as bad as the JWOWW wedding white, but not as good as some other products out there. Has a weird, alcohol-based smell and never gave me a truly deep tan like I was looking for. I&#x27;m pretty pale and need something powerful to give me a tan and this didn&#x27;t quite do it for me.</li>
            <li> I really Loved this lotion, you get a good tan with this after the first time.I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> when you take a shower afterward&#x27;s your money goes right down the drain ... never buy again ... it smell&#x27;s bad !!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this tanning lotion. Thanks JWOWW and Amazon! I have fair skin and still manage to get a fairly good tan with this...</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, smells so good, bronzing and cheaper than the salons !! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion!! I am a natural blonde with a very red/fair skin tone normally. I bought this after reading the positive reviews and I totally agree with them! I noticed a difference after one use and a HUGE difference after about the third use. I only use it on my legs and stomach (my hardest places to tan) and there is a significant difference from there and my other areas like arms. The only con I would say is the smell.I personally like the \\&quot;typical smell\\&quot; of tanning lotion but this isn&#x27;t really \\&quot;typical.\\&quot; It&#x27;s more burnt alcohol smell? Not horrible but not great either. But the smell isn&#x27;t enough to change my decision to continue using it because it works so well for me. If you were looking for a beautiful summer dark glow, don&#x27;t hesitate! Best tanning lotion ever in my opinion.</li>
            <li> First tanning lotion I used and definitely recommend.  Helped me establish a natural tan.</li>
            <li> Product is ok. Will not buy again bc of the smell. Will go back to Paint it Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shipping experience</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion after reading many great reviews about it. I did notice a difference after one use! and after 3 uses I had quite the noticeable difference! I tan at my gym and the max time they let you tan for is 10 minutes, so I feel that if I was able to go in a little longer like you can at most tanning salons, my results may have been even better! I&#x27;ve been using for a week now and everyone tells me how tan I am. So with that being said, this lotion definitely works! I love this lotion and it does not leave streaks. The smell is decent, and does not have an awful overpowering burnt smell after tanning. I will definitely purchase this item again!!</li>
            <li> This product worked very well. It does tan me very good and the smell is not bad after tanning. Overall I have been happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I noticed the color after using it only a few times. I really like the scent, it&#x27;s very light and I don&#x27;t notice the after tanning smell like with other lotions.</li>
            <li> Gives you a beautiful dark color... I luv this product.</li>
            <li> I really love this tanning lotion! I&#x27;ve ordered multiple bottles from Amazon where you can get it for a great price. This lotion has given me the best color out of all previous products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I had been slacking on the tanning bed, but after about three sessions with this product, I can wear shorts again without the fear of blinding people because my legs are so white.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! The product smells great. It takes a few times to get a tan from it. Althought I gave it a four stars because it&#x27;s kinda on the runny side of lotions I have used.</li>
            <li> I get a believable tan from this one.  I go twice a week and it is enough.  What I like best is that it is light as a cream.  I feel cooler when I go under the lamp and don&#x27;t sweat as much.  Feels great on the skin.  Many do not like the smell of the JWoww line but I love them.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for me even seemed like it made me fade. I will never order this again, not sure if it was old or what but this definitely did not do what it claimed</li>
            <li> LOVE IT QUICK SHIPPING</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to tanning and I absolutely love this product.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with streaking and no orange tan!  I&#x27;ll be ordering another bottle soon!  This lotion is light and doesn&#x27;t have a crazy smell to it.  I really enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> It does it exactly what it says it does. and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;the first time I used it I was noticeably darker</li>
            <li> I found this product to work the best of any tanning products I&#x27;ve bought.  I&#x27;m picky about smells and this one doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell after tanning.  Also its so much cheaper on Amazon than at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff works great. I buy it online here all the time. Always get compliments on the smell after tanning.</li>
            <li> I only get the chance to tan about once a week so I was really happy when this lotion was able to make my tan hold a color for more than just a couple days.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. I usually burn when I lay but haven&#x27;t burned once since using this.</li>
            <li> not sure to give it 3 stars or 4, i thought id see color after first time using like it said but it took for tje second time to see a difference.doesnt smell good after you get out but you def have to keep tanning to keep your color with this</li>
            <li> well im very disapointed in this new jwoww!i loved the jwoww 50xblack bronzer lotion moist smelled great and worked.this lotion is weird the textures off and it smells odd.plus it doesnt get y0u darker my salon is upscale i kn0w the beds are great im glad i 0rdered devoted creations 0bsessed to save my tan!wont be buying jwoww ever AGAIN!2 BAD JW0WW</li>
            <li> Love this! It is perfect! I don&#x27;t streak or anything when I use this...I EVEN TRIED to see if it would, and it didn&#x27;t. You can clearly see it is a bronzer. I am completely happy with this! It&#x27;s not EXTREMELY noticeable the first time you use it, but I burned pretty well. It smells very tropical. It&#x27;s a soft coconut/fruity smell, but not an overpowering smell. I love this! The second time I used it, my skin was starting to glow a bit! :) Great product!</li>
            <li> Needs more bronzers but very moisturizing</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get as bronzed as i expected bronzer seemed a little weak, but its still a great lotion!</li>
            <li> Can not tell the lotion is helping my tan at all.  Just like laying in the tanning bed with nothing on</li>
            <li> Just received my second bottle of this jwoww lotion. And it still has yet to fail me. Absolutely amazing especially being nearly half off the original price. Not too sure why some are saying its fake or expired, was the complete opposite for me. Received beautiful results like always.</li>
            <li> After reading all reviews of this product and going tanning and not seeing any results in darkening.. I asked the girl at the tanning salon, who is familiar with a lot of tanning product. She thinks I was scammed on the item. I&#x27;m not happy that I paid so much money for this lotion and have gotten no results.  I was never skeptical about buying items online, but now I am. As I will not buy from this company again or recommend them to others.</li>
            <li> This is not for the faint of heart, this is a serious bronzer. I literally can only use this particular lotion once a week or I look like snooki, if that&#x27;s the goal then sweet, you&#x27;ve got it. For those of us that like something more natural this is a great kick start to a tan. Once a week and then a less bronzing lotion the rest of the week.</li>
            <li> it got me a lot darker in one use. I am now on the lookout for a better local salon with hotter beds to see just how much more this lotion can give me. the smell is pleasant, no bad after smell, it does rub off on the clothes a little but I only noticed when I wore white after leaving the salon.</li>
            <li> Smells good and it seemed to get me darker than I usually get!  For sure but this lotion it works!!!</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again. It dos not give a dark tan as described. I would not purchase again. Huge disappointment !</li>
            <li> I began indoor tanning yet again after about a year of not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read the other reviews on this product  which is why I decided to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it gave me a base tan but for someone that likes a dark tan, fast, this wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually tan pretty easily and this was not was I was expecting from a brand such as the JWOWW brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I&#x27;ll be trying Snooki next!</li>
            <li> Take it from a WHITE girl. I love this tanning lotion!  The smell and texture is amazing, I didn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;after-tan&amp;#34; feel if you know what I mean.  Kind of sticky and stinky.  I saw results immediately after my tan. At least 2 shades darker!  Love it.</li>
            <li> At first, I LOVED this lotion. Now I&#x27;m finding myself turning orange even using it in rotate with a white lotion. The smell is amazing, even afterwards but it&#x27;s definitely not my favorite lotion of hers.</li>
            <li> Paid $25.28 for a product that expired in February, plus $8.98 shipping which will probably not be reimbursed when I return the product.</li>
            <li> Works well. Getting great color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few months now and no problems! I got the product in the time I was told and it&#x27;s worked great for tanning.</li>
            <li> Usually tanning lotions with bronzers smell horrible after a tanning session, but I am able to get the bronzing and smell great at the same time. This is the best lotion I have used and sales at my tanning salon for $80. I also was already tan when using this product and noticed a huge difference in color after two times.</li>
            <li> Horrible lotion. I was more than extremely disappointed. The &amp;#34;bronzers&amp;#34; do nothing and the DHA does less. I see no immediate results that a bronzer should give. The small amount of color I get doesn&#x27;t last; my ran fades very quickly even though I tan easily.</li>
            <li> Smells great.. great after smell....reason for two stars instead of one.&lt;br /&gt;But pours out like watered down lotion.  The week before buying this one I bought another kind of lotion and it poured out like water as well. So I give up on buying lotions from amazon. I&#x27;d rather pay full price and know it works . I picked these lotions because of the highest ratings.. but I guess that means nothing lol I really wished this one was real :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this tanning lotion. I have used it a couple times, and the first time I tanned for four minutes and literally already has slight color on me afterwards. The bottle is a good size as well. The smell isn&#x27;t overly pleasant, but I am not impressed with any tanning lotion smells this far. Definitely worth the $24!</li>
            <li> It was good but I have moved on to another bronzer. I switch up every other bottle. The scent is good and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, you can really see the difference in color!</li>
            <li> My tanning salon tried to charge $75 for this lotion.  I brought mine to the salon and compared the smell and color to see if they were the same and they exactly the same! Great price!</li>
            <li> helps me tan so much faster!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for almost two weeks now and have had no problems! I like that it doesn&#x27;t have any orangey bronzers in it (I always have trouble with bronzers, they give me orange stains on my hands or body from not rubbing in my lotion well enough). I have definitely gotten some color but the &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34; title is slightly misleading. I would definitely recommend this lotion for paler tanners (especially ones that tan easily) because it gives you natural looking bronze tones. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s better lotions out there, this one isn&#x27;t exactly a miracle worker, but it&#x27;s a good lotion. Also, as other reviewers have said, buying this lotion of amazon will save you A LOT of money, tanning salons make a lot of profit on tanning lotion sales and usually triple their wholesale price (aka this is a WAY better deal).</li>
            <li> Smells great, working fairly well. Not the best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Works pretty good but the smell it leaves after tanning is gross. It smells like someone broke a bottle of cheap, spoiled wine all over me.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever...and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them.&lt;br /&gt;Helps achieve a deep dark golden tan fast.&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m done searching for the perfect tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> This is such an awesome bronzer! I do tan easily but have never found a lotion that works this well after only 2 uses. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out either. It doesn&#x27;t give you an &amp;#34;orangish-brown&amp;#34; tint like others either. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love JWoww and Snookie. Born in NY and near Nicole&#x27;s hometown (Pleasant Valley for me), I love this lotion and cannot wait to tan darker and bring my Italian side out!</li>
            <li> it was an OK lotion, didn&#x27;t smell too great didn&#x27;t smell bad either. It just didn&#x27;t come close to giving the results that it said it would. I don&#x27;t think I would ever purchase this lotion again.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have used for tanning &amp; by far much cheaper on amazon than I&#x27;m my local tanning salon where it was priced at $160...rediculous! Anyway buy this you won&#x27;t regret it you will get darker in just one use &amp; continue to see great color for weeks. This is by far my favorite tanning lotion ♥♥♥</li>
            <li> Shippingamount was crazy.</li>
            <li> I was not noticing a difference and started looking for the expiration date, to find it expired the next month. Not happy about that but I know why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because of the smell. It&#x27;s not a terrible smell for tanning lotion but it does smell a little burnt. Otherwise it&#x27;s great! Really can tell after one tanning session so true to the name.</li>
            <li> Left me much darker after one use then other tanning lotions. Really liked it.</li>
            <li> bought the lotion in may. the expiration date on the bottom of the bottle said february. ;(&lt;br /&gt;will not be purchasing jwow tanning lotion again.&lt;br /&gt;hassle to return and buy something else.</li>
            <li> I ordered the lotion 4/12/14 and the expiration date on the bottom of the bottle says 1/26/13!! Which I assume means it is not going to work as well! Otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t expire.</li>
            <li> Where To Begin! I Love This Lotion. In Every Way. I am a very white person, and I went into my normal tanning bed in town I think maybe 3 times and had a beautiful base tan started. This bronzer gives you a beautiful color tone. It smells great it works great. I have not had any problems with streaks or stains. Sometimes I will even tan on my lunch break and when I go back to work I dont smell. I smell good and look great. :) I will buy again especially at this price! It sells for $100.00 in my salon :)</li>
            <li> This came sealed in a bag, I have no doubt it is the real thing. Works amazing as well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it definitely has a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; smell after you tan. I will try her other products now after being happy with this one.</li>
            <li> Read good reviews about it so i went ahead and bought it. Got it and its 4 MONTHS EXPIRED!!! Never heard back from seller. So i went ahead and tried it. Of course it didn&#x27;t work at all. Never will I waste almost 30 dollars online Again. BUYER BEWARE</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter before a big school dance. Didn&#x27;t have very long to get the tan she wanted and this worked perfect. SHe had an amzing tan in just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Good product, but deffiantly takes awhile to see a difference for me atleast. I also have olive skin tone, and tend to tan fast.</li>
            <li> Used this one first and smells great with very fast results!! Recently bought snooki and never again! No results and no good smell. I will stick with jwow!!</li>
            <li> One of the best lotions Ive used. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say only 1 and done, but I did see results only after one use. For dramatic results you will need to use more, but well worth it. Smells great and is very blendable. Not too marky on your hands after, its good to wipe your hands off anyway after any lotion, but nothing extreme like orange hands or anything. The price is unbeatable too. I recommend this to any tanner, beginner or advanced.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Best lotion ever. Gets you dark in a hurry.  I would buy this over and over and over again! Smells great!</li>
            <li> love love love.... buy this noticed first day of use how much better I tanned and the difference in my skin</li>
            <li> expired 1/14 not sure if this is really new or mixed with other things and sold again because this should have worked better than it has. At least buying from the salon you know you are getting the real thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale and pasty and burn super easy. I used this for about 2 weeks in my salon&#x27;s bronzer bed and was immediately tan. The only thing is that this is meant to get you tan fast but it doesn&#x27;t get you dark, it&#x27;s just made to give you a base tan fast. I had to get a different lotion in order to get any darker than what this was getting me. But if you&#x27;re needing a tan fast of wanting a base tan, this is a great lotion for that!</li>
            <li> This is a great tanning lotion to keep a good color! Much better pricing than going to the salon and buying it. I will purchase this again in the future!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I have never been this dark &amp; I have fair skin.. I have bought 2 just this summer. I LOVE it!!! Nice smell too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!!!! Ordering another one!!!!!! Defiantly would recommend to anyone I have fair skin and got really tan! Everyone always like wow you got some sun you&#x27;re so tan!!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Goes on smooth like lotion. It is not thick and greasy. It gives great color and is my new favorite lotion and I have used many over the years. It also doesn&#x27;t take a lot for me to feel like I have some on.</li>
            <li> AWESOME PRODUCT! .... nice smell and really enhances your tanning glow. I use this when I go to the stand up tanning and I got a very nice color in a couple of sessions verses using no product at all which normally takes it 1-2weeks. Yes I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this product since it claims to be a great bronzer.  No color at all. I used this product for a week and never saw a color change. Maybe it was old. I returned to buying on the shelf drug store brands that really work and instantly at 1/2 the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad lotion..just not as good as her other lotions. You don&#x27;t get as dark with this lotion as you do with jwoww&#x27;s black bronzers. Definitely not one and &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;. Once this bottle is gone I will be going back to her black bronzers.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion. It gets you darker quicker, and it leaves your skin smelling delicious!  Plus, it came very quickly in the mail!</li>
            <li> I got my bottle in the mail today only to find it expired in February 2014. I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Perfect tanning lotion, love love love no steaks and applies smooth abd even! Def recommend this lotion to tanners !!</li>
            <li> I have gotten the same results or better with cheaper brands it is good but not for the price &amp; the price in the salons omg I can not believe  it&#x27;s that much, but as I said it is good but there are other brands  cheaper that are even betterr or as good. That is just my experience with it. :)</li>
            <li> This lotion seems to give me great color in a short amount of time. I dont tan all the time but when I do, I like to feel like Im making progress. This lotion starts to give you color quickly and smells good too. It also doesnt seem to bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The best bronzing/tanning lotion for a super white chick!! Nice color after 1 session &amp; smells great, not to mention it came super quick!! 2 days before it was scheduled to be here.</li>
            <li> I wish it was one and done didn&#x27;t see a difference with this product but cheap I would buy again, and it does smell really good</li>
            <li> This product is great! It supposedly makes you a shade darker when you get out of the tanning and IT DOES! (not right when you get out but over an hour or two) This will be the tanning lotion I use forever!</li>
            <li> Was upset didn&#x27;t work like it said... lotion dated last year..have ordered others no issues .I have used several other jwoww lotions in the past ..</li>
            <li> Delivers a nice color without leaving a harsh after tanning smell. Awesome price compared to tanning salon price.</li>
            <li> This is the best bronzing tanning lotion I have ever used. I get the same results with one use/tanning session as two uses/tanning sessions with the previous lotion I used.</li>
            <li> Lotion was expired when it arrived. Still tried it to see if it would work. It did not. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I like to think I am a pretty experienced tanner. I go about two to three times a week until I hit the optimum shade then slow it down to once a week. I have tried TONS of lotions and this is my favorite. It has no tingle factor, but a GREAT bronzer in it, plus it keeps your skin pretty well moisturized afterwards. If you buy here, you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than the salons will sell it for. I am impatient and I like to see results quickly-- this lotion does just that.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this zero. It doesn&#x27;t tan you in the slightest bit because it&#x27;s EXPIRED. I contacted amazons customer service and received a refund. They understood, were very nice, and did it immediately. If you have already purchased this product and are now wondering why it isn&#x27;t working, email customer service to get a refund. They didn&#x27;t even hassle me with returning the bottle. I was a few days over the 30 day refund policy but since this product is DEFECTIVE they did it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expired tanning lotion doesn&#x27;t tan you so I&#x27;m super confused as to why there are recent reviews saying it&#x27;s so great. Different seller perhaps?</li>
            <li> My 23 year old daughter wanted me to order this on Amazon, cheaper than buying in the tanning salon. Anyway, she bought two different brands of Jwoww tanning lotion on Amazon, same day. She&#x27;s allergic to both of them. My daughter has tanned for years and NOTHING has EVER given her a reaction like these have. One is tingle the other is not. BOTH irritate her skin. She had to go to the doctor because of it. The money she saved buying them on Amazon, was spent for the doctor. Just giving you my opinion. Not telling you NOT to buy. I&#x27;ve not read any other reviews of this product, so I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else has had a reaction to it. I&#x27;m just being honest, not putting the product down. Other people might in fact love it. I&#x27;m just saying that my daughter is allergic to both Jwoww tanning lotions she ordered and is perfectly fine using other products.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent and no orange tint like many other lotions. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> very good product. Got me dark fast..</li>
            <li> This actually was for my daughter. According to her this is just what she wanted and at the tanning salon it costs double if not more than what she paid for.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion June 3, 2014. The expiration date on the bottom of the bottle is February 2014. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Just realize when you buy this product that you will be getting an EXPIRED lotion. When I first got my lotion I looked at the expiration date and it&#x27;s been expired for 3 months. I was ok with it but I wished I would have known before I bought this that this product was expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product about 5 times and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, the smell is just ok its fruity and sweet not a basic tanning lotion smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this lotion again.</li>
            <li> Decent I guess. Nothing to really compare it to yet. I bought it because of the good reviews. I don&#x27;t care for the smell but I don&#x27;t care for flowery smells. People are right though, it is expired. Got mine yesterday and the experation date says 1/72014. Not sure what the 7 is for though...</li>
            <li> After just 3 uses it took my tan to a new level. Would definatly recommend and amazon has it the cheapest I could find. Buy it. You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I thought it would get me much darker, but it did not at all make me any darker. I just ordered the jwow tingler I know for a fact it Will get me where I want to be..</li>
            <li> I like this product. It smells good and produces good color. I&#x60;ll buy it again. My brother ordered one of the cheeper indoor tanning lotions on here and while I loved the smell it leaves orange streaks on his body if you don&#x60;t get the lotion on evenly. JWOWW doesn&#x60;t do that. It &#x60;s not the best I&#x60;ve ever used but I believe it&#x60;s the best currently being offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this product so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try! I&#x27;m an advanced tanner but I wanted to try something other than tingles. I was either going to buy Mad Hot Tingle by jwoww or One and Done. the only reason I went with one and done is because of the moisturizing factor which I LOVE.. but even in high intensity beds I&#x27;m not getting a dark color with this lotion.. it&#x27;s smells great and is a decent price but for advanced tanners I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying at this at all.</li>
            <li> Probably the best indoor tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I have great results using this, the smell is good, the after tan smell is NOT bad like some lotions, the bronzer has never ever turned me streaky or odd-colored.. overall everything I am looking for and needing from a tanning lotion! I will order this again when I am running low! Highly recommend to indoor tanners!</li>
            <li> I love love this lotion!!</li>
            <li> This is also a great product but I just like look darkness from insanely Black ! I do alternate the the products !!!</li>
            <li> I loved the color that I got from the lotion I also like the smell and it makes my skin feel moisturized, I will order this again.</li>
            <li> Received outdated bottle. Smells old!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was tingle and it wasn&#x27;t but still use it occassionally</li>
            <li> The scent is ok, not my fav but its alright. I just notice a little color with this lotion, i started using this when i was pale and it did help me to rid of my pastiness. However i think there are better lotions out there then this. Its decent but nothing great. It will help you if your pale but it wont get you very dark. It does make my skin pretty soft though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome  Smells great and it&#x27;s the same stuff at the salon but for a way cheaper price</li>
            <li> Too greasy and the smell is aweful.</li>
            <li> Love the bronzer in this lotion. Smells MUCH better than her White Wedding. Great to be able to not pay majorly marked up Salon prices for this product!</li>
            <li> I have gotten a deep tan that has help very well. I haven&#x27;t been to the tanning salon in almost a month and I have held my color so well.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product especially if Ur starting to tan.  works well and smells very good, definitely good lotion to start tanning with.</li>
            <li> I ordered this formy niece.  She wanted to get a deep dark tan and this product gave her that tan.  She was tan an ready for summer when summer came.  I recommend this iten for tanning bed lotion</li>
            <li> JWoww gets you dark... One and Done! Smells good &amp; works great! I was 2 shades darker after one use!</li>
            <li> Didnt meet my expectations. I ilike Ed Hardy products much better .The Black Koi is my favorite</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try out the new Jwoww tanning lotion because of the great reviews but unfortunately was very disappointed. When I was first putting on the lotion it smelled amazing but once I was done tanning and out of the bed I smelled sour. I sucked it up and continued to use the lotion for a couple weeks but saw almost no difference in my skin color, even my friends asked if I stopped tanning because I was definitely losing my tan. I was starting to wonder if it was just me! so I went tanning again and used the last remains of my Millinum Black Storm lotion (which is half the price of One and Done) and after that one use I saw a huge difference! Needless to say I will not be using this lotion anymore and I will be sticking to Black Storm.</li>
            <li> The product was 5 months expired when I received it.</li>
            <li> Not a great bronzer. Almost like using nothing. I&#x27;m fair skinned so normally it doesn&#x27;t take much to impress me. Just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not quite a one and done but it does the job and quite well. Surprisingly happy with this.</li>
            <li> This lotion absolutely does NOT meet my expectations. The reviews state that this is one of the best tanning lotions there are out there. And I do not agree whatsoever. First of all; the date on this bottle in Fall 2012. The little symbol on the back that shows how long this lotion is good for shows 18 months. Considering we are in August of 2014 That means this lotion is about 6 months past the actual shelf life. I have always purchased my lotions through amazon. And I am highly dissatisfied with the &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;lack of color&amp;#34; this lotion brought me. It was only my 4th time tanning (previously I had not used a lotion this year) and this lotion gave me absolutely no color whatsoever. If looking to purchase this- I would not. I know everyone says the color is great. But I think since these were all produced in 2012 you wont get the same results that previous reviews got considering this lotion is 2 years old. I am disappointed, and I am going to try to return it.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion from my tanning salon &amp; LOVE it. So when I received my bottle from Amazon, I compared the color, scent, etc. The correct is darker than mine from tanning salon. And it&#x27;s runnier. The smell is the same so that&#x27;s confusing!! I am very suspicious that it isn&#x27;t the exact formula I paid for. I will tan tomorrow &amp; see if I get same results!!</li>
            <li> love the lotion it is a great product for a great buy</li>
            <li> Love it will buy again</li>
            <li> My sister and I both order this tanning lotion and were both very disappointed neither of us saw a difference between using this and not using a lotion at all.</li>
            <li> I did not like this at all was no good</li>
            <li> I bought this product after having gone through two bottle of the Jwoww Black Bronzer Dark Tanning Lotion, which I also love. I definitely love the smell of this bronzer way better than the Jwoww Black Bronzer Dark Tanning Lotion. I know others may feel differently about the scent than I do. I am very pale by nature, but tend not to burn as most pale people would. It always takes me a while to brown, but I defiantly noticed more color after using this product for the first time. The Jwoww products have never let me down as other bronzers have. Great if you&#x27;re looking for a natural and not orange looking tan.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!! Have tried all the JWOWW lotions and this is my favorite.  Try to go as long as you can before you shower. Seems like the longer I let this stay on the dark I get by the end of the day..</li>
            <li> Good price, smells great, and makes my skin an excellent shade.  Nothing is orange about it---I&#x27;ve had people asking me all the time if I&#x27;m Italian because my skin is &#x27;olive.&#x27;  Love this lotion and I only go tanning 2x/week!</li>
            <li> Really works and will brown you right up!  Best tanning lotion on the market in my opinion and I have tried alot</li>
            <li> It was expired...so I didnt use it!!! The salon said it was unsafe to use!!!</li>
            <li> it just burns me dosent tanat all worthless a waste of my hard working money</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It smells good, easy to blend and darkens quickly.  Works better than any other lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Jwoww One and Done; Order from &amp;#34;TheeTanMan&amp;#34; I was SUPER skeptical at first because the strong fragrance and light color of the lotion and not sold sealed. I can honestly say as soon as I received it (very quick shipment 4 days) I went straight to the tanning bed to compare theres to mine AUTHENTIC. So excited to order more.</li>
            <li> I have always used bombshell but read the reviews on this product and thought I&#x27;d try it.  This product is more of a stainer than a bronzer.  Will definitely not be ordering it again.  Product arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Yeah i know how nerve racking it can be to find the right tanning lotion,  &amp;&amp; Buying it online does make everyone skeptical. I went through the tanning lotion results on Amazon for a good hour or two before i finally made my choices. Tip one, always read the reviews. I bought two different lotions at my tanning salon and they went back the very next day due how badly i got burnt up, they were both designer skin products.  I ordered this three days ago and was so egger to get it, bam there it was. Used it today and it worked amazingly.  By far my favorite tanning lotion so far. Got color on my first session, and i only laid for 10 mins due to my burnt skin from the previous lotions. Tanning solons said jwows tanning loctions have yougert added in the ingredients and i believe it. Absolutely no ATO. Tanning lotion doesnt have a STRONG perfumey smell, very light and fresh. Not runny, pretty thick which i love... hate trying to cup watery lotion in my hand and quickly rubbing it in. Definitely beyond my expectations.  You go JWow. In love with this stuff&lt;br /&gt;💛💙💜💚❤💛💙💜💚❤💛💙💜</li>
            <li> Some pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The price...my local tanning salon sells it for $68!&lt;br /&gt;It did not have a negative effect on my face, which is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;No weird marks where you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;More tan than burn in areas that formerly  got red.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin absorbs it almost immediately, so no greasiness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little strange, but it&#x27;s mild.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get as tan as I expected from a \\&quot;black bronzer.\\&quot; But then I was in a stand up booth for only 4 minutes. I&#x27;ll try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it. Mostly because I didn&#x27;t burn this time (my tush has a tendency to burn in the booth, even at 4-5 minutes.)</li>
            <li> This stuff got me tan really fast! What would normally take me several tanning bed visits, only took me two to get noticeably tanner. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!! I will never go back to other brands of tanning lotion. This really works! I tanned twice with this lotion in the level four bed. AMAZING RESULTS.</li>
            <li> My favourite lotion! Great price and delivered fast!</li>
            <li> I loooveee this tanning lotion! After only 3 uses I am SO much darker! So far, so good. I&#x27;ve used other lotions and they don&#x27;t even compare. I&#x27;ve used a lotion for a month before and I still wasn&#x27;t as dark as I am using JWOWW One and Done only three times. Try it!! Although, the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite but it&#x27;s worth it. And Amazon is MUCH cheaper than the salon prices! Great purchase</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m a very fair-skinned person and have used other Jwoww lotions but by far this lotion is the best, my absolute favorite, and has given quicker results. I have a beautiful naturally dark tan in only a few tanning sessions!!! The smell is amazing with no after tan odor at all and it is very moisturizing. All thumbs up to this one!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure what tanning lotion to buy. I only had a month an half to get a good tan before my trip to jamaica.But i bought this one and i couldnt b happier im so dark it didnt take long at all an i have fair skin but i tanned so good becouse of this tanning lotion i recomend it to anyone an u can not beat the price were i tan at its over 100 dollars an from amazon its less than 30 wow u cant beat that and its the best.</li>
            <li> Best tanning product i&#x27;ve used in a while! Could tell a difference after laying just once, I love this product.</li>
            <li> I finally got the chance to use this today and I LOVE IT. Definitely will order it again when I finish the first bottle. :)</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and always burn first before tanning. This product is amazing, I got color the very first time I used it.  Its smells good and after tanning you don&#x27;t have that yucky tanning smell to your skin.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best lotion for instant bronzing action. I am an experienced tanner and have used many products.  Jwoww one and done is exactly that, &amp;#34;ONE and DONE!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! THAN KYOU AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and it really makes you a shade darker every time you use it. I don&#x27;t have to go tanning as much.</li>
            <li> works amazingly!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not happy that this lotion expired in February yet they are still selling it to people.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time tanning.  This product eliminated any problem I ever had and solved the ghost face I have,</li>
            <li> Great product! I have been using this lotion for a few weeks now and I have a great tan! I get compliments on my tan all of the time. I was very pale before and was not using a tanning bed at all, and now, voila!!! A bronzed goddess!!  Haha. Seriously it really does work. The lotion is thick and doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but it gets the job done for sure. Don&#x27;t buy the lotion in the tanning salon though bc they charge WAY more than what amazon sells it for, don&#x27;t get ripped off!! happy tanning!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions, the smell is amazing but not intense.  The tan seems to appear quicker compared to using other lotions.</li>
            <li> I am white as casper and do not tan easily by any means. This lotion is amazing!!! I&#x27;ve been getting such a nice color with in just a week or two of using the product! it came in at a decent time and the price is way better than what the tan salon has it for. i will definitely order it again when i run out!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion. It smells so wonderful and leaves my skin golden brown after about 4 visits from the tanning bed. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this, and I cannot wait to buy more of JWOWW&#x27;s tanning lotions!</li>
            <li> It works really well, but you have to make sure you rub it in really good! It will leave spots on you if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love it! Best lotion ever! Smells great, an has gotten me super dark! I Will buy it again for sure!</li>
            <li> I got this because of all of the good reviews, but I was not happy with the outcome. As an experienced tanner, this lotion seemed to make me get lighter, very strange. I used it for about 2 weeks, tanning 4-5 a week. No change was noticed, and like I said, I seemed to get lighter. After I stopped using it, I seemed to get my darker color back. Maybe I got a bad batch, but thats bad for business.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail yesterday and could not wait to try it out today at the tanning salon. I&#x27;m very pleased with how it turned out and the smell is not bad at all. I actually kind of enjoy smelling it :] Makes me feel clean and fresh. Although, I didn&#x27;t really notice a huge difference as some people claimed they did, I did notice I looked slightly darker after a couple hours but keep in mind, I&#x27;m pretty tan as it is. So it&#x27;ll take a couple of sessions but I do not regret getting this lotion. I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about this product and am happy with my purchase. Also, it really beats the prices at tanning salons. I could have gotten it at mine for $65, but I chose to get it off Amazon instead, for less than $30. :D</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion ever!  A must buy for avid indoor tanners.  Will purchase again.  I love it. it is As expected.</li>
            <li> I loved this lotion. It helps me tan well and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Scent--Wow this stuff smells great! And compared to the other JWOWW lotions it&#x27;s the best. It smells really sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Results--It&#x27;s my favorite JWOWW lotion, gives me great results. I think I&#x27;ve purchased 4 bottles of this.</li>
            <li> best tanning lotion !!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It has a great smell so I don&#x27;t smell like burnt skin and it makes me darker than most lotions. Fast shipping. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to feel about this lotion being expired. I&#x27;ve used it twice and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it again.It makes my skin feel weird and I totally not what I expected. Kardashian Glow is a different story though.....</li>
            <li> WAAAAY cheaper here than at the salon and EXACTLY the same product! It definitely helped me get my tan exactly where I wanted it to be. However, I&#x27;m not really into heavily perfumed lotions, and this one is no exception, although it wasn&#x27;t any more heavily perfumed than 9 out of 10 other tanning lotions, and at least the smell was pleasant.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was too good to be true. This bottle had an expiration date of 1/2014. I also purchased another bottle which expired 5/2014. I will only make future lotion purchases from the salon!!!</li>
            <li> Got it for like 75% off the tanning salon prices! And works great! I would definitely recommend this amazing lotion</li>
            <li> Came faster than I expected and was packaged great. I love the scent. Much better than most!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great tanning lotion.. I can&#x27;t really tell you how it works in a tanning bed, I haven&#x27;t used in in there yet, but I just came back from cancun and I usually don&#x27;t tan.. This time I did.. I am the darkest I&#x27;ve ever been.. This product works very well..  The two things I do want to say are, don&#x27;t put this close to your eyes, it runs when you sweat, and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to absorb into the skin.. I found I had to rub it in for a little longer, but it did the trick.. My boyfriend on the other hand, it wouldn&#x27;t seem to want to rub in at all.. Yes, men tend to be a little thicker skinned, so I would not recommend this for a man.. Better off with something else, preferably something designed for men..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, definitely grab this product :)</li>
            <li> The lotion is awesome! I could tell the difference after a couple of uses. And it leaves your skin so soft. It defitnatly gets you dark.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It smells great and works wonders on your skin. You will have great color after using only a couple of times.</li>
            <li> This is a nice bronzer.  It has an ok smell, not exactly my favorite fragrance, but tolerable.  It helps keep your skin moist and helps you to get a more even tan.  I recommend this to anyone getting in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Love it....got darker on my fake n bake ran!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product!! Best results, great smell, non-greasy. Perfect! Best tan I&#x27;ve ever had! Will repurchase this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks....My whole body is really dark....EXCEPT MY LEGS! I only use this on my legs and thighs....To be honest, I went tanning yesterday, and i didnt use my lotion and my legs finally look  a shade darker....Does anyone else have this problem....I am not sure how i feel about product...I won&#x27;t be buying again...I am going to order the Designer Skin BLACK 20x .....</li>
            <li> I got a bottle that was four months expired.</li>
            <li> Loooove the way it smells. Like pineapple! Gets you to a nice tan overall, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This Lotion is fantastic and the smell in wonderful</li>
            <li> This was my first jwoww tanning lotion... It got me dark so quick!! There isn&#x27;t a bad tanning smell or anything and it makes your skin silky smooth while making you dark, quickk! Deff worth it :)</li>
            <li> Perfect thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> This just came out this week and has gotten me excited about JWOWW products again.  I can&#x27;t wear all bronzers, some of them make me itchy which is what the original JWOWW did so I never went back.  I just tried a packet of this One and Done this week due to the fact that it&#x27;s yogurt based and I thought hey, it might work for me.  Well, all I can say is WOW!  The girl at the front desk even noticed! I was instantly super dark and it never made me break out or got me itchy.  I&#x27;m a year long tanner, about 2-3 times a week and like to rotate my bronzers with intensifiers on all level of beds.  I used this on a Fusion bed (high and low pressure combined). It has a tropical like scent, it&#x27;s light and not overpowering,  and goes on well.  Although it claims to have the odor inhibitors I still had a slight immediate after-tan odor which did go away within about 30 minutes.  Overall I think this stuff is fantastic and will be purchasing a big bottle.  It&#x27;s hard for me to find such a nice bronzer that doesn&#x27;t give me the skin sensitivities.</li>
            <li> smells great, and couldn&#x27;t have gotten tanner with this great product !!!!! its the brest product I have ever purchased !</li>
            <li> Wanted a dark tan, which it works and smells nice as well ! :) glad I got it ! Great lotion for cheap</li>
            <li> I tan frequently, like, 3 times a week, and I have been for over 15 years.  I love tanning, and I realize the damage that ultraviolet rays can cause to my skin.  I always, ALWAYS, use lotions, and this one is awesome!!  JWoww has really nice lotions, and this is one of her best.  It applies smoothly and smells great.  It absorbs rather quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft.  I paid HALF of what my salon was asking.  Really, really a wonderful tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> This is just another lotion. It smells decent it leaves you soft. I am not a super fan, but it does its job.</li>
            <li> This product is the second tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried and it does a pretty good job for me when tanning.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I stopped tanning around August and just started back up last saturday and I used a sample packet of the Jwoww one and done because the lady that worked their told me it was there best seller ever since it came out and it&#x27;s been sold out for 2 weeks! The next day i noticed my legs had a color to them and not pale like they were getting!! I seem to be liking it so far so i ordered a bottle of the lotion on monday i cant wait to recieve it and see me getting tanner!!  yay for being tan in te winter!! ;)</li>
            <li> Ok, first off this lotion is great on its own or if you mix it with another product. I can tell a difference after one use, its not a drastic change, but its a difference, but when I mix it with something like pauly d&#x27;s the after party, its like a super bronzing cocktail! its awesome, it smells alittle weird, but I can stand it so the lotion is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Item has been discontinued &amp; it is amazing! No streaking</li>
            <li> I just bought this lotion and used it for the first time today! it is too early to tell for any color yet but I am a bit skeptical.. I was told that the sellers are emptying out the bottles and replacing it with a different lotion and that it can also be expired (because it is yogurt based). My bottle does not have an expiration date marked on it. I am unsure what to think and will not really have a true opinion until I use this a few more times but has anyone else heard of these type of things happening?</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought  it would  be.</li>
            <li> If youre fair and you dont tan great this is exactly what you need to buy, finally after 20 years a product that works</li>
            <li> smells awful before and after tan. consistency is almost runny,not very moisturizing at all! I do not get any color from this lotion whatsoever. the first and last jwoww product I will ever use. disappointed because it claimed to be the best. what a letdown</li>
            <li> I received this within two days of ordering and I went and put it to the test.  I am very satisfied with this product and could tell a difference right away with one use.  I had been using another product for a couple of months and wasn&#x27;t getting any decent results.  I don&#x27;t tan everyday and I don&#x27;t want to be Bahama brown either.  I just try to keep a nice golden glow so I only go maybe twice a week.</li>
            <li> Product great... disappointed about scent. Doesn&#x27;t not smell very good. Other reviews said coconut smell, and it smells NOTHING like a coconut or like a yummy tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I work for a tanning salon, and this lotion is by far one of my favorites. It smells amazing, gives you a nice, bronze color fast that truly lasts, makes your skin so soft and smooth, and makes your tattoos really pop! I would highly recommend it, as well as any of the JWOWW lotions.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It smells great &amp; gives you great color! I will be buying this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best I have ever had! You won&#x27;t regret buying it! also way cheaper here then in salons.</li>
            <li> I usually start tanning this time of year and go for several months in a row. Last year I used Ed Hardy tanning lotion with bronzers and I had to use it for almost a month to really even see any color results. With the JWOWW One and Done I&#x27;ve only used it twice and my friends and coworkers have noticed that I&#x27;m getting dark! What is nice also is that with the bronzers in this one it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks between your fingers like normal bronzers do, and it&#x27;s not orange or streaky. The consistency of the lotion goes on very nicely, don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot. (A little goes a long way) and it smells so good even after tanning. Other lotions smell good in the bottle but soon after tanning you smell like a dirty sock, this stuff makes you smell really yummy :) I highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am hard to tan but jus after 1 week im already pretty dark so this product is great to me an i will def buy more!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion!!! I got it within 3 days!!! Soo fast shipping! My honest option is that at first it smelled really strong and I was like oh no, I&#x27;m not goin to like this but once I got out of the tanning bed I smelled like I just got out of the shower!! It left a clean fresh scent!! Not that burned skin smell! I got soo dark after just one use which I was really surprised, cause this lotion is not as dark as the new snooki one! Over all I love this lotion and would definitely purchase again!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the color it gives me especially right after I tan. The only reason I am not giving it all 5 stars is because the bottle is expired.</li>
            <li> Stinky, slimy lotion that does nothing. It&#x27;s just a silicon based lotion. No bronzer, no tingle, no nada. Don&#x27;t bother. If you love Australian Gold products, looks for some Almost Famous. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty good, not as good as the Worship.</li>
            <li> love it, works great smells great.</li>
            <li> Best lotion by Jwoww so far smells great.....Makes you really dark....I would pick this one over all the other ones she has. love it love it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite tanning lotions by far. It has the best bronzer I have ever used and it actually smells great after tanning.</li>
            <li> Didnt like lotion it wasn&#x27;t thick it pour out like milk, didnt get any color. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I hav the best tan ever! I&#x27;ve been tanning for over 10 years and never used a lotion that got me so dark! Luv</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have gone through a ton of tanning lotions....a ton. One and done definitely smells better than most of the ones I have tried. I can go out with my friends or husband with out smelling burnt. The color it gives me is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. Love it.</li>
            <li> From all the reviews that I read before purchasing this product, I was pleased with the way that it really did increase my tan.  Unfortunately, the smell is very much a deciding on factor with me.  I find the smell horrible.  The first time I used it, it didn&#x27;t seem to be as bad, only noticed a burnt smell when I was finished.  BUT..  the second time I used it was during my lunch hour and I had a horrible smell that to me smelled like &amp;#34;beer&amp;#34;.  :(  I can only tan with this when I am not going anywhere afterwards.  It is worth it for the color, but kind of hard to get past the smell.  :(</li>
            <li> Works well for a beginner tanner , but not so well for someone who needs a lot to get color</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It smells good and works good too. I love the Jwoww products and will keep buying them.</li>
            <li> I couldnt wait to get this home, but I dont even want to tan with it! Its sticky and thick! the smell is pear but like an old pear! also I did look dark but its self Tanner in it. U lose it if not used everyday. I would never buy it again. But hey I gave it a go.</li>
            <li> I have worked in a tanning salon for a few years and I have tried about every lotion under the sun. I am also VERY fair skinned. This lotion is absolutely amazing! JWOWW&#x27;s tanning products are great! I have tanned three days this week and used this lotion, you couldn&#x27;t tell right away but a few hours later the tan came out beautifully. When using this lotion it maks the tan look very natural, and it smells great too! Definitely would recommend using this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.. I had not tanned for 2 months then decided to start back up again. So I bought this a few weeks ago and got dark fast.. I defiantly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, smells pretty good, paraben free, great skin care benefits.  Great price as well.  I am constantly being asked what lotion I use at my salon.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion gives me much more color faster. Its smells great goes perfectly and never streaks or spots a nice bronze!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great gave me a good color I will continue to use this its by far the best lotion and you can&#x27;t beat the price this lotion would cost 3times more at a tanning saloon.</li>
            <li> I tried this when it first came out last fall at my tanning salon. I was hooked. I ordered it on here and it was delivered very quickly. You will get several shades darker after one use of this stuff. I have lent it to my friends so they could try it and they all loved it as well. It&#x27;s a great purchase and fits well into my tanning lotion rotation.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell much difference from any other tanning lotions I have used in the past. Why I gave it three stars, kinda neutral</li>
            <li> I got this lotion at the salon i flip flop between. Im scot/irsh mixed and i have to say i have a great base tan but actually seeing color not so much. I have been using this stuff for over two weeks and in a 3rd highest power bed and it just looks the same :(i the smell going on is good but coming out meh. Im semipleased but will not buy this product agian.</li>
            <li> I love love love this lotion. I have all the Jwoww lotions and this is by far the best. You can see your tan after the first use and you skin feels and looks amazing. It also smells really good!</li>
            <li> This lotion may not smell the greatest, but it gives you great color in only one use! Perfect for getting that base tan for summer!</li>
            <li> I love the Jwoww brands of lotions black, gold and this one and done.  But the One and Done is my favorite so far out of those 3.  It works quickly as it says and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or a burnt skin smell which nobody likes</li>
            <li> this is my favorite so far of the tanning lotions i&#x27;ve tried! the bronzer is great and the scent is not overwhelmingly sweet like most. plus, it&#x27;s not quite as thick as most so it&#x27;s easy to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This product was perfect! They checked the lotion at the salon and it was authintic and full!! Thank you soooo much! This was way cheaper them buying it in the salon :)</li>
            <li> SO I WAS AT MY LOCAL TANNING SALON AND THE LADY AT THE FROUNT TOLD ME ABOUT HER NEW FAVORITE LOTION.... I BOUGHT A SAMPLE PACK FOR $8.....AHHHH  ....... AND FELL IN LOVE.....I&#x27;M STARTING MY SPRING TANNING NOW, YOU KNOW GETTING READY FOR SWIMMING SEASON. TRYED IT ONE TIME AND I SEE A BIG DIFFRENCE IN MY SKIN TONE ABOUT 5 SHADES DARKER IN ONE USE.  I HAVE BAD DRY SKIN AND THIS MAKES MY SKIN FEEL BABY SOFT!!! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WILL KEEP BUYING IT AND FOR THIS PRICE...??? YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE STUPID TO BUY THIS LOTION AT THE SALON WHEN YOU GET IT ON AMAZON FOR HALF THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Great smell and gives you a nice bronzed color after doesn&#x27;t leave you with the \\&quot;tanning salon\\&quot; smell</li>
            <li> The smell is fruity and nice, the lotion leaves my skin feeling smooth and never dried out, and after I tan, it&#x27;s obvious that I went tanning that day. It gives me such a deep tan, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> The delivery was SUPER QUICK. Absolutely satisfied with that. The lotion is pretty good too. I did have a little higher expectations with this one. But I do recommend it</li>
            <li> This lotion is to die for works amazing... You see results the first time! Love it all the jwoww lotion smell great</li>
            <li> Not a fan... Disappointed because I wanted to love it. I tan very well, but this lotion only made me a funky orange color, not deep brown like I like. I had much better luck with Snooki&#x27;s bronzer! It&#x27;s a pretty good  moisturizer, and the smell isn&#x27;t horrible. I actually prefer the smell of this one to Snooki&#x27;s, but I will sacrifice smell for color!  Might be okay for new tanners, but beware as it will turn you orange if you use it daily, and it gives you a golden tan instead of a deep tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase... First off they charge twice as much at any tanning salon so this was at great price !</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this lotion out because of the great reviews I&#x27;ve heard. I have to say I do like it, I just feel like DS Obsidian or Luminary work better for me. This lotion smells great, and my favorite thing about it is that it really does cut down on the after tan smell. It doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate it, but reduced it by about 75-80% compared to others I&#x27;ve used. It gives a nice color, a tiny bit on the orange side for my taste, but not too bad. Overall a good lotion, I&#x27;m not disappointed by any means, I just prefer the other bronzers.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion probably 5 times. I tan yearly (during warmer months and have for years). I&#x27;ve tried all different kinds of lotions, including the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; at the salon.  After reading revies of Jwoww Tanning Lotion One and Done, I purchased. It arrived quickly. the main things I look for in a lotion is smell, bronzers, and after tan smell. This lotion smells good, fresh and clean, in the bottle and when applied. Bronzers are good, don&#x27;t stain hands and doesn&#x27;t streak. After 2 tans I saw a noticable difference in y color. After tan smell is pretty much non-exitent with this lotion. I&#x27;ve purchased lotions at the salon, which I was told would completely eliminate the after tan smell. None of them ever have. This one does. I notice it a little in my hair, but that&#x27;s it. The frangrance of the lotion last for hours but isnt over powering. I would definately purchase this lotion again and you can&#x27;t beat the price (compared to salon price). HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> I would say this tanning lotion is good but it is not the best I&#x27;ve had. So for I think believe and Swedish beauty are better.</li>
            <li> Great product! It smells good and it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I saw a difference after one tanning session. I&#x27;m pale and have a hard time getting color, so if you&#x27;re like me I definitely recommend this lotion! The seller was great also. My order arrived right on time and I got exactly what was described!</li>
            <li> I already used this tanner.once and.it.smells.good and works awesome... i have been using spellbound and this tanning lotion is so much better&lt;br /&gt;. I defiantly notice a difference in color</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to help me over my tanning plateau, but instead I LOST COLOR!! I don&#x27;t know how but I did. I was very disappointed in this lotion because I have use dither original JWOWW and it worked great. If you want to get dark don&#x27;t buy this lotion. Maybe if your a beginner at tanning this would be a good starter lotion.</li>
            <li> I STARTED TANNING COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND ITS TRUE WITH A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY AND ALSO THE TIME I USED I SAW A DIFFERENCE.  THE SMELL OF IT IS GREAT DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE YOU SMELLING LIKE YOU&#x27;VE BEEN WELL COOKED OR SOMETHING.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR BEGINNERS BECAUSE I AM ONE.  DEFINTELY WILL REPURCHASE WHEN TANNING AGAIN.</li>
            <li> It does work but didn&#x27;t start seeing color change for a few weeks it does smell good n does make ur skin soft</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34; but either way I love it and its very very very good for the price. Love love love jwoww.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Jwoww one and done lotion. I can totally see a difference in darkness compared to the lotion I was using. I suggest it! And it smells GREAT.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is amazing I&#x27;ve never owned one that got me tan so quick and it smells amazing (;</li>
            <li> Purchased this lotion today an it&#x27;s expired by 10 months. I will be going back to the tanning salon tomorrow. It&#x27;s no wonder it was 30% off...</li>
            <li> Authentic product at a great price.  Very dark after just a few applications.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome Tanning Lotion for a great price.... Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Get price for how long it lasts and how well it works. It was wrapped in plastic so I know it wasn&#x27;t replaced with fake lotion.</li>
            <li> I like it and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I don&#x27;t go for the dark dark muddy tan so I only tan 2-3 times per week. Noticeable difference after first time.</li>
            <li> I am getting a good tan using this lotion. I wish the tint was a little darker and not as runny. But overall would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle,  squeeze lotion into ur hand to apply. Great smell.</li>
            <li> Helps my skin get a natural sun tan look vs a burnt look!</li>
            <li> Nice but don&#x27;t forget to put some sunscreen on also</li>
            <li> Best dang tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! The name surely does justify how great it actually works; I&#x27;ve tanned with this lotion three times and I&#x27;m already super tan! HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest it!</li>
            <li> This lotion was expired when I got it. It stinks and doesn&#x27;t work. So disappointed since I&#x27;ve loved all her products.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the lotion, it&#x27;s like a berry/pear scent.  I&#x27;ve used it about five times since I got it, haven&#x27;t noticed a HUGE change in color.  I feel like it&#x27;s done a little for my coloring, but definitely not &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34;.  This is the first JWOWW lotion I&#x27;ve used so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  I&#x27;m tanning for a vacation in a month and if I had more time would probably try out another product, but I&#x27;ll stick with this one for now.</li>
            <li> one of the best goes on smooth.  leaves skin moist love it</li>
            <li> if you are a beginnwer at tanning this is defently the tanning lotion to go with.  I could tell a difference the first time i tanned.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Its a ok lotion. But isn&#x27;t one and done as the name says...</li>
            <li> Product is not the same as original. I had a tanning company look at the product and color doesn&#x27;t match any of the bottles they sale. Either product is out of date or is a different product in the bottle than what its suppose to be.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion for the price. I like the smell and it leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Literally just opened up my package with my bottle of this lotion inside and the very first thing I checked was the expiration date. It said 1/7/2014 which at first was discouraging, but decided to go ask my local Planet Beach just to be sure. The lady there was so helpful. We checked the color, smell, and texture of my lotion compared to their bottles of JWoww One and Done on the shelves and they were exactly the same. The date on the bottom on their bottles read 2/7/2014 which puzzled me further. The lady then told me that as long as the bottles had not been tampered with or opened, the lotion has a life of 18 months shown by a small image on the back of the bottle that looks like an open container. She assured me I would be fine using the bottle I had because the shelf life was still in tact. The date on the bottom of the bottle is not so much an expiration date but more likely around when the lot of that lotion had been made. Will use this lotion as I have previously used and love JWoww&#x27;s tanning products.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works great!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping AND absolutely LOVE this product! Will definitely order again...thank you!</li>
            <li> Works quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy.  I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times and can already see my tan.  This never happens for me!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion it really works. Most tanning lotions with lots of bronzers turn you orange but this one doesn&#x27;t. I am a fair skin redhead and it doesnt burn me and its a really natural tan. The only down is that the smell is not great.. It smells a little funky not my idea of a pear scent</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Not only does it smell good, but as a fair skinned lady it has done wonders (so far). My skin feels nourished afterwards and after a few hours you are able to tell a difference.</li>
            <li> The potion costs almost a third of what you would pay for it in a salon. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> today was my first day using this product. I have never used Jwoww&#x27;s brand before so I gave it a try. I immediately saw results after my first session. The only problem i have with this lotion is the very over powering \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; smell that it has, other then that i love it. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feeling greasy.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter, she really likes this product and does recomend it especially at this great price.</li>
            <li> New favorite tanning lotion!!! Although I&#x27;m an avid tanner, just as the product promises, you DO get dark after just one tan!!!!!! Will be ordering again :-)</li>
            <li> Bought this product and was paranoid to use it but seriously after the FIRST use I looked darker! I was using the black jwoww lotion but this one is for sure my new favorite! And the thick yogurt based texture feels awesome! Love the smell too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this jwoww lotion after tanning for two weeks. It has pushed my tan to another level, making me the darkest I&#x27;ve ever been!!! I will be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> This works pretty well. I don&#x27;t tan easily and I have seen somewhat of a difference so far. I will keep using it and see if I get any darker.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good. Makes you skin soft, but as far as making me tan? I still like snookie&#x27;s better. Overall still a pretty good tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> this product does exactly what they said.  the tan is done in one no damage to the lotion at all when it was shipped.  i am very happy with the company.</li>
            <li> The lotion was sent right away in the mail and I received it within the next couple of days. The lotion for one, smells greaaaat and for two, it really does do a nice job with the bronzing of your skin! It is not slimy or uses too much bronzer where it turns your fingers colors, it has just the right amount to really enhance your tan. I really was happy with this purchase especially for the price payed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to other tanners out there :)</li>
            <li> The lotion smelled ok..it was just very strong! I was looking for something that would tan me pretty fast and this lotion did NOT! Seeing as its named one &amp; done, you&#x27;d think it would work fast.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and I actually saw the difference after one use and I tan about 2-3times/week. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> Its a good lotion an my daughter really likes it but for me i need somthing hot to get tan started then use it so i dont lose my tan</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, it has a pleasant smell. I have used her other lotions in the past and they work well too, this one though gets you really dark. I will purchase another one soon to have in hand/ in stock, when the bottle I have now runs out. Its called on and done for a reason. I got tanned pretty fast with this lotion and the tan lasts! :)</li>
            <li> I give this 4.5 star because the girls at my tanning salon recommend this for a richer tan. I have noticed my legs 2 shades darker after using it twice. Smells good also.only downer is that since it has a bronzer in it can leave stains on your clothes or if you don&#x27;t wash your hands after applying the lotion. Other then that its amazing i will definitely be using this lotion from know on.</li>
            <li> Quick deliverry, and great product I was German white and now im taking after my moms side lookin dark! Would definitely recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I love the product Jwoww one and done. I have used other Jwoww products and have been pleased with them as well. The color that I get with this lotion is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Not as good as her black bronzer to me. But I know a lot of people love it. I&#x27;m just don&#x27;t get what all the hype is about</li>
            <li> THIS LOTION IS EXPIRED !!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Really upset that my product is expired.</li>
            <li> Everything was great with the product until I used it. It was very runny no matter how many times I shook it up. The product is a fake. Compared to the salons, it&#x27;s obvious. I&#x27;m very disappointed I wasted money buying this product.</li>
            <li> I have used it a couple times in the bed and can tell the difference. My color is more complete and more lasting in between sessions.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! Goes on evenly and smells amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and cdefinitely can definitely see a lot of color! I noticed color within the first couple visits.</li>
            <li> This lotion came to me in excellent condition and sooner than expected the lotion it self  smells really good and it doesn&#x27;t leave me itchy or stain my hands I did notice a smell after I tanned but it went away within 30mins this lotion is very good I used the first jwow last year and got really dark like black dark brown dark and I&#x27;m really pale skinned naturally  I used this lotion today and haven&#x27;t tanned all winter and I can tell I&#x27;m 2shades darker after the first time I used it  I recommend this lotion to anyone who wants a rich dark brown tan and it being a bronzer lotion getting into a actual bronzing bed will intensify it 10x</li>
            <li> This lotion has to be fake...I&#x27;ve got a tan faster not using any lotion. Very disappointed so far and I won&#x27;t be wasting money on this again.</li>
            <li> Great color after my first use, only tanned for 10 minutes and saw a difference. I love the smell of the lotion and had no after tan scent which is a huge plus! Great product!</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid of trying this out that I might look like an ompa lompa, but it gives a nice color in one tanning session. The smell is fabulous! It doesn&#x27;t turn me streaky either.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!!! It doesn&#x27;t make you feel dried out and it makes you smell good instead of smelling like burnt skin!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It smells wonderful, and you can get it so much cheaper on Amazon than at the salon. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed the dramatic results like others have. This product is just ok for me and I would probably not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing tanning lotion I have ever used! Don&#x27;t let the name think your going to turn black, I promise you won&#x27;t. But I can promise you will turn a beautiful golden heathy glow. You won&#x27;t be sticky at all in drys in the bed. There is no funny during the tan smell, out of the bottle smell, after the tan smell, or in the shower smell. The way you do with other tanning lotions. You will not be disappointed! It leaves your skin silly smooth thanks to the yogurt base.</li>
            <li> A great price for a great lotion. I do not experience the streaking that others wrote about but I do have a base tan. I do enjoy the smell!</li>
            <li> The product smells good not like the other that leave your skin smelling burnt. Moisturizing at the same time as well.</li>
            <li> my daughter was extremely impressed with the product. she said it didn&#x27;t seem to work as she heard it would.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product and I am in love with it.  It wasn&#x27;t as instant tan like they told me at the salon, it took a couple of hours, but I am a shade darker just like they told me I would be.  The smell is great also.  I wasn&#x27;t sure it could be as good as the JWOW Black bronzier, but it is.  Its well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am very pale.&lt;br /&gt;I put this lotion on thicker skin (legs and arms) and another lotion with SPF on back, chest, neck, and face.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a tint of bronzer, you shouldn&#x27;t wear white clothing after you use the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I went to the tanning bed ever other day for a month and I got a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Very impressed. Definitely a one and done product, I tan quickly and easily and this gave me some extra color after just one session - can&#x27;t wait to see the ongoing results.</li>
            <li> Works well for moisturizing, the bronzing effect does not work. Smells pretty bad after as well. I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> my skin looks great after 5 sessions at the tanning salon. i have received so many complements of how beautiful my skin looks.</li>
            <li> One and your done is all it says it is.  I have cut my trips to the salon in half and I&#x27;m still getting color.  The smell is fruity but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> One and done you would think I would be really dark but Im not. Its ok. I would never pay full price for it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite tanning lotions so far and I have purchased many!  Very pleasant smell and is not sticky.  I get a very good tan when I use this lotion!</li>
            <li> As described, great price... Fast shipping. Fresh scent and works great. Very satisfied... Beats tanning salon prices any day!!! I will definitely be purchasing more. I recommend the product as well as the seller!!! A++++</li>
            <li> Seen results after first tan! Would recommend to other tanners. And the price was $20+ cheaper than the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. its the fastest tanning lotion i&#x27;ve ever used. It feels great and smells great. I also have to after tan moisturizer and it great as well. Great buy from amazon vs paying an arm and leg at the tanning salon!!!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite lotion, will always use this one tried switching but ended up giving it away</li>
            <li> This is the first yr  I&#x27;ve used this product, it gives a lovely tan, moisturizers the skin and smells divine</li>
            <li> I have purchased JWoww tanning products in the past and loved them so I purchased this one and am so pleased. The smell is amazing and i got a beautiful dark tan after only a couple of tanning sessions. Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> Overall this lotion is not what I expected!! I did get a decent tan with it though. BUT it is very thick and sticky!! It says there is a fruity scent to it , doesn&#x27;t really smell all that great. Probably will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> works great for me and has improved my tan! I would recommend it to any one and im pretty pale when I started never made me orange and has nice smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work miracles like some of the other reviews said but it works. I was tan within 3 sessions. The smell is amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave oily residues. I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I loved this lotion. It has helped me get a dark tan &amp; the smell is wondeful! I tan before going to the gym &amp; gym partner asked what spray/perfume I had on &amp; it was this lotion! Good stuff..def. recommend it!</li>
            <li> Jwoww tanning lotion has always been a favorite, and one and done doesn&#x27;t disappoint!  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the orangey bronzer.  If you don&#x27;t already have an established tan I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used JWoww lotion in the past and I really liked it.  But definitely not this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not recommend this to anyone nor will I buy this ever again.  It may have even turned me off from her tanning products all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was so dry after the few times I used it.  I also didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> This lotion is just okay.  I was excited to try another tanning lotion, since I got sick of the smell on the one I knew worked great (Solid Black).  The smell isn&#x27;t all that great, kinda cheap smelling.  Not fruity like described.  It&#x27;s more of a floral smell to me.  The bronzer isn&#x27;t noticeable.  I have the cheeky bronzer made by Australlian Gold and paid half the price.  This isn&#x27;t any better and no way does it smell as good.  I had run out of the Millenium Solid Black 100x and got bored of that scent.  The Solid Black does the job way better for those who want a nice brown tan.  This is weak and doesn&#x27;t smell great.  I won&#x27;t be sad when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how dark I got so quickly. Especially since its hard for me to tan, being such a pale person. I will definitely keep buying this.</li>
            <li> Great bronzer for indoor tanning. I have red hair and am fairly fair skinned. It gives me great color, much like all of the JWOWW products. Smells okay, but worth the tan.</li>
            <li> Wife and mother in law aw both said it stinked.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this lotion! By far the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used yet! I did notice isn&#x27;t does smell a bit different than the first one I bought at the tanning salon. Either way no streaks, smells amazing and boosts tan to get a quicker tan!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptic about ordering this lotion from the internet based on many reviews of various tanning lotions being fake. My experience with this lotion has been a great one I have gotten really dark with this lotion alone. It smells ok, I&#x27;ve smelled better lotions but it&#x27;s not horrible. All in all the lotion works great and give me great color so with that being said I will purchase again. Before and after photos below. Standing pic before, sitting pic after.</li>
            <li> Smells good and you get dark results even after the first time using it. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t explain enough good things about this product. Has a smooth feeling when put on, better than lotion. Doesn&#x27;t smell at all after you&#x27;re done tanning. I only tan once a week and the color stays for days. I&#x27;m already on my second bottle of this stuff, it lasts a pretty good amount of time. I can&#x27;t imagine using any other lotion</li>
            <li> It didnt do much for me. It Does smell amazing tho and it beats the expensive price from tanning salons.</li>
            <li> I usually love Jwoww&#x27;s lotions her black bronzer is my favorite so i decided to give this a try, the smell of the lotion in the bottle is not my favorite but once you put it on and get heated up in your tanning bed it smells phenomenal.  does tan you but not as well as her black bronzer.. does not make you orange either</li>
            <li> Not happy with it. Doesnt tan like I wanted it too</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I have tried other tanning lotions in the past (Masquerade, Spellbound) and they don&#x27;t compare to this one! After tanning twice with this lotion, I am noticibly darker and look like I have laid out in the sun ALL day even though it&#x27;s February. I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> This product sucks! Not worth what you pay! I&#x27;ve been tanning for a month and it hasn&#x27;t helped me at all I&#x27;ve bought cheaper ones that work better.</li>
            <li> I  will not buy this lotion again.  I had been tanning indoors for 20 years and I thought o give this product a try.  It does not work, the tan this product gives you is close to none.  Do not waste your money buying this lotion. I will not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion! Smells so good! Gives great color! I will always buy this lotion! Terrific product! I highly recommend this lotion! It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I have a tanning bed at home and have used tons of different lotions.  This one is one I would purchase again.  The bronzing works well and the smell doesn&#x27;t leave the funky after tanning smell I hate.  The initial smell is decent, it smells like fruit mixed with beer..? is that possible? I thought I was crazy, but my husband agreed with me.  After I&#x27;ve put it on, I never smell that again so it&#x27;s not a problem.  Ultimately, I feel it was worth the price and I love the smoothness of it.  I</li>
            <li> Definitely One &amp; Done.  Love this lotion.  The smell is artificial smelling but it does provide intense bronzing.  My salon sells it for $80+!  Great deal here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells awful!! like really strong pear perfume. Gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m sure it gives great color but didn&#x27;t even want to use it cause it smelled so bad!!</li>
            <li> It is great. Came fast. It is expired but seems fine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, after buying black at the tanning salon I was left extemly streaky, almost like I had a bad spray on tan.  With one use of this it started to fade,  now after 3 my skin is completely even. I like the smell and the moisture it gives my skin. Will definitely be buying again when my bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> quick shipping, great product, I would recommend this product to anyone that wants a good dark tan and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like the smell, it is different, but love the bronzer in it!  It is a great product, like all JWOWW Products.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  The smell is great and I get the results that I expected after reading about the product. Would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion. Gets you dark in 2 sessions. Tan lasts a long time! Love it. Deff will buy again!</li>
            <li> I am nice and golden bronzed with this stuff. It also smells completely amazing. No bad after smell after a tanning session. I&#x27;m very happy about that.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews before purchasing. I got the lotion and started using it. When it wasn&#x27;t giving me any color, I checked the expiration date and it expired 5 months ago. Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle tanning product.  But it is a great one!  I have used it several times now and see only a slight difference.  Maybe I just need to give it more time?</li>
            <li> Wish I would have purchased it sooner to use it a few more times befor my vacation.  I had been tanning with another lotion and with this one could see better results in just two uses. I found it good to switch up my lotions.  Would have given it a 5 but since I have not used it more then 2 times had to give it a 4. I like it so far. :)</li>
            <li> I go tanning about 3 times a week. When I received this lotion I had only been tanning 2 times prior. Within 3 uses of this product there was a significant change in my coloring. The lotion smells great! You don&#x27;t smell like burnt fleash after you get out of the bed. I love the JWoww line and will go back to her products again and again!</li>
            <li> I read previous reviews in which people stated that they didn&#x27;t like it. I thought I would try it anyway and I really liked it. It&#x27;s really moisturizing without being heavy or greasy feeling. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was the scent. It&#x27;s ok but not as good as some of the other JWOWW lotions. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!! Shipping &amp; store customer service was great. Beats paying the retail prices. Didn&#x27;t get that orange color that you do from some bronzes. Can&#x27;t say I would buy it again as I usually never purchase the same lotion twice.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion! I just used it a few times and had great results!! Love my natural looking tan! Thanks</li>
            <li> Today was the first day i tried this lotion and i absolutly love it it smells great and the name says it all and it leaves your skin smooth so it doesnt dry out i will be buying this again soon ..</li>
            <li> Not only is this product amazing it smells and works great too! I wanted to buy it at the salon but they were charging ridiculous prices and I found it online for at least 25$ cheaper!! It smells amazing and I saw immediate results after just one use. It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and it&#x27;s by far the best tanning lotion I have used yet. The amount of lotion that comes in the bottle is perfect for the price! Sometimes you see lotions that are 12oz and charging like 30$! But this is PERFECT! Definitely recommend to anyone who loves tanning, or JWOWW (:</li>
            <li> Tanning lotion arrived on time and is a great product!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying in stores, however was near expiration date.</li>
            <li> love it and this is my go to lotion&lt;br /&gt;I am very pale and it helped me get a great tan</li>
            <li> This product truly works if you want a deep dark tan from the tanning bed.  In only a few sessions, I was really dark.  Very happy customer.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion by far! I have used lots of products and this leaves your skin feeling silky smooth, it feels like it tightens your skin and you have a beautiful color. I will only use this product from now on, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it staining your clothes, it&#x27;s awsome!!</li>
            <li> Works good, however I noticed more or an &amp;#34;orange tan&amp;#34; as opposed to browning &amp; bronzing. I would not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Love this product.... Works better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Was ok at first. Eventually it just stopped giving me color. I have olive skin and this never took me any shades darker (i go 3-4 times a week). Smell is ok, but I felt like I smelled like burnt skin after.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion it really gets my tan going!!!! Definitely recommend!! So worth the money!!! Works really fast dark tan</li>
            <li> Within 3 uses I&#x27;m unbelievably tan, and it smells incredible. Especially after the tanning bed, most lotions leave a burnt skin smell but this one is light and fruity, I&#x27;m so glad I bought this. Not to mention I got it within 4 days of ordering it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this tanning lotion to anyone that wants dark, even color. Great results. I love all of her products.</li>
            <li> Probably the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! It smells great, the bronzer is great ( not that orange glow some give you ). Very happy with it and will be reordering when  I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> I am all golden tan and ready for summer smell is good to. A a a a a a a</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! Literally go to the salon once and have noticeable color! I&#x27;m fair skinned and do not tan easily, but this stuff is awesome. Not sure how legit it is buying if offline...</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and couldn&#x27;t find a lotion that would help me achieve a darker look. Have used it 3 times now at the tanning bed and noticed a difference every time. Highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different lotios and they either smelled horrible or I didn&#x27;t like the way they worked! This tanning lotion smells great and works awesome! I would defiently recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> No burning just tanning. Really moisturized my skin. Didn&#x27;t have full results till more like the second use. Would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their skin nice while tanning.</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to get it for her. She had nothing but good things to say about it. I also like that she is now brown as a biscuit.</li>
            <li> I love the way this lotion smells but after a couple weeks of use I&#x27;m not much darker. Not the best for getting dark and not drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and gives a natural tan color!!! Will use this lotion again!!! Goes on smooth and its not sticky!!</li>
            <li> I got this lotion after a friend suggested it. It was half of what I would have paid at the salon. I noticed some color after one session (7 minutes) and after going 4 times, people have been complementing my tan. It smells great, makes your skin so soft, and provides the perfect amount of bronzed as well. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an ex tanning salon employee so trust me I have tried every lotion imaginable lol This honestly is my favorite tanning lotion of all and I have been tanning forever! Its smells awesome, gives amazing color that you will notice after one tan, so the one and done name definitely is true! I haven&#x27;t had any streaking, not orange, nothing negative to say at  all! Try it, if you love a great tan you will love this!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion and absolutely love it! No dry skin and I could see my skin getting much darker after only 3 uses.  Love the price too!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It works great smekks good and makes my skin so soft. I noticed a difference in my tan the first time i used it. Ive used many different lotions but im going to stick with thus one.</li>
            <li> I have my own tanning bed.  And have tried lots of products.  This one really works in one tan you can see a real difference.  Put it on then let it dry a bit.  Four stars because I don&#x27;t really like the smell.  But tanning lotions do their best I guess.  At least I don&#x27;t smell like a coconut.  So I tan and then shower.  I think it is an older version but have tried others and go back to this.  Especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Only reason im giving it 4 &amp; not 5 stars is the lotion was expired which I kinda assumed because of the price but it didnt say anything about being expired on the description. knowing just how expired would be nice .</li>
            <li> great lotion smells good last a long time get super dark with this lotion some times i mix it with a tingle lotion for even darker results</li>
            <li> This lotion was expired by several months, very disappointed because I paid $25.00! I tried it anyways and the smell is great but other than that I don&#x27;t like it. It does not give you an instant color like more bronzers I&#x27;ve used. Will not buy again!</li>
            <li> Great product, great tan!</li>
            <li> Smells good, just didn&#x27;t bronze as fast as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get me as tan as other lotions but it&#x27;s still a nice lotion (I like Solid Black by Millennium better.) I think the color wears off pretty quickly, but it&#x27;s a good lotion to start your base tan!</li>
            <li> Today was the first time I used this product while tanning in a tanning bed.  It worked pretty well and I noticed immediate color.  I&#x27;ve used several other products that were more expensive and they didn&#x27;t seem to give me the color that Jwoww did.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it and probably will again.</li>
            <li> Woww! This tanning lotion is true to its name I was completely dark after using it only 4 times. Has a great smell you don&#x27;t have that burnt tan smell after tanning. This product goes above and beyond my expectations!! Recommend using with forever after tanning moisturizer</li>
            <li> Jwoww&#x27;s products do not disappoint. I had her last bronzer and ran out. So I ordered this one. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and it really helps boost your tan.</li>
            <li> One of the best tanning lotions I&#x27;ve ever used! Smells great when applying but does get a little of that smelly post-tan smell but it&#x27;s not terrible. Very reasonably priced on Amazon as well. Buy this lotion-you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!!!</li>
            <li> Smell good! Enjoy the way it feels.  Use less of this lotion than prior sun bed lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tanning lotion addict! This stuff really works and smells amazing which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> The best tanning lotion I have used yet. I am the whitest girl out there, but after just a week of using this in the tanning bed I am really seeing significant color! And I love that it keeps my skin moisturized and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> I bought this by accident  ( I was trying to order the Jwowww black, after a co worker expressed her delight) back in June 2014. I was trying to get some color for our family vacation to the beach. I only had 3 weeks. I am very pale and am hard to tan. I usually burn. After using this product within the first week, there were notices. After 3 weeks in a bed ( and I even used it on the beach in the natural sun) I was VERY DARK. The locals even commented how lovely my color was ( they thought I was from there and or born with the color I had!!!) I felt sexy. The lotuon went on smooth and even. Smelt very lovely. I am about to buy my 2nd bottle! Very pleased</li>
            <li> Not my fav but it did the trick. I usually use Kardashian brand lotion but someone recommended this one so I thought I would give it a try. It has a tendency to leave you a little orangey rather bronzed looking and most definitely stains the heck out of your hands no matter how fast you wash them off after applying.</li>
            <li> This is a great tanning lotion! There was immediate results, I was a darker color after the first time using it! The smell is great before and after tanning, and it leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried every JWOWW Bronzer on the market and I am NEVER disappointed with the results. Top 3 reasons to buy: 1. SMELLS GREAT! 2. noticeable difference in my tan (I up&#x27;ed my visits to the salon to see what this lotion could do... I went 4 times in a week as opposed to my usually twice a week routine, and friends started to ask if I had vacationed to the Bahamas or something. LOL.) and last, but not least, 3. the &amp;#34;after tan slime&amp;#34; is minimal. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion now for a month and it works great. You get dark even just with one tan</li>
            <li> I used this once and when I got out of the tanning bed it looked like I got back from vacation I was a good dark Color and I use this lotion every time I go I love it this is a must have.</li>
            <li> It really is a good tanning lotion, I&#x27;ve been going tanning for years and this really gives a nice tan glow to your skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> love JWOWW tanning lotions</li>
            <li> I had to buy this lotion when I saw the price. The same bottle costs $65 at my tanning salon. This lotion has a nice bronzer and smells great. I definitely noticed a dark tan after using this lotion and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Loved it from the start and would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Once I read the reviews it was the first bottle I purchased when I started using tanning beds.  It worked great and it made me nice and tanned after just a couple of sessions.  I also loved the smell....</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not a Jersey Shore fan.  Period.  I&#x27;ve tried to watch an episode here and there, but I just couldn&#x27;t do it.  The behaviors of the participants of the show that&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen in the media have been very... disappointing, so I really didn&#x27;t want to purchase a tanning lotion or bronzer that was developed by a company that hired one of the show&#x27;s stars to put her name on their product and endorse it for them.  But, due to a quickly upcoming event and my need to tan for a summer dress I plan to wear to the event, I decided to give this Jwoww tanning product a try since it had so many positive reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using Glam Slam and although it has been working very well on the majority of my body, my legs weren&#x27;t getting as dark as I would have liked.  So, I purchased a bottle of Jwoww One and Done: Advance Black Bronzer here at Amazon.com (A LOT cheaper than my tanning salon sells it for) and used it on my legs. It&#x27;s is just a smidge runnier than Glam Slam, but it went only easily and quickly absorbed into my skin.  I only tanned for 9 minutes and I did see a darker difference after a single tanning session.  I used it again about 48 hours later, and it worked great.  I&#x27;m still using Glam Slam for the rest of my body because I don&#x27;t want to be too dark up top, but I do like my legs darker so I will continue using One and Done on my legs.  Now, I took off one star because of the smell.  If you like super fruity and sweet scents, you may not have a problem.  I actually went to a coffee place after tanning and got a compliment from the guy taking my order about how great I smelled.  However, after I tan, the smell is so incredibly strong and overwhelming, it gives me a headache.  Like I said, this product does work and I would recommend it, but be warned about the smell.  I&#x27;m new to tanning so I&#x27;m not sure if all tanning lotions smell super sweet and fruity, (Glam Slam smells like that too) but if I don&#x27;t get used to the smell, I may have to try other products.</li>
            <li> The best tanning lotion I have tried!! With this lotion I can notice a change of color with one session!!</li>
            <li> Wish I could like this more cuz the lotion smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky however every time I use it I get a horrible rash from it!! Not sure if the bottle is bad from the seller or if it&#x27;s the actual product</li>
            <li> smells great but not sure if its working the best - I have gotten a lot tanner faster with other lotions.</li>
            <li> Best tanning product I have ever used. Kind of amazed that one session or a short time used in the sun really does show a noticeably difference!</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion. I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> It smells good. But it definitely didn&#x27;t bronze me or get me dark any faster than any other tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried. I personally prefer the Snooki one. Smells better, works better.</li>
            <li> I love this Bronzer, it works great! Just don&#x27;t put it on your face, it made my skin breakout and too much color. But for the rest of the body, it&#x27;s just fab!</li>
            <li> Great Bronzer! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i am so pale i glow in the dark. cute, right? not so much. i bought this in hopes of the &#x27;one and done&#x27; idea (i know silly.) and of course it takes more than one session to be done but i certainly have gotten color in  3 uses :) i am very pleased with the product and will repurchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different tanning lotion but by far this is my all time favorite. I already have a good base but this just takes it up a notch! YES,.....</li>
            <li> Lotion is okay, but i feel its not very effective for me. And the smell is okay going intot he bed, but coming out of the bed not so much. And I have used other lotions that when done tanning you didnt smell that bad.</li>
            <li> I got the lotion in 2 days like they said. An there was nothing wrong with it. It smells FAB!! I also got a nice dark tan an its long lasting too!!! 😀👍👍👍 I&#x27;m pleased with this product!!!💋</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion...it works great and I feel very sexy after I tan in the tanning bed... I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion, it arrives fast and in new packaging so you don&#x27;t have to wonder if it has been watered down. After my first session with this I was literally 4 shades darker, I also was in a bronzing bed so this may be different in a regular bed. I have used this product for a month and a half and I am dark, not orange and it is not streaky. The after smell is not exactly grand but hey, you can shower a couple hours after the bed so I don&#x27;t focus on the smell of the lotion, I care about the results. Also be careful putting this on your face when I did it irritated the skin on just my face for some reason, I am not sure why I had this reaction  but I use a different lotion on my face. All in all I still love this lotion and I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> The lotion is great, smells really good and works great. Ive gotten really dark.&lt;br /&gt;Over all i recommend this lotion to anyone who wants to be dark.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t darkened that much at all and the bottle is almost gone - smells good though</li>
            <li> I love this so much. It cost $ 90.00 at the tanning salon but this was a awesome bargain and works so great, I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, and gives me a pretty good tan.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s also not my favorite.  But I don&#x27;t really like pairs sooo yeah lol.  But it doesn&#x27;t leave a gross ato either.  :)  Works very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid tanner (usually go 5 or 6 times a week) and have been using the Adore lotion. I bought this one on a whim just to try it out. I LOVE it. I would repurchase just for the smell alone; it smells amazing! I noticed after a few uses my tan looked more saturated and deeper in color. The lotion didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy at all. I would recommend this lotion to anyone who is looking to take their tan to the next level.  I will definitely repurchase this item and pry try out some other J WOWW products.</li>
            <li> Tried it once and it sucked.  Then I noticed that it was expired.</li>
            <li> I love almost all of the snooki and jwoww lotion. I saw TONS of amazing reviews on this so I thought I&#x27;d try it. I really wasn&#x27;t impressed. I&#x27;ve tanned with it probably 10 times recently and haven&#x27;t seen much color. Definitely not one and done. I would stick with their other products. You get color a lot faster.</li>
            <li> Smells great out of the bottle but has a horrible after smell. The bronzer was barely noticeable. Gave it 2 stars because it does make your skin smooth. Just not for me</li>
            <li> this product says &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34; I have yet to see any results as product says, wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product either:(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far and can already tell a difference in my tan. I have been using Paint It Black for the past 5-6 weeks and that got me to a really great base tan, but I couldn&#x27;t seem to break past a certain peak of my tan. Not with this Jwoww one and done lotion! Now I am breaking the tanning peak and the color is GORGEOUS. Lotion is perfect, not greasy/oily, smells wonderful before after and during but it&#x27;s not an overwhelming fragrance, it&#x27;s just right. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love the lotion! It works really well! The smell is not my favorite but I love it otherwise..I have started getting pretty dark in just a week!</li>
            <li> I had run out of jwowws black bronzer lotion which I loved. So at the salon I asked which wad the best, I wanted to try a packet. She suggested this one. Sells for $70 at salon. I bought a packetfor $8 &amp; I loved it. I do have to say I don&#x27;t see much of a difference between this and the other one. But I only go tanning once every two weeks!!! I remember when I&#x27;d have to go tanning every two days to stay tan. My skin smelt burnt and I could never brown like I do in the sun. I have Mediterranean skin so I brown pretty easy in the sun. Before I give reasons why this is the best I also have to give the tanning salon I go to a lot of credit too. They always change the bulbs and even before the lotion I&#x27;d only go once a week.&lt;br /&gt;So, I love the smell of this lotion (not strong like most tanning lotions and everyone can telltell that you just went tanning)&lt;br /&gt;No matter how much I put on it rubs in so nicely like a nice lotion would, doesn&#x27;t feel caked on. Matter of fact after you tan you can&#x27;t even tell you used lotion on your face because its not greasy at all. I hate feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Its almost like my tan gets darker three days later without tanning (I always get asked, did u just go tanning. And usually the answer is no I haven&#x27;t in at least a week.) So definitely keeps your tan longer, which will save you a ton of money on tanning visits&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, since I started using this I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on my skins complexion. I got shingles last year and have been struggling to clear up blotches and scars. So I also tan to dry out my skin. Before I used this lotion my face would look blotchy and it was almost like it intensified the imperfections. and I&#x27;d still have to use make up to cover up my face. Now, I am so excited literally my face is glowing, shiny and my scars are fading so fast, almost gone! I was told they&#x27;d never go away. I do have to say I believe this tanning lotion is also good for your skin. I&#x27;m not sure what it has in it or even if that&#x27;s one of the things that makes this lotion so popular.&lt;br /&gt;As for the delivery it came before the expected date in a nice protected cushioned package and the top of the lotion was sealed.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of people say don&#x27;t buy lotion online because they water it down, etc. this is my second time buying online and if they do water it down, it is still the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I paid a third of the salon price. No I strongly believe the Sellers who have great ratings, who are trusted do not put anything else in it. Obviously salon employees will tell you that because they want the profit, its well known salons way over price their lotions. Just review the product and the seller and you will be happy with your purchase :)</li>
            <li> I was hoping for faster results of a deeper tan from it. however that did not happen. I do like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> used it one time on a cloudy day for one and half hours it is the best stuff ive ever used considering im redheaded and extremly pale</li>
            <li> Because of the reviews I had really high expectations for this lotion, but honestly I&#x27;m not quite as impressed as I&#x27;d like to be. I&#x27;ll prolbably keep trying different lotions until I find that one that just speaks to me. It does make me really soft and the smell is citrus-y but I&#x27;m not completely wowwed!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite by far of all the tanning lotions I have tried.  Just enough bronzer to notice but not too much to leave streaks.  This is my go to lotion!</li>
            <li> As an experienced tanner, I have tried everything.  All of JWOWW&#x27;s other lotions, all of Snooki&#x27;s lotions, all of Pauly D&#x27;s lotions - you get the drift.  THIS is - by far - my favorite!  The name says it all, one and done.  I&#x27;ve lessened my sessions and now only go about once a week (in prep for summer) and this stuff makes me look like I go 7 days a week!  Nice deep tan, not orange AT ALL.  Would definitely recommend and will order again and again.  It also smells nice.  I tan on my lunch break so I don&#x27;t want to go back to work smelling &#x27;burnt&#x27; and this is like a nice subtle perfume.  Lastly, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  The price for this in the salon I go to is $86.00!!  Five stars!</li>
            <li> great product. I am very light skinned and I have never really tanned in a salon. After 3-4 visits I was way darker. does leave a little stain between fingers after applying BUT does wash off easily! smell is not overwhelming either! love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I just started tanning, and have only used it 3 times, so far.If you don&#x27;t have the time to go tanning too often, this is the product you need : )</li>
            <li> Okay, I have SO MANY good things to say! First off, I am very please with Sunless Deals. I bought this lotion from them and I didn&#x27;t get a rip-off lotion, I got the real deal. Now, the lotion in general is wonderful. I already have a base tan and you can still see a color difference with every use. I don&#x27;t personally like the smell, BUT! I think the way it smells AFTER you tan is nice. It&#x27;s super moisturizing and a little goes a long way. The first time I used this, I put a lot on because it was so runny and I figured it wasn&#x27;t going to be very moisturizing, but I was wrong.. when I got out of the tanning bed, I was syill kinda wet, so yeah, a little goes a long way. Also, even though I put too much on my first time, I recieved ZERO streaks which is totally rad 8) GIVE THIS STUFF A SHOT AND BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!! :) :) :)</li>
            <li> I tried it today and long story short, I loved it!  I recommend this lotion to everyone. This was my first time tanning and my first tan ever and I literally shocked my friends when i came out!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it smells decliious but it has some really attractive ingredients and i got a nice bronze and dark tan. Def recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have never been so tan in my life! I go tanning for two to three months out of the year for the past 5 years and have never seen such amazing results before! I noticed I was getting noticeably darker after the first three days of tanning! This lotion works wonders and smells great too! Highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t as great as the title describes.</li>
            <li> works very well at the tanning salon and a very good price compared to the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t to thrilled with the smell at first but after tanning with it I didn&#x27;t mind the smell. I can tell a big difference in the color of my tan after using this product only a couple times.</li>
            <li> i have been using this lotion almosyt a month and have not got tan by it ask suntan city why and they told me to open the bottle and they opened theres the color is so off mine that i bought from you guys was pale tan and the one from the tanning salon was light tan so i got a knock off bottle that some one tampered with im very pissed will never buy your products again</li>
            <li> I bought this because people rant and rave about the yogurt base.  I don&#x27;t like it as much as silicone lotions.  Unlike silicone lotions, it doesn&#x27;t spread over my skin very well so I have to use more than usual.  However, it is an excellent bronzer.  I got results within 3 sessions! And it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> As a Tanning Salon owner for 10 years I thought a review from someone who has not only sold many different lotions but has also tried many might be helpful.  I am always looking for a new/better lotion for my personal use.  When I heard about One And Done I was excited to give it a try.  I tan 3-4 days/week and was fairly dark when I tried it for the first time.  To be honest I was not expecting to see a dramatic change in the level of my tan.  I was however pleasantly and greatly surprised!  After just one use my legs were at a level of bronze I had not seen since my outdoor summer tan!  The backs of my hands finally have some real color!  Even tanning in my 12 minute bed with all new bronzing lamps has not given me such a gorgeous bronze look!  Unlike others, I love the scent of the lotion.  I detest lotions with that tropical scent as I don&#x27;t care to go through my day smelling like I just got out of a tanning bed.  One And Done has a pleasant none tropical scent which to me smells like a subtle perfume.  It has been nearly 9 hours since I tanned and I still smell great!  One And Done is my lotion of choice from now on.  I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to achieve a level of darkness that they don&#x27;t have the ability to achieve naturally.</li>
            <li> I purchased this recently and have really grown to love it! Absolute great bronzer, and blends very well! The only part I could complain about is the scent could be toned down a notch, but it&#x27;s really not that intolerable. I would highly recommend for a great quality, less expensive option. Much more affordable than salon lotion.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion has a nice bronzer that doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes after you tan and it smells nice to. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I really expected to see a difference when tanning. To me, it&#x27;s just the same as the other tanning lotions, your just paying for the name brand.</li>
            <li> I am still fairly new to tanning in a salon - I used Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow lotion, in the past but that&#x27;s it. So, I decided to go tanning and did a bunch of research. A lot of people recommended using an accelerator or bronzing lotion. I decided to go with the bronzing lotion because supposedly it can show results quicker This stuff was rated the best from what I saw, so I took a chance. It has its pros and cons. It can be streaky and sometimes it flakes off, just like a sunless tanning lotion. You can see results fairly quickly, but once you take a shower, a lot of the color washes off. As of right now, I&#x27;m going to continue using it until its gone, but I am looking for an accelerator. Now, I will say, I don&#x27;t think the lotion itself is bad - it smells really good, goes on great, dries fairly quick, leaves my skin feeling WAY more softer and smoother than before. It has a lot of pros. I just don&#x27;t like the bronzing effect - its not long enough lasting and it can be kind of streaky.</li>
            <li> Great lotion and PRICE!!! Did not make me sweaty or smell after tanning like others do and its got a great bronzer!!! Will buy buy again</li>
            <li> I really liked this lotion when I first started tanning for the season but after about 15 tans... over a month&#x27;s time period I feel like I hit a plateau and I am not getting any darker with it. Great lotion to build a base tan, but not so great to get you that \\&quot;dark\\&quot; summer color I was hoping for. Smell is fine, nothing overpowering.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great. If you purchase the one that is fulfilled by Amazon, it is definitely NOT fake. I thought the smell was a little odd at first, but I have gotten used to it and love it! It is very fruity. Now, I am extremely dark and this lotion also makes my skin really soft and smooth. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Bronzer.  I&#x27;ve never had a dark tan before in my life until using this product.  I started seeing results after the 1st use.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice, smells good, and my sensitive skin has never had a bad reaction to it. It does take a little while to build a good tan though. I guess it depends on what kind of bed you&#x27;re using. I usually go for the top 2 at the salon. Platinum &amp; Platinum Plus beds.</li>
            <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t what I expected! It smells awesome but one and done doesn&#x27;t speak for itself! I should def be a lot darker than I am! Don&#x27;t think I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Noticeable color difference after a 12 min session in a level one bed. No funky after tan smell or orange glow!!! Try it!!!</li>
            <li> Bottle was expired when I received it.</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; I use it and it seems to work pretty well. I may try something with a little bit darker bronzer but over all we were satisfied with the results it gives for a starter.</li>
            <li> The tanning salon tried to sell me this for $60. Glad I found it on Amazon.  Like the smell of it and works really well.</li>
            <li> great product&lt;br /&gt;great price</li>
            <li> I used this lotion for 2 weeks and it was amazing!!! even after a couple times using it I noticed a difference, the smell is GREAT to!&lt;br /&gt;My skin was so much softer after using it, I highly recommend this product, definitely getting this again! :)</li>
            <li> I am a pretty pale person, and started tanning for my senior pictures. I love this lotion because it instantly makes me look darker without turning me orange. It also doesn&#x27;t smell terrible and leaves my skin feeling soft. You can&#x27;t beat the price either! In the tanning salon I go to, it sells for around $110.</li>
            <li> I loved this product, it got me dark fast and had a great smell! It lasted me 2 months worth! And was very moisturizing! I would totally recommend!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Great product, no problems, quick to ship, Item exactly as explained in the description. well worth the money, great price.</li>
            <li> Love it! Gets me so dark</li>
            <li> Used for the first time today, and I could see almost instant results by the time I got home! Smells amazing, and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on my skin. Will by again!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It provides great color and is a good moisturizer as well.  I will buy again in the future</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this new tanning lotion. I was sad to find it very sticky after tanning. I also didn&#x27;t really care for the after smell. Bronzer works well, but there is better lotion than this one. I&#x27;ve purchased lots of other lotions and they have all worked well. One and done is not a lotion I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning every week for about 6 months now, and I definitely hit my tanning plateau. I was looking for something to take me a little darker using the lowest bed at the salon. The first use I walked out and noticed I was instantly dark, not orange, but a deep dark! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and still notice a difference every time I leave the bed. The one minor thing to know is that if you put too much on,  it can become streaky. I really put wayyy too much on thank the streaks were not permanent I just rubbed it in when I got into sunlight and was fine. Now I use just enough as if I was applying regular body lotion and I&#x27;m in love! Never used anything this good, and over the years with bouts of tanning I tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> I must say that I received this so quickly. The shipping is awesome, so if anyone needs it within a few days, they are the bomb.&lt;br /&gt;As for the color, maybe I am just to light skinned. But the color (applied twice in two days) has not covered up my bathing suit marks from last summer. It doesn&#x27;t seem to go on very dark. I have always used (past 25 yrs) that I buy in a Salon size and it&#x27;s great!!! It is St. Tropez. It is expensive if you buy it from say Ulta, but look on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue with it, as I love the smell and the texture!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference at all. Used better lotions.</li>
            <li> The best tanning lotion. I have tried several lotions, this is my favorite !!!!!</li>
            <li> Good color good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this lotion one star and that&#x27;s simply because it smells good before and after tanning.&lt;br /&gt;That being said: this lotion did NOTHING. I have not gotten any darker. There seems to be no bronzer whatsoever.... I&#x27;m pretty annoyed. Waste of money. I think it&#x27;s safe to assume this is a FAKE...</li>
            <li> This is the first JWoww product I have tried, but I picked it because of the advertisement that it was the best yet. I have fair skin and I was excited about the prospect of getting a tan more quickly. Bottom line, it smelled nice, but I was not impressed at all. I&#x27;ve seen more change in one tanning session with NO lotion than I did using this product. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The name fits this product perfectly.  I bought one bottle and won&#x27;t make the same mistake twice . Private Reserve by Jwoww is much better. Didn&#x27;t get great color from this product and I mainly purchase lotion containing bronzer.</li>
            <li> For the value you get from shopping on amazon, JWOWW&#x27;s One and Done Bronzer is the way to go! After reading such great reviews of this lotion, I had to try it, but it  normally retails for almost $70 in my salon! Oh heck no! But the lotion outdoes itself for the price you can get it for on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not too crazy about the smell. I&#x27;m used to more heavily perfumed lotions and the fragrance isn&#x27;t bad for this one but isn&#x27;t strong either. However, there is a moderate ATO. Not as bad as some others, and other people won&#x27;t be able to smell it, but I definitely could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as bronzing, I was actually a bit disappointed when I first got out the bed. It didn&#x27;t seem to have much of an effect. BUT when i looked two hours later, I noticed a darker glow formed and I could actually see a significant improvement! I could tell my skin was at least one shade darker with just one use! This would be a great lotion to use if you tan 2-4 times per week. It made my skin simply look darker, not orangey or streaky. Make sure you wipe it off your palms and apply to your skin in a circular motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as moisturizing goes, that&#x27;s where I found this lotion to be lacking. My skin didn&#x27;t feel flaky or itchy or dry after but it definitely did not feel moisturized and soft. So I would follow up with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the expired bottles go. Yes, this product can expire. It has a yogurt base. However, the lotion has a shelf life of 18 months after it&#x27;s initial use. According to Australian Gold, the stamp on the bottom is the MANUFACTURING date. NOT the expiration. If you are worried the bottle is expired, add 18 months to the stamped date. If it&#x27;s not 18 months you are fine. Wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if most of the expired claims are tanning salon owners looking to make a profit, as usual. But obviously if something seems off with your lotion, don&#x27;t use it and/or return it.</li>
            <li> Just started back up tanning and this is the first lotion I used, three days later and I&#x27;m already showing lots of color! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love all of Jwowws lotions and this one is just as good as all of her others. It has good bronzers and is very thick and moisturizing. The smell, however, is a little different than most lotions I&#x27;ve used....it smells spicy. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s not good, either.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion at my tanning salon for $72 and I loved it its works so fast I noticed my tan the first time. I knew I would get a better price here so I ordered 3 this lotion does not have any bad sents it works perfectly</li>
            <li> I like tingler more but i love the black bronzers in this it smeels a bit wierd but get you very dark :)</li>
            <li> I loved this product! Worked amazing! I only had to tan a few times to get the perfect tone I wanted! Will be buying more of this product when I run out!</li>
            <li> I am sooo dark just after 4 days! Its a great price too...bc my salon asks 70 dollars for it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it about 6 times and I am already wayy dark. I am very happy with this lotion is smells so good before and after actually using the bed. I&#x27;d highly recommend it especially since I only have to tan once a week now and still get dark.</li>
            <li> This product is great and smells so so good I love the out come of it and it leaves my skin&lt;br /&gt;feeling so moist. Love it.....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way the lotion smells. I got a nice tan from using it, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend purchasing this JWOWW Tanning Lotion.  I have previously used Designer Skin&#x27;s BLACK Tanning Lotion and found it to be much more effective.  The smell of JWOWW is not very appealing - it smells like champagne.  I think you&#x27;re better off buying CoCoa Butter lotion from a drugstore before this lotion!</li>
            <li> This product is really good lt came in so quick and works really well for me I am naturally dark completed and I could tell by one use of this I love this</li>
            <li> Its a nice lotion.. works really well I think. it just doesn&#x27;t have a really good smell to it. Its more of a tanning lotion smell...</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion leaves your skin feeling hydrated and helps you tan to a wonderful shade. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion and thinks it works good.  Might or might not purchase same kind again. Still undecided.  Would like to find a lotion that gets me darker.</li>
            <li> Everything was great!!</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t streak or make me look orange.  I looked darker after the first tan and it gives me really good color.  The smell is a little overpowering.  I will probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> Got this lotion based on these reviews, it was nothing like described. I went from using designer skin brand &#x27;conceited&#x27; lotion and wanted to try this and practically lost all my tan. I would not recommend</li>
            <li> This lotion smells awesome and helps you get a really nice dark even tan. Just make sure to wipe off your hands after you apply it - the bronzer in it will stain your hands if they are not washed after applying it</li>
    </ol>
