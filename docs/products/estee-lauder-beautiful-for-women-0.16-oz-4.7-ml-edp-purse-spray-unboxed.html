            <li>good for the purse to carry with you.</li>
            <li>smells good.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wedding because I wanted to smell beautiful on the most important day of my life!</li>
            <li>Fantastic price, cannot be purchased separately in stores, made my girl happy, cheaper than flowers &amp; lasts a lot longer</li>
            <li>Great product excellent scent, and last for quite some time.</li>
            <li>What can I say, fast shipping and been a fan of Beautiful for many year and will continue, just needed a purse size.  </li>
            <li>This is a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll still be enjoying it through the evening.</li>
            <li>My sister suggested this scent, glad I bought it</li>
            <li>my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>It is the size of a lipstick, and most of that is the lid.  </li>
            <li>I think it perhaps smells better on others than on me.</li>
            <li>So I do not carry it in my purse any more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve forgotten to put my &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It is a delightful fragrance, especially for summer  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>for about ten dollars this was the best purchase i made for myself</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t afford the larger bottles anymore, and this purse size is perfect anyway.  </li>
            <li>Good price for the size, not to mention it is the real thing.</li>
            <li>but I fear for the day that it does spray something important in my purse.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I used to have this years ago, loved it, but this smelled a bit on the old side.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice classic fragrance by Estee Lauder.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!!</li>
            <li>I had been so lucky, they sent me an entirely&lt;br /&gt;different</li>
            <li>Prefect size for my purse.as always Delicious smell and a pleasure to use and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Yes i will buy more in the future</li>
            <li>*)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>fast delivery, and it is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Have trouble keeping top on bottle, and it is always coming off in my purse.</li>
            <li>Considering it only takes a few drops of this amazing perfume to know your wearing it.</li>
            <li>small bottle with a big scent - love it!  </li>
            <li>Came wrapped carefully in bubble wrap and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>This was a clear case of bait and switch.  </li>
            <li>far it hasn&#x27;t sprayed anything</li>
            <li>i can at least smell like i have money again :)</li>
            <li>or I will report you to my State Attorney General.</li>

            <li> small bottle with a big scent - love it!  </li>
            <li> Came wrapped carefully in bubble wrap and shipped quickly.  </li>

            <li> wish they would come down on their prices so i could get a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> A little spritz goes a very long way, so even this smaller (0.16 oz.)</li>
            <li> little smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The item was a \\&quot;mini\\&quot;, have never seen one that small.  </li>
            <li> I keep this small bottle of &amp;#34;Beautiful&amp;#34; in my handbag and pull it out whenever needed.  </li>
            <li> What I received was a very small gold colored purse spray.  </li>
            <li> Then they had the nerve to call me everyday wanting to talk to me about my bad review on them.  </li>
            <li> the sad thing here is that the price of the shipping was twice the spray.</li>
            <li> disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I wore this years ago and thought I&#x27;d try it again...not disappointed!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> IT WOULD BE GREAT TO WRITE A REVIEW FOR THIS PRODUCT .. BUT I NEVER GOT IT AND THE COMPANY NEVER RESPONDED SO I HAD THEM REFUND MY MONEY ON MY CREDIT CARD</li>
            <li> This is a lovely fragrance.  A little spritz goes a very long way, so even this smaller (0.16 oz.) bottle will last me awhile!  Spray on in the morning and you&#x27;ll still be enjoying it through the evening.</li>
            <li> Prefect size for my purse.as always Delicious smell and a pleasure to use and last a long time.Yes i will buy more in the future</li>
            <li> My sister suggested this scent, glad I bought it she has great taste in colognes so I had to purchase only wish I&#x27;d ordered the larger size now.</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume. wish they would come down on their prices so i could get a bigger bottle. i could wear it every day.</li>
            <li> I ordered the item believing it was as appeared.  The item was a \\&quot;mini\\&quot;, have never seen one that small.  It is the size of a lipstick, and most of that is the lid.  I have contacted Amazon twice and told they would not refund unless item was not as described.  Hello, it was!  Seller said they would work with me to resolve, but nothing has been done.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.  I order a lot of items on Amazon, but will not anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a nice classic fragrance by Estee Lauder.  I think it perhaps smells better on others than on me. The chemistry thing! :0)</li>
            <li> Came wrapped carefully in bubble wrap and shipped quickly.  All as advertised...this is a great travel or purse size product.</li>
            <li> Have trouble keeping top on bottle, and it is always coming off in my purse. So I do not carry it in my purse any more.</li>
            <li> I wore this years ago and thought I&#x27;d try it again...not disappointed!  It fits me day or evening and the scent lasts!</li>
            <li> product arrived on time but did not smell the same as when I tried it out in the department store.</li>
            <li> Good price for the size, not to mention it is the real thing. Yes, it is Estee Lauder Beautiful, and yes, it does not come in a box..lol (unboxed). My shipping date EST was ahead of schedule.. good job! &#x3D;*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~Mrs. Reneta Pleasant~~~~</li>
            <li> I love everything about this, wonderful scent, beautiful bottle, good price, BUT.....sometimes the cap comes off in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;So far it hasn&#x27;t sprayed anything but I fear for the day that it does spray something important in my purse.  Otherwise it is fabulous.  Just wish when I had ordered the fullsize bottle of Beautiful I had been so lucky, they sent me an entirely&lt;br /&gt;different Estee Lauder scent that I don&#x27;t even like!</li>
            <li> I keep this small bottle of &amp;#34;Beautiful&amp;#34; in my handbag and pull it out whenever needed.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve forgotten to put my &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; on ... and have left the house unscented.  Good thing I can always reach for it whenever I now need to!</li>
            <li> Great product excellent scent, and last for quite some time. Considering it only takes a few drops of this amazing perfume to know your wearing it.</li>
            <li> It is a delightful fragrance, especially for summer  Will order again when this is used up .......will be soon!!!!  Thanks so much!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. small bottle with a big scent - love it!  I purchased this for my wedding because I wanted to smell beautiful on the most important day of my life!</li>
            <li> What can I say, fast shipping and been a fan of Beautiful for many year and will continue, just needed a purse size.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> What is pictured here is not what I got.  This was a clear case of bait and switch.  What I received was a very small gold colored purse spray.  Not what was pictured.  Then they had the nerve to call me everyday wanting to talk to me about my bad review on them.  Really?  I don&#x27;t have anything to say except don&#x27;t bother me anymore or I will report you to my State Attorney General.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price, cannot be purchased separately in stores, made my girl happy, cheaper than flowers &amp; lasts a lot longer</li>
            <li> for about ten dollars this was the best purchase i made for myself all year lol.  being a mom i can&#x27;t afford the larger bottles anymore, and this purse size is perfect anyway.  fast delivery, and it is the real thing.  thank you -- i can at least smell like i have money again :)</li>
            <li> good for the purse to carry with you. little smaller than I expected.  smells good.  the sad thing here is that the price of the shipping was twice the spray.</li>
            <li> I used to have this years ago, loved it, but this smelled a bit on the old side.  Should&#x27;ve returned it.</li>
