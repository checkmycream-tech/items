            <li>Give it a chance and use it, the smell is so soothing and the oil gives your belly a nice moisturized glow.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling but didn&#x27;t prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>and my wife really liked it.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy all day and it absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>and I think it works since I didnt get any stretch marks, nice, non-invasive smell.</li>
            <li>worked with kids, who are tummy-height and brutally honest.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and luxurious feel to it.</li>
            <li>Liked the oil&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>and I liked to use it all around hip area as well.</li>
            <li>This one is really good so that we appreciating and rated as top class.</li>
            <li>Both smell nice</li>
            <li>I gained about 25 pounds with the pregnancy, so I do believe having a reasonable weight gain along with the use of this product, gave me excellent results.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this oil!!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the product, everything seemed great: the smell is good and my tummy felt hydrated.</li>
            <li>My mom and my sister both have pretty severe stretch marks, I&#x27;m 36, and I have very fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs fast and has a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic and smells amazing too!</li>
            <li>It smells great and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely happy with this product until I was about 30 weeks pregnant and noticed 3 stretch marks.</li>
            <li>The smell is good, not too strong</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to people who said you&#x27;ll get them no matter what since your Mom and sister had them!</li>
            <li>The lotion smells very good and it does absorb into the skin very well.</li>
            <li>Love the product, smells amazing</li>
            <li>I purchased this along with the butter and liked the butter much better.</li>
            <li>and this is by far the best in terms of absorbancy, smell, did not make me itch, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have two babies, strong genetics for stretchmarks and no marks for me!  </li>
            <li>So im pretty happy</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to every pregnant lady!!</li>
            <li>, i  like it that.&lt;br /&gt;very very smooth.</li>
            <li>It is almost as if it absorbs too quickly to get a good application.  </li>
            <li>It also smells good and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>But it does help your bump feel nice, not itchy, not overly oily &amp; it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I didn&#x27;t start this oil rub from the beginning of pregnancy, it was more around 5 months pregnant once I started.</li>
            <li>but it smells wonderful and is very soothing to itchy pregnant bellies :-)</li>
            <li>As for myself I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it at all, and got a lot more stretch marks and did often have an itchy belly.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite stretch mark product.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I love the smell too.</li>
            <li>They could have done better.</li>
            <li>(despite being a bit more than I&#x27;d prefer to pay).</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>It moisturizes better than anything else i tried and I am 34 weeks now and no stretchmarks so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the mama mio products, It never prevented strech marks with any of my pregnancies</li>
            <li>I attacked that immediately, and was able to prevent more damage.</li>
            <li>I also applied the mama mio tummy butter on top of that</li>
            <li>and i am sure shes going to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am ok</li>
            <li>B000OZF8W6 Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil, 4.1 fl oz, prevent stretch marks, safe for pregnancy]]</li>
            <li>I ordered this after reading many reviews.  </li>
            <li>I hope I can get use to the smell because I do love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this</li>
            <li>:) i&#x27;ll be posting an updated review once I have my baby boy</li>
            <li>I think if this is used more liberally (which is probably how it&#x27;s meant to be used) we would have run out much more often than we did.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure if this stuff prevented stretch marks during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>at 36 weeks, I have a bunch more.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin for wonderful, hoping that it is actually helping with my growth through my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>What she likes most about it is the anti-itch capabilities.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, love the feel, and love the results.  </li>
            <li>I am 5 months along and love this oil.</li>
            <li>Then once twit soaks in, I go on top with a cocoa butter</li>
            <li>I love this oil</li>
            <li>It is so much better and thicker than Bio Oil.</li>
            <li>so I would say that it is a risk that many of us take.</li>
            <li>For me this worked fabulously!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but I am not so sure.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light fragrance, but nothing too noticeable.</li>
            <li>(Note: this was written on my husbands account as I don&#x27;t have one and just use his :)</li>
            <li>at the time of use i didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks...since running out of the product I have found that my skin is a bit more itchy...</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more through postpartum.</li>
            <li>This means I wore them more than once between washings.</li>
            <li>The consistency seems OK and it does leave my belly moisturized and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Unfortunatley, I will be switching to another product because I don&#x27;t want to pay $35 per month for something that isn&#x27;t a sure thing.</li>
            <li>Smells better than bio oil for sure.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I had read that stretch marks were basically hereditary, and I thought I would surely get them.  </li>
            <li>I will be able to tolerate the smell more.</li>
            <li>I used olive oil mostly, and coconut oil...</li>
            <li>I love mama mio oil.</li>
            <li>I used this oil nightly, and not only did it feel good, it had a great scent, it made me relax, made my skin feel moisturized, but I have 0 stretch marks after my baby was born.</li>
            <li>No stretch marks, my tummy snapped back into place and my skin looks wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff until one exception happened to me.......</li>
            <li>and I had more stretch marks after birth than before.</li>
            <li>However, I am willing to put my odds on the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Oil to keep my skin looking healthy after pregnancy  :o)</li>
            <li>Like most expecting moms, I was paranoid about stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I did moisturize but I felt more greasy than anything else.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>I guess I won&#x27;t know for sure how well this works.</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>Thankful for the most.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>But it does smell way better than coco butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it and hopefully the end results will be no stretch marks :)</li>
            <li>Smells great, soaks in the skin fast</li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>but I love the Mama Mio.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many pregnancy stretch mark oils (palmers, bio oil, etc.)</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product</li>
            <li>I also tried their cream but found this much better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I dislike this item, it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m not in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I am looking into buying more products from this company.</li>
            <li>In addition to the lotion I ate relatively healthy food and did exercise.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this tummy rub oil</li>
            <li>Nice scent, very easy to be absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li>sleep with them on, put on your old pijama and good luck!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, so far so good!</li>
            <li>This oil not only smells awesome, but I find that it is easy to apply, absorbs well (doesn&#x27;t affect my clothing) and prevents itchy belly.</li>
            <li>I also liked the scent and it wasn&#x27;t super greasy.</li>
            <li>I love the scent (very light &amp; clean) and the oil absorbs into your skin</li>
            <li>Its amazing, makes my skin super soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>Whether or not it helps prevent stretch marks up until the end is yet to be told, but I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>So far no stretch marks, and my skin smells great</li>
            <li>First of all the smell is amazing and doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful ingredients like most \\&quot;fragrances\\&quot; do.</li>
            <li>I feel very pleased after my first try of this product.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it is really light.  </li>
            <li>I love the light citrus</li>
            <li>I actually loved the smell so much</li>
            <li>The other products by Mama Mio are great as well!</li>
            <li>I found myself having to use a significant amount of product just to get my stomach and the top part of my hips covered</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so very pleased with the results and am definitely going to recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s pregnant!!!</li>
            <li>It is oily going on, but soaks in very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The oil soaks into the skin very quickly and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone (partners included) who might be bothered by strong or distinctive smells.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and doesn&#x27;t leave ur skin feeling oily, but feeling quenched.  </li>
            <li>They say that genetics, not the use of special lotions/oils, determines how many stretch marks you get.  </li>
            <li>The product smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel which I appreciated very much.</li>
            <li>Not super impressed with it</li>
            <li>I was so nervous because my mom had so many when pregnant with me.  </li>
            <li>I love that it absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>, I plan on buying more of this product, and will recommend to all my pregnant friends</li>
            <li>I recommend this to all my pregnant friends!  </li>
            <li>and I am 6 months pregnant!  </li>
            <li>It smells so good and makes my stomach so soft!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it will do to prevent stretch marks, but I feel better using it and my skin is super smooth.  </li>
            <li>know my wife enjoyed the smell, which is extremely important to a pregnant woman.</li>
            <li>I am the last person to review products, but I have to add my own input about this amazing product.</li>
            <li>My belly is huge</li>
            <li>All I know is that my mother had HUGE stretch marks</li>
            <li>Of course we will never know how much this products really contributed... but it is of great quality and also helped with itching a lot.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and the smell is nice and light.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks even though my tummy was HUGE (</li>
            <li>I also liked the Tummy Rub cream, but the oil lasts much much longer.  </li>
            <li>I know this makes me sound like a jerk</li>
            <li>My belly at almost 33 weeks is still free from stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I feel like it definitely did great things for my skin.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have too much of a smell, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Rest of my abdomen, butt, hips remains stretch mark free.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have what I would call a fantastic scent, but it&#x27;s not offensive, either.  </li>
            <li>I love the whole line of Mama Mio products, but tummy oil is my favorite.</li>
            <li>and so far so good...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pricy, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>it smells good and it does make skin soft</li>
            <li>I loved how soft it made my belly feel.</li>
            <li>The tummy rub butter is also fantastic, but I felt the oil lasted longer and absorbed better.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks and so far have been doing good..</li>
            <li>I will use next time around for sure!!</li>
            <li>Nice oil, refreshing smell to an extremely sensitive pregnant nose ( with severe morning sickness).  </li>
            <li>and it has helped keep me lathered with a mild smell that is not to strong.</li>
            <li>As soon as I found out I was pregnant, I lathered from shoulder to hips in Mama Mio, twice a day, using both the oil and the butter, and my skin remained supple, smooth, and completely free of pregnancy stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Has not yet started, the original is at a friend&#x27;s recommendation to buy.</li>
            <li>Yet, I am pretty sure that I like the scent and the texture of the products and will continue to use them through out my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This oil does not allow your skin to breathe which caused me to break out significantly.</li>
            <li>I feel that it is well worth the investment!</li>
            <li>This is the first stretch mark oil I have tried and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I have stretch marks on my hips and buttocks from hitting puberty, so I thought for sure I was doomed to get them with my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Worth the $40!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the only line I&#x27;ll use during pregnancy because it&#x27;s the safest and most effective one I found</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple of different products and this is by far is the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but I know it was inevitable, but it feels so good on and smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but totally worth it since it worked and was such a joy to use.</li>
            <li>I was originally using the cream version of Mamma Mio&#x27;s tummy rub, but I certainly like this oil much more</li>
            <li>but so far I love it!</li>
            <li>and I was super excited to see the amount of work that was made in this line of skincare by the inventors.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, and feels great as a simple oil, but this oil quickly rubbed off not long after applying and putting on my shirt for the day.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and the whole product line.  </li>
            <li>so I thought for sure this oil wouldn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>so i figured my skin would have to stretch so much that i would get them for sure</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>It also really helped with the itching from stretching skin. :-)</li>
            <li>Smells good, though, which is why I rated it a second star.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy a ton of maternity clothes - just one pair of maternity jeans with a full panel.</li>
            <li>Good luck to all the mommies going though similar experiences.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>As much as I do love the product I probably wont be purchasing again because the amount you get for the spendy price would burn through my wallet fast.</li>
            <li>I loved how moisturized it left my skin.</li>
            <li>It smells so good, lasts a long time and is WORTH every penny!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells great and doesn&#x27;t make me nauseous due to my sensitivity to smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I heard about Mama Mio when I was 8 weeks pregnant and used it twice a day with the cream since I was 9 weeks.</li>
            <li>( I&#x27;m now 35 weeks pregnant).</li>
            <li>I am now 5 months pregnant and no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I will say that I used extraordinarily generous helpings, and probably got through a bottle of oil a month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 34 weeks, I&#x27;ve been using this set/oil since I was about 3 months pregnant.</li>
            <li>My usage is almost a perfect scientific study because it involves the same person at the same age etc etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 weeks pregnant with twins and up 30 pounds and the stretch marks just started appearing, even after using the Mama Mio and Palmer&#x27;s every day for months.  </li>
            <li>I was 34 weeks pregnant when I ordered this oil.</li>
            <li>Throughout my pregnancy I have been rotating different oils &amp; lotions to make sure my belly stayed stretch mark free, which it was until I started using this product!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife when she was 2 months pregnant.</li>
            <li>My wife would recommend this product to all pregnant women.</li>
            <li>I am now 29 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li>As soon as you rub it in it seams to absorb quickly and does not make your skin oily or sticky.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to all of my pregnant friends and family.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant</li>
            <li>When I found out I was pregnant</li>
            <li>they&#x27;d make the scent more neutral or vibrant, rather than floral.</li>
            <li>very oily and honestly i don&#x27;t think it really helped so anything.</li>
            <li>Soaks into the skin quickly, leaves it moisturized, and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Started using this product when I was 14 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil when I was 2 months pregnant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33w2d pregnant with twins.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant, before I even knew I was having twins.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seven months pregnant and use this product every day when I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>Currently pregnant with tripplets and as of week 27...</li>
            <li>I am now 6 months pregnant, and no signs of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>pregnant, and I like the way it smells and feels.</li>
            <li>I got them while I was pregnant</li>
            <li>and it did seem to soak into the skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I tried several different lotions, butters, and oils, but this is the BEST!</li>
            <li>I am 8 months pregnant and not 1 stretch mark to be found.  </li>
            <li>Both absorb into the skin quickly and they are not greasy or leave streaks in your clothes.  </li>
            <li>I  bought this literally as I got pregnant and was applying it every day</li>
            <li>I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Granted, my sense of smell has been super heightened during pregnancy and it made this almost always unbearable to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 38 weeks and getting huge but thanks to this oil, no stretch marks!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure if this oil is responsible for me getting away without stretch marks, I didn&#x27;t exactly have a taut tummy when I got pregnant, so probably had some give already.  </li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t qualify this as the product to use so you don&#x27;t get stretch marks, I really think using anything that&#x27;s a good quality on a DAILY basis is a significant help to reduce stretch marks</li>
            <li>I love my new tummy rub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about the size of a full term singleton pregnancy right now, since I have over 7.5lbs of babies in my belly (plus 2 amniotic sacs).</li>
            <li>burts bees mama belly butter and palmers and seem to be working great for me and is half the price.</li>
            <li>I have just started to notice that the stretchmarks that i have from my previous baby are getting lighter with this which makes me so happy.</li>
            <li>I have read in many places that if your mother got stretch marks during her pregnancy, then your destiny was pretty much set.</li>
            <li>-- I was consistent!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I purchased it right after I found out about being pregnant</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this to anyone who is pregnant, even if the cost is a bit high.  </li>
            <li>But on days where t doesn&#x27;t bother me much, just the oil is fine.</li>
            <li>Smells great but is a little oily!&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>You never know if that is due to Mama Mio or good genetics, but I still recommend it to all of my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li>twice a day, with lotion...it worked for me and it was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Trust me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s interesting is that old stretch marks have started fading away</li>
            <li>Well worth it for that alone.  </li>
            <li>They also said that if you wear white it kind of stains it</li>
            <li>so you have to expect feeling oily when fist applied, but it gets absorbed.</li>
            <li>but I have to not breathe from my nose while doing so and immediately put a shirt on and just try not to breathe from my nose until it is absorbed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absorbed immediately.</li>
            <li>The idea behind this stuff is awesome</li>
            <li>so I think the price is worth it for the results.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve gained 40 pounds at 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and within striking distance of by delivery date.  </li>
            <li>Belly skin is just as soft for a fraction of the price and the smell is much more tolerable to me.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad, it can be strong, but it&#x27;s a natural scent.</li>
            <li>What I love though is unlike cocoa butter and other creams, it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of your skin.</li>
            <li>I started using this oil when I found out I was pregnant with my first child.</li>
            <li>I have been using this twice or three times a day since I was 12 weeks pregnant -- I am now on my 28th week with my first baby.</li>
            <li>I used this oil when pregnant with my first son.</li>
            <li>When she was pregnant with her first child, she tried everything there was to avoid stretchmarks and none of the products she tried prevented her from getting those dreaded stretchmarks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pregnant (first once a day and twice a day after the 5th month) and now, 3 weeks after delivery not once stretch mark.</li>
            <li>I use them right after showering.</li>
            <li>Once I noticed the first, I started to apply the oil more frequently and now</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much to get the full coverage you need.  </li>
            <li>I am actually getting ready to order a couple more bottles!</li>
            <li>Definitely keeps me moisturized and my skin is looking good so far, and I am in my 8th month of pregnancy!</li>
            <li>and it really helps with the itch, specially around my boobs ;)</li>
            <li>but it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt!  </li>
            <li>enjoyed this product so much that I bought a new one when my first ran out, and I included one in my friend&#x27;s goody box who is expecting her first child in January.  </li>
            <li>During my freshman year of college, I gained 15 pounds in three months, and my butt and thighs still looked as striped as a zebra, so I was really worried about stretch marks when I became pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on and makes skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Good old fashion generic cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>The packaging has changed from a drip bottle to a pump bottle (good change: less spillage).  </li>
            <li>Also, I have not had ANY stretch marks this far :) I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s no other evidence that I was even pregnant and now a mama to a beautiful little boy.</li>
            <li>when I became pregnant with my first one, I was really scared that nothing would work.  </li>
            <li>This product is very gentle</li>
            <li>Probably, to normal people it wouldn&#x27;t feel as strong, but pregnant women can be really sensitive to smells (just as i am).</li>
            <li>One of the best parts about the product is that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>So its not like I&#x27;ve gained massive weight to explain so many stretch marks.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to bet this oil is the reason why I avoided the mommy battle scars.</li>
            <li>I got my first stretch mark on my belly</li>
            <li>that considering when I got breast implants I had gotten more than enough stretch marks on my breasts</li>
            <li>and I love how my skin absorbs this instantly</li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;m back on my shape :))))</li>
            <li>I used this oil my first pregnancy all over from my buttocks, stomach and breasts and I did not get 1 stretch mark.</li>
            <li>, I will have to say, I think this product has delivered as much as it is capable!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since my first trimester</li>
            <li>(first I applied the oil, then the butter over it).  </li>
            <li>and I used Palmer&#x27;s Tummy butter the first pregnancy</li>
            <li>but it definitely helped me feel soooo much better.</li>
            <li>This is my first pregnancy, and the women in my family are prone to stretch marks during pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>Really, buying this oil is worth every penny, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I used this for my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>Swore by it during my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I Purchased another bottle my second pregnancy and because of 40 week morning sickness and a sensitivity to smell, I wasn&#x27;t able to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this product every day beginning in the first trimester.  </li>
            <li>Many ppl say you will gain a lot of weight in last month, but I will keep using this and see what happen.</li>
            <li>I will update more later on.</li>
            <li>Directions said to apply twice per day, but most days I only remembered to use once.</li>
            <li>I used this oil throughout my first pregnancy, and being size 4</li>
            <li>It worked wonders for my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I am expecting my first child, and at the beginning of this pregnancy used a lotion specifically for stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>seemed to avoid stretch marks for most of this pregnancy until around the start of the third trimester.  </li>
            <li>I used this throughout my first pregnancy religously - 3 X per day.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it since my first trimester and</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t get any worse, the cost is WELL worth it to me to have this nice smooth belly at 38 weeks preggo!</li>
            <li>The real test will come at week 40!</li>
            <li>I used this with my first pregnancy, and although it&#x27;s pricey</li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law bought a bottle for me after passing through her first pregnancy without stretch marks.</li>
            <li>This was my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>Ok so this is expensive for 4 ounces of oil, that&#x27;s for sure, but I do really love the stuff.  </li>
            <li>I might even love it enough to get another bottle of it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first baby</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for different people.</li>
            <li>but I feel pretty oily for a while.</li>
            <li>This is my first child and my mother did get stretch marks .</li>
            <li>This product really does work and in my opinion is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I use this everyday and so far, it has been great.</li>
            <li>But MamaMio is my favorite of the above because (1) texture - not too oily and appears to absorb easily and last throughout the day,</li>
            <li>Will need to update after giving birth and losing some of this weight to tell if it&#x27;s actually getting the job done, but so far loving it.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m very optimistic about not getting any in these last weeks with my twins:)</li>
            <li>It smells good and has lots of natural essential oils in it which are better than lotions and creams which have many unnecessary additives</li>
            <li>It smells nice, isn&#x27;t too heavy, is easy to apply, and has worked thus far.</li>
            <li>Some of the other butter like products have a very strong smell that I couldn&#x27;t handle in the first trimester.  </li>
            <li>So pretty much, I thought I was doomed in that area.</li>
            <li>I put up with it for so long because so many women swore by it.</li>
            <li>The Mama mio tummy oil definitely has a greasy feel at first, but I felt absorbed in quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had read magnificent reviews and needless to say I had high hopes for this product to work for me.</li>
            <li>I have heard many pregnant ladies complain about itchy, tight bellies</li>
            <li>I am nearly six months pregnant, and (fingers cross/throw some salt over my shoulder)</li>
            <li>I am 4 months pregnant and my skin has stayed soft and supple.</li>
            <li>If I were to put this on twice a day and apply &amp;#34;liberally&amp;#34; as directions state..this bottle would only last me 2-3 weeks at the very most.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant again this time and so far nothing.  </li>
            <li>I am no longer have dry skin &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I noticed the ingredients changed a bit over the past 3 years but the most important ingredients (almond oil, wheatgerm oil) are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ever since buying both of them, I need less of each to get nice, glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way - Good value!</li>
            <li>Make sure you put it on though when you have time to just hang out in loose clothes with no where to go, I bought this and the belly butter, and after they both go on</li>
            <li>Being pregnant and sensitive to smells anyway, I don&#x27;t care much for the overpowering floral aroma.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 weeks pregnant, have been using this product for about six weeks, and so far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>It has the key known ingredients that do the job (saturated fats, fine</li>
            <li>currently 6 weeks pregnant again (with twins, yikes!)</li>
            <li>personally the only thing going for this product is that it smells nice and makes your skin soft and it was dispatched quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I am recently became pregnant with my second child and once I reached 3 months I made sure I had a new bottle of Tummy Rub!  </li>
            <li>and I definitely wasn&#x27;t huge...</li>
            <li>What DID surprise me was how fast they went away even though I didn&#x27;t use it much after I gave birth.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this I have none stretch marks</li>
            <li>I too got stretch marks during a growth spurt in puberty, and fully expected to get more during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I shake the bottle to put about 10 drops on my hand and that covers my whole belly and sides.  </li>
            <li>but it did keep the skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li>so the cost is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>For some reason I never paid much attention to any that remarked about the scent.  </li>
            <li>Smells very musky and makes me want to remove it.  </li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m capable of getting them.)  </li>
            <li>I applied very liberally, 1-2 times a day and used almost 2 bottles.</li>
            <li>but it was too much oil.</li>
            <li>Im really skinny</li>
            <li>I really, really believe this works.  </li>
            <li>I find it very soothing.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the oil spread very well, so I used it in conjunction with the tummy butter.  </li>
            <li>I am now using it during my second pregnancy and it seems to keep my skin moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>and it really helps with my itchy belly.</li>
            <li>The Palmer&#x27;s seemed to clump up and get stuck onto my clothes when I put it on my very taught tummy</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the scent though.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m in my second trimester and growing, I get much needed relief from the dryness and itchiness that my skin is going through, AND no stretch marks so far :-)</li>
            <li>I have and really soothes my skin.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>and it was very oily.</li>
            <li>My boobs grew so fast</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like lotion or oils on my hands, but this is not greasy</li>
            <li>I have been applying very liberally once a day.  </li>
            <li>Sense of smell is especially sensitive during pregnancy</li>
            <li>People said that it is fast absorbing</li>
            <li>Very hydrating.</li>
            <li>It is really oily</li>
            <li>It absorb to your skin fast.</li>
            <li>I was very relaxing to put on.</li>
            <li>they really had to tug and tug....</li>
            <li>I guess we will have to wait and see how it works through the whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>The smell does not nauseate me when everything else does (it&#x27;s citrus-y)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching the contributory factors of stretch marks, I found the primary things have the biggest effect on whether you get stretch marks - diet, water intake, genetics, and exercise (not necessarily in this order).  </li>
            <li>This oil really helped soothe that</li>
            <li>so I of course became very paranoid about getting them during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Perhaps because I keep it very moisturized?</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of the product and it makes my skin feel silky</li>
            <li>I made it to my 37th week without any problems thanks to Mama Mio.</li>
            <li>Really helped my belly become very moisturized.</li>
            <li>- it was just too intense in smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The oily stain comes out in the wash, but remember to wear either a cotton cami or wipe off excess/wait a few minutes for absorption before putting on that nice lightweight shirt you don&#x27;t want to mark up.  </li>
            <li>The first time I got out of the shower to put on the Bio Oil, I noticed new stretch marks</li>
            <li>It did not really help too much with my itchy skin when I was super pregnant</li>
            <li>Am 17 weeks pregnant and barely showing.  </li>
            <li>I will continue using this until my belly is back to the original size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it was a combination of all these factors that helped , but I&#x27;d like to give credit where it&#x27;s due , thank God for this lotion.</li>
            <li>I would usually shower before using it morning and night (just to make sure it got absorbed well) and then would do an additional application around noon, but it was still drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>Well I have been using this product for the past 14 weeks and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>The smell didn&#x27;t bother me much and while I understand that there&#x27;s a cream, I was pregnant in the winter and wanted that extra coverage from an oil-based product.</li>
            <li>I have gained 35 lbs and my belly is very large, 2 people have asked if I&#x27;m having twins, but this is my first pregnancy- just one big boy.</li>
            <li>Of the three, I preferred the ease of application, the light scent, and the long term feel of my tummy.</li>
            <li>No stretch marks developed although she&#x27;s just passed her first trimester....</li>
            <li>so I am not sure if it will be effective in preventing stretch marks.</li>
            <li>usually use it at night after a warm shower</li>
            <li>so they look more like a bunch of black keloids.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is decent size</li>
            <li>In spite being a healthy weight I have had some on my thighs and low hip area since I was a teen.</li>
            <li>Currently I am 19 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because of the good reviews but have only used it a few times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 weeks pregnant, with red/purple-ish stretch marks starting about 2-3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been told that stretch marks are genetic, and that they strike older moms the hardest.  </li>
            <li>I am now 14 weeks pregnant with my second and have stocked up.  </li>
            <li>I am currently 6 months pregnant and no stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I hope I don&#x27;t get any in the end, but I truly believe if I was pregnant with 1 baby instead of 2 I would definitely not have gotten any stretch marks.</li>
            <li>and I am currently 9 months pregnant</li>
            <li>I ordered this product when I was around 14 weeks pregnant, and have used it religiously ever since.</li>
            <li>I started using it daily after my shower when I was around 12 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I am 23 weeks pregnant with my second child.</li>
            <li>I am 33 wks pregnant currently.  </li>
            <li>I have bought several bottles and buying one more now as I approach the final weeks.  </li>
            <li>I havent been using it long enough to really know for sure, if it will work.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant with twins and my belly was stretched to the max and the skin hurt so much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>my mother and grandmother both have stretch marks) and would highly recommend daily/nightly oil massage to every expectant mother.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes with this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you purchase this to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It smells great - very subtle - and the texture is velvety soft.  </li>
            <li>My whole body is super dry from this winter</li>
            <li>I had light stretch marks prior to getting pregnant due to weight gain then loss.</li>
            <li>This product came with great reviews but was a tad expensive for my liking.</li>
            <li>I was really scared of getting stretch marks during pregnancy because I got some when I was growing as an adolescent, so clearly my skin is prone to them.</li>
            <li>My husband really disliked the smell of Palmer&#x27;s, and said this one was way better.</li>
            <li>So far no stretch marks...just a pretty soft belly.</li>
            <li>The clothes I wore closest to my body, such as tank tops or tight Ts, started to get a light rancid oil smell, even when clean.</li>
            <li>I can actually put my clothes on right after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I decided to look for something new, specifically something with less chemicals and more natural moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>No new stretch marks in 3 full weeks, and</li>
            <li>if you live in Brazil, use almond oil with Hipoglos also.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any new stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying a new one soon.</li>
            <li>And I was getting new stretch marks almost every day until I started using this again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 7 1/2 months and have yet to see a new stretch mark.  </li>
            <li>This oil has lightened those marks as well as keep new ones from coming in.</li>
            <li>raw shea butter and calendula or tamaran did way better</li>
            <li>I will say, though, that even these marks (which were very purple/red right after the baby) have faded to barely noticeable a year later, maybe a reason for hope for those who do develop them</li>
            <li>Mama Mio is quite expensive though, for a product that doesn&#x27;t work any better than the cheap options (Palmer&#x27;s is about $6/bottle,</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Very very soft.</li>
            <li>Like the smell.. Very early to say about the result.</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft and not itchy.  </li>
            <li>This is my 2nd pregnancy where I&#x27;ve used this product liberally once a day(twice a day in very rare occassions like after a second shower or bath).  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not sure which ingredient caused it, but make sure you are not allergic to any ingredient before purchasing.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I never write reviews because I&#x27;ve never had a product deliver exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li>When you first put it on it smells like citrus peels (orange mixed with lemon) or lemon starburst.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure that if I would&#x27;ve not use this product I might&#x27;ve had more stretch marks.</li>
            <li>just bought my second bottle as I&#x27;m finishing up the first.  </li>
            <li>I started using it in my first trimester and the bottle lasted me to 34 weeks, using it once daily.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about stretch marks earlier on, and so I started using Bio-oil, Clarins, Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s and MamaMio by the end of the first trimester.</li>
            <li>mom went from skeptic to believer because at first she was telling me that stretchmarks were genetic and that since she had it I might as well accept the inevitable.</li>
            <li>I would still stand by it and will continue to use it to fade the marks as soon as my scar is COMPLETELY healed!</li>
            <li>Might or might not be due to this product, but regardless enjoyed the oil and the twice daily ritual.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get the first stretch mark, so overall I&#x27;d wholeheartedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>For the first trimester I only applied once a day.  </li>
            <li>I only use after I take a hot shower.</li>
            <li>belly stays soft and hydrated all day!  </li>
            <li>In my first pregnancy I gained 44 lbs and my 2nd</li>
            <li>I was pregnant, which was around 8 weeks, because of the high recommendations made by other users.</li>
            <li>The oil hydrates my skin so well, is not overly greasy, and rarely does the belly get so dry that it itches.  </li>
            <li>I have not used this product for long enough to be able to offer a review of whether this \\&quot;prevented\\&quot; stretchmarks (I&#x27;m currently 20 weeks).</li>
            <li>Starting at 4 months pregnant I religiously used the Mama Mio stretch mark oil and the Mama Mio stretch mark butter twice a day</li>
            <li>I had used pure coconut oil on my belly in the same manner until someone gave me this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33 weeks pregnant and only have about 1/4 left of my current bottle, and would really like to keep using this until the baby is here.  </li>
            <li>I also have growth stretch marks in other areas of my body, so when I found out I was pregnant</li>
            <li>I bought it because the smell of cocoa butter made me nauseated and this smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>My baby is now 1 month old and my stomach has &amp;#34;stalled out&amp;#34; I am hoping this helps it continue to shrink.</li>
            <li>No improvement on scars thus far</li>
            <li>I have used it morning and night since I started showing and have so far not gotten any stretch marks (knock on wood--</li>
            <li>So far I have no stretch marks and will keep using until the end of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I am currently ready to give birth to my 2nd child.</li>
            <li>So far, I have gained 30 pounds and not a stretch mark in sight.</li>
            <li>But i knew i would feel better if I at least tried instead of giving in and ruling out any possibilities.</li>
            <li>I am a young 23-year-old mom and I am African-American</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s oily and you might need about three bottles to last you your whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Better late than never ...</li>
            <li>and I was completely devastated.</li>
            <li>, It keeps me soft and moisturized until the end of the day when I put it on again before going to sleep.</li>
            <li>So far, no stretch marks</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 36 weeks now and haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks so far</li>
            <li>- I doubt I can attribute that completely to the oil</li>
            <li>Been using this after my shower and so far, no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I wish I could say that is a testament to the product, but being that I&#x27;m only 32 weeks along I can&#x27;t really guarantee it.</li>
            <li>This time I am trying Mama Mio, and so far no stretch marks</li>
            <li>no heavy smell</li>
            <li>I had my baby in early May</li>
            <li>i do believe the price is a bit much for only 4.1 fl oz...</li>
            <li>so far seems to be working well.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t got any stretch marks yet and I am on my 32nd week.</li>
            <li>Now I am at 30 weeks, and so far crossing fingers.. no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I am now week 14, so it&#x27;s still early.</li>
            <li>Once the belly is big it tends to go fast...</li>
            <li>Our son is now 5 months old, and I did not get stretch marks from the pregnancy.</li>
            <li>But remember that no cream, lotion, or oil will completely prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>The skin can only stretch so much, and genetics also plays a role.</li>
            <li>so far no stretch marks...</li>
            <li>Then again, maybe it was because the elasticity of my skin had already been stretched out the first time around.</li>
            <li>So far no stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>Old stretch marks have faded.  </li>
            <li>This is very soothing and essential for a pregnancy of multiples.  </li>
            <li>Used my whole pregnancy at night before bed (gained almost 40 pounds total) plus used another product I bought on Amazon zero stretch marks!!!</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs within maybe 15-20 minutes and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I started using it in my fourth month once a day before the real stretching began.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product to family &amp; friends and really anyone looking for an oil that will not leave you feeling like you have to take another shower after applying it.  </li>
            <li>I am 16 weeks so its to early to say if it stops me from getting stretch marks</li>
            <li>This was recommended early in pregnancy to me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gained 30 lbs so far.  </li>
            <li>The bottle top starts to slowly weep some of the oil and kept getting an oil ring on my cabinet shelf, so I has to store it in a dish.</li>
            <li>Look, my wife is hot, she does not have a single stretch mark on her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 17 weeks pregnant so far, so I am not very big and have no stretch marks so far but have had severe itching from having an appendicitis and hernia when I was younger...</li>
            <li>I loved this oil so much, I actually looked forward to putting it on twice a day, which might be part of the reason why I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks (except a small one around my navel piercing, which was to be expected)</li>
            <li>I got 3 tiny stretch marks that can barely be seen right above my belly button.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m starting to think that the cheaper and older alternative would&#x27;ve probably worked as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several bottles of this stuff with my first baby and bought again 3 yrs later now that I&#x27;m expecting baby #2.  </li>
            <li>I tried to stay active my whole pregnancy, but still I gained 30 pounds and my belly got pretty big to where I could feel my skin getting tighter,</li>
            <li>I used Palmers religiously throughout my pregnancy, but decided to get something a little better quality for the last trimester.  </li>
            <li>(2) smell is faint and pleasant, and (3) helped even out my overall skin tone.</li>
            <li>I used this product religiously for the second half of my pregnancy (didn&#x27;t really start showing until after 20+ weeks), went full term with a 7.5-pounder, and have NO stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I am still using it because it says it help skin to go back to normal.</li>
            <li>I normally like to wash in cold, but switched those items to hot to get a really thorough clean out of the oil residue.</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive to purchase an oil just because I don&#x27;t really care to use oils and really don&#x27;t like to feel oily all the time...</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the fact that is not super oily like other brands.</li>
            <li>My belly seems bigger than a lot of other pregnant women&#x27;s bellies at this stage, so the tummy rub oil</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t live without this next time</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin so soft...might continue to use during Winter as I always get dry skin.</li>
            <li>I did drink a ton of water and keep my weight gain low, but overall I really think this helped.</li>
            <li>I used it last year religiously since I was 6 weeks pregnant and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say for sure that this product definitely worked, because there are other variables, but one bottle lasted nearly my entire pregnancy (I did buy a second bottle mid-way through my third tri)</li>
            <li>Yes, this stuff moisturizes like no other.</li>
            <li>Used through my second pregnancy and still no stretch marks despite gaining nearly 50lbs!</li>
            <li>She used the oil pretty regularly, but I think she was pretty conservative with it which ultimately resulted in a few stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product due to the positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>go for Mustella double action AND Dr Palmers butter.</li>
            <li>The bottle has a flaw -- when getting the oil onto your hands, some amount of oil runs out on the exterior of the bottle, and will leave oily rings on your furniture if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>I used the Mama Mio oil beginning early in my second trimester.  </li>
            <li>my baby is 2weeks old now im almost back to my pregnancy weight and have not even 1streatchmark.</li>
            <li>I bought another bottle to use with my 2nd pregnancy and so far, no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I also received the Mustela Stretch Mark Double Action Cream.  </li>
            <li>I used this religiously with my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get stretch marks until 10 days before the due date, when they just all popped up at once.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every single cent!!!!!</li>
            <li>only negatives are that it is very pricey and doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>I trust this oil will not leave stains or a residue so much that I have no problem wearing my suits or other maternity clothes after applying it.  </li>
            <li>Not a single one.  </li>
            <li>However, starting from the second use, I gradually developed an itch on my tummy.</li>
            <li>I know genes play a role in stretch marks, but I&#x27;ve been using this from 7 weeks through now (33 weeks) and don&#x27;t have a single new mark on my belly, thighs or chest.  </li>
            <li>having turned a little doughy from my 9 months of pregnancy indulgences ;)</li>
            <li>Once I got the new bottle, the itchiness immediately went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from being a bit pricey, there&#x27;s only one con - it can rub off on clothing that is a delicate fabric if you get dressed right away.  </li>
            <li>I am still in my early stages of pregnacy so in the long run we shall see if this works or not.  </li>
            <li>It does leave you oily at first, but soaks in after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to say that it prevents or gets rid of stretch marks since I&#x27;m still pregnant.</li>
            <li>I am 25 weeks, and I have been using this oil at least once, sometimes twice a day since about 6 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>The oil is very heavy but absorbs fast in to my skin and makes it feel really soft.  </li>
            <li>but I use it very liberally - even on my back and thighs where I had previous stretch marks</li>
            <li>I found it very hard to be comfortable.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I wish you guys the best of luck and hope it works better for you than it did me :)</li>
            <li> The results of the product are so great for me, though, that this con is just a heads-up more than anything else.</li>
            <li> But very satisfied with this oil.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I did because I walked away from my pregnancy with no tummy stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Most of all, great to keep belly itch under control</li>
            <li> but it sure does smell great.</li>
            <li> oil also has a great smell which makes it enjoyable to use.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of whether or not you get stretch marks, the fact that it causes your skin to feel so much better is a great comfort.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what product to use to prevent stretch marks but knew for sure I had to get something!!</li>

            <li> Give it a chance and use it, the smell is so soothing and the oil gives your belly a nice moisturized glow.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling but didn&#x27;t prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> and my wife really liked it.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy all day and it absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> and I think it works since I didnt get any stretch marks, nice, non-invasive smell.</li>
            <li> worked with kids, who are tummy-height and brutally honest.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and luxurious feel to it.</li>
            <li> Liked the oil&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> and I liked to use it all around hip area as well.</li>
            <li> This one is really good so that we appreciating and rated as top class.</li>
            <li> Both smell nice</li>
            <li> I gained about 25 pounds with the pregnancy, so I do believe having a reasonable weight gain along with the use of this product, gave me excellent results.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this oil!!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the product, everything seemed great: the smell is good and my tummy felt hydrated.</li>
            <li> My mom and my sister both have pretty severe stretch marks, I&#x27;m 36, and I have very fair skin.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs fast and has a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic and smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> It smells great and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely happy with this product until I was about 30 weeks pregnant and noticed 3 stretch marks.</li>
            <li> The smell is good, not too strong</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to people who said you&#x27;ll get them no matter what since your Mom and sister had them!</li>
            <li> The lotion smells very good and it does absorb into the skin very well.</li>
            <li> Love the product, smells amazing</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the butter and liked the butter much better.</li>
            <li> and this is by far the best in terms of absorbancy, smell, did not make me itch, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have two babies, strong genetics for stretchmarks and no marks for me!  </li>
            <li> So im pretty happy</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to every pregnant lady!!</li>
            <li> , i  like it that.&lt;br /&gt;very very smooth.</li>
            <li> It is almost as if it absorbs too quickly to get a good application.  </li>
            <li> It also smells good and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> But it does help your bump feel nice, not itchy, not overly oily &amp; it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I didn&#x27;t start this oil rub from the beginning of pregnancy, it was more around 5 months pregnant once I started.</li>
            <li> but it smells wonderful and is very soothing to itchy pregnant bellies :-)</li>
            <li> As for myself I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it at all, and got a lot more stretch marks and did often have an itchy belly.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite stretch mark product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> They could have done better.</li>
            <li> (despite being a bit more than I&#x27;d prefer to pay).</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes better than anything else i tried and I am 34 weeks now and no stretchmarks so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the mama mio products, It never prevented strech marks with any of my pregnancies</li>
            <li> I attacked that immediately, and was able to prevent more damage.</li>
            <li> I also applied the mama mio tummy butter on top of that</li>
            <li> and i am sure shes going to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am ok</li>
            <li> B000OZF8W6 Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil, 4.1 fl oz, prevent stretch marks, safe for pregnancy]]</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading many reviews.  </li>
            <li> I hope I can get use to the smell because I do love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this</li>
            <li> :) i&#x27;ll be posting an updated review once I have my baby boy</li>
            <li> I think if this is used more liberally (which is probably how it&#x27;s meant to be used) we would have run out much more often than we did.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure if this stuff prevented stretch marks during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> at 36 weeks, I have a bunch more.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin for wonderful, hoping that it is actually helping with my growth through my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> What she likes most about it is the anti-itch capabilities.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, love the feel, and love the results.  </li>
            <li> I am 5 months along and love this oil.</li>
            <li> Then once twit soaks in, I go on top with a cocoa butter</li>
            <li> I love this oil</li>
            <li> It is so much better and thicker than Bio Oil.</li>
            <li> so I would say that it is a risk that many of us take.</li>
            <li> For me this worked fabulously!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but I am not so sure.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light fragrance, but nothing too noticeable.</li>
            <li> (Note: this was written on my husbands account as I don&#x27;t have one and just use his :)</li>
            <li> at the time of use i didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks...since running out of the product I have found that my skin is a bit more itchy...</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more through postpartum.</li>
            <li> This means I wore them more than once between washings.</li>
            <li> The consistency seems OK and it does leave my belly moisturized and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatley, I will be switching to another product because I don&#x27;t want to pay $35 per month for something that isn&#x27;t a sure thing.</li>
            <li> Smells better than bio oil for sure.  </li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I had read that stretch marks were basically hereditary, and I thought I would surely get them.  </li>
            <li> I will be able to tolerate the smell more.</li>
            <li> I used olive oil mostly, and coconut oil...</li>
            <li> I love mama mio oil.</li>
            <li> I used this oil nightly, and not only did it feel good, it had a great scent, it made me relax, made my skin feel moisturized, but I have 0 stretch marks after my baby was born.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks, my tummy snapped back into place and my skin looks wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff until one exception happened to me.......</li>
            <li> and I had more stretch marks after birth than before.</li>
            <li> However, I am willing to put my odds on the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Oil to keep my skin looking healthy after pregnancy  :o)</li>
            <li> Like most expecting moms, I was paranoid about stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I did moisturize but I felt more greasy than anything else.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> I guess I won&#x27;t know for sure how well this works.</li>
            <li> It works ok</li>
            <li> Thankful for the most.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> But it does smell way better than coco butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it and hopefully the end results will be no stretch marks :)</li>
            <li> Smells great, soaks in the skin fast</li>
            <li> Will buy more.</li>
            <li> but I love the Mama Mio.  </li>
            <li> I tried so many pregnancy stretch mark oils (palmers, bio oil, etc.)</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product</li>
            <li> I also tried their cream but found this much better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I dislike this item, it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m not in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I am looking into buying more products from this company.</li>
            <li> In addition to the lotion I ate relatively healthy food and did exercise.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this tummy rub oil</li>
            <li> Nice scent, very easy to be absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li> sleep with them on, put on your old pijama and good luck!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, so far so good!</li>
            <li> This oil not only smells awesome, but I find that it is easy to apply, absorbs well (doesn&#x27;t affect my clothing) and prevents itchy belly.</li>
            <li> I also liked the scent and it wasn&#x27;t super greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the scent (very light &amp; clean) and the oil absorbs into your skin</li>
            <li> Its amazing, makes my skin super soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> Whether or not it helps prevent stretch marks up until the end is yet to be told, but I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> So far no stretch marks, and my skin smells great</li>
            <li> First of all the smell is amazing and doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful ingredients like most \\&quot;fragrances\\&quot; do.</li>
            <li> I feel very pleased after my first try of this product.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it is really light.  </li>
            <li> I love the light citrus</li>
            <li> I actually loved the smell so much</li>
            <li> The other products by Mama Mio are great as well!</li>
            <li> I found myself having to use a significant amount of product just to get my stomach and the top part of my hips covered</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so very pleased with the results and am definitely going to recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s pregnant!!!</li>
            <li> It is oily going on, but soaks in very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The oil soaks into the skin very quickly and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone (partners included) who might be bothered by strong or distinctive smells.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and doesn&#x27;t leave ur skin feeling oily, but feeling quenched.  </li>
            <li> They say that genetics, not the use of special lotions/oils, determines how many stretch marks you get.  </li>
            <li> The product smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel which I appreciated very much.</li>
            <li> Not super impressed with it</li>
            <li> I was so nervous because my mom had so many when pregnant with me.  </li>
            <li> I love that it absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> , I plan on buying more of this product, and will recommend to all my pregnant friends</li>
            <li> I recommend this to all my pregnant friends!  </li>
            <li> and I am 6 months pregnant!  </li>
            <li> It smells so good and makes my stomach so soft!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it will do to prevent stretch marks, but I feel better using it and my skin is super smooth.  </li>
            <li> know my wife enjoyed the smell, which is extremely important to a pregnant woman.</li>
            <li> I am the last person to review products, but I have to add my own input about this amazing product.</li>
            <li> My belly is huge</li>
            <li> All I know is that my mother had HUGE stretch marks</li>
            <li> Of course we will never know how much this products really contributed... but it is of great quality and also helped with itching a lot.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast and the smell is nice and light.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks even though my tummy was HUGE (</li>
            <li> I also liked the Tummy Rub cream, but the oil lasts much much longer.  </li>
            <li> I know this makes me sound like a jerk</li>
            <li> My belly at almost 33 weeks is still free from stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I feel like it definitely did great things for my skin.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have too much of a smell, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Rest of my abdomen, butt, hips remains stretch mark free.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have what I would call a fantastic scent, but it&#x27;s not offensive, either.  </li>
            <li> I love the whole line of Mama Mio products, but tummy oil is my favorite.</li>
            <li> and so far so good...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pricy, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> it smells good and it does make skin soft</li>
            <li> I loved how soft it made my belly feel.</li>
            <li> The tummy rub butter is also fantastic, but I felt the oil lasted longer and absorbed better.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks and so far have been doing good..</li>
            <li> I will use next time around for sure!!</li>
            <li> Nice oil, refreshing smell to an extremely sensitive pregnant nose ( with severe morning sickness).  </li>
            <li> and it has helped keep me lathered with a mild smell that is not to strong.</li>
            <li> As soon as I found out I was pregnant, I lathered from shoulder to hips in Mama Mio, twice a day, using both the oil and the butter, and my skin remained supple, smooth, and completely free of pregnancy stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Has not yet started, the original is at a friend&#x27;s recommendation to buy.</li>
            <li> Yet, I am pretty sure that I like the scent and the texture of the products and will continue to use them through out my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This oil does not allow your skin to breathe which caused me to break out significantly.</li>
            <li> I feel that it is well worth the investment!</li>
            <li> This is the first stretch mark oil I have tried and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I have stretch marks on my hips and buttocks from hitting puberty, so I thought for sure I was doomed to get them with my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Worth the $40!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the only line I&#x27;ll use during pregnancy because it&#x27;s the safest and most effective one I found</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of different products and this is by far is the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> but I know it was inevitable, but it feels so good on and smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but totally worth it since it worked and was such a joy to use.</li>
            <li> I was originally using the cream version of Mamma Mio&#x27;s tummy rub, but I certainly like this oil much more</li>
            <li> but so far I love it!</li>
            <li> and I was super excited to see the amount of work that was made in this line of skincare by the inventors.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, and feels great as a simple oil, but this oil quickly rubbed off not long after applying and putting on my shirt for the day.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and the whole product line.  </li>
            <li> so I thought for sure this oil wouldn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> so i figured my skin would have to stretch so much that i would get them for sure</li>
            <li> It smells kind of like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> It also really helped with the itching from stretching skin. :-)</li>
            <li> Smells good, though, which is why I rated it a second star.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy a ton of maternity clothes - just one pair of maternity jeans with a full panel.</li>
            <li> Good luck to all the mommies going though similar experiences.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> As much as I do love the product I probably wont be purchasing again because the amount you get for the spendy price would burn through my wallet fast.</li>
            <li> I loved how moisturized it left my skin.</li>
            <li> It smells so good, lasts a long time and is WORTH every penny!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells great and doesn&#x27;t make me nauseous due to my sensitivity to smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I heard about Mama Mio when I was 8 weeks pregnant and used it twice a day with the cream since I was 9 weeks.</li>
            <li> ( I&#x27;m now 35 weeks pregnant).</li>
            <li> I am now 5 months pregnant and no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I will say that I used extraordinarily generous helpings, and probably got through a bottle of oil a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 34 weeks, I&#x27;ve been using this set/oil since I was about 3 months pregnant.</li>
            <li> My usage is almost a perfect scientific study because it involves the same person at the same age etc etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 weeks pregnant with twins and up 30 pounds and the stretch marks just started appearing, even after using the Mama Mio and Palmer&#x27;s every day for months.  </li>
            <li> I was 34 weeks pregnant when I ordered this oil.</li>
            <li> Throughout my pregnancy I have been rotating different oils &amp; lotions to make sure my belly stayed stretch mark free, which it was until I started using this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife when she was 2 months pregnant.</li>
            <li> My wife would recommend this product to all pregnant women.</li>
            <li> I am now 29 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li> As soon as you rub it in it seams to absorb quickly and does not make your skin oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to all of my pregnant friends and family.</li>
            <li> I was pregnant</li>
            <li> When I found out I was pregnant</li>
            <li> they&#x27;d make the scent more neutral or vibrant, rather than floral.</li>
            <li> very oily and honestly i don&#x27;t think it really helped so anything.</li>
            <li> Soaks into the skin quickly, leaves it moisturized, and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Started using this product when I was 14 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil when I was 2 months pregnant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33w2d pregnant with twins.</li>
            <li> I was pregnant, before I even knew I was having twins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seven months pregnant and use this product every day when I get out of the shower</li>
            <li> Currently pregnant with tripplets and as of week 27...</li>
            <li> I am now 6 months pregnant, and no signs of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> pregnant, and I like the way it smells and feels.</li>
            <li> I got them while I was pregnant</li>
            <li> and it did seem to soak into the skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I tried several different lotions, butters, and oils, but this is the BEST!</li>
            <li> I am 8 months pregnant and not 1 stretch mark to be found.  </li>
            <li> Both absorb into the skin quickly and they are not greasy or leave streaks in your clothes.  </li>
            <li> I  bought this literally as I got pregnant and was applying it every day</li>
            <li> I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Granted, my sense of smell has been super heightened during pregnancy and it made this almost always unbearable to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 weeks and getting huge but thanks to this oil, no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure if this oil is responsible for me getting away without stretch marks, I didn&#x27;t exactly have a taut tummy when I got pregnant, so probably had some give already.  </li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t qualify this as the product to use so you don&#x27;t get stretch marks, I really think using anything that&#x27;s a good quality on a DAILY basis is a significant help to reduce stretch marks</li>
            <li> I love my new tummy rub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about the size of a full term singleton pregnancy right now, since I have over 7.5lbs of babies in my belly (plus 2 amniotic sacs).</li>
            <li> burts bees mama belly butter and palmers and seem to be working great for me and is half the price.</li>
            <li> I have just started to notice that the stretchmarks that i have from my previous baby are getting lighter with this which makes me so happy.</li>
            <li> I have read in many places that if your mother got stretch marks during her pregnancy, then your destiny was pretty much set.</li>
            <li> -- I was consistent!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased it right after I found out about being pregnant</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this to anyone who is pregnant, even if the cost is a bit high.  </li>
            <li> But on days where t doesn&#x27;t bother me much, just the oil is fine.</li>
            <li> Smells great but is a little oily!&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> You never know if that is due to Mama Mio or good genetics, but I still recommend it to all of my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li> twice a day, with lotion...it worked for me and it was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Trust me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s interesting is that old stretch marks have started fading away</li>
            <li> Well worth it for that alone.  </li>
            <li> They also said that if you wear white it kind of stains it</li>
            <li> so you have to expect feeling oily when fist applied, but it gets absorbed.</li>
            <li> but I have to not breathe from my nose while doing so and immediately put a shirt on and just try not to breathe from my nose until it is absorbed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absorbed immediately.</li>
            <li> The idea behind this stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> so I think the price is worth it for the results.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve gained 40 pounds at 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and within striking distance of by delivery date.  </li>
            <li> Belly skin is just as soft for a fraction of the price and the smell is much more tolerable to me.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad, it can be strong, but it&#x27;s a natural scent.</li>
            <li> What I love though is unlike cocoa butter and other creams, it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of your skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this oil when I found out I was pregnant with my first child.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice or three times a day since I was 12 weeks pregnant -- I am now on my 28th week with my first baby.</li>
            <li> I used this oil when pregnant with my first son.</li>
            <li> When she was pregnant with her first child, she tried everything there was to avoid stretchmarks and none of the products she tried prevented her from getting those dreaded stretchmarks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pregnant (first once a day and twice a day after the 5th month) and now, 3 weeks after delivery not once stretch mark.</li>
            <li> I use them right after showering.</li>
            <li> Once I noticed the first, I started to apply the oil more frequently and now</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much to get the full coverage you need.  </li>
            <li> I am actually getting ready to order a couple more bottles!</li>
            <li> Definitely keeps me moisturized and my skin is looking good so far, and I am in my 8th month of pregnancy!</li>
            <li> and it really helps with the itch, specially around my boobs ;)</li>
            <li> but it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt!  </li>
            <li> enjoyed this product so much that I bought a new one when my first ran out, and I included one in my friend&#x27;s goody box who is expecting her first child in January.  </li>
            <li> During my freshman year of college, I gained 15 pounds in three months, and my butt and thighs still looked as striped as a zebra, so I was really worried about stretch marks when I became pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put on and makes skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Good old fashion generic cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> The packaging has changed from a drip bottle to a pump bottle (good change: less spillage).  </li>
            <li> Also, I have not had ANY stretch marks this far :) I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s no other evidence that I was even pregnant and now a mama to a beautiful little boy.</li>
            <li> when I became pregnant with my first one, I was really scared that nothing would work.  </li>
            <li> This product is very gentle</li>
            <li> Probably, to normal people it wouldn&#x27;t feel as strong, but pregnant women can be really sensitive to smells (just as i am).</li>
            <li> One of the best parts about the product is that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> So its not like I&#x27;ve gained massive weight to explain so many stretch marks.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to bet this oil is the reason why I avoided the mommy battle scars.</li>
            <li> I got my first stretch mark on my belly</li>
            <li> that considering when I got breast implants I had gotten more than enough stretch marks on my breasts</li>
            <li> and I love how my skin absorbs this instantly</li>
            <li> and when I&#x27;m back on my shape :))))</li>
            <li> I used this oil my first pregnancy all over from my buttocks, stomach and breasts and I did not get 1 stretch mark.</li>
            <li> , I will have to say, I think this product has delivered as much as it is capable!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since my first trimester</li>
            <li> (first I applied the oil, then the butter over it).  </li>
            <li> and I used Palmer&#x27;s Tummy butter the first pregnancy</li>
            <li> but it definitely helped me feel soooo much better.</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy, and the women in my family are prone to stretch marks during pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> Really, buying this oil is worth every penny, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I used this for my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> Swore by it during my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I Purchased another bottle my second pregnancy and because of 40 week morning sickness and a sensitivity to smell, I wasn&#x27;t able to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this product every day beginning in the first trimester.  </li>
            <li> Many ppl say you will gain a lot of weight in last month, but I will keep using this and see what happen.</li>
            <li> I will update more later on.</li>
            <li> Directions said to apply twice per day, but most days I only remembered to use once.</li>
            <li> I used this oil throughout my first pregnancy, and being size 4</li>
            <li> It worked wonders for my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I am expecting my first child, and at the beginning of this pregnancy used a lotion specifically for stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> seemed to avoid stretch marks for most of this pregnancy until around the start of the third trimester.  </li>
            <li> I used this throughout my first pregnancy religously - 3 X per day.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since my first trimester and</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t get any worse, the cost is WELL worth it to me to have this nice smooth belly at 38 weeks preggo!</li>
            <li> The real test will come at week 40!</li>
            <li> I used this with my first pregnancy, and although it&#x27;s pricey</li>
            <li> ;).</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law bought a bottle for me after passing through her first pregnancy without stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This was my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> Ok so this is expensive for 4 ounces of oil, that&#x27;s for sure, but I do really love the stuff.  </li>
            <li> I might even love it enough to get another bottle of it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first baby</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better for different people.</li>
            <li> but I feel pretty oily for a while.</li>
            <li> This is my first child and my mother did get stretch marks .</li>
            <li> This product really does work and in my opinion is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday and so far, it has been great.</li>
            <li> But MamaMio is my favorite of the above because (1) texture - not too oily and appears to absorb easily and last throughout the day,</li>
            <li> Will need to update after giving birth and losing some of this weight to tell if it&#x27;s actually getting the job done, but so far loving it.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m very optimistic about not getting any in these last weeks with my twins:)</li>
            <li> It smells good and has lots of natural essential oils in it which are better than lotions and creams which have many unnecessary additives</li>
            <li> It smells nice, isn&#x27;t too heavy, is easy to apply, and has worked thus far.</li>
            <li> Some of the other butter like products have a very strong smell that I couldn&#x27;t handle in the first trimester.  </li>
            <li> So pretty much, I thought I was doomed in that area.</li>
            <li> I put up with it for so long because so many women swore by it.</li>
            <li> The Mama mio tummy oil definitely has a greasy feel at first, but I felt absorbed in quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had read magnificent reviews and needless to say I had high hopes for this product to work for me.</li>
            <li> I have heard many pregnant ladies complain about itchy, tight bellies</li>
            <li> I am nearly six months pregnant, and (fingers cross/throw some salt over my shoulder)</li>
            <li> I am 4 months pregnant and my skin has stayed soft and supple.</li>
            <li> If I were to put this on twice a day and apply &amp;#34;liberally&amp;#34; as directions state..this bottle would only last me 2-3 weeks at the very most.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant again this time and so far nothing.  </li>
            <li> I am no longer have dry skin &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I noticed the ingredients changed a bit over the past 3 years but the most important ingredients (almond oil, wheatgerm oil) are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ever since buying both of them, I need less of each to get nice, glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - Good value!</li>
            <li> Make sure you put it on though when you have time to just hang out in loose clothes with no where to go, I bought this and the belly butter, and after they both go on</li>
            <li> Being pregnant and sensitive to smells anyway, I don&#x27;t care much for the overpowering floral aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 weeks pregnant, have been using this product for about six weeks, and so far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> It has the key known ingredients that do the job (saturated fats, fine</li>
            <li> currently 6 weeks pregnant again (with twins, yikes!)</li>
            <li> personally the only thing going for this product is that it smells nice and makes your skin soft and it was dispatched quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I am recently became pregnant with my second child and once I reached 3 months I made sure I had a new bottle of Tummy Rub!  </li>
            <li> and I definitely wasn&#x27;t huge...</li>
            <li> What DID surprise me was how fast they went away even though I didn&#x27;t use it much after I gave birth.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this I have none stretch marks</li>
            <li> I too got stretch marks during a growth spurt in puberty, and fully expected to get more during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I shake the bottle to put about 10 drops on my hand and that covers my whole belly and sides.  </li>
            <li> but it did keep the skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li> so the cost is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> For some reason I never paid much attention to any that remarked about the scent.  </li>
            <li> Smells very musky and makes me want to remove it.  </li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m capable of getting them.)  </li>
            <li> I applied very liberally, 1-2 times a day and used almost 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> but it was too much oil.</li>
            <li> Im really skinny</li>
            <li> I really, really believe this works.  </li>
            <li> I find it very soothing.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the oil spread very well, so I used it in conjunction with the tummy butter.  </li>
            <li> I am now using it during my second pregnancy and it seems to keep my skin moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> and it really helps with my itchy belly.</li>
            <li> The Palmer&#x27;s seemed to clump up and get stuck onto my clothes when I put it on my very taught tummy</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent though.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my second trimester and growing, I get much needed relief from the dryness and itchiness that my skin is going through, AND no stretch marks so far :-)</li>
            <li> I have and really soothes my skin.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> and it was very oily.</li>
            <li> My boobs grew so fast</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like lotion or oils on my hands, but this is not greasy</li>
            <li> I have been applying very liberally once a day.  </li>
            <li> Sense of smell is especially sensitive during pregnancy</li>
            <li> People said that it is fast absorbing</li>
            <li> Very hydrating.</li>
            <li> It is really oily</li>
            <li> It absorb to your skin fast.</li>
            <li> I was very relaxing to put on.</li>
            <li> they really had to tug and tug....</li>
            <li> I guess we will have to wait and see how it works through the whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> The smell does not nauseate me when everything else does (it&#x27;s citrus-y)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching the contributory factors of stretch marks, I found the primary things have the biggest effect on whether you get stretch marks - diet, water intake, genetics, and exercise (not necessarily in this order).  </li>
            <li> This oil really helped soothe that</li>
            <li> so I of course became very paranoid about getting them during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Perhaps because I keep it very moisturized?</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of the product and it makes my skin feel silky</li>
            <li> I made it to my 37th week without any problems thanks to Mama Mio.</li>
            <li> Really helped my belly become very moisturized.</li>
            <li> - it was just too intense in smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oily stain comes out in the wash, but remember to wear either a cotton cami or wipe off excess/wait a few minutes for absorption before putting on that nice lightweight shirt you don&#x27;t want to mark up.  </li>
            <li> The first time I got out of the shower to put on the Bio Oil, I noticed new stretch marks</li>
            <li> It did not really help too much with my itchy skin when I was super pregnant</li>
            <li> Am 17 weeks pregnant and barely showing.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using this until my belly is back to the original size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it was a combination of all these factors that helped , but I&#x27;d like to give credit where it&#x27;s due , thank God for this lotion.</li>
            <li> I would usually shower before using it morning and night (just to make sure it got absorbed well) and then would do an additional application around noon, but it was still drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> Well I have been using this product for the past 14 weeks and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> The smell didn&#x27;t bother me much and while I understand that there&#x27;s a cream, I was pregnant in the winter and wanted that extra coverage from an oil-based product.</li>
            <li> I have gained 35 lbs and my belly is very large, 2 people have asked if I&#x27;m having twins, but this is my first pregnancy- just one big boy.</li>
            <li> Of the three, I preferred the ease of application, the light scent, and the long term feel of my tummy.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks developed although she&#x27;s just passed her first trimester....</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if it will be effective in preventing stretch marks.</li>
            <li> usually use it at night after a warm shower</li>
            <li> so they look more like a bunch of black keloids.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is decent size</li>
            <li> In spite being a healthy weight I have had some on my thighs and low hip area since I was a teen.</li>
            <li> Currently I am 19 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews but have only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 weeks pregnant, with red/purple-ish stretch marks starting about 2-3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been told that stretch marks are genetic, and that they strike older moms the hardest.  </li>
            <li> I am now 14 weeks pregnant with my second and have stocked up.  </li>
            <li> I am currently 6 months pregnant and no stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I hope I don&#x27;t get any in the end, but I truly believe if I was pregnant with 1 baby instead of 2 I would definitely not have gotten any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> and I am currently 9 months pregnant</li>
            <li> I ordered this product when I was around 14 weeks pregnant, and have used it religiously ever since.</li>
            <li> I started using it daily after my shower when I was around 12 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I am 23 weeks pregnant with my second child.</li>
            <li> I am 33 wks pregnant currently.  </li>
            <li> I have bought several bottles and buying one more now as I approach the final weeks.  </li>
            <li> I havent been using it long enough to really know for sure, if it will work.</li>
            <li> I was pregnant with twins and my belly was stretched to the max and the skin hurt so much.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> my mother and grandmother both have stretch marks) and would highly recommend daily/nightly oil massage to every expectant mother.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes with this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you purchase this to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It smells great - very subtle - and the texture is velvety soft.  </li>
            <li> My whole body is super dry from this winter</li>
            <li> I had light stretch marks prior to getting pregnant due to weight gain then loss.</li>
            <li> This product came with great reviews but was a tad expensive for my liking.</li>
            <li> I was really scared of getting stretch marks during pregnancy because I got some when I was growing as an adolescent, so clearly my skin is prone to them.</li>
            <li> My husband really disliked the smell of Palmer&#x27;s, and said this one was way better.</li>
            <li> So far no stretch marks...just a pretty soft belly.</li>
            <li> The clothes I wore closest to my body, such as tank tops or tight Ts, started to get a light rancid oil smell, even when clean.</li>
            <li> I can actually put my clothes on right after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I decided to look for something new, specifically something with less chemicals and more natural moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> No new stretch marks in 3 full weeks, and</li>
            <li> if you live in Brazil, use almond oil with Hipoglos also.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any new stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying a new one soon.</li>
            <li> And I was getting new stretch marks almost every day until I started using this again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 7 1/2 months and have yet to see a new stretch mark.  </li>
            <li> This oil has lightened those marks as well as keep new ones from coming in.</li>
            <li> raw shea butter and calendula or tamaran did way better</li>
            <li> I will say, though, that even these marks (which were very purple/red right after the baby) have faded to barely noticeable a year later, maybe a reason for hope for those who do develop them</li>
            <li> Mama Mio is quite expensive though, for a product that doesn&#x27;t work any better than the cheap options (Palmer&#x27;s is about $6/bottle,</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Very very soft.</li>
            <li> Like the smell.. Very early to say about the result.</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and not itchy.  </li>
            <li> This is my 2nd pregnancy where I&#x27;ve used this product liberally once a day(twice a day in very rare occassions like after a second shower or bath).  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure which ingredient caused it, but make sure you are not allergic to any ingredient before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I never write reviews because I&#x27;ve never had a product deliver exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li> When you first put it on it smells like citrus peels (orange mixed with lemon) or lemon starburst.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure that if I would&#x27;ve not use this product I might&#x27;ve had more stretch marks.</li>
            <li> just bought my second bottle as I&#x27;m finishing up the first.  </li>
            <li> I started using it in my first trimester and the bottle lasted me to 34 weeks, using it once daily.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about stretch marks earlier on, and so I started using Bio-oil, Clarins, Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s and MamaMio by the end of the first trimester.</li>
            <li> mom went from skeptic to believer because at first she was telling me that stretchmarks were genetic and that since she had it I might as well accept the inevitable.</li>
            <li> I would still stand by it and will continue to use it to fade the marks as soon as my scar is COMPLETELY healed!</li>
            <li> Might or might not be due to this product, but regardless enjoyed the oil and the twice daily ritual.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get the first stretch mark, so overall I&#x27;d wholeheartedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For the first trimester I only applied once a day.  </li>
            <li> I only use after I take a hot shower.</li>
            <li> belly stays soft and hydrated all day!  </li>
            <li> In my first pregnancy I gained 44 lbs and my 2nd</li>
            <li> I was pregnant, which was around 8 weeks, because of the high recommendations made by other users.</li>
            <li> The oil hydrates my skin so well, is not overly greasy, and rarely does the belly get so dry that it itches.  </li>
            <li> I have not used this product for long enough to be able to offer a review of whether this \\&quot;prevented\\&quot; stretchmarks (I&#x27;m currently 20 weeks).</li>
            <li> Starting at 4 months pregnant I religiously used the Mama Mio stretch mark oil and the Mama Mio stretch mark butter twice a day</li>
            <li> I had used pure coconut oil on my belly in the same manner until someone gave me this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 weeks pregnant and only have about 1/4 left of my current bottle, and would really like to keep using this until the baby is here.  </li>
            <li> I also have growth stretch marks in other areas of my body, so when I found out I was pregnant</li>
            <li> I bought it because the smell of cocoa butter made me nauseated and this smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> My baby is now 1 month old and my stomach has &amp;#34;stalled out&amp;#34; I am hoping this helps it continue to shrink.</li>
            <li> No improvement on scars thus far</li>
            <li> I have used it morning and night since I started showing and have so far not gotten any stretch marks (knock on wood--</li>
            <li> So far I have no stretch marks and will keep using until the end of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I am currently ready to give birth to my 2nd child.</li>
            <li> So far, I have gained 30 pounds and not a stretch mark in sight.</li>
            <li> But i knew i would feel better if I at least tried instead of giving in and ruling out any possibilities.</li>
            <li> I am a young 23-year-old mom and I am African-American</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s oily and you might need about three bottles to last you your whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Better late than never ...</li>
            <li> and I was completely devastated.</li>
            <li> , It keeps me soft and moisturized until the end of the day when I put it on again before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> So far, no stretch marks</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 36 weeks now and haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks so far</li>
            <li> - I doubt I can attribute that completely to the oil</li>
            <li> Been using this after my shower and so far, no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say that is a testament to the product, but being that I&#x27;m only 32 weeks along I can&#x27;t really guarantee it.</li>
            <li> This time I am trying Mama Mio, and so far no stretch marks</li>
            <li> no heavy smell</li>
            <li> I had my baby in early May</li>
            <li> i do believe the price is a bit much for only 4.1 fl oz...</li>
            <li> so far seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t got any stretch marks yet and I am on my 32nd week.</li>
            <li> Now I am at 30 weeks, and so far crossing fingers.. no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I am now week 14, so it&#x27;s still early.</li>
            <li> Once the belly is big it tends to go fast...</li>
            <li> Our son is now 5 months old, and I did not get stretch marks from the pregnancy.</li>
            <li> But remember that no cream, lotion, or oil will completely prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> The skin can only stretch so much, and genetics also plays a role.</li>
            <li> so far no stretch marks...</li>
            <li> Then again, maybe it was because the elasticity of my skin had already been stretched out the first time around.</li>
            <li> So far no stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> Old stretch marks have faded.  </li>
            <li> This is very soothing and essential for a pregnancy of multiples.  </li>
            <li> Used my whole pregnancy at night before bed (gained almost 40 pounds total) plus used another product I bought on Amazon zero stretch marks!!!</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs within maybe 15-20 minutes and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> I started using it in my fourth month once a day before the real stretching began.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product to family &amp; friends and really anyone looking for an oil that will not leave you feeling like you have to take another shower after applying it.  </li>
            <li> I am 16 weeks so its to early to say if it stops me from getting stretch marks</li>
            <li> This was recommended early in pregnancy to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gained 30 lbs so far.  </li>
            <li> The bottle top starts to slowly weep some of the oil and kept getting an oil ring on my cabinet shelf, so I has to store it in a dish.</li>
            <li> Look, my wife is hot, she does not have a single stretch mark on her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 17 weeks pregnant so far, so I am not very big and have no stretch marks so far but have had severe itching from having an appendicitis and hernia when I was younger...</li>
            <li> I loved this oil so much, I actually looked forward to putting it on twice a day, which might be part of the reason why I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks (except a small one around my navel piercing, which was to be expected)</li>
            <li> I got 3 tiny stretch marks that can barely be seen right above my belly button.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m starting to think that the cheaper and older alternative would&#x27;ve probably worked as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several bottles of this stuff with my first baby and bought again 3 yrs later now that I&#x27;m expecting baby #2.  </li>
            <li> I tried to stay active my whole pregnancy, but still I gained 30 pounds and my belly got pretty big to where I could feel my skin getting tighter,</li>
            <li> I used Palmers religiously throughout my pregnancy, but decided to get something a little better quality for the last trimester.  </li>
            <li> (2) smell is faint and pleasant, and (3) helped even out my overall skin tone.</li>
            <li> I used this product religiously for the second half of my pregnancy (didn&#x27;t really start showing until after 20+ weeks), went full term with a 7.5-pounder, and have NO stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I am still using it because it says it help skin to go back to normal.</li>
            <li> I normally like to wash in cold, but switched those items to hot to get a really thorough clean out of the oil residue.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive to purchase an oil just because I don&#x27;t really care to use oils and really don&#x27;t like to feel oily all the time...</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the fact that is not super oily like other brands.</li>
            <li> My belly seems bigger than a lot of other pregnant women&#x27;s bellies at this stage, so the tummy rub oil</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t live without this next time</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin so soft...might continue to use during Winter as I always get dry skin.</li>
            <li> I did drink a ton of water and keep my weight gain low, but overall I really think this helped.</li>
            <li> I used it last year religiously since I was 6 weeks pregnant and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say for sure that this product definitely worked, because there are other variables, but one bottle lasted nearly my entire pregnancy (I did buy a second bottle mid-way through my third tri)</li>
            <li> Yes, this stuff moisturizes like no other.</li>
            <li> Used through my second pregnancy and still no stretch marks despite gaining nearly 50lbs!</li>
            <li> She used the oil pretty regularly, but I think she was pretty conservative with it which ultimately resulted in a few stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> go for Mustella double action AND Dr Palmers butter.</li>
            <li> The bottle has a flaw -- when getting the oil onto your hands, some amount of oil runs out on the exterior of the bottle, and will leave oily rings on your furniture if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> I used the Mama Mio oil beginning early in my second trimester.  </li>
            <li> my baby is 2weeks old now im almost back to my pregnancy weight and have not even 1streatchmark.</li>
            <li> I bought another bottle to use with my 2nd pregnancy and so far, no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I also received the Mustela Stretch Mark Double Action Cream.  </li>
            <li> I used this religiously with my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get stretch marks until 10 days before the due date, when they just all popped up at once.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every single cent!!!!!</li>
            <li> only negatives are that it is very pricey and doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> I trust this oil will not leave stains or a residue so much that I have no problem wearing my suits or other maternity clothes after applying it.  </li>
            <li> Not a single one.  </li>
            <li> However, starting from the second use, I gradually developed an itch on my tummy.</li>
            <li> I know genes play a role in stretch marks, but I&#x27;ve been using this from 7 weeks through now (33 weeks) and don&#x27;t have a single new mark on my belly, thighs or chest.  </li>
            <li> having turned a little doughy from my 9 months of pregnancy indulgences ;)</li>
            <li> Once I got the new bottle, the itchiness immediately went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from being a bit pricey, there&#x27;s only one con - it can rub off on clothing that is a delicate fabric if you get dressed right away.  </li>
            <li> I am still in my early stages of pregnacy so in the long run we shall see if this works or not.  </li>
            <li> It does leave you oily at first, but soaks in after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say that it prevents or gets rid of stretch marks since I&#x27;m still pregnant.</li>
            <li> I am 25 weeks, and I have been using this oil at least once, sometimes twice a day since about 6 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> The oil is very heavy but absorbs fast in to my skin and makes it feel really soft.  </li>
            <li> but I use it very liberally - even on my back and thighs where I had previous stretch marks</li>
            <li> I found it very hard to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> Used diligently, generous applications at least once every night right before bed, starting from 4th month.  </li>
            <li> Eating right and gaining weight slowly in my opinion is the only way to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I went through 3 bottles with my first pregnancy and did&#x27;t get a single stretch mark and was sure I would because my Mom had bad ones</li>
            <li> Many of the other creams I&#x27;ve tried (including cocoa butter) actually make the itchiness worse</li>
            <li> Here on Amazon they have the new packaging, which looks nicer since it has a pump instead, but it was no worth</li>
            <li> I ordered extra direct from Mama Mio since I also wanted to try other items that were overpriced on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Despite my due diligence, I still developed stretch marks at 23 weeks.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not sure this product made a difference is that my mom (also very slim during her childbearing years) didn&#x27;t use anything, and she says she has no stretch marks, either.  </li>
            <li> My mother had horrible stretch marks from her pregnancy with me and I have decided to fight the good fight with my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> My husband teased me the whole time about my greasy little belly - even when it felt dry to me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of this -- I use a few other products as well, and my mom didn&#x27;t get many marks during her pregnancies either</li>
            <li> I am a smaller person and only use enough to cover myself generously from breasts to hips, and the butter lasts about 3 weeks (a month and a half in early pregnancy) and the oil about a month (a month and a half- two months early pregnancy).</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to add to my lotion routine to give my skin some extra help during the dry winter.  </li>
            <li> Also I don&#x27;t really consider the price unreasonable, considering I have been using the product twice a day liberally for the past 5 months</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really prevents stretch marks, I still got them...</li>
            <li> so it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the oil for so long I finally had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I do have to admit, this oil does last long.</li>
            <li> before pregnancy I always had a flat stomach</li>
            <li> a new little one cropped up every 1-2 days for about a week.  </li>
            <li> I have mild eczema prior to pregnancy and during my pregnancy I had dry patches behind my knees, the oil was so soothing.  </li>
            <li> I went through 2.5 bottles total and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li> find it hard (although not impossible) to apply the oil and butter when I&#x27;m not freshly showered.  </li>
            <li> so I can just put my clothes on right away without the feeling of being uncomfortable at all unlike other products that are really sticky that you have to wait minutes and minutes for it to dry and put your clothes on.</li>
            <li> I also read and heard all of the negatives from websites, other ladies, and doctors saying that stretch marks are inevitable, that it&#x27;s all about genetics and that topical applications don&#x27;t and can&#x27;t help anything.</li>
            <li> A year later, I&#x27;m still bikini-confident and I constantly refer the product to other expecting moms.</li>
            <li> I was Obsessed with this oil while I was pregnant!</li>
            <li> got a bottle of this early in pregnancy and started using it, but got lazy, especially since everything I read said it&#x27;s all genetic anyway.  </li>
            <li> The smell is HEAVENLY, it doesn&#x27;t take too long to soak into your skin.  </li>
            <li> It gave me minor bumps and did not absorb.</li>
            <li> softness and suppleness of the oil lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The time I used this oil was too short to tell whether it is effective in stretchmark prevention, but I can tell you it is not for everybody. :(</li>
            <li> would like to purchase this item again, but I will opt for a less expensive, better smelling one when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Also, I used it daily on my stomach from 16 weeks to 38 weeks, and still have about half a bottle left.  </li>
            <li> I gave birth to my son (my first child) and other than my once hard abs</li>
            <li> I would let it dry a little before putting clothes on, but it doesn&#x27;t feel suffocating like other oils, so I really liked that part too.</li>
            <li> Ahh, I mean, these type of products really can&#x27;t prevent stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> Maybe stretch marks are a matter of genetics, but in any case, my skin didn&#x27;t feel itchy, dry or stretched.  </li>
            <li> how long it takes to dry.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use every single night - the other products (a salve &amp; a lotion)</li>
            <li> I noticed as soon as I started it that the skin on my stomach was so dry it was flaky.</li>
            <li> I use this after I shower since my skin gets dry, and before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I have definitley noticed that my skin is not as dry and appears smoother, my skin stays hydrated throught the day.  </li>
            <li> I only have two small ones on my belly botton piercing area, barely noticeable .</li>
            <li> I also kept my weight gain to within the recommended guidelines (25 lbs, gained slowly and steadily) plus</li>
            <li> I immediately re-purchased the oil and no new marks showed.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks until the last 2-3 weeks of my pregnancy and they weren&#x27;t very bad, but that wasn&#x27;t surprising since my baby</li>
            <li> NOT ONE SINGLE STRETCH MARK.</li>
            <li> A SINGLE ONE!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get one single mark on my belly or boobs.</li>
            <li> I did not develop one single stretch mark during my pregnancy or after.  </li>
            <li> I did not get a single stretch-mark.</li>
            <li> My sister cannot believe I haven&#x27;t gotten a single stretch mark, she makes me show her my belly every time she comes over.</li>
            <li> I did not have a single stretch mark in that pregnancy.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get one single stretch marks even though I gained 35 pounds.  </li>
            <li> Each bottle on average would last me about 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Actually, you only need a small amount and it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have 12 days left to go before due date!).</li>
            <li> I was very greasy and had a hard time putting my bra on!</li>
            <li> I only went through a bottle and a half of the Oil for the rest of my pregnancy-</li>
            <li> I also understand that you&#x27;re less likely to get stretch marks in your 30s vs. 20s.  </li>
            <li> so one bottle only lasts about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> Each time only small amount is enough</li>
            <li> Wish it was a bigger bottle, I&#x27;m already thru half the bottle in about 2 months.</li>
            <li> With my second son our finances were low and didn&#x27;t want to be out the $35, for rather small bottle.</li>
            <li> While it hasn&#x27;t prevented any marks, I would definitely agree that it has made them less severe than they would have otherwise been.  </li>
            <li> I only used half of this bottle.</li>
            <li> No new stretch marks, thats a plus!</li>
            <li> I will point out that I have normally very dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get one single stretch mark!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark!</li>
            <li> then I had a c section and my baby had his cord tight wrapped twice around his neck and was buried very deep in my pelvis</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the beach surfing all the time and am constantly in a two-piece suit and was a little worried about getting stretch marks on my stomach.</li>
            <li> Im liking it so far and even my husband was saying he could hardly see the stretchmarks on my tummy.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and didn&#x27;t aggravate my horrible nausea at the beginning of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle was a littel bigger, but that was my only complaint.</li>
            <li> But I applied the oil twice a day EVERYDAY after my showers starting from 3 months along.</li>
            <li> and I have absolutely no stretch marks at all.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t regret the money spent on this.</li>
            <li> I was not very found of the smell</li>
            <li> Spent a lot of money on this product throughout my pregnancy (and after) and still got stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I think there is really no way to avoid it</li>
            <li> I will keep you updated in the next few months.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m careful about where I place the bottle.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks later stretch marks started to show.  </li>
            <li> Although, I do allow roughly 5 minutes to go by after applying the oil to allow time for my skin to fully absorb it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After birth, a week later the ones that I had during last trimester slowly disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Another cream I&#x27;ve used is plain Vitamin E cream, which also seemed to help, but I&#x27;ve been only using the Mama Mio oil since I was around 7 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I still have a little less than a quarter of the bottle left!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be switching to something a little less pungent.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I already have some stretch marks on my back and legs from my puberty growth spurts, AND my mom and grandmas got them bad from being pregnant.</li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t prevent every single stretch mark at least it helps to sooth the inevitable itch of a growing belly.  </li>
            <li> I only have 2 small strech marks coming off of an existing appendix scar and let me tell you</li>
            <li> and he usually complains about the smells of the various products I use.</li>
            <li> (bc I am extremely itchy).</li>
            <li> I know that the results may vary so it might work for other women</li>
            <li> I noticed no results other than oily sheets after I put it on before bed.</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve been trying other things - MamaMio cream,</li>
            <li> I worried I would lose my skin due to the stretching.</li>
            <li> Not as overbearing as some other oils I tried.</li>
            <li> I will be trying lotion next, no more oil for me.  </li>
            <li> Also, when you pour the oil out you have to be careful because it drips down the side of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I had very minimal stretch marks for carrying a 9 lb 3 oz baby at 37 weeks.....</li>
            <li> Within a few hours it felt dry again.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m an average size and went thru 4-5 bottles in 36 weeks)</li>
            <li> However, I found that the oil is difficult to apply as it doesn&#x27;t really spread across the skin.  </li>
            <li> my LATE 3rd trimester, I received two stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a base most days as soon as I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil can get messy at times, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> They are very small and light in color, and I know they will get probably get worse within the final few weeks, but I believe that had I not used this product they would be MUCH worse by now.</li>
            <li> On the down side, even with use of both the oil and the cream in the morning and night, I couldn&#x27;t seem to keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> however, I was not going down without a fight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mom and sister never got them but somewhere down the line someone had them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Around my 37th week, I developed a few faint marks around my poor, long-suffering and very taut belly button area.</li>
            <li> Over the course of 5 months of use, I used a bottle and a half.</li>
            <li> In a day and a half the pain had gone.  </li>
            <li> enough, I never had stretchmarks (except for a small part on my hip that I don&#x27;t usually apply the oil</li>
            <li> I already knew I was prone to stretch marks since I had some on my thighs from previous weight gain.</li>
            <li> I used less than 2 bottles throughout my pregnancy</li>
            <li> I was also stoked that their driving factor in making this product was born out of previous pregnancies.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even made it through half of the bottle yet</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time too since the oil is very thick, a little goes a long way and soaks into the skin gradually, no greasy after feel.</li>
            <li> I got a few slight dark stretch marks on my hips.</li>
            <li> I have tired other oils, including one from L&#x27;occitaine with virtually the same ingredients, and it barley compares to this oil.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little pricey so after it ran out</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I still got stretch marks-it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> complaint is that the oil discolored my white shirts a little.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful, delicate citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I plan on using during my post-delivery recovery period in the hopes it will help me tone and firm in record time.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money on it again.</li>
            <li> (I already had gotten a few on my thighs) within a few days of switching over from Palmer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I figure I am going to get some, because I got a few on my hips and thighs during puberty.</li>
            <li> I started using it around 3 months and kept with it everyday until my son was born  </li>
            <li> everyday</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste $30 plus dollars on fancy oils like this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on anything else.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product - granted, I still have a few weeks to go</li>
            <li> My stretch marks have not been getting worse and the color is not as red.</li>
            <li> I do recommend waiting a few minutes to put clothing on though, as it takes a bit for your skin to absorb it.</li>
            <li> I even applied it morning and night everyday.  </li>
            <li> I applied at a minimum twice a day everyday from 8weeks on and still got stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I apply this tummy rub oil everyday.</li>
            <li> I just got a few stretch marks this week around my belly button.</li>
            <li> Also, I am prone to stretch marks because I have a few from my growth spurt as a teenager.  </li>
            <li> Not So Good:&lt;br /&gt;I busted a stretch mark just a few weeks after using this product.</li>
            <li> I was worried about stretch marks because I have a few on both of my butt cheeks from when I hit puberty.  </li>
            <li> I have had this for a while now still half bottle!</li>
            <li> So...I&#x27;mgoing to credit this one to Mama Mio because all other indicators said I should have gotten at least some stretch marks.</li>
            <li> only real negative feedback at this point is that the product doesn&#x27;t dispense well and leaves the bottle all oily.</li>
            <li> I plan to use this past my delivery date by a few weeks just in case.</li>
            <li> The oil stained my dress, not sure if it will come out since I washed and dried it before noticing the stains.  </li>
            <li> No joke- Not even a little one!  </li>
            <li> After trying a few different stretch mark butters that felt thick and left a bad residue, a friend with twins suggested Mama Mio.</li>
            <li> but I do think it helped a very little bit.</li>
            <li> Used everyday and did not get any stretch marks!  </li>
            <li> and I also have some small ones on my breasts and hips from puberty.  </li>
            <li> and I were small.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks because of this rub or if it was genetics</li>
            <li> Not sure if genetics played a role (since I never had an issue with stretch marks before),</li>
            <li> (I do have faint stretch marks on my hips from growing during my teenage years, so</li>
            <li> No more marks since I stopped using</li>
            <li> I have been somewhat prone to stretch marks in the past</li>
            <li> has it helped to prevent stretch marks I am not sure....</li>
            <li> I am so unbelievably grateful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it helped or didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works on stretch marks yet</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s the first time it&#x27;s stretching. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it will stop stretch marks</li>
            <li> I typically do not use oils because I am afraid that they will leave a residue or leave me feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I did end up with stretch marks on my leg from grabbing so hard when pushing during delivery, so I am susceptible to stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but after less than a week of using this oil my stretch marks were remarkably less noticeable!</li>
            <li> I used it at least once a day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it at least once a day, like others have said it is oily, so I put it on and do my hair and makeup while it dries before I get dressed.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really not all that expensive.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve honestly never felt either of those sensations.  </li>
            <li> but it tells you to put it on thick.</li>
            <li> I would recomend either using it just in the evenings or not quite so thick.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thick,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the oil or genes, but I did not get not one stretch mark!</li>
            <li> and I am now the owner of a stomach full of horrible stretch marks,  </li>
            <li> Smells funky so it has made it hard for me to use and is greasy!</li>
            <li> The oil might work at preventing stretch marks, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t get past the application to find out.</li>
            <li> and I put it on at least 2 times a day!</li>
            <li> At the very least, Mama Mio staves off itchiness as your belly grows, and is safer than the mineral-based oils that contain parabens etc.</li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t mean I was going to roll over and let whatever stretch marks occur!  </li>
            <li> Maybe they&#x27;d be worse if I hadn&#x27;t used this stuff??  </li>
            <li> Yep, you&#x27;ll smell like dusty old-lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> This product was too thin for me.</li>
            <li> my hips) got a few huge/deep stretch marks :-(</li>
            <li> I started out using it twice a day, but it became really expensive, so I supplemented a cheaper oil to use in the morning and it still worked.</li>
            <li> Even my doctor commented about my tummy skin being &amp;#34;nicer than everybody else&#x27;s&amp;#34; and that I &amp;#34;must be using an expensive oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Yeah, it was expensive...</li>
            <li> and boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately did not work for me.</li>
            <li> She used a lot at a time and In the end I bought 4 or 5 bottles through the pregnancy, crazy thing is she still uses it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately at 33 weeks the stretch marks started to appear :(</li>
            <li> Very expensive, and I saw no results.</li>
            <li> but I thought it was very expensive at $56 which includs tax and shipping.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me there is nothing I could do to prevent stretch marks, but that using this may help them from being too bad.  </li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t make you sick.  </li>
            <li> and I still got a lot of stretch marks.. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> one bad thing, if your clumsy your going to drop it and break the bottle because its GLASS!!!!!</li>
            <li> hated the store brand coco stuff because of the smell.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong !!!</li>
            <li> and cousin have awful stretch marks</li>
            <li> A nasty one on the side, then another ...</li>
            <li> My mother has some of the worst stretch marks I have ever seen on a person....</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the smell is just awful.</li>
            <li> Smell is terrible!</li>
            <li> otherwise I get terribly naseuous.</li>
            <li> My Mother had terrible stretch marks, so I assumed I was destined for them as well, but I believe this oil saved me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. I used it at least once a day once I started to show, at about 12 weeks.  Before 12 weeks it used it 3-4 times a week. I used the cream once a day at night and the boob tube product as well. I did not receive any stretch marks! I am still using the oil once a day. My baby is now 1 month old and my stomach has &amp;#34;stalled out&amp;#34; I am hoping this helps it continue to shrink.</li>
            <li> Smells funky so it has made it hard for me to use and is greasy! No improvement on scars thus far</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I used it throughout my pregnancy after showers. It could possibly be the reason why I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks on my abdomen during my pregnancy.  Lasts a good amount of time, but you&#x27;ll probably need two bottles to get through 9 months.  The other products by Mama Mio are great as well!</li>
            <li> I am currently in my second trimester and I started using this product about 4 weeks ago. It smells great and absorbs quickly.  It is not greasy at all.  I don&#x27;t know what it will do to prevent stretch marks, but I feel better using it and my skin is super smooth.  I plan on using during my post-delivery recovery period in the hopes it will help me tone and firm in record time.  That&#x27;s asking a lot of one product, though!!</li>
            <li> Ahh, I mean, these type of products really can&#x27;t prevent stretchmarks. Your genes are a big determinant. I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money on it again.</li>
            <li> I have to stop using it since I got rash from it. i&#x27;m not sure which ingredient caused it, but make sure you are not allergic to any ingredient before purchasing.</li>
            <li> As for myself I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I hated the store brand coco stuff because of the smell. Anyhow this ptoduct smells great and keeps my skin&lt;br /&gt;Very very soft.</li>
            <li> mama mio tummy rub stretch mark oil 4.1 fl oz prevent stretch marks, i  like it that.&lt;br /&gt;very very smooth.</li>
            <li> I heard about Mama Mio when I was 8 weeks pregnant and used it twice a day with the cream since I was 9 weeks. My mom.. aunt.. and cousin have awful stretch marks so I knew there was a genetic disposition. I was extremely happy with this product until I was about 30 weeks pregnant and noticed 3 stretch marks. Within 1 1/2 weeks the entire bottom of my tummy had stretch marks. Second issue is I&#x27;m caribbean so they look more like a bunch of black keloids.  I&#x27;ve never scratched and should mention Ive only gained 11lbs during my pregnancy ( I&#x27;m now 35 weeks pregnant). So its not like I&#x27;ve gained massive weight to explain so many stretch marks. I guess its different.</li>
            <li> Very expensive, and I saw no results.</li>
            <li> Stretch marks run in my family. I used this religiously with my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get stretch marks until 10 days before the due date, when they just all popped up at once. But I never had \\&quot;itchy belly\\&quot; problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second pregnancy I didn&#x27;t use it at all, and got a lot more stretch marks and did often have an itchy belly. I probably should have used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that the oil discolored my white shirts a little.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful, delicate citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I used this product religiously for the second half of my pregnancy (didn&#x27;t really start showing until after 20+ weeks), went full term with a 7.5-pounder, and have NO stretch marks.  Not a single one.  This oil smells great, massages in well without leaving a sticky residue, and WORKS!  I also liked the Tummy Rub cream, but the oil lasts much much longer.  I started with the cream and went through a jar in a month.  A bottle of this oil lasted about 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li> Used everyday and did not get any stretch marks!  A must buy!!!</li>
            <li> I am recently became pregnant with my second child and once I reached 3 months I made sure I had a new bottle of Tummy Rub!  I went through 3 bottles with my first pregnancy and did&#x27;t get a single stretch mark and was sure I would because my Mom had bad ones and I also have some small ones on my breasts and hips from puberty.  I put this on morning and night and never missed a day.  I swear this was the reason I never got any!!</li>
            <li> Both my mother and sister had stretch marks so I figured I was doomed, but I had to try anyway. I used this oil around the beginning of my second trimester untill I delivered. I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks until the last 2-3 weeks of my pregnancy and they weren&#x27;t very bad, but that wasn&#x27;t surprising since my baby and I were small. What DID surprise me was how fast they went away even though I didn&#x27;t use it much after I gave birth. 19 months later I can&#x27;t see them at all and I&#x27;m going to purchase another bottle for bump number 2.</li>
            <li> go for Mustella double action AND Dr Palmers butter. if you live in Brazil, use almond oil with Hipoglos also. they will work well to prevent the stretch marks on you. sleep with them on, put on your old pijama and good luck!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I started using a product called \\&quot;Beauty for ashes tummy oil\\&quot; this product was good but I thought it was very expensive at $56 which includs tax and shipping. I then looked on amazon for products that had similar ingredient&#x27;s. I read the reviews on this oil and thought I would try it. I started using this product when I was 3 months. I am now 5 months pregnant and no stretch marks. I did get some stretch marks on my lower back, buttocks, and inner thighs from teenage years. So, I&#x27;m hoping that as I get bigger this product continues to work. It feels good on my skin and it also has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I am nearly six months pregnant, and (fingers cross/throw some salt over my shoulder) I don&#x27;t have any new stretch marks.  I use this stuff every day, often twice a day, and definitely after every time I shower.  It smells great and feels good on.  Despite the doctors who insist genes not creams determine stretch marks, I definitely think this oil works as a stretch mark preventative.  During my freshman year of college, I gained 15 pounds in three months, and my butt and thighs still looked as striped as a zebra, so I was really worried about stretch marks when I became pregnant.  But this time around, I have used Mama Mio tummy rub as a stretch mark preventative in conjunction with gradual weight gain (I try to keep my calorie intake between 2,400 to 2,600 calories a day) and exercise (I use the elliptical for about 20 minutes four times a week and I use the 10-Minute Solutions Pre-Natal Pilates about 10-20 minutes three to four times a week).  I tried Palmers (couldn&#x27;t stand the smell) before this and an organic stretch mark cream (made me break out), but this is my favorite! I would recommend it to every pregnant lady!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite stretch mark product. I started out using Clarins stretch mark lotion (way overpriced), and my friend gave me mama b&#x27;s belly butter (to sticky and did not absorb well). This oil not only smells awesome, but I find that it is easy to apply, absorbs well (doesn&#x27;t affect my clothing) and prevents itchy belly. I love it! I have used it morning and night since I started showing and have so far not gotten any stretch marks (knock on wood--I have 12 days left to go before due date!). Also I don&#x27;t really consider the price unreasonable, considering I have been using the product twice a day liberally for the past 5 months and I still have a little less than a quarter of the bottle left!</li>
            <li> I used tummy cream all through pregnancies and this oil towards the end of each of my pregnancies.  I have two babies, strong genetics for stretchmarks and no marks for me!  Mama Mio rocks!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks because of this rub or if it was genetics but regardless I&#x27;ll be using it for every pregnancy. Easy to put on and makes skin incredibly soft. I used it postpartum as well.</li>
            <li> I have tired other oils, including one from L&#x27;occitaine with virtually the same ingredients, and it barley compares to this oil.  The smell is HEAVENLY, it doesn&#x27;t take too long to soak into your skin.  So far I have no stretch marks and will keep using until the end of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I started using Mama Mio around my 8th week of pregnancy. I gained 35 lbs and carried my baby bump well in the 41st week and I didn&#x27;t get one single stretch mark! I applied the oil liberally to my belly, breasts and thighs/butt every night after showering. I started out using it twice a day, but it became really expensive, so I supplemented a cheaper oil to use in the morning and it still worked. Not sure if genetics played a role (since I never had an issue with stretch marks before), but I&#x27;m willing to bet this oil is the reason why I avoided the mommy battle scars. I love the smell too. Each bottle on average would last me about 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this I have none stretch marks</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Whether or not it helps prevent stretch marks up until the end is yet to be told, but I&#x27;m happy with it so far. I have tried both the Tummy Rub oil and the Tummy Rub butter and prefer the oil simply because it lasts longer. I don&#x27;t know why some reviewers claim one jar of this product lasts them four or five months... I am a smaller person and only use enough to cover myself generously from breasts to hips, and the butter lasts about 3 weeks (a month and a half in early pregnancy) and the oil about a month (a month and a half- two months early pregnancy). Use generously, though, because skimping on it isn&#x27;t going to do us any favors! I put this on once a day up until about 20 weeks and now that I&#x27;m 25 weeks have been using it twice a day. So far no stretch marks, and my skin smells great (my husband loves it!) and feels great!</li>
            <li> The bottle has a flaw -- when getting the oil onto your hands, some amount of oil runs out on the exterior of the bottle, and will leave oily rings on your furniture if you are not careful. They could have done better.</li>
            <li> I used Palmers religiously throughout my pregnancy, but decided to get something a little better quality for the last trimester.  I chose Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil and Cream because of all the great reviews I&#x27;ve read.  On the plus side, it smells really nice. My husband really disliked the smell of Palmer&#x27;s, and said this one was way better. On the down side, even with use of both the oil and the cream in the morning and night, I couldn&#x27;t seem to keep my skin hydrated. Within a few hours it felt dry again.  I got my first stretch mark on my belly (I already had gotten a few on my thighs) within a few days of switching over from Palmer&#x27;s. My doctor told me no cream in the world is going to prevent them if they&#x27;re in your genes, so it might not be Mama Mio&#x27;s fault.  Mama Mio is quite expensive though, for a product that doesn&#x27;t work any better than the cheap options (Palmer&#x27;s is about $6/bottle, Mama Mio oil and cream came to $70). The oil and cream both lasted me about 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am currently ready to give birth to my 2nd child. I&#x27;ve used this product with both my pregnancies starting from around week 11. I am prone to stretchmarks and they run in my family. However; using this product, I don&#x27;t have any stretchmarks from pregnancy! It smells good and is a luxury to use each morning! I&#x27;d recommend this to any expectant Mom!</li>
            <li> I am the last person to review products, but I have to add my own input about this amazing product. I too got stretch marks during a growth spurt in puberty, and fully expected to get more during pregnancy. Not so! As soon as I found out I was pregnant, I lathered from shoulder to hips in Mama Mio, twice a day, using both the oil and the butter, and my skin remained supple, smooth, and completely free of pregnancy stretch marks. I will say that I used extraordinarily generous helpings, and probably got through a bottle of oil a month. I also kept my weight gain to within the recommended guidelines (25 lbs, gained slowly and steadily) plus I drank plenty of water and coconut water to further aid hydration. At the very least, Mama Mio staves off itchiness as your belly grows, and is safer than the mineral-based oils that contain parabens etc.</li>
            <li> The Mama Mio line, specifically the \\&quot;Congratulations\\&quot; kit which includes the \\&quot;Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil\\&quot; is the BEST gift I received, EVER! It smells so good, lasts a long time and is WORTH every penny! (despite being a bit more than I&#x27;d prefer to pay). I&#x27;m almost 34 weeks, I&#x27;ve been using this set/oil since I was about 3 months pregnant. I got rid of all my Cocoa Butter creams I had purchased and solely use Mama Mio products. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love the whole line of Mama Mio products, but tummy oil is my favorite. First of all the smell is amazing and doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful ingredients like most \\&quot;fragrances\\&quot; do. It moisturizes better than anything else i tried and I am 34 weeks now and no stretchmarks so far.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only line I&#x27;ll use during pregnancy because it&#x27;s the safest and most effective one I found</li>
            <li> I love the mama mio products, It never prevented strech marks with any of my pregnancies but it smells wonderful and is very soothing to itchy pregnant bellies :-)</li>
            <li> Has not yet started, the original is at a friend&#x27;s recommendation to buy.Such as the use, we will then decide whether to continue to buy it</li>
            <li> I love this product, and the whole product line.  I bought this in conjunction with the body butter to specifically use this at night.  I thought that since it was an oil, that it may feel greasy and stain my clothes.  Actually, you only need a small amount and it goes a long way.  I shake the bottle to put about 10 drops on my hand and that covers my whole belly and sides.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy during the day and has a very pleasant lemony smell.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I either have good genes, or this product works! I used this morning and night starting my 4th month of pregnancy and until 8 wks after I gave birth and I have ZERO stretch marks. It did not really help too much with my itchy skin when I was super pregnant but it did keep the skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am 25 weeks, and I have been using this oil at least once, sometimes twice a day since about 6 weeks pregnant. I occasionally use the cream as well. The smell is great and didn&#x27;t aggravate my horrible nausea at the beginning of my pregnancy. So far, I have gained 30 pounds and not a stretch mark in sight. I figure I am going to get some, because I got a few on my hips and thighs during puberty. Keeping my fingers crossed that this takes me through the nine month streeeeetch!</li>
            <li> Used diligently, generous applications at least once every night right before bed, starting from 4th month.  I had used pure coconut oil on my belly in the same manner until someone gave me this product.  I never got stretch marks (my mother and grandmother both have stretch marks) and would highly recommend daily/nightly oil massage to every expectant mother.  I called it belly sauce!  Over the course of 5 months of use, I used a bottle and a half.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this oil!!  I will use next time around for sure!! I swear by it - coming from a family of women who got stretch marks I thought I was doomed. I started using this oil at 10 weeks and am very happy with the results!! I love the scent (very light &amp; clean) and the oil absorbs into your skin so you are not left feeling greasy (as Palmer&#x27;s butter does). At 5 months the only stretch marks I earned were on my hips/back where I was skimping on applying oil (should have read the directions). I attacked that immediately, and was able to prevent more damage. I also started using twice a day in my 3rd tri, and post-partum so suggest you stock up!! (I&#x27;m an average size and went thru 4-5 bottles in 36 weeks)</li>
            <li> I believe this oil does work, but i couldn&#x27;t give it a chance. It has a strong smell. Probably, to normal people it wouldn&#x27;t feel as strong, but pregnant women can be really sensitive to smells (just as i am). Cant use it. (((</li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t usually buy into the hype of cosmetic products who boast miracles. Secondly, I never write reviews because I&#x27;ve never had a product deliver exactly what it claims.  But I read the product reviews for this and figured why not try. I&#x27;m at the beach surfing all the time and am constantly in a two-piece suit and was a little worried about getting stretch marks on my stomach. I already have some stretch marks on my back and legs from my puberty growth spurts, AND my mom and grandmas got them bad from being pregnant. So pretty much, I thought I was doomed in that area. But i knew i would feel better if I at least tried instead of giving in and ruling out any possibilities. Now- I also read and heard all of the negatives from websites, other ladies, and doctors saying that stretch marks are inevitable, that it&#x27;s all about genetics and that topical applications don&#x27;t and can&#x27;t help anything. But I applied the oil twice a day EVERYDAY after my showers starting from 3 months along. I also applied the mama mio tummy butter on top of that but the butter only lasted me a month and it&#x27;s a little pricey so after it ran out i used st. ives elastin body lotion in combination with the oil. Twice a day. I only went through a bottle and a half of the Oil for the rest of my pregnancy- so it does last a long time. And I applied it liberally. It&#x27;s oil, so I would let it dry a little before putting clothes on, but it doesn&#x27;t feel suffocating like other oils, so I really liked that part too. I tried to stay active my whole pregnancy, but still I gained 30 pounds and my belly got pretty big to where I could feel my skin getting tighter, And still you know what....NOT ONE SINGLE STRETCH MARK. No joke- Not even a little one!  I gave birth to my son (my first child) and other than my once hard abs having turned a little doughy from my 9 months of pregnancy indulgences ;), there&#x27;s no other evidence that I was even pregnant and now a mama to a beautiful little boy. So...I&#x27;mgoing to credit this one to Mama Mio because all other indicators said I should have gotten at least some stretch marks. So- twice a day, with lotion...it worked for me and it was well worth the price. I&#x27;m so very pleased with the results and am definitely going to recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s pregnant!!!</li>
            <li> I am a first-time mom and I used this on my belly, and my back and my sides and I have no stretch marks!! I am a young 23-year-old mom and I am African-American and I have absolutely no stretch marks at all. The bottle is decent size it&#x27;s oily and you might need about three bottles to last you your whole pregnancy. Trust me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I used the Mama Mio oil beginning early in my second trimester.  I did not develop stretch marks on my tummy, but did develop some on my breasts where I was not using the oil.  I can&#x27;t say for sure if this oil is responsible for me getting away without stretch marks, I didn&#x27;t exactly have a taut tummy when I got pregnant, so probably had some give already.  I also understand that you&#x27;re less likely to get stretch marks in your 30s vs. 20s.  I did end up with stretch marks on my leg from grabbing so hard when pushing during delivery, so I am susceptible to stretch marks.  I will say, though, that even these marks (which were very purple/red right after the baby) have faded to barely noticeable a year later, maybe a reason for hope for those who do develop them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for sure that this product definitely worked, because there are other variables, but one bottle lasted nearly my entire pregnancy (I did buy a second bottle mid-way through my third tri) so the cost is reasonable.  Nice and moisturizing, so I didn&#x27;t have itchiness problems.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Look, my wife is hot, she does not have a single stretch mark on her. When she became pregnant I was so terrified that her perfect skin would be ruined. I know this makes me sound like a jerk but my desire to avoid stretch marks led me to this AWESOME product. My wife used this throughout the entire pregnancy and not one damn stretch mark popped up, NOT A SINGLE ONE!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know my wife enjoyed the smell, which is extremely important to a pregnant woman. She used a lot at a time and In the end I bought 4 or 5 bottles through the pregnancy, crazy thing is she still uses it and i am sure shes going to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one bad thing, if your clumsy your going to drop it and break the bottle because its GLASS!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing I&#x27;m at 41 weeks and ad I only have 2 small strech marks coming off of an existing appendix scar and let me tell you I am ok w that considering when I got breast implants I had gotten more than enough stretch marks on my breasts so I thought for sure this oil wouldn&#x27;t do much but I was wrong !!! Deff recommend this product for breast augmentation and preggo bellies !!!</li>
            <li> Nice scent, very easy to be absorbed by skin. I feel very pleased after my first try of this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the mama mio tummy rub stretch mark oil since I was in my third month of pregnancy. My belly is huge but I&#x27;m happy to say that I have no stretch marks! I use it twice a day and sometimes add the mama mio butter as well. I use a lot so one bottle only lasts about a month and a half. I highly recommend this product. [[ASIN:B000OZF8W6 Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil, 4.1 fl oz, prevent stretch marks, safe for pregnancy]]</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading many reviews.  For some reason I never paid much attention to any that remarked about the scent.  When you first put it on it smells like citrus peels (orange mixed with lemon) or lemon starburst.  After its had a while to soak in to my skin I feel like I have a teenage boy following me around.  Smells very musky and makes me want to remove it.  If I was still had morning sickness I do not think I could use it.  The oil is very heavy but absorbs fast in to my skin and makes it feel really soft.  I use the stretch mark butter with this at the same time.  I hope I can get use to the smell because I do love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> the mama mio tummy rub i bought for a gift person whom i gave it to loved it said that she is gonna order one</li>
            <li> Love it!! I will be buying a new one soon. I rub it all over my belly. Haven&#x27;t seen any stech mark yet.</li>
            <li> I used this religiously during my pregnancy, every night.  I used the Mamma Mio butter every morning bc I thought the oil might stain my clothes.  Despite having a big baby (over 9 lbs; I gained, then lost 25 lbs) and my breasts going from a 34A to a 38DD at their peak, I don&#x27;t have ANY stretch marks.  (I do have faint stretch marks on my hips from growing during my teenage years, so I know I&#x27;m capable of getting them.)  The only reason I&#x27;m not sure this product made a difference is that my mom (also very slim during her childbearing years) didn&#x27;t use anything, and she says she has no stretch marks, either.  Maybe stretch marks are a matter of genetics, but in any case, my skin didn&#x27;t feel itchy, dry or stretched.  So I don&#x27;t regret the money spent on this.</li>
            <li> I was Obsessed with this oil while I was pregnant! I started using it around 3 months and kept with it everyday until my son was born  (and a bit beyond). It smells great, is made from wonderful ingredients, feels amazing on your skin, and best of all...no stretch marks! I thought I would be prone to them, since I have others on my hips and thighs from teenage years, but not a one appeared during pregnancy.  It is a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way.  I applied very liberally, 1-2 times a day and used almost 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> I knew I was getting an oil and I wanted it because of that but it tells you to put it on thick. I did that but it was too much oil. I was very greasy and had a hard time putting my bra on! I would recomend either using it just in the evenings or not quite so thick. Rub it in good. Maybe get a masseuse to use it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I used it last year religiously since I was 6 weeks pregnant and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark.  Im really skinny so i figured my skin would have to stretch so much that i would get them for sure but I&#x27;m stoked with the results.  Im currently 6 weeks pregnant again (with twins, yikes!) and have started using it once again so I&#x27;m hoping to get the same results this time around.  Give it a chance and use it, the smell is so soothing and the oil gives your belly a nice moisturized glow. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Better late than never ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a bottle of this early in pregnancy and started using it, but got lazy, especially since everything I read said it&#x27;s all genetic anyway.  So by 12 or 15 weeks I had stopped altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stretch marks started at about 30 weeks.  Ugh!!!  A nasty one on the side, then another ... a new little one cropped up every 1-2 days for about a week.  Then I pulled this out and decided to try again.  That was 3 weeks ago.  No new stretch marks in 3 full weeks, and I&#x27;ve definitely gotten bigger.  And I was getting new stretch marks almost every day until I started using this again.  I really, really believe this works.  My usage is almost a perfect scientific study because it involves the same person at the same age etc etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved using the Mama Mio Tummy rub because it smells great and soothes my itchy belly.  However, if you&#x27;re prone to stretch marks and you get big enough then you get stretch marks.  My dermatologist told me there is nothing I could do to prevent stretch marks, but that using this may help them from being too bad.  I&#x27;m 31 weeks pregnant with twins and up 30 pounds and the stretch marks just started appearing, even after using the Mama Mio and Palmer&#x27;s every day for months.  Maybe they&#x27;d be worse if I hadn&#x27;t used this stuff??  Regardless, the oil relieves the itchiness and burning.  I find it very soothing.  If anything actually prevented stretch marks all together then I would give it 5 stars, but that product doesn&#x27;t exist!</li>
            <li> The product smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel which I appreciated very much. However, I found that the oil is difficult to apply as it doesn&#x27;t really spread across the skin.  I found myself having to use a significant amount of product just to get my stomach and the top part of my hips covered and I am a petite person.  It is almost as if it absorbs too quickly to get a good application.  The oil might work at preventing stretch marks, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t get past the application to find out.</li>
            <li> I was 34 weeks pregnant when I ordered this oil. Throughout my pregnancy I have been rotating different oils &amp; lotions to make sure my belly stayed stretch mark free, which it was until I started using this product! I noticed as soon as I started it that the skin on my stomach was so dry it was flaky. I would usually shower before using it morning and night (just to make sure it got absorbed well) and then would do an additional application around noon, but it was still drying out my skin. As soon as I realized there was no way this stuff was going to work (I gave it about 3 weeks) I went to the grocery store and bought Bio Oil. Bio Oil is AMAZING - get that, not this!! The first time I got out of the shower to put on the Bio Oil, I noticed new stretch marks and I was completely devastated. No more marks since I stopped using Mama Mio - I wish I had never used it to begin with.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife when she was 2 months pregnant. She is 7 months now and uses Mama Mio twice a day every day and NO stretch marks!! it has a pleasant smell that is not overpowering and does not smell like medicine. My wife would recommend this product to all pregnant women.</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me I would slather my tummy with this oil and the butter to morning ang evening  everyday and I still got a lot of stretch marks.. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I made it through an entire pregnancy without any stretchmarks on my belly.  I didn&#x27;t think the oil spread very well, so I used it in conjunction with the tummy butter.  I did drink a ton of water and keep my weight gain low, but overall I really think this helped.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling but didn&#x27;t prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks developed although she&#x27;s just passed her first trimester.... What&#x27;s interesting is that old stretch marks have started fading away</li>
            <li> I am now 29 weeks pregnant.  Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil was added to my tummy care routine two months ago (21 weeks).  I apply it to my tummy, hip, upper part of my thighs and wrap around my body.  Then, I add the cream as a second layer.  I only do this tummy care routine once a day after shower.  I don&#x27;t see any sign of stretch mark or feel itchy so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I shall wait until my delivery to tell whether Mama Mio tuummy care system works as it claims.  Yet, I am pretty sure that I like the scent and the texture of the products and will continue to use them through out my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and I love how my skin absorbs this instantly so I can just put my clothes on right away without the feeling of being uncomfortable at all unlike other products that are really sticky that you have to wait minutes and minutes for it to dry and put your clothes on. I am still on the process of using it, I am happy I don&#x27;t have any signs of stretch marks and I&#x27;m on the 5th month of pregnancy :) i&#x27;ll be posting an updated review once I have my baby boy and when I&#x27;m back on my shape :))))</li>
            <li> I was originally using the cream version of Mamma Mio&#x27;s tummy rub, but I certainly like this oil much more, It keeps me soft and moisturized until the end of the day when I put it on again before going to sleep. So far, no stretch marks and I&#x27;m six months in. I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed that I won&#x27;t end up getting them last minute. This rub also keeps the itchy-ness away because as I was waiting for my shipment to come in, I was running out of my rub and noticed a lot of itcy-ness.</li>
            <li> Bought this tummy rub stretch oil for my wife. She used the oil pretty regularly, but I think she was pretty conservative with it which ultimately resulted in a few stretch marks. I think if this is used more liberally (which is probably how it&#x27;s meant to be used) we would have run out much more often than we did. Seems to be a great product though.</li>
            <li> I used this oil my first pregnancy all over from my buttocks, stomach and breasts and I did not get 1 stretch mark. I am now using it during my second pregnancy and it seems to keep my skin moisturized and smooth. It has a great relaxing scent that is not overpowering at all. As soon as you rub it in it seams to absorb quickly and does not make your skin oily or sticky. I have recommended this to all of my pregnant friends and family. It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure if this stuff prevented stretch marks during my pregnancy. All I know is that my mother had HUGE stretch marks and I still have some from puberty so I thought I was doomed. I used this stuff twice a day as soon as I found out I was pregnant and I didn&#x27;t get one single mark on my belly or boobs. Was it the oil or a craps shoot? I have no idea. But I would use this stuff again just in case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since around the beginning of my second trimester and it really helps with my itchy belly. Many of the other creams I&#x27;ve tried (including cocoa butter) actually make the itchiness worse so I now use this twice a day. Another cream I&#x27;ve used is plain Vitamin E cream, which also seemed to help, but I&#x27;ve been only using the Mama Mio oil since I was around 7 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 36 weeks now and haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks so far - I doubt I can attribute that completely to the oil but it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt!  My husband also says he likes the smell and he usually complains about the smells of the various products I use.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes with this product. I used this oil and the tummy butter twice a day. Unfortunately at 33 weeks the stretch marks started to appear :( Once I noticed the first, I started to apply the oil more frequently and now at 36 weeks, I have a bunch more. I know that stretch marks are genetic, so theres nothing I could do. But I was hoping the oil would help some!</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way. I have had this for a while now still half bottle! its very good for my belly i&#x27;m on my 3 try and no stretch marks. I&#x27;m still on a look out</li>
            <li> As a physician, I realize that stretch marks are predominately related to genetics...  but that doesn&#x27;t mean I was going to roll over and let whatever stretch marks occur!  My mother has some of the worst stretch marks I have ever seen on a person.... But at 38 weeks currently (and VERY big... I have been asked if I was having twins several times by different people), I will have to say, I think this product has delivered as much as it is capable!  I have yet to have a stretch mark crop up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using mama mio oil at about 12 weeks, twice a day (morning and night).. and also after showers.  It is oily going on, but soaks in very quickly.  One of the greatest benefits, is that it greatly reduced itchy skin!!!  Well worth it for that alone.  I also had been given some Palmer&#x27;s Coco Butter and had bought Bella B Tummy Honey Butter...  I found the Mama Mio superior to each of them.  The Palmer&#x27;s seemed to clump up and get stuck onto my clothes when I put it on my very taught tummy (great for elbows and hands though).  I found the texture of the Bella B Tummy Honey Butter to be slightly gross.  It had a gritty consistency and did not absorb well into the skin.  The Mama mio tummy oil definitely has a greasy feel at first, but I felt absorbed in quickly.  Of the three, I preferred the ease of application, the light scent, and the long term feel of my tummy.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful. I use it almost every night and it feels great. It makes my skin for wonderful, hoping that it is actually helping with my growth through my pregnancy. Will need to update after giving birth and losing some of this weight to tell if it&#x27;s actually getting the job done, but so far loving it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I know genes play a role in stretch marks, but I&#x27;ve been using this from 7 weeks through now (33 weeks) and don&#x27;t have a single new mark on my belly, thighs or chest.  I use it on all three places once a day after my shower.  It smells great - very subtle - and the texture is velvety soft.  I strongly recommend this to anyone who is pregnant, even if the cost is a bit high.  I&#x27;ve gone through 1.5 bottles between 7 - 33 weeks through daily use, and I could not believe how itchy my skin was for the week that I ran out between bottles (I used another stretch cream as a substitute thinking I could cut costs).  Once I got the new bottle, the itchiness immediately went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from being a bit pricey, there&#x27;s only one con - it can rub off on clothing that is a delicate fabric if you get dressed right away.  The oily stain comes out in the wash, but remember to wear either a cotton cami or wipe off excess/wait a few minutes for absorption before putting on that nice lightweight shirt you don&#x27;t want to mark up.  The results of the product are so great for me, though, that this con is just a heads-up more than anything else.</li>
            <li> Been using this after my shower and so far, no stretch marks. I wish I could say that is a testament to the product, but being that I&#x27;m only 32 weeks along I can&#x27;t really guarantee it. I also use the belly butter periodically. I like them both for how well they moisturize and absorb into the skin without a greasy residue.  I really don&#x27;t like the scent though. Being pregnant and sensitive to smells anyway, I don&#x27;t care much for the overpowering floral aroma. It smells kind of like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s on her 23rd week and still no stretch marks.  What she likes most about it is the anti-itch capabilities.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t prevent every single stretch mark at least it helps to sooth the inevitable itch of a growing belly.  We ended up buying a 2nd bottle from a different retailer.  Here on Amazon they have the new packaging, which looks nicer since it has a pump instead, but it was no worth the extra $8-10 we would end up spending.  The ounces and item are the same so we figured why not just find it at it&#x27;s cheapest?</li>
            <li> Be diligent about this cream and it will work.  I bought it because the smell of cocoa butter made me nauseated and this smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to use during the pregnancy to help with stretch marks, etc.  This product seemed to do the trick and my wife really liked it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since my first trimester and so far so good...no stretch marks.  I&#x27;ll update my post after the baby is born.  The smell is good, not too strong so it won&#x27;t make you sick.  Some of the other butter like products have a very strong smell that I couldn&#x27;t handle in the first trimester.  I wish the bottle was a littel bigger, but that was my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I started using this oil when I found out I was pregnant with my first child. I ordered the oil because of all the wonderfull reviews that it got. I used it for about 3 to 4 months and in those months I ran into a lot of problems. This oil does not allow your skin to breathe which caused me to break out significantly. I was embarrassed to show anyone my belly. I put up with it for so long because so many women swore by it. I also did not like the continuously oily feeling when wearing clothes or trying to go to sleep. I found it very hard to be comfortable. The oil also stained some of my clothes while wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the oil for so long I finally had to stop using it. I&#x27;m now just using Johnsons Baby Lotion to help with the itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is, it&#x27;s not going to matter what you use on your skin. NOTHING you put on your skin will prevent stretch marks. Eating right and gaining weight slowly in my opinion is the only way to prevent stretch marks. Don&#x27;t waste $30 plus dollars on fancy oils like this.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product, everything seemed great: the smell is good and my tummy felt hydrated. However, starting from the second use, I gradually developed an itch on my tummy. I don&#x27;t have a history of allergy to anything, but this oil gave me such an unbearable itching sensation that after two weeks of use I had to stop.  I then switched to another product and the itch stopped. The time I used this oil was too short to tell whether it is effective in stretchmark prevention, but I can tell you it is not for everybody. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mama Mio oil for about a month now. I love the smell and the fact that is not super oily like other brands. So far, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! My mother had horrible stretch marks from her pregnancy with me and I have decided to fight the good fight with my first pregnancy. I started using this oil in my first trimester as a moisturizer because it feels and smells wonderful. Now that I&#x27;m in my second trimester and growing, I get much needed relief from the dryness and itchiness that my skin is going through, AND no stretch marks so far :-) I am actually getting ready to order a couple more bottles!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 17 weeks pregnant so far, so I am not very big and have no stretch marks so far but have had severe itching from having an appendicitis and hernia when I was younger... this oil helps relieve any itching or discomfort I have and really soothes my skin. I love it. So even if it doesn&#x27;t keep stretch marks from coming, I am really happy with the non-itching effects and soothing.</li>
            <li> Starting at 4 months pregnant I religiously used the Mama Mio stretch mark oil and the Mama Mio stretch mark butter twice a day (first I applied the oil, then the butter over it).  I did not develop one single stretch mark during my pregnancy or after.  I love the scent, love the feel, and love the results.  Great product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Would highly recommend it! I used it throughout my pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks on my belly. It also really helped with the itching from stretching skin. :-) Love this stuff!! I think I purchased it about 5 times throughout my pregnancy as I applied it 2-3 times per day starting around month 4 or 5 when my belly started to grow.</li>
            <li> Well I have been using this product for the past 14 weeks and so far so good.  I am still in my early stages of pregnacy so in the long run we shall see if this works or not.  I wish that this oil will help with the constant itching.</li>
            <li> I am 5 months along and love this oil. It is not greasy all day and it absorbs nicely. This is my 2nd pregnancy and I used Palmer&#x27;s Tummy butter the first pregnancy and I still had stretch marks through out the pregnancy. This time I am trying Mama Mio, and so far no stretch marks yet.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and doesn&#x27;t make me nauseous due to my sensitivity to smells.&lt;br /&gt;It is pricy, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice or three times a day since I was 12 weeks pregnant -- I am now on my 28th week with my first baby. As the tummy stretches to give room for the baby, the tummy rub helps keep the itching under control so you can avoid unconsciously scratching when you&#x27;re sleeping. It is a bit pricey but I am hoping I can avoid or lessen my stretch marks when I finally give birth. Even my doctor commented about my tummy skin being &amp;#34;nicer than everybody else&#x27;s&amp;#34; and that I &amp;#34;must be using an expensive oil&amp;#34; Haha</li>
            <li> Love! Non greasy oil absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave a gross residue. I use this as a base most days as soon as I get out of the shower. Then once twit soaks in, I go on top with a cocoa butter (bc I am extremely itchy). But on days where t doesn&#x27;t bother me much, just the oil is fine.</li>
            <li> Like the smell.. Very early to say about the result. But very satisfied with this oil. Each time only small amount is enough</li>
            <li> Best oil out there. This is my 2nd pregnancy and my babies will be 19mos apart, that&#x27;s a lot of stretching in a short span of time. I love this oil, it&#x27;s thick, no heavy smell, it absorbs yet I still feel the softness and protection the next morning. I wished I had used this during puberty and my teenage growth spurts! My belly at almost 33 weeks is still free from stretch marks. It really makes my skin so soft...might continue to use during Winter as I always get dry skin. It is so much better and thicker than Bio Oil. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on anything else. The bottle lasts a long time too since the oil is very thick, a little goes a long way and soaks into the skin gradually, no greasy after feel.</li>
            <li> I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS PRODUCT IS NOW $300 !!! i bought this oil march 24, 2014 for $45.00 !!!!! THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL I WILL PAY 300 bucks for an oil</li>
            <li> Not super impressed with it but I do think it helped a very little bit. I was not very found of the smell and it was very oily.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product the moment I found out I was pregnant, which was around 8 weeks, because of the high recommendations made by other users. I had read magnificent reviews and needless to say I had high hopes for this product to work for me. I used this product as instructed and found myself with stretch marks in the middle of my stomach and on my sides by 14 weeks. I was saddened but still had hope that if I continued to use the rest of the bottle that they might go away, but that was not the case. I am now 31 weeks and 2 days and I am still batteling the stretch marks that I got when I was in my first-second trimester. I know that the results may vary so it might work for other women so I would say that it is a risk that many of us take. I wish you guys the best of luck and hope it works better for you than it did me :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the second trimester.  I use it in combination with the stretch mark butter after showering.  My skin is very soft and not itchy.  The scent is not offensive either.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I didn&#x27;t start this oil rub from the beginning of pregnancy, it was more around 5 months pregnant once I started. I noticed no results other than oily sheets after I put it on before bed. Smells good, though, which is why I rated it a second star.</li>
            <li> Amazing results!!! I was skeptical but after less than a week of using this oil my stretch marks were remarkably less noticeable!</li>
            <li> For me this worked fabulously! I have used the butter every night before bed together with the oil every morning after shower since about 4-5 months of pregnancy. I did not get a single stretch-mark. Of course we will never know how much this products really contributed... but it is of great quality and also helped with itching a lot. I feel like it definitely did great things for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I know that they say that it&#x27;s all genetics but I am not so sure. I have been somewhat prone to stretch marks in the past and my mom definitely has them. In spite being a healthy weight I have had some on my thighs and low hip area since I was a teen. When I found out I was pregnant I did my research and found this product. I was a little apprehensive to purchase an oil just because I don&#x27;t really care to use oils and really don&#x27;t like to feel oily all the time...but based on the reviews I decided to give it a try. The oil soaks into the skin very quickly and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It also doesn&#x27;t have too much of a smell, which is nice. I didn&#x27;t want anything perfumey. It has a nice light fragrance, but nothing too noticeable. I began using it on my stomach and sides when I was about 12 weeks or so and have continued to use it faithfully each night. I am now 37 1/2 weeks and every time I go to the Dr. he is amazed and comments on my lack of stretch marks. I am on my 3rd bottle. I feel that it is well worth the investment! My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t use it on my chest as well. My boobs grew so fast and now I do have some stretch marks there as a result. Lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a great product! I highly recommend it. (Note: this was written on my husbands account as I don&#x27;t have one and just use his :)</li>
            <li> This product is very gentle and I think it works since I didnt get any stretch marks, nice, non-invasive smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of different products and this is by far is the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I used this product religiously. I had my baby in early May and I have stretch marks on my waist and my belly. I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure that if I would&#x27;ve not use this product I might&#x27;ve had more stretch marks. However, I&#x27;m starting to think that the cheaper and older alternative would&#x27;ve probably worked as well. Good old fashion generic cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Currently I am 19 weeks pregnant.  I used this product for about 4 weeks and then I ran out.  I gave the product 4 stars because simply put there is not enough oil in the bottle and I don&#x27;t believe they make a bigger size.  The smell is okay at best..it smells kinda lemony....it does feel good on your skin...has it helped to prevent stretch marks I am not sure....at the time of use i didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks...since running out of the product I have found that my skin is a bit more itchy...i do believe the price is a bit much for only 4.1 fl oz...</li>
            <li> I was pregnant with twins and my belly was stretched to the max and the skin hurt so much.  I was about to give in and get a prescription cream from my doctor when I tried this as a last resort.  In a day and a half the pain had gone.  It has a great smell (i.e. didn&#x27;t make me queasy) and I will swear by this product to anyone who needs some relief!  Can&#x27;t speak to reduced stretch lines but it definitely helped me feel soooo much better.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is buy this now, buy 2 at a time! I used this twice a day during my entire pregnancy and did not get 1 stretch mark! I know some of that is genetic, but I am a big beliver! Worth the money and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I will be ordering more through postpartum. I really don&#x27;t like lotion or oils on my hands, but this is not greasy it is silky and works great! I&#x27;m 24 weeks with my second child and no signs of stretch marks yet!</li>
            <li> I am currently 31 weeks, and have been using this product since I was about 12 weeks.  This is my first pregnancy, and the women in my family are prone to stretch marks during pregnancy.  No way was I about to let that happen with me!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product - granted, I still have a few weeks to go but I haven&#x27;t gotten one stretch mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought my second bottle as I&#x27;m finishing up the first.  I have been applying very liberally once a day.  The oil feels great on my skin and it doesn&#x27;t get onto my clothes, and it has a really nice smell.  I plan to use this past my delivery date by a few weeks just in case. I will update my review once I&#x27;ve delivered, but I don&#x27;t expect to get any stretch marks.  Really, buying this oil is worth every penny, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into your skin really nicely, and smells great. Wish it was a bigger bottle, I&#x27;m already thru half the bottle in about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Used this from the beginning of my pregnancy and throughout and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. It is fantastic and smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> Yes, this stuff moisturizes like no other. It leaves my belly feeling oily all day. I started using it in my first trimester and the bottle lasted me to 34 weeks, using it once daily. I write this having just run out, and I still don&#x27;t have any stretch marks. This could be because of Mama Mio or because of my genetics/diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell is just awful. I didn&#x27;t buy a ton of maternity clothes - just one pair of maternity jeans with a full panel. This means I wore them more than once between washings. The smell of Mama Mio would soak into my clothes and it&#x27;s not something I wanted to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked with kids, who are tummy-height and brutally honest. I already knew I smelled like old-lady from the Mama Mio oil. One girl commented that I smelled like dust. Yep, you&#x27;ll smell like dusty old-lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they&#x27;d make the scent more neutral or vibrant, rather than floral.</li>
            <li> very oily and honestly i don&#x27;t think it really helped so anything. raw shea butter and calendula or tamaran did way better</li>
            <li> so far seems to be working well. I am 4 months pregnant and my skin has stayed soft and supple. No marks yet (crosses fingers) Nice smell and luxurious feel to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews but have only used it a few times. I don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling and how long it takes to dry. it smells good and it does make skin soft but i ended up using Vaseline coco butter, burts bees mama belly butter and palmers and seem to be working great for me and is half the price. i would say this is overpriced product for the size.</li>
            <li> this didn&#x27;t do it for me . I bought it after seeing good reviews. Its just too oily and it makes me sweat and after one bottle I didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 weeks pregnant, with red/purple-ish stretch marks starting about 2-3 weeks ago. I was concerned about stretch marks earlier on, and so I started using Bio-oil, Clarins, Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s and MamaMio by the end of the first trimester. I didn&#x27;t like Burt&#x27;s Bees at all. It gave me minor bumps and did not absorb. I like the Clarins&#x27; smell the best. But MamaMio is my favorite of the above because (1) texture - not too oily and appears to absorb easily and last throughout the day, (2) smell is faint and pleasant, and (3) helped even out my overall skin tone. Despite my due diligence, I still developed stretch marks at 23 weeks. Since then, I&#x27;ve been trying other things - MamaMio cream, Coccare 100% Vitamin E oil, Earth Mama healing salve... I ordered Mederma Stretch Mark Therapy and will try that next. My current routine is Cococare Vitamin E oil plus MamaMio Oil plus Earth Mama healing salve. My stretch marks have not been getting worse and the color is not as red. I think it is fainting ...maybe. I&#x27;ve also been wearing a support belt for back pain and hoping that it will also help with stretch marks. Good luck to all the mommies going though similar experiences.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product for long enough to be able to offer a review of whether this \\&quot;prevented\\&quot; stretchmarks (I&#x27;m currently 20 weeks). The consistency seems OK and it does leave my belly moisturized and not greasy. However, the scent of this product alone is enough for me not to want to continue using it. Sense of smell is especially sensitive during pregnancy and I wish the manufacturers took that into consideration. I&#x27;ll definitely be switching to something a little less pungent.</li>
            <li> This is the first stretch mark oil I have tried and absolutely love it.  It goes on really light, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes.  I can actually put my clothes on right after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives are that it is very pricey and doesn&#x27;t last long.  If I were to put this on twice a day and apply &amp;#34;liberally&amp;#34; as directions state..this bottle would only last me 2-3 weeks at the very most.  Unfortunatley, I will be switching to another product because I don&#x27;t want to pay $35 per month for something that isn&#x27;t a sure thing.</li>
            <li> I used this for my first pregnancy and I didn&#x27;t get 1 stretch mark!!  I was so nervous because my mom had so many when pregnant with me.  I&#x27;m pregnant again this time and so far nothing.  This really is an awesome product!!</li>
            <li> Liked the oil&#x27;s scent. It didn&#x27;t stop all stretch marks for me, but kept my skin well hydrated so my tummy wasn&#x27;t itchy. The bottle top starts to slowly weep some of the oil and kept getting an oil ring on my cabinet shelf, so I has to store it in a dish.</li>
            <li> Smells better than bio oil for sure.  Soaks into the skin quickly, leaves it moisturized, and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been told that stretch marks are genetic, and that they strike older moms the hardest.  My mom and my sister both have pretty severe stretch marks, I&#x27;m 36, and I have very fair skin.  Recipe for a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting at about week ten, I combined this stuff with Mama Mio&#x27;s butter and used a lot of it.  I think I went through two containers of each per month.  Yeah, it was expensive...but I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks.  I am so unbelievably grateful.</li>
            <li> I had a big bellly and i used this oil coupled with the mama mio tummy butter. It worked wonders! I got 3 tiny stretch marks that can barely be seen right above my belly button. Rest of my abdomen, butt, hips remains stretch mark free. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I found this product on Pinterest and did some research on it. I wasn&#x27;t sure what product to use to prevent stretch marks but knew for sure I had to get something!! This product came with great reviews but was a tad expensive for my liking. I debated back and forth about the price and decided to go for it. I&#x27;m very glad I did because I walked away from my pregnancy with no tummy stretch marks. I did not use the product on my breasts thinking Ahhh.... I won&#x27;t get stretch marks there and boy was I wrong. People said that it is fast absorbing but I didn&#x27;t see that. They also said that if you wear white it kind of stains it and I didn&#x27;t have that problem. I did use this twice a day, morning and night, and I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t got any stretch marks yet and I am on my 32nd week. But you never know what will happen until after the delivery though. Cross fingers. I use this product every night and morning. However, I have to combine this product with cream at night since it still leave my skin itchy.</li>
            <li> Absolutly loved this during my pregnancy! I still got stretch marks but I know it was inevitable, but it feels so good on and smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> Mama Mio Tummy rub oil works well. Swore by it during my first pregnancy. I Purchased another bottle my second pregnancy and because of 40 week morning sickness and a sensitivity to smell, I wasn&#x27;t able to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is getting plenty of use now as a moisturizer and I love the smell. I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone (partners included) who might be bothered by strong or distinctive smells.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating. Started using this product when I was 14 weeks pregnant. Now I am at 30 weeks, and so far crossing fingers.. no stretch marks. Most of all, great to keep belly itch under control/prevent it. It is an oil so you have to expect feeling oily when fist applied, but it gets absorbed.</li>
            <li> I used this product every day beginning in the first trimester.  I had read that stretch marks were basically hereditary, and I thought I would surely get them.  However, I managed to escape pregnancy with only one tiny stretch mark!  It smells great and once it dries, your skin feels moisturized but not greasy.  I do recommend waiting a few minutes to put clothing on though, as it takes a bit for your skin to absorb it.</li>
            <li> I used this product along with the tummy rub; however, I still got stretch marks all over my body. I used it starting the 3rd trimester until delivery. I even applied it morning and night everyday.  Save your money for something else!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get lots of weight,  so maybe that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t have stretch mark yet. I&#x27;m 34 was now. Many ppl say you will gain a lot of weight in last month, but I will keep using this and see what happen.</li>
            <li> If money is not an object to you, this would be your product. I do have to admit, this oil does last long. What I ended up doing was using this with another product for (a stretch mark prevention cream) to make it last even longer. Both my mom and my sis had stretch marks so I thought I was doomed to have them. Thank God, I didn&#x27;t. I think it was the combination of using 3 or 4 different creams/oil and the fact that I only gained 25 lbs total. I also delivered at 37 weeks! Who knows!</li>
            <li> Smell is terrible! I am still using product but I have to not breathe from my nose while doing so and immediately put a shirt on and just try not to breathe from my nose until it is absorbed otherwise I get terribly naseuous. I am only 8 weeks so I am hoping once I get in my second trimester I will be able to tolerate the smell more. It is really oily so I am not sure if it will be effective in preventing stretch marks. I will update more later on.</li>
            <li> I got this product at week 10 of my pregnancy. I am now week 14, so it&#x27;s still early. I love that it absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy. It makes my skin feel wonderful! Oh, and the smell is lovely as well!!</li>
            <li> This product was too thin for me. It smells nice, and feels great as a simple oil, but this oil quickly rubbed off not long after applying and putting on my shirt for the day.</li>
            <li> I used this oil when pregnant with my first son. I loved the oil.  With my second son our finances were low and didn&#x27;t want to be out the $35, for rather small bottle. Once the belly is big it tends to go fast...and I liked to use it all around hip area as well. I used olive oil mostly, and coconut oil...I was happy with results but still missed the Mama Mio at times</li>
            <li> I bought this oil when I was 2 months pregnant. Worrying that I may develop stretch mark, I used it regularly. I like that it smells good and very light weight. It absorb to your skin fast. I stopped using on my 4 months because I went overseas and it was thrown in the airport. I didn&#x27;t have any stretch mark at all after birth. I think it&#x27;s genetic. My mom had 4 kids but no stretch mark, my sister had 1 child and no stretch mark. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer to your skin but if stretch mark run in family, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s something that you can use to prevent it.</li>
            <li> Spent a lot of money on this product throughout my pregnancy (and after) and still got stretch marks. I applied at a minimum twice a day everyday from 8weeks on and still got stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Loved it!! I&#x27;ve read that stretch marks are possibly genetic, but I did not want to take the chance.  I used this all during my pregnancy and loved it.  Our son is now 5 months old, and I did not get stretch marks from the pregnancy. Directions said to apply twice per day, but most days I only remembered to use once.</li>
            <li> I works great and it smell amazing. I was very relaxing to put on. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister in law who is expecting her 2nd child.  When she was pregnant with her first child, she tried everything there was to avoid stretchmarks and none of the products she tried prevented her from getting those dreaded stretchmarks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I became pregnant with my first one, I was really scared that nothing would work.  I did some research and came across Mama Mio Tummy Rub and decided to give it a try since it wasn&#x27;t one of the products my sister-in-law tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True enough, I never had stretchmarks (except for a small part on my hip that I don&#x27;t usually apply the oil on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom went from skeptic to believer because at first she was telling me that stretchmarks were genetic and that since she had it I might as well accept the inevitable.</li>
            <li> I could bathe in this stuff multiple times daily.</li>
            <li> I love mama mio oil. my baby is 2weeks old now im almost back to my pregnancy weight and have not even 1streatchmark. i was using mama mio from 4th months of pregnancy and loved it</li>
            <li> I used the Tummy Rub twice day from my 2nd Trimester on.  Smells great but is a little oily!&lt;br /&gt;in my LATE 3rd trimester, I received two stretch marks.  Whether or not you get stretch marks during pregnancy is up to genetics, not a $30 bottle of oil.</li>
            <li> I used this oil throughout my first pregnancy, and being size 4 I worried I would lose my skin due to the stretching. I used this oil nightly, and not only did it feel good, it had a great scent, it made me relax, made my skin feel moisturized, but I have 0 stretch marks after my baby was born. Even the Dr. in the operating room before doing the C section commented on the fact that I had no stretch marks whatsoever. I have even bought another bottle just for regular moisturizing now a year after my baby&#x27;s birth. Fantastic, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It worked wonders for my first pregnancy. No stretch marks, my tummy snapped back into place and my skin looks wonderful.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy it for the second!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff until one exception happened to me.......I used this religiously every day when I woke up and fell asleep for 9 months I had very minimal stretch marks for carrying a 9 lb 3 oz baby at 37 weeks.....then I had a c section and my baby had his cord tight wrapped twice around his neck and was buried very deep in my pelvis they really had to tug and tug....this stuff was no match for that and I had more stretch marks after birth than before. I would still stand by it and will continue to use it to fade the marks as soon as my scar is COMPLETELY healed!</li>
            <li> I am expecting my first child, and at the beginning of this pregnancy used a lotion specifically for stretch marks.  I decided to look for something new, specifically something with less chemicals and more natural moisturizers.  I came across the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Oil and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seemed to avoid stretch marks for most of this pregnancy until around the start of the third trimester.  My belly seems bigger than a lot of other pregnant women&#x27;s bellies at this stage, so the tummy rub oil had a *big* task ahead of it!  While it hasn&#x27;t prevented any marks, I would definitely agree that it has made them less severe than they would have otherwise been.  The oil hydrates my skin so well, is not overly greasy, and rarely does the belly get so dry that it itches.  It doesn&#x27;t have what I would call a fantastic scent, but it&#x27;s not offensive, either.  I use it only on my belly and hips, but for some reason (maybe or maybe not related to the product) I seem to break out when I use it on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed this product so much that I bought a new one when my first ran out, and I included one in my friend&#x27;s goody box who is expecting her first child in January.  I will continue to use this after I deliver.  They say that genetics, not the use of special lotions/oils, determines how many stretch marks you get.  However, I am willing to put my odds on the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Oil to keep my skin looking healthy after pregnancy  :o)</li>
            <li> Like most expecting moms, I was paranoid about stretch marks.  I purchased this hoping it would help keep those pesky marks at bay.  I&#x27;m not sure if it helped or didn&#x27;t.  I did moisturize but I felt more greasy than anything else.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad, it can be strong, but it&#x27;s a natural scent. Not as overbearing as some other oils I tried. And it seems to be working for me. Definitely keeps me moisturized and my skin is looking good so far, and I am in my 8th month of pregnancy!</li>
            <li> Every woman in my family has stretch marks from pregnancy.  I was determined to fight them even though I&#x27;ve been told it is not possible.  I used this throughout my first pregnancy religously - 3 X per day.  I went 41 weeks and never got 1 stretch mark!!!!  I am now 14 weeks pregnant with my second and have stocked up.  It also smells good and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works on stretch marks yet but it sure does smell great. It leaves my skin perfect and not oily at all. My whole body is super dry from this winter and I apply this all over. I am no longer have dry skin &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;I will update after i give birth.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.  I am currently 6 months pregnant and no stretch marks.  I guess we will have to wait and see how it works through the whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I have read in many places that if your mother got stretch marks during her pregnancy, then your destiny was pretty much set. I also have growth stretch marks in other areas of my body, so when I found out I was pregnant I resigned myself to the fact I would have stretch marks on my belly as well - however, I was not going down without a fight.&lt;br /&gt;It could have been the oil I used every night after shower. It could have been the Aveeno I used every morning before work - It could have been the combo; fact is it did not have one, not even a tiny, stretch mark on my belly.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my sister. Love the product, smells amazing, I plan on buying more of this product, and will recommend to all my pregnant friends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33w2d pregnant with twins. I started using this when I found out I was pregnant, before I even knew I was having twins. I&#x27;m glad I did! I use this after I shower since my skin gets dry, and before going to bed. I&#x27;m about the size of a full term singleton pregnancy right now, since I have over 7.5lbs of babies in my belly (plus 2 amniotic sacs). I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark! I still have 4 weeks to go, so I hope I don&#x27;t get any in the end, but I truly believe if I was pregnant with 1 baby instead of 2 I would definitely not have gotten any stretch marks. And I&#x27;m very optimistic about not getting any in these last weeks with my twins:)</li>
            <li> I apply this tummy rub oil everyday. It smells great, feels amazing and softens the skin without making it oily at all. It also helps relax the tummy skin and relieves the stretchy feeling in the abdomen area.</li>
            <li> This oil smells delicious and rubs into the skin very nicely without feeling oily. My only complaint is that I still got stretch marks-it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> Until my pregnancy is over I guess I won&#x27;t know for sure how well this works. But remember that no cream, lotion, or oil will completely prevent stretch marks. The skin can only stretch so much, and genetics also plays a role. What I love though is unlike cocoa butter and other creams, it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of your skin. It&#x27;s absorbed immediately. It smells good and has lots of natural essential oils in it which are better than lotions and creams which have many unnecessary additives</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.  I started using Bio Oil and was still feeling itchy.  Once I switched to Mama Mio Oil, I felt an immediate difference.  Plus Mama Mio Oil smells amazing and relaxes your senses.  I look forward to my husband rubbing it on my belly every night.  I&#x27;m 38 weeks and getting huge but thanks to this oil, no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I wish this bottle was bigger than 4.1 fl oz. I use this everyday and so far, it has been great. It&#x27;s hard to say that it prevents or gets rid of stretch marks since I&#x27;m still pregnant. However, it definitely lightened my existing stretch marks that were on my thighs. I will definitely buy this product over and over again.</li>
            <li> I love Mam Mio Tummy Rub!! I&#x27;m seven months pregnant and use this product every day when I get out of the shower and I have not had one stretch mark yet!! It smells so good and makes my stomach so soft! I highly recommend this product!! I also got the Mama Mio Tummy Butter which is also a great product!</li>
            <li> It works ok but I still did get stretch marks. I think there is really no way to avoid it but if you want to spend money to try (like me) . Why not ?!</li>
            <li> This one is really good so that we appreciating and rated as top class. Every one who is looking for this product need to buy this brand only. Thankful for the most.</li>
            <li> Loved this product! Went through about 1.5 bottles during my pregnancy and got through it without a stretch mark. Might or might not be due to this product, but regardless enjoyed the oil and the twice daily ritual.</li>
            <li> I love this!! I&#x27;ve been using it my entire pregnancy and I am currently 9 months pregnant so far no stretch marks... Fingers crossed!! I bought another bottle for my postpartum period because I read that you should use it afterward as well because it help prevent stretch marks that can happen when your skin is shrinking back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am 1 day overdue and I gained about 50 lbs. before pregnancy I always had a flat stomach so it&#x27;s the first time it&#x27;s stretching. :( I just got a few stretch marks this week around my belly button. I am still using this oil and I love the smell. I will continue to use it after the baby is born as is recommended. I will update later to see how noticeable the stretch marks end up being after the baby is born.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Feels great. I&#x27;ve been using it since my first trimester and at 8 months, I don&#x27;t have a stretch mark in sight!</li>
            <li> I love my new tummy rub. It absorbs fast and the smell is nice and light. As much as I do love the product I probably wont be purchasing again because the amount you get for the spendy price would burn through my wallet fast.</li>
            <li> Currently pregnant with tripplets and as of week 27... no stretch marks for me.  It may be the oil, or maybe I am just blessed with good jeans.  There may not be any way to tell, but I am happy with how things are going and would buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real negative feedback at this point is that the product doesn&#x27;t dispense well and leaves the bottle all oily.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. I started using it a month ago and my tummy still looks good! I am now 6 months pregnant, and no signs of stretch marks. I will keep you updated in the next few months.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I have never written an Amazon review but for this amazing product I HAD TOO!!!! I have used the Tummy oil since the 4th month, I already have stretch marks on my hips and thighs from puberty so I know I&#x27;m prone to them. My sister and Mom have them everywhere from pregnancy so I swore I would try everything I could not to get them. I&#x27;ve used it at least once a day, like others have said it is oily, so I put it on and do my hair and makeup while it dries before I get dressed. I have gained 35 lbs and my belly is very large, 2 people have asked if I&#x27;m having twins, but this is my first pregnancy- just one big boy. My sister cannot believe I haven&#x27;t gotten a single stretch mark, she makes me show her my belly every time she comes over. I am on my 3rd bottle but I use it very liberally - even on my back and thighs where I had previous stretch marks so they don&#x27;t get any worse, the cost is WELL worth it to me to have this nice smooth belly at 38 weeks preggo! Best Pregnancy Product EVER!!! :) I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to people who said you&#x27;ll get them no matter what since your Mom and sister had them!</li>
            <li> I have been using the oil for about a month now, I am 17wks. pregnant, and I like the way it smells and feels. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve seen any type of results yet, I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks, but I&#x27;m not showing yet either. I only gave it 4 stars b/c I havent been using it long enough to really know for sure, if it will work. But it does smell way better than coco butter. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and hopefully the end results will be no stretch marks :)</li>
            <li> I only used half of this bottle. It did not moisturize the way I thought it would. This was my 2nd child. I gained 41lbs and did not get any stretch marks. Then again, maybe it was because the elasticity of my skin had already been stretched out the first time around. I purchased this along with the butter and liked the butter much better.</li>
            <li> Am 17 weeks pregnant and barely showing.  I&#x27;m using this twice a day in addition to the butter (same brand).  So far no stretch marks.  The real test will come at week 40!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several bottles of this stuff with my first baby and bought again 3 yrs later now that I&#x27;m expecting baby #2.  The packaging has changed from a drip bottle to a pump bottle (good change: less spillage).  I noticed the ingredients changed a bit over the past 3 years but the most important ingredients (almond oil, wheatgerm oil) are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep coming back to it because:&lt;br /&gt;- It seems to work (no stretch marks!)&lt;br /&gt;- It has the key known ingredients that do the job (saturated fats, fine oils)&lt;br /&gt;- The smell does not nauseate me when everything else does (it&#x27;s citrus-y)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching the contributory factors of stretch marks, I found the primary things have the biggest effect on whether you get stretch marks - diet, water intake, genetics, and exercise (not necessarily in this order).  But that didn&#x27;t stop me from also researching the best ointments to use as well.  I purchased this oil based on the known effectiveness of its ingredients on skin (almond oil, for example) and paired it with cocoa butter, applied 2-4 times daily.  I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks, but do see slackened skin after 6 months post-partum.  I think the oil was helpful as part of my routine (regular exercise, lots of water, dr. guidelines on pregnancy weight gain).</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I love this stuff! Smells great, soaks in the skin fast and I put it on at least 2 times a day! Definitely recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 weeks pregnant, have been using this product for about six weeks, and so far, I really like it. It smells nice, isn&#x27;t too heavy, is easy to apply, and has worked thus far. I also like the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> The idea behind this stuff is awesome but it&#x27;s all in genetics for stretch marks. My mom and sister never got them but somewhere down the line someone had them. I got them while I was pregnant and I definitely wasn&#x27;t huge...oh well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 7 1/2 months and have yet to see a new stretch mark.  Old stretch marks have faded.  I began using the Tummy Rub butter at about 4 months, and for the last month or so I use both the Oil and the Butter in sequence.  I use them right after showering. Baby seems to like the massage, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil can get messy at times, so be careful.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with stained sheets, but I do sit on a towel when I&#x27;m applying it and I&#x27;m careful about where I place the bottle.  Ever since buying both of them, I need less of each to get nice, glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it hard (although not impossible) to apply the oil and butter when I&#x27;m not freshly showered.  Thus, in the evenings, I use Mederma for stretch marks instead.  Will buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it will stop stretch marks but I was incredibly itchy around the belly and breasts. This oil really helped soothe that so I&#x27;d recommend it for that reason.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Used through my second pregnancy and still no stretch marks despite gaining nearly 50lbs!</li>
            <li> I used this with my first pregnancy, and although it&#x27;s pricey I loved how soft it made my belly feel. I did not have a single stretch mark in that pregnancy. I bought another bottle to use with my 2nd pregnancy and so far, no stretch marks. While I can&#x27;t qualify this as the product to use so you don&#x27;t get stretch marks, I really think using anything that&#x27;s a good quality on a DAILY basis is a significant help to reduce stretch marks ;).</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law bought a bottle for me after passing through her first pregnancy without stretch marks. I already knew I was prone to stretch marks since I had some on my thighs from previous weight gain. I started using Mama Mio in month 4, once a day; then from month 7, twice a day. I went through 2.5 bottles total and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark. Yay! So the pro is that it worked for me. The cons are that it is oily. I got used to the feeling and it did seem to soak into the skin fairly quickly. My husband teased me the whole time about my greasy little belly - even when it felt dry to me he assured me it was not. When the weather warmed up I noticed a side effect of sorts from it. The clothes I wore closest to my body, such as tank tops or tight Ts, started to get a light rancid oil smell, even when clean. I normally like to wash in cold, but switched those items to hot to get a really thorough clean out of the oil residue. Anyway, my first-born is here and I didn&#x27;t get the first stretch mark, so overall I&#x27;d wholeheartedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recieved this in a gift basket.  I also received the Mustela Stretch Mark Double Action Cream.  Both smell nice but I love the Mama Mio.  I actually loved the smell so much I bought the mini&#x27;s to take to the hospital with me when I go.  So far no stretch marks...just a pretty soft belly.</li>
            <li> I loved the lightness of the oil and the smell.  However, I did notice that my breasts were still a bit itchy/dry after daily use for 2 weeks.  So I switched back to a heavier (and cheaper) oil that I had been using before. I will point out that I have normally very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used this oil throughout my pregnancy, and added in the lotion the last month.  I am now 2 weeks postpartum and have NO stretch marks!!!  My Mother had terrible stretch marks, so I assumed I was destined for them as well, but I believe this oil saved me.&lt;br /&gt;This oil also has a great smell which makes it enjoyable to use.  It also lasts a while.  I used less than 2 bottles throughout my pregnancy so it&#x27;s really not all that expensive.</li>
            <li> Both my sister and mother have gnarly stretch marks on their entire mid sections so I of course became very paranoid about getting them during pregnancy. I used the oil and the mama Mio butter together 2 times a day, every day. I gained 52 lbs and in the areas I applied I got 3 tiny stretch marks that I have to LOOK for. The downside? Because of the price I was scared to apply everywhere and go through the product faster than I already was and the spots I left out (my hips) got a few huge/deep stretch marks :-( This product definitely worked for me in the areas that I applied it. It&#x27;s worth every single cent!!!!! In my entire pregnancy I used 3 jars of butter and 1 container of oil.</li>
            <li> I tried several different lotions, butters, and oils, but this is the BEST! It smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t ruin clothes, and has prevented stretch marks for me. Love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the oil or genes, but I did not get not one stretch mark! I will use it again for baby #2</li>
            <li> I ordered this product when I was around 14 weeks pregnant, and have used it religiously ever since. I am currently on my third bottle, and have 3 weeks to go until delivery. Within the last three weeks I began to notice stretch marks. They are very small and light in color, and I know they will get probably get worse within the final few weeks, but I believe that had I not used this product they would be MUCH worse by now.</li>
            <li> This is very soothing and essential for a pregnancy of multiples.  Regardless of whether or not you get stretch marks, the fact that it causes your skin to feel so much better is a great comfort.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the positive reviews on Amazon. I started using the oil morning and night around 18 weeks. I loved how moisturized it left my skin. I never had any tightness or itchiness on my belly. The greatest part of all was ZERO stretch marks! I have stretch marks on my hips and buttocks from hitting puberty, so I thought for sure I was doomed to get them with my first pregnancy. I gained about 25 pounds with the pregnancy, so I do believe having a reasonable weight gain along with the use of this product, gave me excellent results. Like some reviewers mentioned it is a bit greasy, so I would apply as soon as I toweled off from the shower and then do hair, apply makeup, etc while allowing oil to sink in. I never had any issue with it staining my clothes.</li>
            <li> I tried so many pregnancy stretch mark oils (palmers, bio oil, etc.) and this is by far the best in terms of absorbancy, smell, did not make me itch, etc.  I loved this oil so much, I actually looked forward to putting it on twice a day, which might be part of the reason why I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks (except a small one around my navel piercing, which was to be expected) -- I was consistent!  I recommend this to all my pregnant friends!  The tummy rub butter is also fantastic, but I felt the oil lasted longer and absorbed better.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but totally worth it since it worked and was such a joy to use.</li>
            <li> im in my second trimester and i have been using this product and my stretch marks are out of whack.  i know that i have to use another product to lighten these stretch marks</li>
            <li> This oil is a pregnancy must have! It works great and smells amazing. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Loved this. I ordered extra direct from Mama Mio since I also wanted to try other items that were overpriced on Amazon. This oil actually helped in minimizing a pervious laparoscopic surgery scar that I had! In addition no stretch marks. I used this product since about 24 weeks until delivery. I also liked the scent and it wasn&#x27;t super greasy.</li>
            <li> I am 8 months pregnant and not 1 stretch mark to be found.  With my prior pregnancy my stomach looked like a road atlas.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product</li>
            <li> Now I had my baby I can testify that it works.  This was my first pregnancy and I was keen on applying the oil daily.  For the first trimester I only applied once a day.  Once my belly started to show I applied twice a day.  I also tried their cream but found this much better.  I have mild eczema prior to pregnancy and during my pregnancy I had dry patches behind my knees, the oil was so soothing.  For my last trimester, I decided to stop using it and just use the vitamin E oil instead ( big mistake) A few weeks later stretch marks started to show.  I immediately re-purchased the oil and no new marks showed.  After birth, a week later the ones that I had during last trimester slowly disappeared.  I will continue using this until my belly is back to the original size.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil after reading all of the great reviews.  I started using it daily after my shower when I was around 12 weeks pregnant.  I just had my baby and I do not have one stretch mark!  Also, I am prone to stretch marks because I have a few from my growth spurt as a teenager.  This product smells great and it just soaks into your skin.  I plan on still using it daily until I get back to my pre-pregnancy weight.  I recommend this to all expecting moms.  It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> Used my whole pregnancy at night before bed (gained almost 40 pounds total) plus used another product I bought on Amazon zero stretch marks!!!</li>
            <li> Great product .. Smells good and my husband loves to rub this on my belly. I had light stretch marks prior to getting pregnant due to weight gain then loss. This oil has lightened those marks as well as keep new ones from coming in. I put this on 2xs a day and I started use at 3months..I am now 8 months and gained a lot. I highly recommend .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is the variation on the pricing.</li>
            <li> I used the Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil on my breasts and belly, waited 15 min. and then put my dress on.  The oil stained my dress, not sure if it will come out since I washed and dried it before noticing the stains.  I have now sprayed a stain remover on my dress and will wash it again.  Also, when you pour the oil out you have to be careful because it drips down the side of the bottle.  I will be trying lotion next, no more oil for me.  I cannot return this product to the individual seller I purchased from because they do not accept returns of an item that has been opened so I have contacted the company to see what they can do for me.</li>
            <li> Ok so this is expensive for 4 ounces of oil, that&#x27;s for sure, but I do really love the stuff.  I might even love it enough to get another bottle of it.  I&#x27;m 33 weeks pregnant and only have about 1/4 left of my current bottle, and would really like to keep using this until the baby is here.  The oil absorbs within maybe 15-20 minutes and leaves my skin so soft.  I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of this -- I use a few other products as well, and my mom didn&#x27;t get many marks during her pregnancies either so I may not be inherently in danger of getting them anyways.  I have heard many pregnant ladies complain about itchy, tight bellies - I&#x27;ve honestly never felt either of those sensations.  Perhaps because I keep it very moisturized? This is the only product I use every single night - the other products (a salve &amp; a lotion) I only use after I take a hot shower. And they leave me feeling greasy and sticky for the majority of the night. If you have the money, this is a great splurge!</li>
            <li> so its been about two weeks and ive been using this mornings and before i go to bed. I have just started to notice that the stretchmarks that i have from my previous baby are getting lighter with this which makes me so happy. I really like the smell of the product and it makes my skin feel silky smooth lol... Im liking it so far and even my husband was saying he could hardly see the stretchmarks on my tummy. So im pretty happy</li>
            <li> I made it to my 37th week without any problems thanks to Mama Mio. I started using it in my fourth month once a day before the real stretching began. After about a month, I applied the oil twice per day, in the morning and again at night. The only time I had problems was when I ran out and used coconut oil until the next bottle arrived in the mail. I got a few slight dark stretch marks on my hips. Using the Mama Mio oil helped to stop that from progressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around my 37th week, I developed a few faint marks around my poor, long-suffering and very taut belly button area. I&#x27;ll take it. A year later, I&#x27;m still bikini-confident and I constantly refer the product to other expecting moms. The smell didn&#x27;t bother me much and while I understand that there&#x27;s a cream, I was pregnant in the winter and wanted that extra coverage from an oil-based product. I highly recommend that you purchase this to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I was really scared of getting stretch marks during pregnancy because I got some when I was growing as an adolescent, so clearly my skin is prone to them. I started using this oil as soon as I learned I was pregnant (first once a day and twice a day after the 5th month) and now, 3 weeks after delivery not once stretch mark. I am still using it because it says it help skin to go back to normal. I also smells great and has a great texture.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> This is my first baby and I decided to try this oil with the cream and I love it! Both absorb into the skin quickly and they are not greasy or leave streaks in your clothes.  I would recommend this product, so far so good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I dislike this item, it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m not in love with it.  I purchased it right after I found out about being pregnant and I was super excited to see the amount of work that was made in this line of skincare by the inventors.  I was also stoked that their driving factor in making this product was born out of previous pregnancies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s oily, but not too greasy.  It&#x27;s never messed up my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;The softness and suppleness of the oil lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Not So Good:&lt;br /&gt;I busted a stretch mark just a few weeks after using this product. (This could be genetics, I know)&lt;br /&gt;The smell started to REALLY bother me a few weeks after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to purchase this item again, but I will opt for a less expensive, better smelling one when it runs out. (probably Burt&#x27;s Bees lemon body oil)  Maybe it works better for different people.</li>
            <li> Best tummy oil I&#x27;ve used.. Really helped my belly become very moisturized. Loved it. I would totally recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am in week 35 and no stretch marks yet</li>
            <li> I am 23 weeks pregnant with my second child. I used Mama Mio for my first pregnancy and it was excellent. I didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks and so far have been doing good..</li>
            <li> This product smells awesome, and feels great on your skin. Make sure you put it on though when you have time to just hang out in loose clothes with no where to go, I bought this and the belly butter, and after they both go on I smell amazing but I feel pretty oily for a while.</li>
            <li> Already used 2 of these and I&#x27;m 30 weeks preggers. Its amazing, makes my skin super soft and smells great. Also, I have not had ANY stretch marks this far :) I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Loved the smell and texture of this oil! Won&#x27;t live without this next time</li>
            <li> I  bought this literally as I got pregnant and was applying it every day like it says on the bottle,  however it didn&#x27;t keep the dreaded stretch marks away and I am now the owner of a stomach full of horrible stretch marks,  personally the only thing going for this product is that it smells nice and makes your skin soft and it was dispatched quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> 2nd pregnancy and it has helped keep me lathered with a mild smell that is not to strong. I mix it with Shea butter from Bath and Body to keep my skin well lathered. No new stretch marks, thats a plus!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to add to my lotion routine to give my skin some extra help during the dry winter.  I love it!!!  I have definitley noticed that my skin is not as dry and appears smoother, my skin stays hydrated throught the day.  I love the smell, it is really light.  So, I don&#x27;t know about stretch marks, but I do know that this product definitely moisturizes your skin.</li>
            <li> Loved it!  I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks even though my tummy was HUGE (although I don&#x27;t know if I can attribute to this or just genetics?)  Even if it didn&#x27;t prevent marks, I thought it felt great, was not greasy, and kept away itchy skin.  Also, I used it daily on my stomach from 16 weeks to 38 weeks, and still have about half a bottle left.  A little goes a long way - Good value!</li>
            <li> I typically do not use oils because I am afraid that they will leave a residue or leave me feeling greasy.  I decided to try this product based on the reviews I had read and I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I purchased it!  I use it every morning after my shower, before getting dressed for work.  I trust this oil will not leave stains or a residue so much that I have no problem wearing my suits or other maternity clothes after applying it.  Although, I do allow roughly 5 minutes to go by after applying the oil to allow time for my skin to fully absorb it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My belly stays soft and hydrated all day!  I haven&#x27;t seen one stretch mark yet and I am 6 months pregnant!  I was worried about stretch marks because I have a few on both of my butt cheeks from when I hit puberty.  I have always been a skinny person as well so I knew I was in for a lot of stretching and growing when I found out I was pregnant.  One of the best parts about the product is that a little goes a long way.  You don&#x27;t have to use much to get the full coverage you need.  I haven&#x27;t even made it through half of the bottle yet and I have been using it for 2 months now.  Another perk is that it smells wonderful!  I love the light citrus scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to family &amp; friends and really anyone looking for an oil that will not leave you feeling like you have to take another shower after applying it.  I am looking into buying more products from this company.</li>
            <li> Nice oil, refreshing smell to an extremely sensitive pregnant nose ( with severe morning sickness).  Time will tell if it helps.</li>
            <li> This smells great and leaves my skin feeling good!  I am 16 weeks so its to early to say if it stops me from getting stretch marks but so far I love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! 4th time mom and it&#x27;s worked like a charm every time</li>
            <li> After trying a few different stretch mark butters that felt thick and left a bad residue, a friend with twins suggested Mama Mio. It is an oil instead of a cream or butter. It does leave you oily at first, but soaks in after a few minutes. It smells amazing! I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks using Mama Mio with baby #1 and haven&#x27;t yet with my current 2nd pregnancy. You never know if that is due to Mama Mio or good genetics, but I still recommend it to all of my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my pregnancy and I didn&#x27;t get one single stretch marks even though I gained 35 pounds.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and doesn&#x27;t leave ur skin feeling oily, but feeling quenched.  I only used one bottle throughout my pregnancy so I think the price is worth it for the results.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my aesthetician.  So far I&#x27;ve gained 40 pounds at 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and within striking distance of by delivery date.  No stretch marks in sight.  Worth the $40!</li>
            <li> This was recommended early in pregnancy to me and I know it&#x27;s highly loved by all, but, I just could never get over the smell. Granted, my sense of smell has been super heightened during pregnancy and it made this almost always unbearable to use - it was just too intense in smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since switched to organic coconut oil. Belly skin is just as soft for a fraction of the price and the smell is much more tolerable to me.</li>
            <li> Mama Mio oil feels good on my skin. Absorbs fast and has a very pleasant smell. Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> The lotion smells very good and it does absorb into the skin very well. I&#x27;m 3 months post delivery and thankfully I did not get any belly stretch marks . I only have two small ones on my belly botton piercing area, barely noticeable . I started to use mama mio in my third trimester and have been using it for recovery . This is my first child and my mother did get stretch marks . In addition to the lotion I ate relatively healthy food and did exercise. I gained 25 lbs. I&#x27;m sure it was a combination of all these factors that helped , but I&#x27;d like to give credit where it&#x27;s due , thank God for this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd pregnancy where I&#x27;ve used this product liberally once a day(twice a day in very rare occassions like after a second shower or bath).  I am 33 wks pregnant currently.  In my first pregnancy I gained 44 lbs and my 2nd I&#x27;ve gained 30 lbs so far.  Thankfully, miraculously, blessed-ly, I don&#x27;t have stretch marks.  And it is not the genes.  This product really does work and in my opinion is worth the money.  Even after the 1st pregnancy as I lost the weight, I loved what it did for my skin condition and resiliency.  I have bought several bottles and buying one more now as I approach the final weeks.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this tummy rub oil and my husband loves it too. It feels and smells like something you will get in a spa but with a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use it at night after a warm shower and it really helps with the itch, specially around my boobs ;)&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product. Five stars!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really prevents stretch marks, I still got them... But it does help your bump feel nice, not itchy, not overly oily &amp; it smells pretty good.</li>
