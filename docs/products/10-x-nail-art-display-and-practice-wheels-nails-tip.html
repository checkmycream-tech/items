            <li>Good to practice on though.</li>
            <li>and i have to put perfume on the wheel just for it can smell good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>Good way to practice.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>Love them!  </li>
            <li>I was worth the wait very good quality</li>
            <li>Their smooth and are great for practice.</li>
            <li>I received 10 of them for an amazing price &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Quality is nice.</li>
            <li>so I can repeat the look, and gave each color polish their own wheel.</li>
            <li>I can also see and pick what I will do on my own nails.</li>
            <li>it would have been nice to have the option to pick, but thats what i get trusting amazon.</li>
            <li>When i opened the package, i loved how they have it all in bubble wrap, &amp; all safe.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and I am very happy these wheels are very useful for me.</li>
            <li>Perfect for swatching new colours and experimenting with designs.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and the packaging was great so none of the nails broke or anything.</li>
            <li>I love practicing and creating nail designs so that I can do my own nails.</li>
            <li>I would have liked them better</li>
            <li>I bought these to test colors and combinations of colors because I love to paint my nails.</li>
            <li>I need more text, so...</li>
            <li>I like being able to practice nailart with these.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s why you need more than one wheel.</li>
            <li>Will probably order more.  </li>
            <li>Never used this before but love how I can identify nail polishes on it.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than using my index cards.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>these are okay for price - and practicing your nail designs they send you a lot of them to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I&#x27;m glad I have these now.</li>
            <li>They are amazing for beginners and for the more advanced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just make sure to keep remover away from these since it damages the &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to purchase more.</li>
            <li>I love this product and shipped before the estimated shipping</li>
            <li>I ordered the white ones because I figured that would display the nail colors best.</li>
            <li>Love these...</li>
            <li>Will be buying more from you.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for practicing nail art or for trying out nail polishes without actually putting it on your fingernails.</li>
            <li>The price was amazing compared to what was available in a cosmetic store.</li>
            <li>WHY DOESNT AMAZON GVE MORE PRODUCT DETAIL.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they came to me in the mail almost 3days</li>
            <li>later there was no fuss and they look awesome.</li>
            <li>But i love my order and I&#x27;m looking forward on ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love doing nails</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>i love these wheels  and they are 10 not 1 wheel which you can use to display all your nail colors</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to look at these rather than hauling out my baskets full of nail polish bottles to pick a color.</li>
            <li>These are my first wheels and I loved how they came before the estimated date.</li>
            <li>Its nice to look at these rather out my baskets full of nail polish bottles to pick a color</li>
            <li>Nail wheels are a must for me, great for swatching new polishes or trying out nail art.</li>
            <li>Makes for quick decision making when one needs to consider what kind of color mood one is in...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost more fun than painting your own nails.</li>
            <li>I received it when expected and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the packaging and everything else just bummed out that the clear practice wheels did not come</li>
            <li>Break easily and you can&#x27;t take the nail polish off.  </li>
            <li>you can write the polish name, number, etc on the inside of the wheel for easy categorization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I want to try nail polish colors on a skin tone like mine, I find painting both sides with a light nude first is the best way to get an accurate result (paint the underside for faster dry time and more coats for the top)</li>
            <li>These are really great for practicing but they don&#x27;t really have a top if you want to practice French tip of some kind.</li>
            <li>came quickly!  </li>
            <li>and I can find my colors really quickly!</li>
            <li>I recommend the natural ones if you want to really see the true color come out (perfect for neons, jellies, and glitters).</li>
            <li>Love to practice new designs, and these allow me to do that without the wear and tear on my own nails..</li>
            <li>You get a large amount of &amp;#34;nails&amp;#34; on each wheel and the &amp;#34;nail plate&amp;#34; is ample space for trying any kind of design.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more right away because I&#x27;m filling them up so quickly!</li>
            <li>These are great ways to swatch your nail polishes on, especially if you have a lot of them.</li>
            <li>But the price was cheap</li>
            <li>Quality-wise, they&#x27;re sturdy and light, the polish goes on smoothly with no edges to catch the brushes, and as for price, you get a ton.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get as clean of a finish, and 2) the nails are close together</li>
            <li>People, this made my life much easier...and fun! :)</li>
            <li>clients think its a cool display.</li>
            <li>Just for the fact that it took forever to arrive i nearly forgot about this order it was like receiving a nice surprise in the mail.</li>
            <li>Already painted and ready for more</li>
            <li>I love these so much.</li>
            <li>I love trying new polishes and unique designs.</li>
            <li>These came quickly.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly, just as described and was packaged</li>
            <li>I got the white ones (more like off-white) and I love them.</li>
            <li>Its a quick fix if you use tape to cover the surrounding nails.</li>
            <li>so that was good but didn&#x27;t care for the long shipping time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Three week ago I placed a new order, can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive :)</li>
            <li>Overall I love it!</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted and needed!  </li>
            <li>I am, however removing a star because you can&#x27;t easily remove polish from these as I was able to with my last set.</li>
            <li>I have also taken fine tip marker and wrote on the back top of each nail the polish name(s)</li>
            <li>Prior to having them I would practice on my own nails</li>
            <li>This is also useful for when friends want me to do their nails.  </li>
            <li>Worth the wait and worth the buy.  </li>
            <li>You need to use more polish with the clear.  </li>
            <li>The nail part is kind of big.</li>
            <li>and when i remove the polish it leaves a powerful smell</li>
            <li>to be honest i thought they were smaller</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and easy to practice different nail art techniques.</li>
            <li>Other than that I loved them</li>
            <li>Works very well for organizing and for display not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I bought this to catalog my nail polish collection, so I don&#x27;t have to struggle when trying to find the right shade.</li>
            <li>Good product, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>These nail art wheels are very large and have room to write on them.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using these before I create a new nail art.</li>
            <li>Although my collection isn&#x27;t huge (I only used 3 wheels), I enjoy that I have some to spare.  </li>
            <li>I like the elongated oval shape, they hold up to using nail polish remover, and are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I love using these to practice new designs or try out new techniques.</li>
            <li>Then I label the colors I use and how many coats with a sharpie in the middle.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li>From china, exactly 8 days after I placed the order.  </li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s fast!</li>
            <li>These are my personal favorite nail wheels for polish swatching.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants to organize their nail polish collection or even practice nail art!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish was that instead of the oval shape, it would have been more round, but other than that its perfect.</li>
            <li>That pretty much says it.</li>
            <li>need to put 3 coats though to get the true color of the polish when on natural nails.  </li>
            <li>Fun to inventory my colors and try new designs.  </li>
            <li>And it does, I have about 50 some odd nail polishes, and I only used about 4 of the wheels, great buy is all I can say..</li>
            <li>Oh well they came in a reasonable time and there are a bunch of these</li>
            <li>They can see what designs I&#x27;m capable of and can choose from the wheel.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to display them though...</li>
            <li>You can organize your collection and pick your nail color so much faster once these are all painted on.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really sturdy and does the job really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like them because let&#x27;s me see what works.</li>
            <li>I have so much nail polish and now with the wheels</li>
            <li>The white set is my favorite over the clear.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;ve been enjoying doing swatches of all of my colors.</li>
            <li>Fairly quick shipping for international.  </li>
            <li>Decent shipping time from HK seller, about two weeks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I have lots of polish and was able to fill up a few of these swatches.</li>
            <li>no breaks and all are thick and nice to handle.</li>
            <li>I mean, they&#x27;re going to get painted on anyway, but it would have been nice to get what I paid</li>
            <li>If you are reviewing a lot of polishes or just want to try new nail art ideas, these are for you.</li>
            <li>I have a LOT of polishes and like to swatch all of my new purchases and test designs before trying them on my nails.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was looking for and allows me to swatch my various nail polish colors.  </li>
            <li>I recently became interested in nail art</li>
            <li>Took a long time to get to us &amp; not quite the shape of nails we are used to but the price was right.</li>
            <li>However, I got all clear, but I was completely okay with that since that&#x27;s what I usually work with.</li>
            <li>Had I known better, I would have chose all white instead of half clear.</li>
            <li>They are oval wheels instead of round but very sturdy and easy to work with, just ordered a second batch!</li>
            <li>the only reason I took off one star is because when I tried to remove the polish with remover, it kind of &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; a little so they are a one time use only product.</li>
            <li>The picture and description stated that there would be the nails PLUS the clear case.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred the clear ones though.</li>
            <li>I did not get even one clear practice wheel.</li>
            <li>Professional nail technician/artist and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s default is the natural nails</li>
            <li>I wish I had gotten the clear instead of the natural.</li>
            <li>I made 4 swatches so far</li>
            <li>but once it did and I saw how far it had travelled, it made sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nail polish doesn&#x27;t adhere to it as easily as a natural nail</li>
            <li>but when I got my Pratcice wheels they were all natural.</li>
            <li>I bought the natural lookinh ones.</li>
            <li>ordered 5 packs of the Natural nail wheels, however what I received was a mixed bag of natural and clear.</li>
            <li>everything is super organized and there is little hassle.</li>
            <li>Ok so I always hate it when ppl say fast shipping but don&#x27;t really give you an idea of what fast is for them, so here it is!</li>
            <li>On the picture it shows 5 clear and 5 natural practice wheels so that was why I purchased these ten</li>
            <li>They are nice and thick, unlike some other wheels I have.</li>
            <li>but i thought i was getting clear and white...</li>
            <li>if you use alot of sheer nail polish you might wanna use the clear but</li>
            <li>it looks like you will get 5 clear displays and 5 white displays.</li>
            <li>i only got the white displays that really upset me because colors look different with a white background.</li>
            <li>Instead of the clear wheels, all ten were white.</li>
            <li>Buy the clear if you want to hold it over the real nail to see how the opacity will transfer to the color of your plain nails or</li>
            <li>I usually get mine from sallys beauty, but these cost less:)</li>
            <li>I was expecting the clear and the white, but my package only contained white.  </li>
            <li>the only problem i have is that i didnt know you could choose between the white and clear and white arrived and the nails are too close together</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Good way to practice.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and I am very happy with these.</li>
            <li> These are perfect to show off new colors and are great for getting macro shots.</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift for a friend and she enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> I love them too!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> Got these to keep track of all my nail polishes and to help me pick out colors better!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Love them!  </li>
            <li> I was worth the wait very good quality</li>
            <li> Their smooth and are great for practice.</li>
            <li> I received 10 of them for an amazing price &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Quality is nice.</li>
            <li> so I can repeat the look, and gave each color polish their own wheel.</li>
            <li> I can also see and pick what I will do on my own nails.</li>
            <li> it would have been nice to have the option to pick, but thats what i get trusting amazon.</li>
            <li> When i opened the package, i loved how they have it all in bubble wrap, &amp; all safe.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and I am very happy these wheels are very useful for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect for swatching new colours and experimenting with designs.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and the packaging was great so none of the nails broke or anything.</li>
            <li> I love practicing and creating nail designs so that I can do my own nails.</li>
            <li> I would have liked them better</li>
            <li> I bought these to test colors and combinations of colors because I love to paint my nails.</li>
            <li> I need more text, so...</li>
            <li> I like being able to practice nailart with these.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s why you need more than one wheel.</li>
            <li> Will probably order more.  </li>
            <li> Never used this before but love how I can identify nail polishes on it.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than using my index cards.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> these are okay for price - and practicing your nail designs they send you a lot of them to use</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, I&#x27;m glad I have these now.</li>
            <li> They are amazing for beginners and for the more advanced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just make sure to keep remover away from these since it damages the &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I love this product and shipped before the estimated shipping</li>
            <li> I ordered the white ones because I figured that would display the nail colors best.</li>
            <li> Love these...</li>
            <li> Will be buying more from you.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for practicing nail art or for trying out nail polishes without actually putting it on your fingernails.</li>
            <li> The price was amazing compared to what was available in a cosmetic store.</li>
            <li> WHY DOESNT AMAZON GVE MORE PRODUCT DETAIL.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they came to me in the mail almost 3days</li>
            <li> later there was no fuss and they look awesome.</li>
            <li> But i love my order and I&#x27;m looking forward on ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love doing nails</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> i love these wheels  and they are 10 not 1 wheel which you can use to display all your nail colors</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to look at these rather than hauling out my baskets full of nail polish bottles to pick a color.</li>
            <li> These are my first wheels and I loved how they came before the estimated date.</li>
            <li> Its nice to look at these rather out my baskets full of nail polish bottles to pick a color</li>
            <li> Nail wheels are a must for me, great for swatching new polishes or trying out nail art.</li>
            <li> Makes for quick decision making when one needs to consider what kind of color mood one is in...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost more fun than painting your own nails.</li>
            <li> I received it when expected and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the packaging and everything else just bummed out that the clear practice wheels did not come</li>
            <li> Break easily and you can&#x27;t take the nail polish off.  </li>
            <li> you can write the polish name, number, etc on the inside of the wheel for easy categorization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I want to try nail polish colors on a skin tone like mine, I find painting both sides with a light nude first is the best way to get an accurate result (paint the underside for faster dry time and more coats for the top)</li>
            <li> These are really great for practicing but they don&#x27;t really have a top if you want to practice French tip of some kind.</li>
            <li> came quickly!  </li>
            <li> and I can find my colors really quickly!</li>
            <li> I recommend the natural ones if you want to really see the true color come out (perfect for neons, jellies, and glitters).</li>
            <li> Love to practice new designs, and these allow me to do that without the wear and tear on my own nails..</li>
            <li> You get a large amount of &amp;#34;nails&amp;#34; on each wheel and the &amp;#34;nail plate&amp;#34; is ample space for trying any kind of design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more right away because I&#x27;m filling them up so quickly!</li>
            <li> These are great ways to swatch your nail polishes on, especially if you have a lot of them.</li>
            <li> But the price was cheap</li>
            <li> Quality-wise, they&#x27;re sturdy and light, the polish goes on smoothly with no edges to catch the brushes, and as for price, you get a ton.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get as clean of a finish, and 2) the nails are close together</li>
            <li> People, this made my life much easier...and fun! :)</li>
            <li> clients think its a cool display.</li>
            <li> Just for the fact that it took forever to arrive i nearly forgot about this order it was like receiving a nice surprise in the mail.</li>
            <li> Already painted and ready for more</li>
            <li> I love these so much.</li>
            <li> I love trying new polishes and unique designs.</li>
            <li> These came quickly.  </li>
            <li> Came quickly, just as described and was packaged</li>
            <li> I got the white ones (more like off-white) and I love them.</li>
            <li> Its a quick fix if you use tape to cover the surrounding nails.</li>
            <li> so that was good but didn&#x27;t care for the long shipping time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Three week ago I placed a new order, can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive :)</li>
            <li> Overall I love it!</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted and needed!  </li>
            <li> I am, however removing a star because you can&#x27;t easily remove polish from these as I was able to with my last set.</li>
            <li> I have also taken fine tip marker and wrote on the back top of each nail the polish name(s)</li>
            <li> Prior to having them I would practice on my own nails</li>
            <li> This is also useful for when friends want me to do their nails.  </li>
            <li> Worth the wait and worth the buy.  </li>
            <li> You need to use more polish with the clear.  </li>
            <li> The nail part is kind of big.</li>
            <li> and when i remove the polish it leaves a powerful smell</li>
            <li> to be honest i thought they were smaller</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and easy to practice different nail art techniques.</li>
            <li> Other than that I loved them</li>
            <li> Works very well for organizing and for display not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to catalog my nail polish collection, so I don&#x27;t have to struggle when trying to find the right shade.</li>
            <li> Good product, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> These nail art wheels are very large and have room to write on them.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy using these before I create a new nail art.</li>
            <li> Although my collection isn&#x27;t huge (I only used 3 wheels), I enjoy that I have some to spare.  </li>
            <li> I like the elongated oval shape, they hold up to using nail polish remover, and are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I love using these to practice new designs or try out new techniques.</li>
            <li> Then I label the colors I use and how many coats with a sharpie in the middle.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> From china, exactly 8 days after I placed the order.  </li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s fast!</li>
            <li> These are my personal favorite nail wheels for polish swatching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants to organize their nail polish collection or even practice nail art!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was that instead of the oval shape, it would have been more round, but other than that its perfect.</li>
            <li> That pretty much says it.</li>
            <li> need to put 3 coats though to get the true color of the polish when on natural nails.  </li>
            <li> Fun to inventory my colors and try new designs.  </li>
            <li> And it does, I have about 50 some odd nail polishes, and I only used about 4 of the wheels, great buy is all I can say..</li>
            <li> Oh well they came in a reasonable time and there are a bunch of these</li>
            <li> They can see what designs I&#x27;m capable of and can choose from the wheel.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to display them though...</li>
            <li> You can organize your collection and pick your nail color so much faster once these are all painted on.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really sturdy and does the job really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like them because let&#x27;s me see what works.</li>
            <li> I have so much nail polish and now with the wheels</li>
            <li> The white set is my favorite over the clear.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;ve been enjoying doing swatches of all of my colors.</li>
            <li> Fairly quick shipping for international.  </li>
            <li> Decent shipping time from HK seller, about two weeks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I have lots of polish and was able to fill up a few of these swatches.</li>
            <li> no breaks and all are thick and nice to handle.</li>
            <li> I mean, they&#x27;re going to get painted on anyway, but it would have been nice to get what I paid</li>
            <li> If you are reviewing a lot of polishes or just want to try new nail art ideas, these are for you.</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of polishes and like to swatch all of my new purchases and test designs before trying them on my nails.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for and allows me to swatch my various nail polish colors.  </li>
            <li> I recently became interested in nail art</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get to us &amp; not quite the shape of nails we are used to but the price was right.</li>
            <li> However, I got all clear, but I was completely okay with that since that&#x27;s what I usually work with.</li>
            <li> Had I known better, I would have chose all white instead of half clear.</li>
            <li> They are oval wheels instead of round but very sturdy and easy to work with, just ordered a second batch!</li>
            <li> the only reason I took off one star is because when I tried to remove the polish with remover, it kind of &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; a little so they are a one time use only product.</li>
            <li> The picture and description stated that there would be the nails PLUS the clear case.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred the clear ones though.</li>
            <li> I did not get even one clear practice wheel.</li>
            <li> Professional nail technician/artist and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s default is the natural nails</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten the clear instead of the natural.</li>
            <li> I made 4 swatches so far</li>
            <li> but once it did and I saw how far it had travelled, it made sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nail polish doesn&#x27;t adhere to it as easily as a natural nail</li>
            <li> but when I got my Pratcice wheels they were all natural.</li>
            <li> I bought the natural lookinh ones.</li>
            <li> ordered 5 packs of the Natural nail wheels, however what I received was a mixed bag of natural and clear.</li>
            <li> everything is super organized and there is little hassle.</li>
            <li> Ok so I always hate it when ppl say fast shipping but don&#x27;t really give you an idea of what fast is for them, so here it is!</li>
            <li> On the picture it shows 5 clear and 5 natural practice wheels so that was why I purchased these ten</li>
            <li> They are nice and thick, unlike some other wheels I have.</li>
            <li> but i thought i was getting clear and white...</li>
            <li> if you use alot of sheer nail polish you might wanna use the clear but</li>
            <li> it looks like you will get 5 clear displays and 5 white displays.</li>
            <li> i only got the white displays that really upset me because colors look different with a white background.</li>
            <li> Instead of the clear wheels, all ten were white.</li>
            <li> Buy the clear if you want to hold it over the real nail to see how the opacity will transfer to the color of your plain nails or</li>
            <li> I usually get mine from sallys beauty, but these cost less:)</li>
            <li> I was expecting the clear and the white, but my package only contained white.  </li>
            <li> the only problem i have is that i didnt know you could choose between the white and clear and white arrived and the nails are too close together</li>
            <li> got the clear wheels so I could test the opacity of some polishes, among other things.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to walk around with different designs on my nails at once or constantly uses nail polish remover which would dry out my nails.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product 3 weeks ago it came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> I was wanting to organize my nail polish collection for a long time now because i never knew what colors i had or needed.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t need any for a long time!</li>
            <li> so it could be a possibility that u could get polish on the the next nail too it but other than that ita</li>
            <li> So you have to let it dry for a longer.</li>
            <li> I wish the nail part could be a little smaller.</li>
            <li> They came sooner than I expected.  </li>
            <li> This is my fourth round of these wheels.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> All the other ones are quite sturdy and have not cracked or chipped.</li>
            <li> The issues with them are that the nails are shaped a little weird - long and very oval.  </li>
            <li> some of the edges are a little rough</li>
            <li> This make it a little difficult to put designs near or on the edge of the nail without hitting the one next to it.  </li>
            <li> Also, idk why ppl are having such a hard time with the color options when there&#x27;s a drop down menu.</li>
            <li> nails are a little too close together, but</li>
            <li> These arrives quickly enough and none were broken.</li>
            <li> had they been round instead of oval</li>
            <li> This disappointed me because I decorate them for fun and wanted to do stained glass effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell what a color looks like when it&#x27;s in the little bottle.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t wind up buying duplicates which I have in the past.</li>
            <li> Then, I transfered my nail designs from the loose fake nails I was using onto a few of the wheels.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to change.</li>
            <li> The 3 that are not broken are scratched very bad.</li>
            <li> They took forever to come here from China and some were chipped and broken, but I can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
            <li> It took 3 weeks to get here and over half of them are broken and chipped so bad I cant even use them.</li>
            <li> One of my guilty pleasures is hoarding nail polish.</li>
            <li> very bad every thing broken</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend buying this product its horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! Arrived earlier than I anticipate . I am, however removing a star because you can&#x27;t easily remove polish from these as I was able to with my last set. Other than that I loved them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product. It took 3 weeks to get here and over half of them are broken and chipped so bad I cant even use them. The 3 that are not broken are scratched very bad.I do not recommend buying this product its horrible.</li>
            <li> I review a ton of nail polishes and sometimes a girl just runs out of fingers. These are perfect to show off new colors and are great for getting macro shots. If you are reviewing a lot of polishes or just want to try new nail art ideas, these are for you.</li>
            <li> Best nail wheels on the market. I recommend the natural ones if you want to really see the true color come out (perfect for neons, jellies, and glitters). Buy the clear if you want to hold it over the real nail to see how the opacity will transfer to the color of your plain nails or whatever color you have on them (Great for effect topcoats and art/color designing).</li>
            <li> These came quickly.  There are ten (10) nail wheels.  I purchased them to organize my nail polish collection into an easy-to-access display (for home use).  Although my collection isn&#x27;t huge (I only used 3 wheels), I enjoy that I have some to spare.  Buying these wheels here saved me a lot of money!!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for and allows me to swatch my various nail polish colors.  I received it when expected and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> That pretty much says it. I bought these to test colors and combinations of colors because I love to paint my nails. They took forever to come here from China and some were chipped and broken, but I can&#x27;t complain for the price. I need more text, so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the clear wheels so I could test the opacity of some polishes, among other things. When I want to try nail polish colors on a skin tone like mine, I find painting both sides with a light nude first is the best way to get an accurate result (paint the underside for faster dry time and more coats for the top) Then I label the colors I use and how many coats with a sharpie in the middle.</li>
            <li> I use these nail wheels for practicing my designs and for swatching all of my polishes. These are a perfect, cheap solution!</li>
            <li> No complaints, item as described.  Priced lower than what I can find it for locally.</li>
            <li> I got the white ones but i thought i was getting clear and white... Oh well they came in a reasonable time and there are a bunch of these so I won&#x27;t need any for a long time!</li>
            <li> These are great ways to swatch your nail polishes on, especially if you have a lot of them. It helps me remember what all i do have!!</li>
            <li> I recently became interested in nail art so I decided to buy these practice wheels so I can try several different designs at once.  Prior to having them I would practice on my own nails but I didn&#x27;t want to walk around with different designs on my nails at once or constantly uses nail polish remover which would dry out my nails.  This is also useful for when friends want me to do their nails.  They can see what designs I&#x27;m capable of and can choose from the wheel.</li>
            <li> I received the practice wheels and it arrived intact.  I recently got into nail art and stamping so that means plenty of polishes.  I plan on keeping a catalog of my nail polishes so that I do not buy repeats.  Of course I plan on practicing on them also.  Worth the wait and worth the buy.  I might have to get another 10.</li>
            <li> I like being able to practice nailart with these. Had I known better, I would have chose all white instead of half clear. You need to use more polish with the clear.  They are sturdy and once polish sets into the nail for a couple of days it&#x27;s hard to change. I guess that&#x27;s why you need more than one wheel.</li>
            <li> The picture and description stated that there would be the nails PLUS the clear case. I only got the nails. I really wanted to display them though... However, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the clear and the white, but my package only contained white.  Not a big deal to me.  Fairly quick shipping for international.  Quality is nice.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and the packaging was great so none of the nails broke or anything. I got it as a gift for a friend and she enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> came quickly!  beautiful.  Fun to inventory my colors and try new designs.  need to put 3 coats though to get the true color of the polish when on natural nails.  I bought white</li>
            <li> I ordered these in white. They are nice and thick, unlike some other wheels I have. I will definitely be buying these again.</li>
            <li> Great value at a great price.  They came sooner than I expected.  Will probably order more.  Never used this before but love how I can identify nail polishes on it.</li>
            <li> Ordered these last year and didn&#x27;t realize this.these worked well for practicing on but when I used acetone to take off the polish it scratched the plastic so now they are bumpy. But the price was cheap so that was good but didn&#x27;t care for the long shipping time.</li>
            <li> I have polished all my polishes on them and have combined polishes (layered) 2 nails as well. This is so much better than using my index cards. These actually keep the gloss instead of soaking the gloss into the paper. I have also taken fine tip marker and wrote on the back top of each nail the polish name(s) so I can repeat the look, and gave each color polish their own wheel. Plus one for misc. colors and one for twotone colors. I have one wheel to spare. Our of 200 I have only used 64. They came in tact no breaks and all are thick and nice to handle. When the time comes I will order again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it! However, I got all clear, but I was completely okay with that since that&#x27;s what I usually work with. I&#x27;ll definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and she loves it. She&#x27;s an aspiring nail tech and she has been practicing her designs on them. I love them too!</li>
            <li> I love practicing and creating nail designs so that I can do my own nails. These are great for that. I highly recommend them. The white set is my favorite over the clear.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> Great way to practice nail art</li>
            <li> I love these. One of my guilty pleasures is hoarding nail polish. Perfect for swatching new colours and experimenting with designs.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, just as described and was packaged well/no damage. They are easy to use and easy to practice different nail art techniques.</li>
            <li> They work great. Their smooth and are great for practice. I would recommend this to anyone who is going to buy some.</li>
            <li> Professional nail technician/artist and I love using these to practice new designs or try out new techniques. This is my fourth round of these wheels. You get a large amount of &amp;#34;nails&amp;#34; on each wheel and the &amp;#34;nail plate&amp;#34; is ample space for trying any kind of design. You can use acrylic on them and they don&#x27;t melt or anything. Love these!</li>
            <li> these are okay for price - and practicing your nail designs they send you a lot of them to use</li>
            <li> Ok so I always hate it when ppl say fast shipping but don&#x27;t really give you an idea of what fast is for them, so here it is! I ordered these and thry made it to my door in los angeles..  From china, exactly 8 days after I placed the order.  Now that&#x27;s fast! Also, idk why ppl are having such a hard time with the color options when there&#x27;s a drop down menu. It&#x27;s default is the natural nails so its up to you to change it. They are oval wheels instead of round but very sturdy and easy to work with, just ordered a second batch!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product 3 weeks ago it came earlier than expected that was great the only problem i have is that i didnt know you could choose between the white and clear and white arrived and the nails are too close together so it could be a possibility that u could get polish on the the next nail too it but other than that ita an awesome product!!!!</li>
            <li> I got the white ones (more like off-white) and I love them. I can&#x27;t wait to use them. I would have preferred the clear ones though.</li>
            <li> Break easily and you can&#x27;t take the nail polish off.  Good to practice on though.</li>
            <li> I use the wheels to keep track of all the nail polish colors I have. It&#x27;s hard to tell what a color looks like when it&#x27;s in the little bottle. Then, I transfered my nail designs from the loose fake nails I was using onto a few of the wheels. People, this made my life much easier...and fun! :)</li>
            <li> very happy with the product</li>
            <li> These are a must have for a nail polish collector or beauty blogger. You can organize your collection and pick your nail color so much faster once these are all painted on.&lt;br /&gt;And you can write the polish name, number, etc on the inside of the wheel for easy categorization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 5 packs of the Natural nail wheels, however what I received was a mixed bag of natural and clear. I mean, they&#x27;re going to get painted on anyway, but it would have been nice to get what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I&#x27;m glad I have these now.</li>
            <li> These came gayer than predicted and we&#x27;re in great shape.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get to us &amp; not quite the shape of nails we are used to but the price was right.</li>
            <li> The nail part is kind of big. I wish the nail part could be a little smaller. Other than that, I&#x27;ve been enjoying doing swatches of all of my colors. I wish I had gotten the clear instead of the natural.</li>
            <li> I have used these to put my polish on so I can choose which color I want to wear at a glance.  Makes for quick decision making when one needs to consider what kind of color mood one is in...</li>
            <li> Item just as described.  I&#x27;m very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!! These are awesome for doing swatches and practicing designs. I love trying new polishes and unique designs. Awesome to use!</li>
            <li> This is like my 3rd or 4th time buying these nail art wheels. They are amazing for beginners and for the more advanced. These nail wheels are the only ones I buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this to catalog my nail polish collection, so I don&#x27;t have to struggle when trying to find the right shade. It&#x27;s really sturdy and does the job really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure to keep remover away from these since it damages the &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three week ago I placed a new order, can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive :)</li>
            <li> Love to practice new designs, and these allow me to do that without the wear and tear on my own nails..really like them because let&#x27;s me see what works. I can also see and pick what I will do on my own nails.They&#x27;re like an inventory of looks.I&#x27;m going to purchase more.</li>
            <li> very great for price. nails are a little too close together, but Its a quick fix if you use tape to cover the surrounding nails. clients think its a cool display. Overall I love it!</li>
            <li> These are my personal favorite nail wheels for polish swatching. I like the elongated oval shape, they hold up to using nail polish remover, and are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Perfect to keep track of all my color polishes so I don&#x27;t wind up buying duplicates which I have in the past.</li>
            <li> I was worth the wait very good quality and you sure get what you paid for 10! wheels!! Works very well for organizing and for display not disappointed. Just for the fact that it took forever to arrive i nearly forgot about this order it was like receiving a nice surprise in the mail.</li>
            <li> I was wanting to organize my nail polish collection for a long time now because i never knew what colors i had or needed. This is the perfect thing! I made 4 swatches so far and I can find my colors really quickly! I love this product and shipped before the estimated shipping so that was awesome! I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants to organize their nail polish collection or even practice nail art!</li>
            <li> I did not get the clears one and when i remove the polish it leaves a powerful smell and i have to put perfume on the wheel just for it can smell good</li>
            <li> These nail wheels are great for making swatches of all my polishes. the only reason I took off one star is because when I tried to remove the polish with remover, it kind of &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; a little so they are a one time use only product. All the other ones are quite sturdy and have not cracked or chipped.</li>
            <li> Product took longer to Arrive than I thought but once it did and I saw how far it had travelled, it made sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaged wonderfully and arrived safely!  Already painted and ready for more</li>
            <li> Instead of the clear wheels, all ten were white. This disappointed me because I decorate them for fun and wanted to do stained glass effect. nail polish doesn&#x27;t adhere to it as easily as a natural nail So you have to let it dry for a longer. It is satisfactory. Works perfectly for nail paint (acrylic). It&#x27;s a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted! Customs took a while but very happy with the product</li>
            <li> Good product, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Nail wheels are a must for me, great for swatching new polishes or trying out nail art. I usually get mine from sallys beauty, but these cost less:)</li>
            <li> On the picture it shows 5 clear and 5 natural practice wheels so that was why I purchased these ten but when I got my Pratcice wheels they were all natural. I did not get even one clear practice wheel. I am happy with the packaging and everything else just bummed out that the clear practice wheels did not come in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. There is no way to track the packaging once you purchase this item</li>
            <li> I love these! Quality-wise, they&#x27;re sturdy and light, the polish goes on smoothly with no edges to catch the brushes, and as for price, you get a ton. I&#x27;m buying more right away because I&#x27;m filling them up so quickly! It&#x27;s really great for comparing colors, layering glitters, and practicing art on. It&#x27;s almost more fun than painting your own nails.</li>
            <li> Got these to keep track of all my nail polishes and to help me pick out colors better! I would definitely recommend these to people with a lot of nail polish.</li>
            <li> I ordered the white ones because I figured that would display the nail colors best. And it does, I have about 50 some odd nail polishes, and I only used about 4 of the wheels, great buy is all I can say..</li>
            <li> These arrives quickly enough and none were broken. Only two things bother me. 1) some of the edges are a little rough so you don&#x27;t get as clean of a finish, and 2) the nails are close together so of I&#x27;m working on a design I get polish on the nail next to it.</li>
            <li> if you use alot of sheer nail polish you might wanna use the clear but these r great. a must have for nail polish lovers</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and I am very happy with these. I have lots of polish and was able to fill up a few of these swatches. It&#x27;s nice to look at these rather than hauling out my baskets full of nail polish bottles to pick a color.</li>
            <li> Just got these in the mail about 2 days ago and I&#x27;m in love! I already started swatching my polishes. The only thing I wish was that instead of the oval shape, it would have been more round, but other than that its perfect. I received 10 of them for an amazing price &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Not much else to say. Decent shipping time from HK seller, about two weeks. This is the best price for these I have found. I have a LOT of polishes and like to swatch all of my new purchases and test designs before trying them on my nails. I order these in white. I use the centers to mix colors as well!</li>
            <li> I would have liked them better had they been round instead of oval but I do like how sturdy they are</li>
            <li> Love these...exactly what I wanted and needed!  Love them!  I can practice all I want and catalogued my colors...GREAT price!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using these before I create a new nail art. I even use them just to see what colors go best together. Will be buying more from you. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Loved them! Good way to practice.</li>
            <li> very bad every thing broken</li>
            <li> Wonderful! These are perfect for practicing nail art or for trying out nail polishes without actually putting it on your fingernails. The price was amazing compared to what was available in a cosmetic store.</li>
            <li> I order these nail displays and based on the picture it looks like you will get 5 clear displays and 5 white displays. YOU DO NOT! i only got the white displays that really upset me because colors look different with a white background. WHY DOESNT AMAZON GVE MORE PRODUCT DETAIL. I GET THAT THEY ARENT THE SELLER, BUT AS AN AMAZON CUSTOMER THIS UPSET. it would have been nice to have the option to pick, but thats what i get trusting amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they came to me in the mail almost 3days later there was no fuss and they look awesome. to be honest i thought they were smaller but i see why they are so big. But i love my order and I&#x27;m looking forward on ordering more.</li>
            <li> These nail art wheels are very large and have room to write on them.  The issues with them are that the nails are shaped a little weird - long and very oval.  The nails are also too close together.  This make it a little difficult to put designs near or on the edge of the nail without hitting the one next to it.  Just for a polish palatte, it works great.</li>
            <li> When i opened the package, i loved how they have it all in bubble wrap, &amp; all safe. I have tried these out, &amp; they are awesome! If you are a fan of magnetic polish, they do work on the wheels. 5 star..</li>
            <li> I love these so much. Its awesome to practice on. I love doing nails so this is perfect. I bought the natural lookinh ones.</li>
            <li> I loved these wheels! I have so much nail polish and now with the wheels everything is super organized and there is little hassle.</li>
            <li> Great for displaying my nail colors.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I use these to practice different designs on my nails or combining nail polish. The only disadvantage is don&#x27;t use nail polish remover on it! It wld melt it!</li>
            <li> i love these wheels  and they are 10 not 1 wheel which you can use to display all your nail colors</li>
            <li> These are my first wheels and I loved how they came before the estimated date. What a great way to show the polishes</li>
            <li> These are really great for practicing but they don&#x27;t really have a top if you want to practice French tip of some kind. I don&#x27;t regret buying it because I need practice. however I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and I am very happy these wheels are very useful for me. I have lots of polish.. Its nice to look at these rather out my baskets full of nail polish bottles to pick a color</li>
