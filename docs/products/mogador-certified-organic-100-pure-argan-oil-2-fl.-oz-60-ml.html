            <li>It makes your skin feel so good.</li>
            <li>sample I got was the josie maran brand, and I really really loved it</li>
            <li>Good brand .No  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend money on Josie Maran&#x27;s oil when this is just as good.</li>
            <li>This oil is good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>The product is what I anticipated, being good quality.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I was delighted and ordered it.</li>

            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of good reports of Argan Oil, and wanted to try some for both my hair and my skin.</li>
            <li>but I was trusting a good friend who has been using this product and swears by it.  </li>
            <li>- the reviews were really good, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li>it is good -</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>No frizz, just beautiful curly ringlets with healthy shine...not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone seeking a healthy alternative to beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>I tried the Josie Maran argan oil and loved it, so I did some research and found that this one got good reviews on Amazon (and also at a much more affordable price!).</li>
            <li>I was looking for an organic healthy and safe alternative to a moisturizer and this is great!</li>
            <li>My skin is moisturized &amp; happily soaking in more moisture with the hep of the Hyaluronic acid that I use in tandem with my Argan oil.</li>
            <li>Many creams disappear too soon, but this organic Argan oil is great.</li>
            <li>I have used on my hair and I am very pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li>I am about 1/8 through the bottle because I share with my kiddos, and I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Curly girls, the search is over for great looking, fuss free hair!  </li>
            <li>It leaves your face very smooth and radiant!</li>
            <li>After reading many great things about this product I decided to give it a try for myself.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t fabulous, but it&#x27;s authentic, and therefore, to me, it&#x27;s the best smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I immediately noticed wonderful moisturization, smooth skin, and have received many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT !</li>
            <li>But make sure you use it sparingly!</li>
            <li>and I feel confident I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li>I do love what this does!</li>

            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>Then wash off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I can&#x27;t use it every day on my skin because it becomes a bit too much, but a couple times a week is perfect.</li>
            <li>rose and neroli are also astringents).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shipping was lightning fast and the customer service is excellent.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit of experimenting to know how much works best for your body/face/hair</li>
            <li>This oil feels wonderful on my face-light but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>Mogador is effective, and although I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, I want to prevent them and preserve.</li>
            <li>, it is nice the texture on my face when I applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Nice skin product.</li>
            <li>My argan is now oiled up nice</li>
            <li>The most noticeable to me is that my hair stays looking good all day.</li>
            <li>This is nice.</li>
            <li>but it does moisturizer nicely</li>
            <li>I bought this brand the first time and must say it is very good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a wonderful moisturizing oil, and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>This product is a great for organic pure argan oil and the price is more than great.  </li>
            <li>Aragon oil great as always and enjoyed using it as it helps feeling my face smooth and radiant and recommending to all</li>
            <li>are the good reviews, most of which said that the product is authentic.</li>
            <li>and I am super happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful on hair, nails, acne scars so far!</li>
            <li>light, wonderful oil, no bad smell, love it for hair and skin</li>
            <li>Best of all, it has a rather strong, nutty odor, which I much prefer to deli meat!</li>
            <li>The best Argan oil I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>but so far I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>and this by far has worked the best!</li>
            <li>However, the two together make a good combination for a smooth and moisturized complexion without the greasy results you get with some oils.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Argan oil is supposed to have amazing antioxidant and possibly even antibacterial properties, in addition to being an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes well, but is also very light -</li>
            <li>I think as far as argan oil goes, this is pretty great, and an incredible value.</li>
            <li>pure and great for smoothing my hair</li>
            <li>Regardless, I shall not go without my new beloved argan oil ever again!  </li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>I love it-</li>
            <li>This product is magic.</li>
            <li>Customer Service is TOP NOTCH - just like product.</li>
            <li>I am using now and love the product.  </li>
            <li>Okay, this product is wonderful for skin rejuvenation and such, and that&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
            <li>and I tell you, my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>but I love this stuff for moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping that it works in the summer when my skin is more oily.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The quality is so much better than the one I had before and</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best quality 100% Argan oil available.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely top quality without the sticker shock :)</li>
            <li>The price is also descent compared to another brand I actually love but is quite pricey.  </li>
            <li>I did buy many Mogador Argan bottles  for  </li>
            <li>They even stopped putting those synthetic moisturizers/substances that cause more harm.</li>
            <li>My family and I love this product and we will keep purchasing it from Mogador Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it works best on damp skin--it not only locks moisture in, it also makes the oil easier to use.</li>
            <li>The texture on my neck and chest looks much better, too.</li>
            <li>Also, I love that the proceeds go to support the Berber women who make it.</li>
            <li>Also, I love that the proceeds go to support the Berber women who make it.</li>

            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>Love argan oil</li>
            <li>and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;wasn&#x27;t impressed especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and many said this oil is just like Josie&#x27;s on QVC.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it probably helps with acne as well...</li>
            <li>I Love Argan oil</li>
            <li>The best part about it is the different uses of it.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine uses Argan oil from a famous distributor.  </li>
            <li>I discovered argan oil a year ago after reading many beauty blogs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those of you with oily/combination skin who are hesitant to put more oil on your face - this is the BEST facial moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>In fact, it provides the perfect canvas for  makeup application after you let it properly sink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of Argan oil.</li>
            <li>and it is works magically.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with the results on my face that  I apply it to my entire body now after my shower.</li>
            <li>I like the earthy scent and am very happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker than another brand that I tried, it seems to go on better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Just wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li>and it makes make-up go on much better.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for much more after reading all the rave reviews.  </li>
            <li>In the morning, after my shower while my skin is still moist, I apply 2 more drops.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>It is dispensed by dropper, which is interesting.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I really love this oil and my daughter does also.</li>
            <li>would be going all the way to Morocco for some oil :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>However, it met my expectations and the price point was better than a lot of others out there.</li>
            <li>love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this oil.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I get more out of it that way than using it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I became acquainted with argan oil in a trip that I made to Morocco, where I bougth it.</li>
            <li>this bottle is 2 oz, when most are 1).</li>
            <li>I LOVE Argan oil, but not this one.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff .</li>
            <li>But I love argan</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily, just healthy skin.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Most days my face is au naturel, except for this</li>
            <li>It is a much better product for me than Josie Marin&#x27;s Argan oil.</li>
            <li>so this isn&#x27;t the most thorough review.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Very much satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I love how it moisturizes my skin and gives off this dewey glow.</li>
            <li>I really feel like i am doing something great for my skin when I use this product.</li>
            <li>Love this oil</li>
            <li>Mogador Organic Argan Oil can be used for many purposes.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>and I love the dropper</li>
            <li>and I love it already.</li>
            <li>I am going to reorder 3 more bottles for myself and my sister.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to do this in my 20s, but my skin looks better now (more even).  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is the most versatile product in my beauty product collection.  </li>
            <li>It is the most soothing moisturizer on the planet.  </li>
            <li>Love, love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So pleased to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I apply this to my face and neck daily and my skin has more elasticity and feels great!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the dropper bottle.</li>
            <li>This product is well priced compared to many that are available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it is lovely on my face, neck and hands.</li>
            <li>This is the best and most simple product for your skin -face, neck, body.</li>
            <li>For about 2 years I was a brand that cost more -than-twice this brand (because I didn&#x27;t think to look on Amazon).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love 😍 love 😍 it.....</li>
            <li>and I ALREADY love it..</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE TRIED A MANY OF PRODUCTS TO FIND SOMETHING TO MOISTURIZE MY HAIR</li>
            <li>It delivers the same (or perhaps better) results at a great price!!!</li>
            <li>Cannot ask for anything better.</li>
            <li>I ran out and wanted to buy more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did purchase</li>
            <li>This product is top of the line.</li>
            <li>Nine more words are required so here they are.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>That combination seems to work best - There was a definite dryness that this oil has diminished</li>
            <li>I originally discovered Josie Maran Argan Oil as a free sample at Sephora and I loved it.</li>
            <li>true thing, absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>For a face product on Amazon that amazing right there!  </li>
            <li>The oil is very light and absorbs into my face and neck very quickly leaving no feeling of oily residue.</li>
            <li>It is awesome all over the body, and just a couple drops go a long way.  </li>
            <li>My cuticles look pretty good too.</li>
            <li>But my sister who is real user said \\&quot;Best, hair&#x27;s shine is come back and its volume is good.</li>
            <li>It comes with a dropper top which makes it very clean and easy to get a couple of drops.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important that the product is authentic, because argan oil is very rare, and the cheaper versions can often be diluted.</li>
            <li>not so oily, it&#x27;s best for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I rarely recommend beauty products to anyone, as I don&#x27;t think most products are as effective as advertised.</li>
            <li>It takes just 4 drops per day, but honestly people ask me how I have such great skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall, good experience in ordering and good quality product.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent moisturizer and wrinkle minimizer for my face and is light enough to be used under makeup.</li>
            <li>Also, it has awesome antiseptic properties, so I use a liberal amount on a newly popped pimple instead of rubbing alcohol (but still wash the area with face face wash first).</li>
            <li>&quot; is very true.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my skin look and feel, so healthy and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my skin and hair for about ten days now, and it really is incredible.</li>
            <li>Its been a week since I have begun using argan oil, and I have to say this was the best 18.99 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li>and I love how light weight it is</li>
            <li>I wake up with smooth, healthy looking</li>
            <li>All natural, great value and a much&lt;</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous and the customer service couldn&#x27;t have been better.  </li>
            <li>But most importantly:  the blotchiness on the side of my face and neck has gone away.  </li>
            <li>Mogador is just as good, but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that Mogador argan oil is Fair</li>
            <li>The natural color is great and my nails are so strong.  </li>
            <li>The price is right, as if you buy real cheap, well you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>This argan oil is nice and rich; it absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Put a quarter-sized amount on your fingertips and clean your face (works on even the most stubborn eye makeup too).</li>
            <li>the seller was very helpful and it was shipped super fast and packaged with very great care .</li>
            <li>Argan oil is great, it works better than the moisturizer I used to use, I can&#x27;t feel it on, and it improved my moderate acne.</li>
            <li>and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Does not make my face look greasy and easy to absorb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of over-the-counter as well as strong strong strong prescription medication (including</li>
            <li>I used to shell out big bucks for Josie Maran, which is also good, but this is just as effective at a lower price.  </li>
            <li>Overall this product is great and even has a natural odor which is great.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and I would highly recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li>but I will break it down, excellent on hair, skin, nails.</li>
            <li>I am blessed with very good skin, not too dry or too oily and this product does not interfere in that balance.</li>
            <li>Specially my mom was complaining 3 wks ago that a good chunk (unusual amount) of her hair was falling.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are diminishing as well.</li>
            <li>but I still have fine lines.</li>
            <li>This oil is much better than the higher priced brand - it seems thicker to me and moisturizes better.</li>
            <li>It has diminished fine lines and has tighten my skin.</li>
            <li>I have seen an improvement in fine lines on my face</li>
            <li>Great natural, true product.</li>
            <li>also love the mildly roasted fragrance of this oil.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and hydrates my skin like nothing else!</li>
            <li>product is a MUST have, I am a loyal customer for life!</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing from this seller again, delivery was quick and I am pleased with the size of the jar.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and the bottle reached safely.  </li>
            <li>I know this stuff says it is organic and pure argan oil which is why I was so happy with the purchase because it was pretty cheap</li>
            <li>Love the product very much !</li>
            <li>Very good product love it ,use it every day in my face and  for my hair it has done a spectacular difference before was dry now is soft</li>
            <li>The product is fine, I like the light sesame fragrance and the oil</li>
            <li>The seller was very quick to resend replacement product when it came to their attention that the original shipment had been damaged.</li>
            <li>Even from day 1 I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This argan oil, in addition to 2.0% retinol cream from NCN have been extremely effective in helping my skin heal much faster than before.</li>
            <li>The ordering process was convenient and secure.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s important to moisturize and soften them to heal.</li>
            <li>Will probably order it again if it continues to agree with my skin which is smooth and hydrated after using this product.</li>
            <li>I would not suggest using this on your face everyday, 2 times a week for me at night works best.  </li>
            <li>Great for daily use!</li>
            <li>I started a regimen of argan oil two years ago, each morning around my eyes and mouth, and it has genuinely made a difference.  </li>
            <li>I had never heard of argan oil until I tried a free sample out of a magazine.</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth and it cleared up any breakout I had.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face primarily, and the flakiness is almost gone</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really makes my skin feel amazing-</li>
            <li>I am so happy I finally found this.</li>
            <li>this cheap (remember,</li>
            <li>I have never found anything (cheap or expensive)that could do what this does.  </li>
            <li>and i use cheap shampoo/conditioner).  </li>
            <li>The results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting this stuff on my face twice a day for about 3 weeks now, and the results have been fantastic.</li>
            <li>Does not clog pores and makes face smooth.</li>
            <li>Clears and moisturizes acne-prone skin, makes hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>so this bottle will probably last 5-6 months, great value.</li>
            <li>Now, my face feels smooth every time I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>This product actually makes my skin feel great</li>
            <li>I also apply a drop around my eyes and on my neck to keep the skin smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li>Not only that, the delivery time was GREAT</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it, my face is already healing and started to look better after a couple times of using the Josie Maran Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this purchase, I learned that you get what you pay for - if the stuff is cheap</li>
            <li>Great skin moisturizer for evenings, but can be used during the day depending on the individual&#x27;s desire.</li>
            <li>After dipping my toe in the water, so to speak, I began to lightly coat my face every night.  </li>
            <li>hair is nice and soft and my face is blemish free!  </li>
            <li>Being a Moroccan, Argan oil has always been an essential element in my life; therefore, I do know the  characteristics of a good quality and authentic Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair and it does a good job of helping to keep it soft.  </li>
            <li>The reason I purchased this product because it contained no harsh chemicals and all the good reviews it received.  </li>
            <li>The appearance of the fine lines on my face have diminished significantly.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a high quality Argan oil but don&#x27;t want to pay the extra 50 bucks for a designer name, this is the best value for your dollar.  </li>
            <li>If goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I strongly believe that Mogador Argan oil is pure and authentic.</li>
            <li>I use this oil to heal my dry chapped hands and after two weeks I have experienced a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>This oil is light and is absorbed very quickly, leaving the skin moist and supple not greasy.  </li>
            <li>i just love this oil so much!</li>
            <li>She has lovely skin, so I thought I would try this one first instead of paying $60+ for the advertising.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff - bought my first bottle in Morocco and have been hooked ever since.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about the effects I bought some Organic Argan oil  shampoo and masque</li>
            <li>(it reminds me of toasted nuts :)), but it didn&#x27;t bother me the first time I used it - now I don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.</li>
            <li>It is great all year long.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant decrease in the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m excited to see what my skin will look like in  1 month.  </li>
            <li>But first of all, she lovely this argan oil because it doesn&#x27;t have any smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves a fabulous glow on my skin, has a lovely somewhat nutty, natural scent that is very light and dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>The oil tames frizzy hair and works great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is light, non-greasy, absorbs quickly, and is odorless.</li>
            <li>Most worked great for a few weeks</li>
            <li>To be honest, I enjoy the smell of natural products.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Love, love, my 16 year old daughter used on a break out on her chin before bed.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry nails too.</li>
            <li>The oil goes on light and absorbs rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>and WOW I am in love!</li>
            <li>, I know it can most certainly replace a night cream.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is organic, PURE Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for an authentic, pure, Moroccan Argan oil for years and years now, trying everything and anything in the market</li>
            <li>great product, arrived just as i expected.</li>
            <li>this at amazon.i have always been pleased with my purchases from amazon and the fast service</li>
            <li>: I have a combination oily, acne-prone skin, and what I read about the astringent effect of argan oil is true in my case.</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair and accidentally run out of hair conditioner, a drop of this oil can work as a detangler (although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good replacement for hair conditioner on a regular basis).</li>
            <li>When I was younger, I had fairly severe acne, and still encounter hormonal breakouts once and a while.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>If you want an effective natural product, I&#x27;d recommend this.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my skin look more hydrated</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this product for a good solid run before reviewing it.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this produce and give a full review once I have completed the bottle.</li>
            <li>Since then I have tried Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil and am more convinced that Mogador is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This stuff is potent, so you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>and I found that it was true</li>
            <li>No bad reaction, and my face is softer than ever.  </li>
            <li>Light and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>True argan oil isn&#x27;t cheap, so when you find a cheap bottle claiming it is 100% pure, question it.</li>
            <li>I had heard many good things about this oil, I had been using a much more expensive oil and this is actually better.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped to me quickly and I received it within 3 days.</li>
            <li>it soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs quickly, as others say and leaves no oil residue at all.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use it on damp skin, there&#x27;s a bit of a tacky or sticky sensation that quickly goes away (as does the aroma).</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how quickly my skin absorbs it, though.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use it on damp skin, there&#x27;s a bit of a tacky or sticky sensation that quickly goes away (as does the aroma).</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how quickly my skin absorbs it, though.</li>
            <li>It has made a tremendous difference on my feet.</li>
            <li>I came back to amazon to buy more, thinking I would do a bit more searching and review reading this time.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly - leaving you skin feeling like a newborn.  </li>
            <li>I have been suffering with mild acne.</li>
            <li>I received this product rather quickly, and it was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>As for the seller, the product was sent quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>but most of them had so many different ingredients in them that I didn&#x27;t know</li>
            <li>It also arrived really quickly and well packed.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair super soft&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not irritate the face and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The oil does absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth and soft my skin looks and feels after I apply it.  </li>
            <li>While I love this I did find another brand that had twice the oil for only $10 more that works just as well.</li>
            <li>but when you get it right it is so worth it!</li>
            <li>I love this product for my face and my hair, my hair gives you high gloss and does not feel oily, I recommend</li>
            <li>Oil will absorb some of the chemicals in the plastic containers, so this product is of high quality and safe.</li>
            <li>It has the slightly nutty scent (I&#x27;m asian and it kind of reminds me of a very light sesame oil...sort of), glides on my skin really smoothly, and has been really amazing to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Argain oil has an exquisite ability to absorb into skin completely (or nearly completely depending on the \\&quot;mood\\&quot; of my skin and application) that I have not seen in other oils.</li>
            <li>Low odor -- no adverse reactions or breakouts (my skin is very sensitive) -- cruelty free -- nice packaging (both appearance and usability)!</li>
            <li>I first received the oil, I was super excited.</li>
            <li>because I only use 4 drops a day, it is certified organic, it has simplified my beauty routine as I only use a gentle cleanser and the oil with great results, and it&#x27;s great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(I work in an aromatherapy shop, so being able to detect oils that have gone off is becoming second nature to me).</li>
            <li>The dropper makes it easy to keep from overpouring too much and the bottle is tinted just as it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle!</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!!  </li>
            <li>The product seems to work as well as others that were more expensive but had a more pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>So I started putting this oil on damp hair after I wash it and it makes my hair so shiny and reduces frizz and makes it wavy or less curly which I LOVE!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use as much, it spreads more easily, and sinks in better.</li>
            <li>this is a fine oil - it will get through your fingers, I apply directly on forehead - cheeks - neck -arms and smooth it in.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen any remarkable skin changes or improvements in particular but my skin looks youthful and I look about 10 years younger than I am (48).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone needing to give special attention to problematic skin ailments!</li>
            <li>So, I read about rubbing oils into the scalp - tried olive oil warmed in a bowl - worked great, but too messy.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast and the oil was package securely against breakage.</li>
            <li>I put a few drops in my bath, and my skin feels so great.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth and my hair is very silk.</li>
            <li>Husband likes it as well helps calm his eczema .</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Wow, I love it on my skin.</li>
            <li>Gross as that sounds, it is so effective, I just have to put it out there.&lt;br /&gt;Getting</li>
            <li>it makes my skin really fresh and</li>
            <li>Basically the same idea as in method 2, but instead of using it in the shower, moist your face with rose (or neroli or mineral) water, and then apply a drop or two of the oil.</li>
            <li>I LOVE how the product works, my skin is soft and no breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this after comparing this product to a name brand product from Sephora and decided that this was worth the risk to save some $.  </li>
            <li>There must be some kind of antiseptic quality similar to Walnut oil that helps heal outbreaks, rashes and cuts.</li>
            <li>I can honestly tell a difference in my skin in a short 48 hours.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li>Ok, if you are beginning to get winkles, this is the simple answer to smooth them out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and love it so far.</li>
            <li>It is a splurge well worth it.</li>
            <li>Glad it works for some, but if you have really sensitive skin as I do, I&#x27;d avoid this product.</li>
            <li>I do wait about 15 minutes for the oil to be absorbed before applying my make-up.  </li>
            <li>Easily absorbed by skin.  </li>
            <li>this oil n said \\&quot; ok let&#x27;s try this again sigh \\&quot; and guess what it makes my skin soft ..</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about argan oil is that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>My bottle also did not have a distinct smell in the bottle or on the hair.</li>
            <li>Now my skin is so soft, more even, and I seem to have fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li>For me, it is worth the price just for that.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes without greasiness, all the oil is absorbed.</li>
            <li>I like the way it is absorbed into the skin and makeup goes on so well over</li>
            <li>but so far I am pleased with the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>Economical and meets my expectations.</li>
            <li>that my 2 cents for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>2 months I have been using this product, My hair looks so healthy, it seems like my split ends disappear, and it looks like it has been professionally done.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth it for me.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to use something more natural.</li>
            <li>Pure Argan Oil was not something I was familiar with, but I purchased it becasue of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried countless anti-aging products to retain my youthful skin, and I have only been using this product for a week and have noticed remarkable difference in fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It absorbs pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li>This is as good, if not better, than the Josie Maran brand at a much more reasonable price point.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and efficient and I could not recommend this product more highly.</li>
            <li>This brand&#x27;s argan oil was everything I wanted: high quality and effective for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I tried it right away</li>
            <li>it literally just flows right out of the dropper onto your hand or wherever.</li>
            <li>I use almost 10 and it soaks right in</li>
            <li>I use this in my hair right after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>I went out right away and purchased the Josie Maran oil</li>
            <li>so I have a strong interest in effects of chemicals (natural or synthetic) in our body, and I tend to trust natural compounds more.</li>
            <li>It has not only healed my inflammation but it has taken away the red, scaly look on my skin and has made it beautiful and</li>
            <li>Has a slightly nutty scent, but pleasant and not noticeable at all when I put it on.</li>
            <li>This is very important for those who begin their day in a yoga or some other physical activity class - no gross feeling when you sweat, as it is always the case even with the best body lotions.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used argan oil (after hearing all the rants and raves about it, i had to try it), and it was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The first time I used about 10 drops, but it made my hair just a tad bit oily so 5-7 is right for me.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and argan oil makes an amazing face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This oil should probably be great for African hair, especially for those who heat-style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased argan oil from another vendor here, and, while it worked fairly well, (I used it on practically anywhere</li>
            <li>It works quickly and really does everything it&#x27;s set out to do.</li>
            <li>I do not usually review products but this one is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Why mess with a good thing, right?!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>By Sunday night, the skin has healed and pealed off, leaving new smooth red skin (it does help that I&#x27;m getting 8 hrs of sleep as this is my summer break before grad school start, and I have a healthy diet).</li>
            <li>I break out very easily and suffer from super oily skin and periods/patches of really unbearably dry flaky red/pink skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil by Ecocert, 2oz size for the use of 2 bottle worth if you will.</li>
            <li>At first I was surprised &amp; happy that it lacked the stinkiness of other Argan oils.  </li>
            <li>Not the cheapest, but definitely amongst the best, and accurate to the fact that it&#x27;s organic with the evidence of a roasted, nutty,&lt;br /&gt;smell, unlike others that are, obviously mixed with other oils, like the ELMA &amp; SANA brand, calling it 100% organic when you&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and the benefits for your skin are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>my skin gets super dry and this stuff lasts long and is a great deal.</li>
            <li>The cost per unit of measure is a bit higher, but unlike many of the competing offers this one seems high purity, doesn&#x27;t have any odor,</li>
            <li>the product is ok, not really nothing special.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 days ONLY now , and i noticed a huge difference on my skin !</li>
            <li>Have been using argan oil for about 8 mo.started with a higher priced one,but found this one on line and decided to try it.love</li>
            <li>Argan oil is the ultimate for me as it has so many beneficial compounds.</li>
            <li>I spread it on my hands first so the oil don&#x27;t aggregate in one spot on my hair and make that area too oily.</li>
            <li>Rinse a facecloth in hot water, squeeze it out and put over your face until it cools.</li>
            <li>I thought that L&#x27;Occitane Immortelle mask does miracles when worn overnight, but I actually like the effect of argan oil better -</li>
            <li>This is how I think I&#x27;ll be using it in summer when it gets hot and humid.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought Argan Oil</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, my skin drank it up like no one&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li>The skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Lord willing, we will NOT experience another situation without our (my husband &amp; I) Argan oil</li>
            <li>I ordered this and when it came I decided to try it on my skin, well it really works on wrinkles!</li>
            <li>81 years old and face is smooth.</li>
            <li>Someone with thick hair and/or curls could probably use this any time with great results.  </li>
            <li>DID make me break out just at first.  </li>
            <li>fantastic on my body; can&#x27;t use on my face as it caused acne, but I am prone to adult acne from almost anything; will buy it again</li>
            <li>I started to use the Argan Oil from the first day i received it.</li>
            <li>Love the product, and I actually recommend it to my sister.</li>
            <li>Both argan and coconut oil go on greaseless, but argan oil left my skin feeling more nourished and softer.</li>
            <li>I recently gave up smoking after 40 years and someone told me about Argon oil to heal my skin on my face after so many years of smoking.</li>
            <li>so soft and smooth (</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Argon Oil</li>
            <li>Mogador argan oil has changed my skin, turned it into baby smooth and replenished the natural skin moisture.  </li>
            <li>I used it to the last drop and then could not find any place where to buy some more.</li>
            <li>So I sought out a cheaper alternative and after researching found this product which when I first bought this product I paid $18.84 for it.</li>
            <li>so I have to use another 3 because my hands absorb it, but it makes my hair silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Not even aware that it is on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely getting more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>And its very affordable!</li>
            <li>, after using this product consistently every day since I received it, I see the results.  </li>
            <li>I will write more later..</li>
            <li>From the moment I first used this, I could almost feel the moisture penetrating my skin.</li>
            <li>(Before most people heard of Amazon actually.)  </li>
            <li>Yet, this is the first review I have taken the time to write.  </li>
            <li>most likely it isn&#x27;t -</li>
            <li>It is the first moisturizer zi apply, let it absorb, and apply a serum</li>
            <li>The only difference during the day is that I wear spf on top.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll most likely be purchasing another bottle once I&#x27;ve used this one up.</li>
            <li>In the mean time this oil is a great addition to my skincare regime.</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin look and feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>; is not easy, but yes, its a really good stuff.</li>
            <li>I read through many reviews and settled on this brand in particular - it did take me a few weeks to see results, but now, after about 2 to 3 weeks, my skin is softer, more supple and the winter dullness has faded.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped using any other moisturizers on my face, this is amazing.</li>
            <li>Combine with mineral water spray (Evian at Sephora, or some other) or rose or neroli water.</li>
            <li>Mogador produces a very high quality product and deals directly with the producer in Morocco, which I think is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable and very high quality.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker than many others, it&#x27;s not mixed with anything synthetic, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was using a more expensive brand of Argan and wanted to see if it was just as good.</li>
            <li>Most of all it has provided so much smoothness in my skin, especially around my eyes!</li>
            <li>The quality of this brand was just as good as the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>I would love a beauty product that really reduces fine lines, improves firmness, tones, improves pore size and uneven skin with noticeable results</li>
            <li>It will quickly dissipate, and is actually a sign of it being the true stuff from Morocco.</li>
            <li>This positive about this product is that it is non oily after application</li>
            <li>have invented several other uses of it for myself that I would be happy to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot give a full report on how it has worked for my stretch marks so far, but I pray it does well on them.</li>
            <li>I am focused on using natural products on my skin and this product is superior to other non-natural products I have used for years.</li>
            <li>It does not clog my pores, I find it to be fairly fragrance free, with a very subtle nutty scent if any.</li>
            <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t smell sweet or perfumey--and it shouldn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t smell sweet or perfumey--and it shouldn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>It is not oily and absorbs quickly and completely and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes and softens my skin so well, which probably appeases my own oil glands, so it becomes much less shiny.</li>
            <li>You can also use it to get rid of dry skin and blemishes, condition cuticles, as much more.</li>
            <li>Makes my skins and hair super soft.  </li>
            <li>I use about 8 drops for medium length hair, so I expect this will last me a good long time.</li>
            <li>though if I had truly understood how strong it was back then, I probably would have chosen not to).  </li>
            <li>but I think it isn&#x27;t true argan oil, at least the kind you should be putting on your face.  </li>
            <li>This time I deciden to change the brand and buoght Mogador Certified Organic Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I have been reading that pure argan oil can be purchased cheaper than Josie&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>that was quite large as my mosquito bites are generally large and weep</li>
            <li>I have heard about Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil for over 3 years now.</li>
            <li>Mogador&#x27;s argan oil certainly fits the bill!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once I started using the pure argan oil, those problems went away.</li>
            <li>My face seemed to have large craters and it was lowering my self esteem.</li>
            <li>I also wanted one that was pure oil.</li>
            <li>had used another oil that contained Argan Oil and that is when I decided to buy pure Argan Oil</li>
            <li>However, this is pure argan oil</li>
            <li>organic 100% pure argan oil</li>
            <li>BUT UNTIL I FOUND Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil BY ECOCERT</li>
            <li>Thank God that I ran across Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil</li>
            <li>B004S2G4FG Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil 2oz (60 mL)]]</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase it because it is an organic, 100% pure argan oil</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s claiming it is pure organic argan oil</li>
            <li>The skin absorbs it very well and it looks smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li>The bottle is worth the money since I use significantly less argan oil than drugstore moisturizer, and it works much better.</li>
            <li>This argan oil is just like another main stream brand with a much higher price tag.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality oil.</li>
            <li>takes a little while to absorb, but when it does, my face feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been switching all of my beauty products over the last 6 months to pure, vegan, and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It is of a very high quality at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>This is the best oil i have found so far, forget the fake stuff, like the J. Moran oil.</li>
            <li>BIG, HUGE thanks to those who reviewed this becasue it has changed the look and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li>haha  </li>
            <li>then wash until much of it is out and condition.</li>
            <li>I have really curly and frizzy hair after i wash it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li>This really helps to minimize frizz from blow drying.</li>
            <li>One drop too much might make your hair look somewhat lifeless, unless your hair is extra-coarse.</li>
            <li>I use 2 times x 4 drops of this oil for my whole body before wiping with towel.</li>
            <li>It feels like nothing at all, but the skin is much softer.</li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t, it really works.</li>
            <li>well packaged and very moisturizing...</li>
            <li>this is the REAL DEAL</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>If you do feel greasy then I think you are applying too much and wasting the product.  </li>
            <li>It really is miraculous.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use as much anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must say that it has been working quite well -adding softness and smoothness to my hair, my hair looks healthy and appears to be stronger as the amount of hair that breaks off is minimal</li>
            <li>I also have a very oily face</li>
            <li>Really keeps your skin moisturized in colder weather</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li>I only need a drop or two to rub in my hands and then over my hair to make it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>this stuff really calmed and healed it faster than if I had not used it</li>
            <li>I use it along with (alternate it to see which I like best)  another more expensive oil I purchased prior and</li>
            <li>No smell and really absorbs easily.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Fast forward a couple of days</li>
            <li>I just started using it on my hair and it has really changed my hair.</li>
            <li>Will be placing an order again very soon.</li>
            <li>I know it sounds like a gimmick, oil in a bottle, what can argon oil really do for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>bought this in the winter because my skin was so much drier then and this has done the trick.</li>
            <li>I have never broken out in a rash or pimples using it</li>
            <li>I ordered this brand when I couldn&#x27;t get what I wanted at the Whole Foods nearby.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>The Josie Maran one is much</li>
            <li>I have used coconut oil before, but it didn&#x27;t feel very hydrating.</li>
            <li>This argan oil is very soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>I like the oil so much.</li>
            <li>oil is the real deal, people.</li>
            <li>This product really helps my face.</li>
            <li>It was delvered very promptly</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t do too much for me.</li>
            <li>Have my whole family using it now.</li>
            <li>Even this may be too much though.  </li>
            <li>but it really doesnt leave you feeling oily at all</li>
            <li>BUT 1.7 ounces of Josie Maran Argan Oil costs $48 and that is way too much for me.</li>
            <li>think that those who are claiming that this is oily/greasy are probably using too much.  </li>
            <li>go away that fast EVER.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This brand seems like the real deal I am stocking up.</li>
            <li>I was really worried that this Argan oil would make me break out.  </li>
            <li>I put a couple drops and rub all over my face and scalp before moisturizing and it really has made a difference in the appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product and think it makes my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>product is very concentrated</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve both noticed it making our hair much softer and shinier.</li>
            <li>Goes on light, no greasy facial appearance.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>So I ordered a bottle and over the course of a couple of weeks, it really has made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>This one is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>and when I applied to my hair it really makes it shiny.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>that I leave one about this Argon oil, which absolutely lives up to its reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my face at night and during the day, and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Cocoa butter is commonly used for the purpose, and argan is just as good.</li>
            <li>I used this stuff for a few weeks expecting to see some results, but no go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would honestly advise people to just eat this stuff.</li>
            <li>First, I live in Korea.</li>
            <li>It is light and quickly absorbed, where the other stuff seemed to hang around for a while.</li>
            <li>specially my face .. although i was so tired but this oil made my skin glows , bright and very smooth and tight !</li>
            <li>and it is just as good as the one I first bought in Morocco, the only difference is in the aroma which is a little stronger.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see all the magic things that some of the other reviewers claim this product is doing for them.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be using any other product. :)</li>
            <li>When I put it on, I use a lot more than what the other posters have been saying.  </li>
            <li>Now I think this oil might replace all these products, as it allows to achieve a better effect or at least the same, really saves time (and certainly money), and makes it easier and more compact to pack for travel.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal for a decent price</li>
            <li>Usually I apply the argan oil, followed by a light moisturizer and then a light liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>On the face I generally put a small amount of light moisturizer after a minute or so which helps to hydrate better.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so smooth and the effect lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>intend to keep purchasing this item as long as it&#x27;s available.  </li>
            <li>It was OK, but not worth the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really wanted something that&#x27;s most like the actual Argan Oil from Morocco (One that I&#x27;ve tried after family traveled there and came back with this miracle oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps cut down on fly-aways for sure, without adding any weight.</li>
            <li>It helps cut down on fly-aways for sure, without adding any weight.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>AND I live way up North in the frozen tundra!</li>
            <li>I found a new beauty product that really works.</li>
            <li>I did use it on my dry skin and it is fabulous for that.  </li>
            <li>So use more or less depending on your hair type.</li>
            <li>I have terribly dry hair and this oil has made it shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>At night, when I wash my make-up off, I lightly pat my skin dry.</li>
            <li>From what I read about argan oil, it is packed with antioxidants and the main vitamins used in skin care, so, it can also be used alone.</li>
            <li>I still order this product but mainly use it for my hair and feet.</li>
            <li>Absorbed fast acne is finally clearing up.</li>
            <li>but I use it mainly on my hair.</li>
            <li>but it is still a very good deal at less than half the price of Josie Maran for the same exact product.</li>
            <li>I actually use a lot on my hair right after washing, on top of my leave in conditioner and it does not leave my hair greasy like other oils do.  </li>
            <li>Because my hair is so fine, and so dry, when I blow dry and curl my hair, I can&#x27;t get out of the bathroom before my hair start swelling up, so I most often wore my hair natural, because it is naturally wavy or curly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As much as I rely on reviews, it&#x27;s only right</li>
            <li>highly recommended .</li>
            <li>no anti-aging cream has done the job at the 1/4 of the price I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It has really made my skin soft</li>
            <li>Still using this product but really like the results so far.  </li>
            <li>2 drops make my skin so soft and reduces fine lines and this dry patch I always get at the corner of my mouth in the winter.</li>
            <li>Was worried it might be too much for my skin, have combination skin, but no breakouts so far.</li>
            <li>I naturally have a problem with extremely dry and fine hair.</li>
            <li>I love Mogador Argan Oil and have benefitted from it for a few years now.</li>
            <li>I have recently started using natural oils as opposed to most of the commercial hair care products on the market.  </li>
            <li>If use everyday you&#x27;ll be able to see the result.</li>
            <li>When I use it I never expected that it really works a lot , but it works!</li>
            <li>And to be fair, my white mother was an olive-y German who aged well, as did her mother, so I&#x27;ve been genetically blessed.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better everyday with the oil.</li>
            <li>I love the way it melts into my skin and moisturizes without being oily or heavy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but considering how few drops need to be used and how many uses it has</li>
            <li>This product is a must for anyone looking to avoid the harsh chemicals and toxins which are in most lotions and creams these days.  </li>
            <li>My entire forehead was covered in zits, and I rarely breakout there.</li>
            <li>The consistency is thick, the oil is a nice amber color.</li>
            <li>The consistency is thick, the oil is a nice amber color.</li>
            <li>Next time I will read more critical reviews if there are any before purchasing something that generally has high ratings.</li>
            <li>It smooths easily over skin and comes in a dark glass bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li>or it will be too oily to be comfortable due to potency.  </li>
            <li>: I have curly hair, and this oil enabled me to style it in a new way.</li>
            <li>and I have my new argan oil.</li>
            <li>I used to live in Morocco and we would have it with breakfast as a dipping sauce for bread.</li>
            <li>and still buy new.</li>
            <li>This will be my new argan oil.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and lasts a very long time as you just need a couple of drops.</li>
            <li>I am so tired of being dependent on countless skin-hair-body care products that I am just happy when I can use one for all these purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read nothing but good things, the only negative thing I read about this oil was the smell.</li>
            <li>I really like the effect on my neck and chest, really smooths the skin there where it is just starting to &amp;#34;crinkle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My skin glows in a beautifully healthy way, and I&#x27;ve received quite a few compliments in the past few days about how great I look.</li>
            <li>I use this in my hair and on my face to make both very soft.</li>
            <li>It lighten my skin &amp; it&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I wake up with my face very soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and suffered from severe acne in college.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be healing it - and it makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>My face and neck feel very soft, too.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I also use this around my eyes and it has made a huge difference in my dark circles and my skin is tighter.  </li>
            <li>Even if my first impression fades after some time (I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week)</li>
            <li>My friend ordered a bottle and I got another for my 82 year old mother!</li>
            <li>Same exact everything except price.</li>
            <li>I had bought some other brand a while back, but this one is better.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and helps prevent breatkouts too!  </li>
            <li>Amazingly soft skin!</li>
            <li>and it is completely gone!</li>
            <li>it was COMPLETELY gone!</li>
            <li>It is 100% natural and it works quite well for everything I use it for!</li>
            <li>and other things I&#x27;ve used can break me out significantly in 2-3 days).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am going to purchase some for my 24 year old daughter!</li>
            <li>brand is exactly the same in quality, the affect on my skin and purity.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this so much, unfortunately a few days after using it my face broke out all over!</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t have the fancy packaging but it is exactly the same oil.</li>
            <li>a friend of mine brought from Morocco, and this one has exactly the same consistency and scent.</li>
            <li>Wow, wow, wow!</li>
            <li>but WOW WOW WOW!</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars as I have been using Mogadar Pure Argan Oil for only 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Will continue to use a 100% pure oil in the future for neck and chest and perhaps face....</li>
            <li>This is the second order of this Pure Argan Oil and</li>
            <li>I have bought Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil multiple times and will continue to do</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth, little blemishes are disappearing</li>
            <li>I put this stuff on my face at least twice a day and have really noticed a difference in the softness and appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>Even though the softening effect is very light, it remains for at least the whole day until the next shower.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to put oil on my face, being used to only buying products that are oil-free, but am am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I actually ended up ordering some for about 1/4 of the price on amazon (Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil ) and it works the exact same was except the josie maran brand has no smell at all, and the other kind I ordered has a very very slight smell (almost like coffee -</li>
            <li>It absorbs completely and quickly, unlike other oils.</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of dull skin, my skin slowly started getting better and better.  </li>
            <li>Its great for dry frizzy hair and mixing it up with any of your other daily beauty products makes such a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely going to keep buying this.</li>
            <li>Also helps to heal and  clear skin issues, blemishes, scratches.</li>
            <li>It also helped clear up my scalp.</li>
            <li>I now have Clear skin not even on scarand</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.i&#x27;m 75yrs old</li>
            <li>Everything I&#x27;ve tried with shampoos for color treated hair with dandruff and itchy scalp doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate the issues.  </li>
            <li>And, wow, what it does for my face, hair, and nails.  </li>
            <li>I am thinking of replacing the Clinique scrub with natural particles (jojba beads, crushed grapeseeds etc, available at brambleberry.com, and possibly amazon as well)</li>
            <li>Also, I like the fact that Mogador is not deodorized like Josie Maran, and is kept natural this way.</li>
            <li>its all natural and has cleared up my acne.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by its qualities.</li>
            <li>I mix it with carols daughters body cream (all natural).  </li>
            <li>This really, really does help not just the look, but overall health, of my skin and nails.</li>
            <li>This really, really does help not just the look, but overall health, of my skin and nails.</li>
            <li>I am a mature woman with wrinkles, sags, bags (you get the picture).  </li>
            <li>and I either mix a drop of argan oil with a drop of jojoba oil (0r i use either oil straight) as my facial treatment (night or day).  </li>
            <li>it has a soft glow.  </li>
            <li>Still using, but it&#x27;s early so I cannot comment on results.</li>
            <li>Too early for me to make a valid statement.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d try it as I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and given the price had nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>I also frequently apply this oil to my forehead as a moisturizer and have not had any issues with breaking out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I also put it on my legs before bed and they feel so soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive skin and this product</li>
            <li>I add it to my regular moisturizer and at night I use it straight to &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; treat.</li>
            <li>but so far I haven&#x27;t found it.</li>
            <li>I then started looking on Amazon for creams that would help my eczema on my arms and make my skin look alive.</li>
            <li>Arrived early.</li>
            <li>Also made my skin soft but would not solely recommend as a solution for seborrheic dermatitis sufferers like myself.  </li>
            <li>As far as value goes, I&#x27;ve never seen argan oil</li>
            <li>I have severely damaged hair from years of bleaching/flat ironing, and it has made my hair soft, shiny, and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mother is in her 50&#x27;s and has never been keen on putting things on her face that are not 100% natural.</li>
            <li>She really loves this product as she noticed it helped with the appearance of lines; especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Skin feels really soft and renewed after using it.</li>
            <li>After considerable amount of reading I decided to give argan oil a try.</li>
            <li>I am using this in combination with vit. C , so far they both work well together.</li>
            <li>I read in a magazine that professional make up artists use Argan oil when applying foundation.</li>
            <li>And there were some responses by the seller that struck me as defensive and that almost made me give more credence to these negative comments.  </li>
            <li>far as the smell...it smells like rotten nuts to me</li>
            <li>and it was soothing and soft on skin.</li>
            <li>my face feels soft all day.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, and it&#x27;s non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The seller contacted me soon after and quickly fixed my dropper issue.  </li>
            <li>The reason it doesn&#x27;t last for 2 or 3 days or more is because I sweat in my scalp heavily every night when I sleep.</li>
            <li>and its nice to know that the stuff i am putting on my skin doesnt have a bunch of crap in it :) might be too oily if you have oily skin?</li>
            <li>Many others have the argan oil mixed with other ingredients as a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; - but this oil is only Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I have only ever tried one other brand, and have similarly not responded in the beauty-breakthrough way most people describe for argan oil.</li>
            <li>Can be hard to find a true pure argan oil, but this one is.</li>
            <li>It is as good, if not better, than its much more expensive competitors, and it serves as my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel dry and since I live in AZ, my face could really use this oil.</li>
            <li>Not sure what to expect, first impression, a little watery but absorbed quickly into skin.</li>
            <li>I have also used this oil on my scars and noticed a significant improvement in appearance after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>They have some serious explaining to do to customers who can tell the&lt;br /&gt;difference from their brand and this one; cause I sure could, the moment I opened the bottles.</li>
            <li>I use just a few drops each morning and night after I clean my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be 50 in a couple months, and have slight sun damage on my face (darker spots), fine wrinkles, and rosacea on my upper arms.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and use more than the recommended few drops, however.</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t matter to me because I am looking for high quality moisturizing which this product definitely delivers.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this as a facial moisturiezer.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of natural home-made skin and hair treatments, but so far have mostly used them to complement the more expensive, professionally made skin and hair care products (usually from L&#x27;Occitane).</li>
            <li>This has really tamed my hair and made it much softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a better value for the money than most of the other &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; products that probably contain no more than a few drops!</li>
            <li>and it normally seems almost everything clogs my pores, if anything it helps the occasional hormonal breakout.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work pretty well on hair- definitely use sparingly though as it will weigh hair down and make it look oily if you use too much.</li>
            <li>(maybe that just reflects how dry my skin is right now as the winter is starting).  </li>
            <li>I have only been doing it for a few days and there is already a huge difference.</li>
            <li>My face used to get really dry fast no matter what lotion I used.</li>
            <li>If you have oily hair it may be too much for you, but for someone with dry hair it has been a life saver.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample of this product by a friend and it seemed like it really would help my overly dry hands.</li>
            <li>Very comparable to much more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>I recently have been slowly changing my routine of drastic changes with making my lifestyle as clean, green and healthy as possible, I wanted to find a product that I could use to help with my skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, therefore you should not put that much of it, but even that&#x27;s not really a thing, because you&#x27;re not supposed to put too much, and it comes with a dropper, so clearly this is not really an issue.</li>
            <li>Not sure, but possibly but not due to not using it the right way, as soon as it arrived.(shipping time was fast but who cares with a product like this)  </li>
            <li>and so I have very dry skin but also have very oily/acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s strangely evened out my complexion, making my T-zone less oily and my dry cheeks and nose-creases more moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I am 92 and it has improved my skin better than all other much costlier products I have used, people are shocked when they find out I am that age with such a clear and smooth complexion .</li>
            <li>clear fluid (yuck</li>
            <li>think I overestimate this product, having clear that all skin and hair have different ph, genetics and others.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li>My basic day creme, night cream and eye cream have always been professional.</li>
            <li>I am of African descent and have been wearing my hair in its natural state for about four years now.  </li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an all natural alternative to chemical laced moisturizers</li>
            <li>It will take pages to explain how soft my hair and skin feel after only 3 uses of this oil.</li>
            <li>As a 63 year old, it has also been helpful in plumping up the skin on my neck and upper chest.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how young she looks, as if she were in her twenties (we are mid thirties).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and it actually glows.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the product is good, for my skin and for my hair to, but nothing that a regular product bought from the traditional trade hasn&#x27;t done before at a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product, will save you $$ in the long run!</li>
            <li>I placed a bit more oil on my hands with a little less lotion and put it on my face.</li>
            <li>I prefer this to the Josie Maran and other argan oil products for hair and skin because it&#x27;s pure and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals or silicones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, not sure if I can tell the difference between other products that are cheaper...</li>
            <li>Use this, STAY OUT OF THE SUN (especially if you have fair skin), hydrate with at least 60 ounces of water daily, eat omega-3s and loads of organic green veggies, and you&#x27;ll be set.  </li>
            <li>I use with other products and don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very apprehensive to put &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on my face, but it has actually helped fade a few acne marks and has not caused any new outbreaks.</li>
            <li>I am tossing because of the smell and going back to my smaller old brand.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do half of the things the positive reviews say.  </li>
            <li>so I have new pimples, old dark spots and some scars.</li>
            <li>This may be different for everyone, just try it a few times till you get it right.</li>
            <li>I had been using a higher priced Argan oil, but thought I would look to see if I could find something similar for much less money.</li>
            <li>It is consistent and works the same as the previous bottle.</li>
            <li>and I normally have severely dry skin, especially during the winter).</li>
            <li>I chose this one due to the great reviews and how it is certified by ECOCERT and cold pressed.</li>
            <li>Instead of taking all the vitamins out there that&#x27;s not natural, use this natural argan oil.</li>
            <li>This is good and not as expensive as other brands.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cost prohibitive and this is exactly the same thing for half the price AND a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>have mature dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have really dry sensitive skin that was unbalanced for years.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do not need to wash my hands or rub off excess oil, because it completely disappears into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is lasting quite a long time, and I will buy another as soon as this one gets</li>
            <li>The first night, I mixed a few drops with some lotion and rubbed it on my arms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is a miracle product, but the fact that it hasn&#x27;t made me break out and is noticeably refining my skin definitely make it worth buying in my opinion.</li>
            <li>but not least: what made me buy this argan oil rather than any other</li>
            <li>the more expensive oil is thinner which I like, but this really helps on my neck and chest to hydrate and waking with less lines on my chest after side sleeping all night</li>
            <li>I use this on my fine, thin, highlighted hair at night to moisturize and wash it out in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 57 years old and have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>My fine lines have decreased, my skin tone has improved and I just look younger!  </li>
            <li>can certainly try to add a few drops of essential oil to the bottle of argan oil, according to desired effect (for example, lemon oil for whitening, neroli or lemongrass as astringent), but I prefer to keep the process simple, and just use it as is.</li>

            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;It is the most remarkable product I have ever used !</li>

            <li> Good quality product.  </li>
            <li> --I think it smells good.</li>

            <li> Good product , I used it for my face and hair .</li>
            <li> is a good quality.</li>
            <li> use it every night and it leaves skin feeling great, smells nice too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good oil, but not a mind-blowing oil like it was hyped up to be.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> sample I got was the josie maran brand, and I really really loved it</li>
            <li> Good brand .No  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend money on Josie Maran&#x27;s oil when this is just as good.</li>
            <li> This oil is good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> The product is what I anticipated, being good quality.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I was delighted and ordered it.</li>
            <li> it never looked good</li>
            <li> ..just loved it</li>
            <li> and it is an excellent chemical free makeup remover</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of good reports of Argan Oil, and wanted to try some for both my hair and my skin.</li>
            <li> but I was trusting a good friend who has been using this product and swears by it.  </li>
            <li> - the reviews were really good, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li> it is good -</li>
            <li> and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> No frizz, just beautiful curly ringlets with healthy shine...not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone seeking a healthy alternative to beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> I tried the Josie Maran argan oil and loved it, so I did some research and found that this one got good reviews on Amazon (and also at a much more affordable price!).</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic healthy and safe alternative to a moisturizer and this is great!</li>
            <li> My skin is moisturized &amp; happily soaking in more moisture with the hep of the Hyaluronic acid that I use in tandem with my Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Many creams disappear too soon, but this organic Argan oil is great.</li>
            <li> I have used on my hair and I am very pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li> I am about 1/8 through the bottle because I share with my kiddos, and I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Curly girls, the search is over for great looking, fuss free hair!  </li>
            <li> It leaves your face very smooth and radiant!</li>
            <li> After reading many great things about this product I decided to give it a try for myself.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t fabulous, but it&#x27;s authentic, and therefore, to me, it&#x27;s the best smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I immediately noticed wonderful moisturization, smooth skin, and have received many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> But make sure you use it sparingly!</li>
            <li> and I feel confident I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I do love what this does!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> I just love using this Organic Argan Oil for nourishing my skin!</li>

            <li> This is the first time I have used this oil and it is wonderful.  </li>

            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> Then wash off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I can&#x27;t use it every day on my skin because it becomes a bit too much, but a couple times a week is perfect.</li>
            <li> rose and neroli are also astringents).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shipping was lightning fast and the customer service is excellent.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit of experimenting to know how much works best for your body/face/hair</li>
            <li> This oil feels wonderful on my face-light but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I liked it</li>
            <li> Mogador is effective, and although I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, I want to prevent them and preserve.</li>
            <li> , it is nice the texture on my face when I applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Nice skin product.</li>
            <li> My argan is now oiled up nice</li>
            <li> The most noticeable to me is that my hair stays looking good all day.</li>
            <li> This is nice.</li>
            <li> but it does moisturizer nicely</li>
            <li> I bought this brand the first time and must say it is very good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a wonderful moisturizing oil, and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This product is a great for organic pure argan oil and the price is more than great.  </li>
            <li> Aragon oil great as always and enjoyed using it as it helps feeling my face smooth and radiant and recommending to all</li>
            <li> are the good reviews, most of which said that the product is authentic.</li>
            <li> and I am super happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful on hair, nails, acne scars so far!</li>
            <li> light, wonderful oil, no bad smell, love it for hair and skin</li>
            <li> Best of all, it has a rather strong, nutty odor, which I much prefer to deli meat!</li>
            <li> The best Argan oil I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> but so far I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> and this by far has worked the best!</li>
            <li> However, the two together make a good combination for a smooth and moisturized complexion without the greasy results you get with some oils.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Argan oil is supposed to have amazing antioxidant and possibly even antibacterial properties, in addition to being an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well, but is also very light -</li>
            <li> I think as far as argan oil goes, this is pretty great, and an incredible value.</li>
            <li> pure and great for smoothing my hair</li>
            <li> Regardless, I shall not go without my new beloved argan oil ever again!  </li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> I love it-</li>
            <li> This product is magic.</li>
            <li> Customer Service is TOP NOTCH - just like product.</li>
            <li> I am using now and love the product.  </li>
            <li> Okay, this product is wonderful for skin rejuvenation and such, and that&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
            <li> and I tell you, my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> but I love this stuff for moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping that it works in the summer when my skin is more oily.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> The quality is so much better than the one I had before and</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best quality 100% Argan oil available.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely top quality without the sticker shock :)</li>
            <li> The price is also descent compared to another brand I actually love but is quite pricey.  </li>
            <li> I did buy many Mogador Argan bottles  for  </li>
            <li> They even stopped putting those synthetic moisturizers/substances that cause more harm.</li>
            <li> My family and I love this product and we will keep purchasing it from Mogador Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it works best on damp skin--it not only locks moisture in, it also makes the oil easier to use.</li>
            <li> The texture on my neck and chest looks much better, too.</li>
            <li> Also, I love that the proceeds go to support the Berber women who make it.</li>

            <li> and, I have enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> Love argan oil</li>
            <li> and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;wasn&#x27;t impressed especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and many said this oil is just like Josie&#x27;s on QVC.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it probably helps with acne as well...</li>
            <li> I Love Argan oil</li>
            <li> The best part about it is the different uses of it.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine uses Argan oil from a famous distributor.  </li>
            <li> I discovered argan oil a year ago after reading many beauty blogs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those of you with oily/combination skin who are hesitant to put more oil on your face - this is the BEST facial moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> In fact, it provides the perfect canvas for  makeup application after you let it properly sink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of Argan oil.</li>
            <li> and it is works magically.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with the results on my face that  I apply it to my entire body now after my shower.</li>
            <li> I like the earthy scent and am very happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker than another brand that I tried, it seems to go on better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Just wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li> and it makes make-up go on much better.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for much more after reading all the rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, after my shower while my skin is still moist, I apply 2 more drops.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> It is dispensed by dropper, which is interesting.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I really love this oil and my daughter does also.</li>
            <li> would be going all the way to Morocco for some oil :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> However, it met my expectations and the price point was better than a lot of others out there.</li>
            <li> love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  </li>
            <li> i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I get more out of it that way than using it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I became acquainted with argan oil in a trip that I made to Morocco, where I bougth it.</li>
            <li> this bottle is 2 oz, when most are 1).</li>
            <li> I LOVE Argan oil, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff .</li>
            <li> But I love argan</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily, just healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Most days my face is au naturel, except for this</li>
            <li> It is a much better product for me than Josie Marin&#x27;s Argan oil.</li>
            <li> so this isn&#x27;t the most thorough review.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Very much satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I love how it moisturizes my skin and gives off this dewey glow.</li>
            <li> I really feel like i am doing something great for my skin when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Love this oil</li>
            <li> Mogador Organic Argan Oil can be used for many purposes.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> and I love the dropper</li>
            <li> and I love it already.</li>
            <li> I am going to reorder 3 more bottles for myself and my sister.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to do this in my 20s, but my skin looks better now (more even).  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> This is the most versatile product in my beauty product collection.  </li>
            <li> It is the most soothing moisturizer on the planet.  </li>
            <li> Love, love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So pleased to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I apply this to my face and neck daily and my skin has more elasticity and feels great!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the dropper bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is well priced compared to many that are available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it is lovely on my face, neck and hands.</li>
            <li> This is the best and most simple product for your skin -face, neck, body.</li>
            <li> For about 2 years I was a brand that cost more -than-twice this brand (because I didn&#x27;t think to look on Amazon).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love 😍 love 😍 it.....</li>
            <li> and I ALREADY love it..</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED A MANY OF PRODUCTS TO FIND SOMETHING TO MOISTURIZE MY HAIR</li>
            <li> It delivers the same (or perhaps better) results at a great price!!!</li>
            <li> Cannot ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> I ran out and wanted to buy more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did purchase</li>
            <li> This product is top of the line.</li>
            <li> Nine more words are required so here they are.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> That combination seems to work best - There was a definite dryness that this oil has diminished</li>
            <li> I originally discovered Josie Maran Argan Oil as a free sample at Sephora and I loved it.</li>
            <li> true thing, absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> For a face product on Amazon that amazing right there!  </li>
            <li> The oil is very light and absorbs into my face and neck very quickly leaving no feeling of oily residue.</li>
            <li> It is awesome all over the body, and just a couple drops go a long way.  </li>
            <li> My cuticles look pretty good too.</li>
            <li> But my sister who is real user said \\&quot;Best, hair&#x27;s shine is come back and its volume is good.</li>
            <li> It comes with a dropper top which makes it very clean and easy to get a couple of drops.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important that the product is authentic, because argan oil is very rare, and the cheaper versions can often be diluted.</li>
            <li> not so oily, it&#x27;s best for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I rarely recommend beauty products to anyone, as I don&#x27;t think most products are as effective as advertised.</li>
            <li> It takes just 4 drops per day, but honestly people ask me how I have such great skin.  </li>
            <li> Overall, good experience in ordering and good quality product.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent moisturizer and wrinkle minimizer for my face and is light enough to be used under makeup.</li>
            <li> Also, it has awesome antiseptic properties, so I use a liberal amount on a newly popped pimple instead of rubbing alcohol (but still wash the area with face face wash first).</li>
            <li> &quot; is very true.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my skin look and feel, so healthy and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my skin and hair for about ten days now, and it really is incredible.</li>
            <li> Its been a week since I have begun using argan oil, and I have to say this was the best 18.99 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> and I love how light weight it is</li>
            <li> I wake up with smooth, healthy looking</li>
            <li> All natural, great value and a much&lt;</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous and the customer service couldn&#x27;t have been better.  </li>
            <li> But most importantly:  the blotchiness on the side of my face and neck has gone away.  </li>
            <li> Mogador is just as good, but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that Mogador argan oil is Fair</li>
            <li> The natural color is great and my nails are so strong.  </li>
            <li> The price is right, as if you buy real cheap, well you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is nice and rich; it absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Put a quarter-sized amount on your fingertips and clean your face (works on even the most stubborn eye makeup too).</li>
            <li> the seller was very helpful and it was shipped super fast and packaged with very great care .</li>
            <li> Argan oil is great, it works better than the moisturizer I used to use, I can&#x27;t feel it on, and it improved my moderate acne.</li>
            <li> and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Does not make my face look greasy and easy to absorb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of over-the-counter as well as strong strong strong prescription medication (including</li>
            <li> I used to shell out big bucks for Josie Maran, which is also good, but this is just as effective at a lower price.  </li>
            <li> Overall this product is great and even has a natural odor which is great.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and I would highly recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> but I will break it down, excellent on hair, skin, nails.</li>
            <li> I am blessed with very good skin, not too dry or too oily and this product does not interfere in that balance.</li>
            <li> Specially my mom was complaining 3 wks ago that a good chunk (unusual amount) of her hair was falling.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are diminishing as well.</li>
            <li> but I still have fine lines.</li>
            <li> This oil is much better than the higher priced brand - it seems thicker to me and moisturizes better.</li>
            <li> It has diminished fine lines and has tighten my skin.</li>
            <li> I have seen an improvement in fine lines on my face</li>
            <li> Great natural, true product.</li>
            <li> also love the mildly roasted fragrance of this oil.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and hydrates my skin like nothing else!</li>
            <li> product is a MUST have, I am a loyal customer for life!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing from this seller again, delivery was quick and I am pleased with the size of the jar.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and the bottle reached safely.  </li>
            <li> I know this stuff says it is organic and pure argan oil which is why I was so happy with the purchase because it was pretty cheap</li>
            <li> Love the product very much !</li>
            <li> Very good product love it ,use it every day in my face and  for my hair it has done a spectacular difference before was dry now is soft</li>
            <li> The product is fine, I like the light sesame fragrance and the oil</li>
            <li> The seller was very quick to resend replacement product when it came to their attention that the original shipment had been damaged.</li>
            <li> Even from day 1 I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This argan oil, in addition to 2.0% retinol cream from NCN have been extremely effective in helping my skin heal much faster than before.</li>
            <li> The ordering process was convenient and secure.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s important to moisturize and soften them to heal.</li>
            <li> Will probably order it again if it continues to agree with my skin which is smooth and hydrated after using this product.</li>
            <li> I would not suggest using this on your face everyday, 2 times a week for me at night works best.  </li>
            <li> Great for daily use!</li>
            <li> I started a regimen of argan oil two years ago, each morning around my eyes and mouth, and it has genuinely made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I had never heard of argan oil until I tried a free sample out of a magazine.</li>
            <li> My face is so smooth and it cleared up any breakout I had.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face primarily, and the flakiness is almost gone</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really makes my skin feel amazing-</li>
            <li> I am so happy I finally found this.</li>
            <li> this cheap (remember,</li>
            <li> I have never found anything (cheap or expensive)that could do what this does.  </li>
            <li> and i use cheap shampoo/conditioner).  </li>
            <li> The results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting this stuff on my face twice a day for about 3 weeks now, and the results have been fantastic.</li>
            <li> Does not clog pores and makes face smooth.</li>
            <li> Clears and moisturizes acne-prone skin, makes hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> so this bottle will probably last 5-6 months, great value.</li>
            <li> Now, my face feels smooth every time I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> This product actually makes my skin feel great</li>
            <li> I also apply a drop around my eyes and on my neck to keep the skin smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, the delivery time was GREAT</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it, my face is already healing and started to look better after a couple times of using the Josie Maran Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this purchase, I learned that you get what you pay for - if the stuff is cheap</li>
            <li> Great skin moisturizer for evenings, but can be used during the day depending on the individual&#x27;s desire.</li>
            <li> After dipping my toe in the water, so to speak, I began to lightly coat my face every night.  </li>
            <li> hair is nice and soft and my face is blemish free!  </li>
            <li> Being a Moroccan, Argan oil has always been an essential element in my life; therefore, I do know the  characteristics of a good quality and authentic Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair and it does a good job of helping to keep it soft.  </li>
            <li> The reason I purchased this product because it contained no harsh chemicals and all the good reviews it received.  </li>
            <li> The appearance of the fine lines on my face have diminished significantly.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a high quality Argan oil but don&#x27;t want to pay the extra 50 bucks for a designer name, this is the best value for your dollar.  </li>
            <li> If goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I strongly believe that Mogador Argan oil is pure and authentic.</li>
            <li> I use this oil to heal my dry chapped hands and after two weeks I have experienced a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> This oil is light and is absorbed very quickly, leaving the skin moist and supple not greasy.  </li>
            <li> i just love this oil so much!</li>
            <li> She has lovely skin, so I thought I would try this one first instead of paying $60+ for the advertising.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - bought my first bottle in Morocco and have been hooked ever since.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited about the effects I bought some Organic Argan oil  shampoo and masque</li>
            <li> (it reminds me of toasted nuts :)), but it didn&#x27;t bother me the first time I used it - now I don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.</li>
            <li> It is great all year long.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant decrease in the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m excited to see what my skin will look like in  1 month.  </li>
            <li> But first of all, she lovely this argan oil because it doesn&#x27;t have any smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves a fabulous glow on my skin, has a lovely somewhat nutty, natural scent that is very light and dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> The oil tames frizzy hair and works great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is light, non-greasy, absorbs quickly, and is odorless.</li>
            <li> Most worked great for a few weeks</li>
            <li> To be honest, I enjoy the smell of natural products.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Love, love, my 16 year old daughter used on a break out on her chin before bed.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry nails too.</li>
            <li> The oil goes on light and absorbs rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> So far I love it!</li>
            <li> and WOW I am in love!</li>
            <li> , I know it can most certainly replace a night cream.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is organic, PURE Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for an authentic, pure, Moroccan Argan oil for years and years now, trying everything and anything in the market</li>
            <li> great product, arrived just as i expected.</li>
            <li> this at amazon.i have always been pleased with my purchases from amazon and the fast service</li>
            <li> : I have a combination oily, acne-prone skin, and what I read about the astringent effect of argan oil is true in my case.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair and accidentally run out of hair conditioner, a drop of this oil can work as a detangler (although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good replacement for hair conditioner on a regular basis).</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I had fairly severe acne, and still encounter hormonal breakouts once and a while.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> If you want an effective natural product, I&#x27;d recommend this.  </li>
            <li> It really helps my skin look more hydrated</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product for a good solid run before reviewing it.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this produce and give a full review once I have completed the bottle.</li>
            <li> Since then I have tried Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil and am more convinced that Mogador is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This stuff is potent, so you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li> and I found that it was true</li>
            <li> No bad reaction, and my face is softer than ever.  </li>
            <li> Light and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> True argan oil isn&#x27;t cheap, so when you find a cheap bottle claiming it is 100% pure, question it.</li>
            <li> I had heard many good things about this oil, I had been using a much more expensive oil and this is actually better.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped to me quickly and I received it within 3 days.</li>
            <li> it soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs quickly, as others say and leaves no oil residue at all.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use it on damp skin, there&#x27;s a bit of a tacky or sticky sensation that quickly goes away (as does the aroma).</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how quickly my skin absorbs it, though.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use it on damp skin, there&#x27;s a bit of a tacky or sticky sensation that quickly goes away (as does the aroma).</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how quickly my skin absorbs it, though.</li>
            <li> It has made a tremendous difference on my feet.</li>
            <li> I came back to amazon to buy more, thinking I would do a bit more searching and review reading this time.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly - leaving you skin feeling like a newborn.  </li>
            <li> I have been suffering with mild acne.</li>
            <li> I received this product rather quickly, and it was packaged well.  </li>
            <li> As for the seller, the product was sent quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> but most of them had so many different ingredients in them that I didn&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> It also arrived really quickly and well packed.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair super soft&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not irritate the face and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The oil does absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth and soft my skin looks and feels after I apply it.  </li>
            <li> While I love this I did find another brand that had twice the oil for only $10 more that works just as well.</li>
            <li> but when you get it right it is so worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this product for my face and my hair, my hair gives you high gloss and does not feel oily, I recommend</li>
            <li> Oil will absorb some of the chemicals in the plastic containers, so this product is of high quality and safe.</li>
            <li> It has the slightly nutty scent (I&#x27;m asian and it kind of reminds me of a very light sesame oil...sort of), glides on my skin really smoothly, and has been really amazing to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Argain oil has an exquisite ability to absorb into skin completely (or nearly completely depending on the \\&quot;mood\\&quot; of my skin and application) that I have not seen in other oils.</li>
            <li> Low odor -- no adverse reactions or breakouts (my skin is very sensitive) -- cruelty free -- nice packaging (both appearance and usability)!</li>
            <li> I first received the oil, I was super excited.</li>
            <li> because I only use 4 drops a day, it is certified organic, it has simplified my beauty routine as I only use a gentle cleanser and the oil with great results, and it&#x27;s great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (I work in an aromatherapy shop, so being able to detect oils that have gone off is becoming second nature to me).</li>
            <li> The dropper makes it easy to keep from overpouring too much and the bottle is tinted just as it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!!  </li>
            <li> The product seems to work as well as others that were more expensive but had a more pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> So I started putting this oil on damp hair after I wash it and it makes my hair so shiny and reduces frizz and makes it wavy or less curly which I LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use as much, it spreads more easily, and sinks in better.</li>
            <li> this is a fine oil - it will get through your fingers, I apply directly on forehead - cheeks - neck -arms and smooth it in.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen any remarkable skin changes or improvements in particular but my skin looks youthful and I look about 10 years younger than I am (48).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone needing to give special attention to problematic skin ailments!</li>
            <li> So, I read about rubbing oils into the scalp - tried olive oil warmed in a bowl - worked great, but too messy.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast and the oil was package securely against breakage.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my bath, and my skin feels so great.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth and my hair is very silk.</li>
            <li> Husband likes it as well helps calm his eczema .</li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Wow, I love it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Gross as that sounds, it is so effective, I just have to put it out there.&lt;br /&gt;Getting</li>
            <li> it makes my skin really fresh and</li>
            <li> Basically the same idea as in method 2, but instead of using it in the shower, moist your face with rose (or neroli or mineral) water, and then apply a drop or two of the oil.</li>
            <li> I LOVE how the product works, my skin is soft and no breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this after comparing this product to a name brand product from Sephora and decided that this was worth the risk to save some $.  </li>
            <li> There must be some kind of antiseptic quality similar to Walnut oil that helps heal outbreaks, rashes and cuts.</li>
            <li> I can honestly tell a difference in my skin in a short 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li> Ok, if you are beginning to get winkles, this is the simple answer to smooth them out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and love it so far.</li>
            <li> It is a splurge well worth it.</li>
            <li> Glad it works for some, but if you have really sensitive skin as I do, I&#x27;d avoid this product.</li>
            <li> I do wait about 15 minutes for the oil to be absorbed before applying my make-up.  </li>
            <li> Easily absorbed by skin.  </li>
            <li> this oil n said \\&quot; ok let&#x27;s try this again sigh \\&quot; and guess what it makes my skin soft ..</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about argan oil is that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> My bottle also did not have a distinct smell in the bottle or on the hair.</li>
            <li> Now my skin is so soft, more even, and I seem to have fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li> For me, it is worth the price just for that.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes without greasiness, all the oil is absorbed.</li>
            <li> I like the way it is absorbed into the skin and makeup goes on so well over</li>
            <li> but so far I am pleased with the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> Economical and meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> that my 2 cents for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> 2 months I have been using this product, My hair looks so healthy, it seems like my split ends disappear, and it looks like it has been professionally done.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth it for me.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to use something more natural.</li>
            <li> Pure Argan Oil was not something I was familiar with, but I purchased it becasue of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried countless anti-aging products to retain my youthful skin, and I have only been using this product for a week and have noticed remarkable difference in fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It absorbs pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> This is as good, if not better, than the Josie Maran brand at a much more reasonable price point.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and efficient and I could not recommend this product more highly.</li>
            <li> This brand&#x27;s argan oil was everything I wanted: high quality and effective for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it right away</li>
            <li> it literally just flows right out of the dropper onto your hand or wherever.</li>
            <li> I use almost 10 and it soaks right in</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair right after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I went out right away and purchased the Josie Maran oil</li>
            <li> so I have a strong interest in effects of chemicals (natural or synthetic) in our body, and I tend to trust natural compounds more.</li>
            <li> It has not only healed my inflammation but it has taken away the red, scaly look on my skin and has made it beautiful and</li>
            <li> Has a slightly nutty scent, but pleasant and not noticeable at all when I put it on.</li>
            <li> This is very important for those who begin their day in a yoga or some other physical activity class - no gross feeling when you sweat, as it is always the case even with the best body lotions.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used argan oil (after hearing all the rants and raves about it, i had to try it), and it was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The first time I used about 10 drops, but it made my hair just a tad bit oily so 5-7 is right for me.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and argan oil makes an amazing face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This oil should probably be great for African hair, especially for those who heat-style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased argan oil from another vendor here, and, while it worked fairly well, (I used it on practically anywhere</li>
            <li> It works quickly and really does everything it&#x27;s set out to do.</li>
            <li> I do not usually review products but this one is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Why mess with a good thing, right?!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> By Sunday night, the skin has healed and pealed off, leaving new smooth red skin (it does help that I&#x27;m getting 8 hrs of sleep as this is my summer break before grad school start, and I have a healthy diet).</li>
            <li> I break out very easily and suffer from super oily skin and periods/patches of really unbearably dry flaky red/pink skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil by Ecocert, 2oz size for the use of 2 bottle worth if you will.</li>
            <li> At first I was surprised &amp; happy that it lacked the stinkiness of other Argan oils.  </li>
            <li> Not the cheapest, but definitely amongst the best, and accurate to the fact that it&#x27;s organic with the evidence of a roasted, nutty,&lt;br /&gt;smell, unlike others that are, obviously mixed with other oils, like the ELMA &amp; SANA brand, calling it 100% organic when you&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and the benefits for your skin are wonderful.  </li>
            <li> my skin gets super dry and this stuff lasts long and is a great deal.</li>
            <li> The cost per unit of measure is a bit higher, but unlike many of the competing offers this one seems high purity, doesn&#x27;t have any odor,</li>
            <li> the product is ok, not really nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 days ONLY now , and i noticed a huge difference on my skin !</li>
            <li> Have been using argan oil for about 8 mo.started with a higher priced one,but found this one on line and decided to try it.love</li>
            <li> Argan oil is the ultimate for me as it has so many beneficial compounds.</li>
            <li> I spread it on my hands first so the oil don&#x27;t aggregate in one spot on my hair and make that area too oily.</li>
            <li> Rinse a facecloth in hot water, squeeze it out and put over your face until it cools.</li>
            <li> I thought that L&#x27;Occitane Immortelle mask does miracles when worn overnight, but I actually like the effect of argan oil better -</li>
            <li> This is how I think I&#x27;ll be using it in summer when it gets hot and humid.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought Argan Oil</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, my skin drank it up like no one&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li> The skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Lord willing, we will NOT experience another situation without our (my husband &amp; I) Argan oil</li>
            <li> I ordered this and when it came I decided to try it on my skin, well it really works on wrinkles!</li>
            <li> 81 years old and face is smooth.</li>
            <li> Someone with thick hair and/or curls could probably use this any time with great results.  </li>
            <li> DID make me break out just at first.  </li>
            <li> fantastic on my body; can&#x27;t use on my face as it caused acne, but I am prone to adult acne from almost anything; will buy it again</li>
            <li> I started to use the Argan Oil from the first day i received it.</li>
            <li> Love the product, and I actually recommend it to my sister.</li>
            <li> Both argan and coconut oil go on greaseless, but argan oil left my skin feeling more nourished and softer.</li>
            <li> I recently gave up smoking after 40 years and someone told me about Argon oil to heal my skin on my face after so many years of smoking.</li>
            <li> so soft and smooth (</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Argon Oil</li>
            <li> Mogador argan oil has changed my skin, turned it into baby smooth and replenished the natural skin moisture.  </li>
            <li> I used it to the last drop and then could not find any place where to buy some more.</li>
            <li> So I sought out a cheaper alternative and after researching found this product which when I first bought this product I paid $18.84 for it.</li>
            <li> so I have to use another 3 because my hands absorb it, but it makes my hair silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Not even aware that it is on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely getting more.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> And its very affordable!</li>
            <li> , after using this product consistently every day since I received it, I see the results.  </li>
            <li> I will write more later..</li>
            <li> From the moment I first used this, I could almost feel the moisture penetrating my skin.</li>
            <li> (Before most people heard of Amazon actually.)  </li>
            <li> Yet, this is the first review I have taken the time to write.  </li>
            <li> most likely it isn&#x27;t -</li>
            <li> It is the first moisturizer zi apply, let it absorb, and apply a serum</li>
            <li> The only difference during the day is that I wear spf on top.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll most likely be purchasing another bottle once I&#x27;ve used this one up.</li>
            <li> In the mean time this oil is a great addition to my skincare regime.</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin look and feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> ; is not easy, but yes, its a really good stuff.</li>
            <li> I read through many reviews and settled on this brand in particular - it did take me a few weeks to see results, but now, after about 2 to 3 weeks, my skin is softer, more supple and the winter dullness has faded.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using any other moisturizers on my face, this is amazing.</li>
            <li> Combine with mineral water spray (Evian at Sephora, or some other) or rose or neroli water.</li>
            <li> Mogador produces a very high quality product and deals directly with the producer in Morocco, which I think is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable and very high quality.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker than many others, it&#x27;s not mixed with anything synthetic, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was using a more expensive brand of Argan and wanted to see if it was just as good.</li>
            <li> Most of all it has provided so much smoothness in my skin, especially around my eyes!</li>
            <li> The quality of this brand was just as good as the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I would love a beauty product that really reduces fine lines, improves firmness, tones, improves pore size and uneven skin with noticeable results</li>
            <li> It will quickly dissipate, and is actually a sign of it being the true stuff from Morocco.</li>
            <li> This positive about this product is that it is non oily after application</li>
            <li> have invented several other uses of it for myself that I would be happy to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot give a full report on how it has worked for my stretch marks so far, but I pray it does well on them.</li>
            <li> I am focused on using natural products on my skin and this product is superior to other non-natural products I have used for years.</li>
            <li> It does not clog my pores, I find it to be fairly fragrance free, with a very subtle nutty scent if any.</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t smell sweet or perfumey--and it shouldn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t smell sweet or perfumey--and it shouldn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> It is not oily and absorbs quickly and completely and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and softens my skin so well, which probably appeases my own oil glands, so it becomes much less shiny.</li>
            <li> You can also use it to get rid of dry skin and blemishes, condition cuticles, as much more.</li>
            <li> Makes my skins and hair super soft.  </li>
            <li> I use about 8 drops for medium length hair, so I expect this will last me a good long time.</li>
            <li> though if I had truly understood how strong it was back then, I probably would have chosen not to).  </li>
            <li> but I think it isn&#x27;t true argan oil, at least the kind you should be putting on your face.  </li>
            <li> This time I deciden to change the brand and buoght Mogador Certified Organic Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I have been reading that pure argan oil can be purchased cheaper than Josie&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> that was quite large as my mosquito bites are generally large and weep</li>
            <li> I have heard about Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil for over 3 years now.</li>
            <li> Mogador&#x27;s argan oil certainly fits the bill!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I started using the pure argan oil, those problems went away.</li>
            <li> My face seemed to have large craters and it was lowering my self esteem.</li>
            <li> I also wanted one that was pure oil.</li>
            <li> had used another oil that contained Argan Oil and that is when I decided to buy pure Argan Oil</li>
            <li> However, this is pure argan oil</li>
            <li> organic 100% pure argan oil</li>
            <li> BUT UNTIL I FOUND Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil BY ECOCERT</li>
            <li> Thank God that I ran across Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil</li>
            <li> B004S2G4FG Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil 2oz (60 mL)]]</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase it because it is an organic, 100% pure argan oil</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s claiming it is pure organic argan oil</li>
            <li> The skin absorbs it very well and it looks smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li> The bottle is worth the money since I use significantly less argan oil than drugstore moisturizer, and it works much better.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is just like another main stream brand with a much higher price tag.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality oil.</li>
            <li> takes a little while to absorb, but when it does, my face feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been switching all of my beauty products over the last 6 months to pure, vegan, and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> It is of a very high quality at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> This is the best oil i have found so far, forget the fake stuff, like the J. Moran oil.</li>
            <li> BIG, HUGE thanks to those who reviewed this becasue it has changed the look and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li> haha  </li>
            <li> then wash until much of it is out and condition.</li>
            <li> I have really curly and frizzy hair after i wash it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> This really helps to minimize frizz from blow drying.</li>
            <li> One drop too much might make your hair look somewhat lifeless, unless your hair is extra-coarse.</li>
            <li> I use 2 times x 4 drops of this oil for my whole body before wiping with towel.</li>
            <li> It feels like nothing at all, but the skin is much softer.</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t, it really works.</li>
            <li> well packaged and very moisturizing...</li>
            <li> this is the REAL DEAL</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> If you do feel greasy then I think you are applying too much and wasting the product.  </li>
            <li> It really is miraculous.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use as much anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must say that it has been working quite well -adding softness and smoothness to my hair, my hair looks healthy and appears to be stronger as the amount of hair that breaks off is minimal</li>
            <li> I also have a very oily face</li>
            <li> Really keeps your skin moisturized in colder weather</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li> I only need a drop or two to rub in my hands and then over my hair to make it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> this stuff really calmed and healed it faster than if I had not used it</li>
            <li> I use it along with (alternate it to see which I like best)  another more expensive oil I purchased prior and</li>
            <li> No smell and really absorbs easily.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Fast forward a couple of days</li>
            <li> I just started using it on my hair and it has really changed my hair.</li>
            <li> Will be placing an order again very soon.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds like a gimmick, oil in a bottle, what can argon oil really do for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> bought this in the winter because my skin was so much drier then and this has done the trick.</li>
            <li> I have never broken out in a rash or pimples using it</li>
            <li> I ordered this brand when I couldn&#x27;t get what I wanted at the Whole Foods nearby.</li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> The Josie Maran one is much</li>
            <li> I have used coconut oil before, but it didn&#x27;t feel very hydrating.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is very soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the oil so much.</li>
            <li> oil is the real deal, people.</li>
            <li> This product really helps my face.</li>
            <li> It was delvered very promptly</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t do too much for me.</li>
            <li> Have my whole family using it now.</li>
            <li> Even this may be too much though.  </li>
            <li> but it really doesnt leave you feeling oily at all</li>
            <li> BUT 1.7 ounces of Josie Maran Argan Oil costs $48 and that is way too much for me.</li>
            <li> think that those who are claiming that this is oily/greasy are probably using too much.  </li>
            <li> go away that fast EVER.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This brand seems like the real deal I am stocking up.</li>
            <li> I was really worried that this Argan oil would make me break out.  </li>
            <li> I put a couple drops and rub all over my face and scalp before moisturizing and it really has made a difference in the appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product and think it makes my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> product is very concentrated</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve both noticed it making our hair much softer and shinier.</li>
            <li> Goes on light, no greasy facial appearance.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> So I ordered a bottle and over the course of a couple of weeks, it really has made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> This one is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> and when I applied to my hair it really makes it shiny.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> that I leave one about this Argon oil, which absolutely lives up to its reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face at night and during the day, and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Cocoa butter is commonly used for the purpose, and argan is just as good.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for a few weeks expecting to see some results, but no go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would honestly advise people to just eat this stuff.</li>
            <li> First, I live in Korea.</li>
            <li> It is light and quickly absorbed, where the other stuff seemed to hang around for a while.</li>
            <li> specially my face .. although i was so tired but this oil made my skin glows , bright and very smooth and tight !</li>
            <li> and it is just as good as the one I first bought in Morocco, the only difference is in the aroma which is a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see all the magic things that some of the other reviewers claim this product is doing for them.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using any other product. :)</li>
            <li> When I put it on, I use a lot more than what the other posters have been saying.  </li>
            <li> Now I think this oil might replace all these products, as it allows to achieve a better effect or at least the same, really saves time (and certainly money), and makes it easier and more compact to pack for travel.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal for a decent price</li>
            <li> Usually I apply the argan oil, followed by a light moisturizer and then a light liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> On the face I generally put a small amount of light moisturizer after a minute or so which helps to hydrate better.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin so smooth and the effect lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> intend to keep purchasing this item as long as it&#x27;s available.  </li>
            <li> It was OK, but not worth the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really wanted something that&#x27;s most like the actual Argan Oil from Morocco (One that I&#x27;ve tried after family traveled there and came back with this miracle oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps cut down on fly-aways for sure, without adding any weight.</li>
            <li> It helps cut down on fly-aways for sure, without adding any weight.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> AND I live way up North in the frozen tundra!</li>
            <li> I found a new beauty product that really works.</li>
            <li> I did use it on my dry skin and it is fabulous for that.  </li>
            <li> So use more or less depending on your hair type.</li>
            <li> I have terribly dry hair and this oil has made it shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> At night, when I wash my make-up off, I lightly pat my skin dry.</li>
            <li> From what I read about argan oil, it is packed with antioxidants and the main vitamins used in skin care, so, it can also be used alone.</li>
            <li> I still order this product but mainly use it for my hair and feet.</li>
            <li> Absorbed fast acne is finally clearing up.</li>
            <li> but I use it mainly on my hair.</li>
            <li> but it is still a very good deal at less than half the price of Josie Maran for the same exact product.</li>
            <li> I actually use a lot on my hair right after washing, on top of my leave in conditioner and it does not leave my hair greasy like other oils do.  </li>
            <li> Because my hair is so fine, and so dry, when I blow dry and curl my hair, I can&#x27;t get out of the bathroom before my hair start swelling up, so I most often wore my hair natural, because it is naturally wavy or curly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As much as I rely on reviews, it&#x27;s only right</li>
            <li> highly recommended .</li>
            <li> no anti-aging cream has done the job at the 1/4 of the price I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It has really made my skin soft</li>
            <li> Still using this product but really like the results so far.  </li>
            <li> 2 drops make my skin so soft and reduces fine lines and this dry patch I always get at the corner of my mouth in the winter.</li>
            <li> Was worried it might be too much for my skin, have combination skin, but no breakouts so far.</li>
            <li> I naturally have a problem with extremely dry and fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love Mogador Argan Oil and have benefitted from it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I have recently started using natural oils as opposed to most of the commercial hair care products on the market.  </li>
            <li> If use everyday you&#x27;ll be able to see the result.</li>
            <li> When I use it I never expected that it really works a lot , but it works!</li>
            <li> And to be fair, my white mother was an olive-y German who aged well, as did her mother, so I&#x27;ve been genetically blessed.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better everyday with the oil.</li>
            <li> I love the way it melts into my skin and moisturizes without being oily or heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but considering how few drops need to be used and how many uses it has</li>
            <li> This product is a must for anyone looking to avoid the harsh chemicals and toxins which are in most lotions and creams these days.  </li>
            <li> My entire forehead was covered in zits, and I rarely breakout there.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick, the oil is a nice amber color.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick, the oil is a nice amber color.</li>
            <li> Next time I will read more critical reviews if there are any before purchasing something that generally has high ratings.</li>
            <li> It smooths easily over skin and comes in a dark glass bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li> or it will be too oily to be comfortable due to potency.  </li>
            <li> : I have curly hair, and this oil enabled me to style it in a new way.</li>
            <li> and I have my new argan oil.</li>
            <li> I used to live in Morocco and we would have it with breakfast as a dipping sauce for bread.</li>
            <li> and still buy new.</li>
            <li> This will be my new argan oil.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and lasts a very long time as you just need a couple of drops.</li>
            <li> I am so tired of being dependent on countless skin-hair-body care products that I am just happy when I can use one for all these purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read nothing but good things, the only negative thing I read about this oil was the smell.</li>
            <li> I really like the effect on my neck and chest, really smooths the skin there where it is just starting to &amp;#34;crinkle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My skin glows in a beautifully healthy way, and I&#x27;ve received quite a few compliments in the past few days about how great I look.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair and on my face to make both very soft.</li>
            <li> It lighten my skin &amp; it&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I wake up with my face very soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and suffered from severe acne in college.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be healing it - and it makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> My face and neck feel very soft, too.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I also use this around my eyes and it has made a huge difference in my dark circles and my skin is tighter.  </li>
            <li> Even if my first impression fades after some time (I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week)</li>
            <li> My friend ordered a bottle and I got another for my 82 year old mother!</li>
            <li> Same exact everything except price.</li>
            <li> I had bought some other brand a while back, but this one is better.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and helps prevent breatkouts too!  </li>
            <li> Amazingly soft skin!</li>
            <li> and it is completely gone!</li>
            <li> it was COMPLETELY gone!</li>
            <li> It is 100% natural and it works quite well for everything I use it for!</li>
            <li> and other things I&#x27;ve used can break me out significantly in 2-3 days).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am going to purchase some for my 24 year old daughter!</li>
            <li> brand is exactly the same in quality, the affect on my skin and purity.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this so much, unfortunately a few days after using it my face broke out all over!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have the fancy packaging but it is exactly the same oil.</li>
            <li> a friend of mine brought from Morocco, and this one has exactly the same consistency and scent.</li>
            <li> Wow, wow, wow!</li>
            <li> but WOW WOW WOW!</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars as I have been using Mogadar Pure Argan Oil for only 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use a 100% pure oil in the future for neck and chest and perhaps face....</li>
            <li> This is the second order of this Pure Argan Oil and</li>
            <li> I have bought Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil multiple times and will continue to do</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth, little blemishes are disappearing</li>
            <li> I put this stuff on my face at least twice a day and have really noticed a difference in the softness and appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> Even though the softening effect is very light, it remains for at least the whole day until the next shower.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to put oil on my face, being used to only buying products that are oil-free, but am am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I actually ended up ordering some for about 1/4 of the price on amazon (Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil ) and it works the exact same was except the josie maran brand has no smell at all, and the other kind I ordered has a very very slight smell (almost like coffee -</li>
            <li> It absorbs completely and quickly, unlike other oils.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of dull skin, my skin slowly started getting better and better.  </li>
            <li> Its great for dry frizzy hair and mixing it up with any of your other daily beauty products makes such a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely going to keep buying this.</li>
            <li> Also helps to heal and  clear skin issues, blemishes, scratches.</li>
            <li> It also helped clear up my scalp.</li>
            <li> I now have Clear skin not even on scarand</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great.i&#x27;m 75yrs old</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve tried with shampoos for color treated hair with dandruff and itchy scalp doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate the issues.  </li>
            <li> And, wow, what it does for my face, hair, and nails.  </li>
            <li> I am thinking of replacing the Clinique scrub with natural particles (jojba beads, crushed grapeseeds etc, available at brambleberry.com, and possibly amazon as well)</li>
            <li> Also, I like the fact that Mogador is not deodorized like Josie Maran, and is kept natural this way.</li>
            <li> its all natural and has cleared up my acne.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by its qualities.</li>
            <li> I mix it with carols daughters body cream (all natural).  </li>
            <li> This really, really does help not just the look, but overall health, of my skin and nails.</li>
            <li> This really, really does help not just the look, but overall health, of my skin and nails.</li>
            <li> I am a mature woman with wrinkles, sags, bags (you get the picture).  </li>
            <li> and I either mix a drop of argan oil with a drop of jojoba oil (0r i use either oil straight) as my facial treatment (night or day).  </li>
            <li> it has a soft glow.  </li>
            <li> Still using, but it&#x27;s early so I cannot comment on results.</li>
            <li> Too early for me to make a valid statement.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try it as I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and given the price had nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> I also frequently apply this oil to my forehead as a moisturizer and have not had any issues with breaking out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I also put it on my legs before bed and they feel so soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin and this product</li>
            <li> I add it to my regular moisturizer and at night I use it straight to &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; treat.</li>
            <li> but so far I haven&#x27;t found it.</li>
            <li> I then started looking on Amazon for creams that would help my eczema on my arms and make my skin look alive.</li>
            <li> Arrived early.</li>
            <li> Also made my skin soft but would not solely recommend as a solution for seborrheic dermatitis sufferers like myself.  </li>
            <li> As far as value goes, I&#x27;ve never seen argan oil</li>
            <li> I have severely damaged hair from years of bleaching/flat ironing, and it has made my hair soft, shiny, and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mother is in her 50&#x27;s and has never been keen on putting things on her face that are not 100% natural.</li>
            <li> She really loves this product as she noticed it helped with the appearance of lines; especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Skin feels really soft and renewed after using it.</li>
            <li> After considerable amount of reading I decided to give argan oil a try.</li>
            <li> I am using this in combination with vit. C , so far they both work well together.</li>
            <li> I read in a magazine that professional make up artists use Argan oil when applying foundation.</li>
            <li> And there were some responses by the seller that struck me as defensive and that almost made me give more credence to these negative comments.  </li>
            <li> far as the smell...it smells like rotten nuts to me</li>
            <li> and it was soothing and soft on skin.</li>
            <li> my face feels soft all day.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft, and it&#x27;s non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The seller contacted me soon after and quickly fixed my dropper issue.  </li>
            <li> The reason it doesn&#x27;t last for 2 or 3 days or more is because I sweat in my scalp heavily every night when I sleep.</li>
            <li> and its nice to know that the stuff i am putting on my skin doesnt have a bunch of crap in it :) might be too oily if you have oily skin?</li>
            <li> Many others have the argan oil mixed with other ingredients as a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; - but this oil is only Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I have only ever tried one other brand, and have similarly not responded in the beauty-breakthrough way most people describe for argan oil.</li>
            <li> Can be hard to find a true pure argan oil, but this one is.</li>
            <li> It is as good, if not better, than its much more expensive competitors, and it serves as my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel dry and since I live in AZ, my face could really use this oil.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to expect, first impression, a little watery but absorbed quickly into skin.</li>
            <li> I have also used this oil on my scars and noticed a significant improvement in appearance after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> They have some serious explaining to do to customers who can tell the&lt;br /&gt;difference from their brand and this one; cause I sure could, the moment I opened the bottles.</li>
            <li> I use just a few drops each morning and night after I clean my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be 50 in a couple months, and have slight sun damage on my face (darker spots), fine wrinkles, and rosacea on my upper arms.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and use more than the recommended few drops, however.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t matter to me because I am looking for high quality moisturizing which this product definitely delivers.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this as a facial moisturiezer.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of natural home-made skin and hair treatments, but so far have mostly used them to complement the more expensive, professionally made skin and hair care products (usually from L&#x27;Occitane).</li>
            <li> This has really tamed my hair and made it much softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a better value for the money than most of the other &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; products that probably contain no more than a few drops!</li>
            <li> and it normally seems almost everything clogs my pores, if anything it helps the occasional hormonal breakout.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work pretty well on hair- definitely use sparingly though as it will weigh hair down and make it look oily if you use too much.</li>
            <li> (maybe that just reflects how dry my skin is right now as the winter is starting).  </li>
            <li> I have only been doing it for a few days and there is already a huge difference.</li>
            <li> My face used to get really dry fast no matter what lotion I used.</li>
            <li> If you have oily hair it may be too much for you, but for someone with dry hair it has been a life saver.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this product by a friend and it seemed like it really would help my overly dry hands.</li>
            <li> Very comparable to much more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> I recently have been slowly changing my routine of drastic changes with making my lifestyle as clean, green and healthy as possible, I wanted to find a product that I could use to help with my skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , therefore you should not put that much of it, but even that&#x27;s not really a thing, because you&#x27;re not supposed to put too much, and it comes with a dropper, so clearly this is not really an issue.</li>
            <li> Not sure, but possibly but not due to not using it the right way, as soon as it arrived.(shipping time was fast but who cares with a product like this)  </li>
            <li> and so I have very dry skin but also have very oily/acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s strangely evened out my complexion, making my T-zone less oily and my dry cheeks and nose-creases more moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I am 92 and it has improved my skin better than all other much costlier products I have used, people are shocked when they find out I am that age with such a clear and smooth complexion .</li>
            <li> clear fluid (yuck</li>
            <li> think I overestimate this product, having clear that all skin and hair have different ph, genetics and others.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li> My basic day creme, night cream and eye cream have always been professional.</li>
            <li> I am of African descent and have been wearing my hair in its natural state for about four years now.  </li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an all natural alternative to chemical laced moisturizers</li>
            <li> It will take pages to explain how soft my hair and skin feel after only 3 uses of this oil.</li>
            <li> As a 63 year old, it has also been helpful in plumping up the skin on my neck and upper chest.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how young she looks, as if she were in her twenties (we are mid thirties).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and it actually glows.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the product is good, for my skin and for my hair to, but nothing that a regular product bought from the traditional trade hasn&#x27;t done before at a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product, will save you $$ in the long run!</li>
            <li> I placed a bit more oil on my hands with a little less lotion and put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the Josie Maran and other argan oil products for hair and skin because it&#x27;s pure and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals or silicones.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not sure if I can tell the difference between other products that are cheaper...</li>
            <li> Use this, STAY OUT OF THE SUN (especially if you have fair skin), hydrate with at least 60 ounces of water daily, eat omega-3s and loads of organic green veggies, and you&#x27;ll be set.  </li>
            <li> I use with other products and don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very apprehensive to put &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on my face, but it has actually helped fade a few acne marks and has not caused any new outbreaks.</li>
            <li> I am tossing because of the smell and going back to my smaller old brand.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do half of the things the positive reviews say.  </li>
            <li> so I have new pimples, old dark spots and some scars.</li>
            <li> This may be different for everyone, just try it a few times till you get it right.</li>
            <li> I had been using a higher priced Argan oil, but thought I would look to see if I could find something similar for much less money.</li>
            <li> It is consistent and works the same as the previous bottle.</li>
            <li> and I normally have severely dry skin, especially during the winter).</li>
            <li> I chose this one due to the great reviews and how it is certified by ECOCERT and cold pressed.</li>
            <li> Instead of taking all the vitamins out there that&#x27;s not natural, use this natural argan oil.</li>
            <li> This is good and not as expensive as other brands.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s cost prohibitive and this is exactly the same thing for half the price AND a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> have mature dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry sensitive skin that was unbalanced for years.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do not need to wash my hands or rub off excess oil, because it completely disappears into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is lasting quite a long time, and I will buy another as soon as this one gets</li>
            <li> The first night, I mixed a few drops with some lotion and rubbed it on my arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a miracle product, but the fact that it hasn&#x27;t made me break out and is noticeably refining my skin definitely make it worth buying in my opinion.</li>
            <li> but not least: what made me buy this argan oil rather than any other</li>
            <li> the more expensive oil is thinner which I like, but this really helps on my neck and chest to hydrate and waking with less lines on my chest after side sleeping all night</li>
            <li> I use this on my fine, thin, highlighted hair at night to moisturize and wash it out in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57 years old and have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My fine lines have decreased, my skin tone has improved and I just look younger!  </li>
            <li> can certainly try to add a few drops of essential oil to the bottle of argan oil, according to desired effect (for example, lemon oil for whitening, neroli or lemongrass as astringent), but I prefer to keep the process simple, and just use it as is.</li>
            <li> I only needed 3 droppers full on my entire head of very thick, middle of back length hair.  </li>
            <li> and that little bottle goes a long way because you dont need much.</li>
            <li> Use it undiluted (i.e., on dry skin), and then a few minutes later wipe your face gently with a a cotton disk soaked in alcohol-containig toner (I use Clinique 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin got back to normal after a few weeks of NOT using this product.</li>
            <li> I expected something highly moisturizing for the area around my eyes, but other than making me look greasy, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I am using very little foundation now thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> : use argan oil instead of your regular eye cream, but allow 3-5 minutes to absorb (probably not necessary for people with dry skin).</li>
            <li> I have a dry skin problem likely related to the fact I am living in an area where the water is supplied from a desalination plant and it exacerbates skin oil loss.</li>
            <li> I have pretty wonky skin, dry/oily combination, prone to break outs and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> I spent the last 15 years working my way through a number of different moisturizer products with various results.  </li>
            <li> Highlights: long lasting product</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s still going to last a long time, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a drop makes it lie flat.</li>
            <li> With this, just use tiny amounts..it will go a long way.</li>
            <li> Since this bottle will last a long time, I figure it&#x27;s an affordable way to pamper yourself and look healthier, too.</li>
            <li> As reference, I have shoulder length, straight, thick, normal black hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and have only had very minor breakouts since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I had oily skin as my facial skin is quite dry.  </li>
            <li> I also use a tiny bit on my face for a dry patch that doesn&#x27;t seem to go away during the winter, and it got rid of it.</li>
            <li> It has actually healed a dry flakey patch on the side on my nose that I have had for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42, half-white/half-black combination skin...and the old adage about \\&quot;black don&#x27;t crack\\</li>
            <li> I use this daily to help with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> so I use only three drops; I put a drop on three fingertips, rub the fingers on both hands together, run my fingers through my hair, then dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this Argan Oil last week and it came a day earlier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Some comments have indicated a mild organic smell, but I have not experienced this in either bottle.</li>
            <li> Some say it&#x27;s from excessive oils being produced by the scalp, others say it&#x27;s really from dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> only thing that I would say is problematic with it is that it&#x27;s not very large for the price</li>
            <li> I use it for everything, from my nails to moisturize the cuticle, to make my hair shine after i low dry it, to using it as a moisturizer at night on my face!</li>
            <li> Better than any other expensive products - keeps skin supple and diminishes lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I only need a few drops twice a day and my skin looks soft and glowing, and I don&#x27;t get dry patches throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Just a little of the Mogador Argan Oil goes a long way to making my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I recently went from a dark brown to blonde hair color and wanted something that would keep my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use a henna/indigo combo on my long hair to condition and color it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m still waiting to see what the long term effects are</li>
            <li> And does wonders for minor scars.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is the only product that diminishes my wrinkles and moisturizes my skin, also giving it a glow - not much is needed</li>
            <li> It goes a long way</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> You really do not use a lot, specifically on the face, I only use about three pin-point worths combined with my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this one after thinking about it for a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly &amp; a few drops of the oil does wonders.</li>
            <li> I have not been using the product long enought to know if it does everything it claims to do</li>
            <li> I will probably use this product for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> It did leave a strange feel to the hair</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled better, although it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell bad!</li>
            <li> but when I found out that the larger bottle was super expensive, I decided to look for another option.</li>
            <li> I prefer not to use it if I let my hair dry naturally on that day, because it makes curls somewhat too tame -</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned different ways to use this.  </li>
            <li> It does smell a little unusual, but that disappears after a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Because I am using so little at a time, this 2.1oz bottle will last me for a very long time - so the value is definitely there for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it is a tiny bit more expensive than a few other brands, I trust that it is 100% argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this for my very long hair that is turning gray.  </li>
            <li> Not when I consider all the products I was using before for my dry, itchy skin that this one product has replaced.  </li>
            <li> my face is so dry and</li>
            <li> For now it leaves my skin a bit dry on those spots that tend to be drier, but in summer it should be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for almost two months, and all it did to my face was make it dry, flaky, and made my forehead breakout.</li>
            <li> I had a dry flaky patch on my forehead for 6 weeks and could not moisturize it away.  </li>
            <li> It took about 3 weeks for the dry patch to go away.</li>
            <li> that was at all dry, my face, my hair, stretch marks on my belly, anywhere,)</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry skin.</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t had dry skin at all during wintertime.</li>
            <li> sometimes my hands are really dry</li>
            <li> Helps my face stay moisturizer instead of so dry it gets flakey.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> I even use it on my face when it feels dry</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to have dry skin, and use this oil every day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to help my dry skin keep moist without it being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and body to help with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I only need a few drops to cover my entire face.  </li>
            <li> and I do think I am noticing a reduction in pore size even though my pores were not real large??</li>
            <li> No sign of a single zit, and my pores seem to have shrunk.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day for my hands, or cuticles, or the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it really is pure argon oil, smells a little funky....</li>
            <li> I would not stop using this product due to smell the benefits far outweigh a few seconds of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not sure how my sensitive skin would react to an oil</li>
            <li> After the first few days, my skin started looking really dull, but I kept using it.  </li>
            <li> my face.argan oil cleared my skin in less than a weeks time,it&#x27;s the only  thing I use now</li>
            <li> So many uses for this product -- elbows, knees, dark spots, chicken skin, eyes, lips, hair and cuticles.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount for your entire neck/face.</li>
            <li> Incredibly enough my breakouts have cleared up and my face is much less oily.</li>
            <li> and sure enough I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> I only use about a half teaspoon once in the morning and once in the evening after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I use a generous amount to treat it and it only looks slightly greasy.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about the quality because the price is so low, but after comparing it to the much more expensive Josie Moran argan oil from Sephora, I found that this is identical, if not better.  </li>
            <li> This particular brand has a slight odor which I am not pleased to have in the product.</li>
            <li> left feedback about the dropper coming in damaged and about the slightly rancid smell.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I also put 1 drop, on 2 of my fingers and rub them together with the same 2 fingers on the other hand to apply a concentrated version on my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I only used a little and it made my hair so oily.  </li>
            <li> I still use a little bit of my regular hairstyling product.</li>
            <li> Rub a little on my hair - especially the ends to reduce split ends.  </li>
            <li> Also, I noticed the tone of my skin started to look off, and I had little red pumps that started to develop on my cheeks and chin.  </li>
            <li> And a little goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> As my bottle is nearing empty, I think I will buy from Mogador again.</li>
            <li> If anything it is helping my wrinkles because I actually moisturize my face everyday since it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film and make me break out.</li>
            <li> Use a combination of 1 and 2 - apply when your face is still wet, and then remove excess with toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it will probably last forever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days</li>
            <li> found that argon oil was  the miraculously product that helped diminished the rough patches of skin on my body.</li>
            <li> I deal with bitter winds and dryness a lot.</li>
            <li> I would recommend giving this a try if you are curious about Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I am no different, but in my case the Aran oil was a waste of  money.  </li>
            <li> rub a couple drops in my hair while it is still wet</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days...</li>
            <li> After shower, a few drops on my palms, and then spread on the hair, especially the ends.</li>
            <li> I also spent a lot of time in the sun one day, and got a sun burn on my chest.</li>
            <li> This is money well spent.</li>
            <li> so I only need to use a few drops</li>
            <li> HOWEVER the smell only lasts a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I use only a few drops on my face and neck, then rub the leftover oil on my hands.</li>
            <li> I tries it al from proactive Clearasil etc.</li>
            <li> I wet my hair and applied the Organic Argon Oil.</li>
            <li> Just like with my hair, I wet my face 1st, then drop a couple of drops on the palm of my hand a rub my hands together, then I apply it to my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have bought plain extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, but it&#x27;s not strong and can be masked by combining it with a drop or two of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Other reviews of argan oil have mentioned an odor, but the very slight smell that is in the bottle isn&#x27;t enough to change the smell of your shampoo, nor can I smell it on my face.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with argan oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I use it on my face and in my hair.</li>
            <li> The product is quite concentrated so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I use about three drops a night (a little goes a long way) and I put it in the palm of my hand, then use the other hand to spread the oil.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays this way until I wash it again a day or two later with very little upkeep.</li>
            <li> Anyway there are other uses for it.  </li>
            <li> I have used Josie Maran Argan Oil in the past and I compared the two literally with both bottles in front of me and the only difference</li>
            <li> I thought at first that this product would be too expensive to use.  </li>
            <li> Also, I use coconut oil on my hair for deep conditioning once a week, so am not sure if the Argan oil is adding anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my hair needs it because of the other things I use on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In other words, it doesn&#x27;t smell like synthetic cosmetic products do.</li>

            <li> recently got a small sample of multi - use argan oil at sephora, and now I am hooked.</li>
            <li> I was led to mogador through reviews on other argan oil distributors and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> but I have tried using other products and the wrinkles return</li>
            <li> I use it with my other products and it does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and hair and other parts of my body.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products but tried is one because it came in a 2 oz size.</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t seen any changes on the other things it mentions it helps like acne wrinkles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker than other argan oils I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> and it is giving me the moisture that I have not gotten from other products.</li>
            <li> My hair is ridiculously shiny from the henna, so I&#x27;m not sure if this really adds anything.</li>
            <li> My hair is ridiculously shiny from the henna, so I&#x27;m not sure if this really adds anything.</li>
            <li> Normally, whenever I put an artificial lotion on my dry skin (especially during winters), my skin starts itching.</li>
            <li> and I have very few wrinkles.really appreciate this product and the moderate price.bought</li>
            <li> It makes me suspicious that it&#x27;s not completely pure, or that it&#x27;s been watered down somewhere along the way.</li>
            <li> those cheap oils don&#x27;t really glide, but leave a nasty residue afterwards, and salt/sugar scratch</li>
            <li> Apply it on wet face at the end of the shower, then towel-dry slightly; use blotting paper to remove excess oil if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I plan to use hair dryer, I rub a drop of argan oil in my palms when they are wet, and then apply on wet hair after I have rinsed the conditioner, put a towel on my hair for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> However, a few weeks later, it developed a faint smell, as expected.  </li>
            <li> It does remind me slightly of sesame oil as some other reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just been recently henna-ed also, so it&#x27;s hard to say the effect this has.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every expensive product and nothing has ever really worked.  </li>
            <li> Dark spots on my forehead and cheeks from sun damage are fading, as are the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have had dark spots on my face for years and now 98% gone.  </li>
            <li> and it absolutely did not cause any breakouts!I have tried all the expensive brands (La Mer, Arcona, etc.)</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t plan on too, since the bottle is small and I have long hair</li>
            <li> As an added benefit, I found that it does indeed reduce the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I prefer to read the negative (1 or 2 star reviews especially) to see what people don&#x27;t like about a product.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise, after doing this for 2 weeks, my neighbor and her daughter told me that my dark circles had lighten up tremendously!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>

            <li> It was so watered down that you don&#x27;t even need the dropper for the oil to</li>
            <li> I was counting down the days to receive it.</li>
            <li> thank you for such an unbelievably miracle of nature!</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes has tightened as well, and my dark under eye circles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually less oily now, and my skin has a glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s replaced about half a dozen items in my arsenal.</li>
            <li> The scent disappears within a couple of minutes (less than 5 minutes) after applying it to the skin.    </li>
            <li> It has a slight smell like olive oil which dissipates rapidly</li>
            <li> It does have a rather odd smell that could be off-setting to some users.</li>
            <li> Since I started this mixture I find that my face is much less shiny</li>
            <li> And I do believe it is giving me a slight glow.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny, less stringy, straighter, and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> As is typical, it does have a slight aroma - - which is not offensive, but if you are unfamiliar with Argon oil, may take some getting accustomed to.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil helps for black head and acne.</li>
            <li> There is a slight odor, which goes away and is no problem.</li>
            <li> I must say that I agree with others about the temporary odd, nutty smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year and still have half the bottle.</li>
            <li> I had previously used bio-oil but found out it had mineral oil</li>
            <li> I only used a very small quantity, but found it a little too greasy for hair use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As someone with combination skin, I can assure you that this sinks into your skin after a few minutes and leaves your skin hydrated from the inside out; it does not leave your face oily!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed as the reviews have made this sound like the wonder oil of the decade.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy curly hair (think Andie mcdowell).  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel so tight and crinkly anymore.  </li>
            <li> And these weren&#x27;t normal pimples, they were painful, deep, cyst-like pimples</li>
            <li> It keeps my face moisturized without making me break out, which all the other creams I used in the past did.</li>
            <li> is Josie&#x27;s has a little fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil on my hair for 3 weeks and my hair stopped falling little by little.</li>
            <li> Just massage a little bit into the spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It smells a little like sesame oil, a little like walnut oil.</li>
            <li> It smells a little like sesame oil, a little like walnut oil.</li>
            <li> On skin leaves you feeling a little oily as well.</li>
            <li> Drop a little in the palm of your hands, rub together and pat or rub on your skin -</li>
            <li> You just need a little bit on your hands, and massage it in your skin.  </li>
            <li> leaving a little bit of water on, and apply 2 drops.  </li>
            <li> a little on a cotton pad</li>
            <li> (as opposed to split ends every 4 weeks), and my hair seems healthier and grows a little faster.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t quite soak into the skin as I was hoping, and I noticed little change to my complexion.</li>
            <li> All I need is a little eye liner and chap stick.  </li>
            <li> Well, since using this oil for the past 4 days, I have had  minimal shine!</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE - After using this product for a little while now I broke out all over my face and in places</li>
            <li> mix a few drops in my daytime moisturizer (makes your face a little greasy looking if used by itself.)&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li> But after a few months of using this, I bought it for my mom and sister too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For daytime I have a few options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then wash again, but this time add a few drops of argan oil in soap lather.</li>
            <li> I also add a few drops of it into a non-oily body scrub (mine is Clinique) and use as a foot scrub.</li>
            <li> After using (a drop or two on face) for a few weeks it made my skin look older,wrinkles,dullness, sagging and breakout.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months and it has drastically improved my skin elasticity, eliminated wrinkles, and has helped to even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> A few drops each on my legs, arms, stomach, chest.  </li>
            <li> I have used this in my hair a few times also and it controls the friz in the summer heat.  </li>
            <li> face: after I wash my face, while the skin is still damp, I rub on a few drops of oil  and let it sink in before I use my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nothing goes to waste - I rub any remainder into my hands.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought the really expensive version just for hair, and was not impressed really at all.</li>
            <li> The odor goes away in a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> I also put a few drops around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I saw no changes in my skin except irritation after using a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Not too greasy if you use few drops</li>
            <li> A few drops a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few places for Argan oil</li>
            <li> after using this oil for just a few weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops in with my night cream, after cleansing and exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got dried out dyed hair, I use 3 drops before blowdrying and 3 drops after.</li>
            <li> I also put a few drops on the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> She let me try some of hers for a few days.</li>
            <li> There are a few one-star and two-star ratings that made me worry.  </li>
            <li> I received my oil a few days ago and can already see differences in my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> I also use a few drops in my hair (in place of frizz-ease AND heat protectant), and my husband has been trying it out in place of his beard conditioner.</li>
            <li> Then I dried it with the blow dryer, and curled it with the electric curling irons.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that goes past my shoulders</li>
            <li> a complaint I have noticed about other brands.</li>
            <li> and it prevents peeling when I go a little overboard.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about Argan oil and have stayed away from it while the whole world was raving about it.</li>
            <li> They also explained that the smell is from the raw Argan pressed nuts.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when buying this product, having had many bad experiences with finding a moisturizer that I was not allergic to.</li>
            <li> a little (not a word you want to use describing your skin!).</li>
            <li> purchased a small bottle of Josie Maran’s argan oil and Mogador’s is comparable, if not better, at half the price!</li>
            <li> It has very little odor.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Although it might seem expensive, a little truly goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You can even tap a small drop into your foundation before putting it on.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about these anti-wrinkle benefits everyone is talking about</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for the past 25 years.  </li>
            <li> I had a small pimple outbreak on my chin, and this stuff cleared it up in a day.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t usually have acne).  </li>
            <li> I put a small bit on my face at night and in the morning.</li>
            <li> I used this oil for several weeks and unfortunately discovered it caused my skin to break out.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I&#x27;m not sure how this product acts alone.  </li>
            <li> Result, not sure yet.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I no longer wake up with a slick oily face.  </li>
            <li> I usually use some type of oil on my face and hair so I was looking forward to trying the Argan oil.</li>
            <li> the face I use a drop of argAn oil and small Shea Butter daytime and night argAn oil and treetea oil.</li>
            <li> and my skin has been getting drier and duller looking over the past number of years.  </li>
            <li> I found this brand of argon oil to be a bit heavier than another brand that I have purchased used in the past.</li>
            <li> I use 3 drops on my hair (my hair is thin &amp; shoulder length) when its damp and its gives it shine without weighing it down</li>
            <li> Just rub it in (not too hard) all over affected areas, wrap hair in towel</li>
            <li> and I found out the hard way.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and this oil just made it worse!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> br /&gt;*I also have been using it on my lips lately and my lips are no longer chapped</li>
            <li> negative reaction with her skin as well</li>
            <li> It is so thick.  </li>
            <li> I initially reported an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a last resort before purchasing the very expensive Rodin face oil</li>
            <li> but it was a little too expensive to start using.</li>
            <li> Not good for hair.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m in my late 60s!</li>
            <li> It took me at least 3 months so be patient!</li>
            <li> It is a tough combination to get control over</li>
            <li> In fact, I was just carded a few days ago!!!  </li>
            <li> I was confused from conflicting info.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out at all (</li>
            <li> I usually have terribly oily skin where I am shinning within an hour and am constantly blotting my skin.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed the dramatic changes I hoped for in my face</li>
            <li> I have used other brands, this one is very poor, it smells bad and the bottle leaks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have terrible skin before using this, but I did have some discoloration from old acne.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m addicted to this routine now, because if I don&#x27;t use argan oil and retinol cream, my skin is drier and feel horrible the next morning.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even feel like oil in a weird way...</li>
            <li> Expensive?  </li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s superquick to apply, which I can&#x27;t fail to appreciate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Who I chose was random.</li>
            <li> I know that is weird) to it.</li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical about using oil on my skin because I&#x27;m prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as soon as I tried it</li>
            <li> Really not impressed.</li>
            <li> Seemed weird at fist to be putting on oil on my face...</li>
            <li> teenagers and children have (weird description, but that&#x27;s what it makes me think of).</li>
            <li> I had been using 100%&#x27;Argan Oil by Josie Maran, but it was 3x as expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> , I know it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> I am sad</li>
            <li> The smell is also faint and does not linger on the skin.  </li>
            <li> My friend who&#x27;ve been using the Josie Maran Argan Oil didn&#x27;t think anything wrong with the smell of the Mogador Argan Oil</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by other BS Argan oil products out there that are seriously pathetic.  </li>
            <li> There is no fragrance added for those concerned with artificial scents.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid I would have a problem with the scent, but I could not smell anything.</li>
            <li> Will buy again - can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!</li>
            <li> it see no difference in this product and the pricier one.argan oil cleared my face from a bad reaction I had from a combination of medication and skin creams that had  badly,almost a burned effect on</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad on my arms as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I applied after washing my face and it didn&#x27;t feel too oily or smell bad like some people have mentioned.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if it supposed to have this smell or is bad.</li>
            <li> This was bad situation.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of this item.  </li>
            <li> Mine is damaged and looks like crap</li>
            <li> , THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE!</li>
            <li> smelled horrible.</li>
            <li> Except you are not paying an outrageous amount of money like you do with hers.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product restored my fragile, peeling fingernails in six weeks.  Just rub it into cuticles and the results are amazing.  My nails look so good, I don&#x27;t bother with polish anymore.  The natural color is great and my nails are so strong.  The argan oil is also wonderful for skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair.  It is so thick.  Not good for hair.  The fake stuff is better.  I only used a little and it made my hair so oily.  I was blow drying my hair with it and it must have gotten on the mirror.  I can&#x27;t get the smudge out of it.  I have cleaned them with windex 3 times.  haha  what a joke.  Anyway there are other uses for it.  I guess I will try it on my skin.  I did use it on my dry skin and it is fabulous for that.  Wow, I love it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see all the magic things that some of the other reviewers claim this product is doing for them. It keeps my face moisturized without making me break out, which all the other creams I used in the past did. For that reason alone, I may buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. It feels great on my skin and sometimes I run my fingers through my curly hair after patting my face with the oil. It absorbs quickly and lasts a very long time as you just need a couple of drops. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen any remarkable skin changes or improvements in particular but my skin looks youthful and I look about 10 years younger than I am (48). I would love a beauty product that really reduces fine lines, improves firmness, tones, improves pore size and uneven skin with noticeable results but I am still looking. In the mean time this oil is a great addition to my skincare regime.</li>
            <li> Have been using argan oil for about 8 mo.started with a higher priced one,but found this one on line and decided to try it.love it see no difference in this product and the pricier one.argan oil cleared my face from a bad reaction I had from a combination of medication and skin creams that had  badly,almost a burned effect on my face.argan oil cleared my skin in less than a weeks time,it&#x27;s the only  thing I use now and it&#x27;s great.i&#x27;m 75yrs old and my skin looks great and I have very few wrinkles.really appreciate this product and the moderate price.bought this at amazon.i have always been pleased with my purchases from amazon and the fast service</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I have purchased and it definitely lives up to expectations. It is of a very high quality at a very affordable price. I have used Josie Maran Argan Oil in the past and I compared the two literally with both bottles in front of me and the only difference is Josie&#x27;s has a little fragrance. That doesn&#x27;t matter to me because I am looking for high quality moisturizing which this product definitely delivers.</li>
            <li> Better than any other expensive products - keeps skin supple and diminishes lines and wrinkles.  Will buy again - can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!</li>
            <li> I rarely recommend beauty products to anyone, as I don&#x27;t think most products are as effective as advertised. But after a few months of using this, I bought it for my mom and sister too.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to scratch my skin when I&#x27;m stressed (which is all the time as I just finished undergraduate and going on to graduate school for another 6 years) so I have new pimples, old dark spots and some scars. This argan oil, in addition to 2.0% retinol cream from NCN have been extremely effective in helping my skin heal much faster than before. As an example, I popped a pimple last Thursday night. By Sunday night, the skin has healed and pealed off, leaving new smooth red skin (it does help that I&#x27;m getting 8 hrs of sleep as this is my summer break before grad school start, and I have a healthy diet). A&lt;br /&gt;I used this oil twice daily. Three drops in the morning (with Missha BB cream if I go out), and three drops at night with NCN 2.0% retinol. I know I&#x27;m addicted to this routine now, because if I don&#x27;t use argan oil and retinol cream, my skin is drier and feel horrible the next morning. As my bottle is nearing empty, I think I will buy from Mogador again. Although it is a tiny bit more expensive than a few other brands, I trust that it is 100% argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;I studied biochemistry in undergraduate so I have a strong interest in effects of chemicals (natural or synthetic) in our body, and I tend to trust natural compounds more. Argan oil is the ultimate for me as it has so many beneficial compounds. Also, it has awesome antiseptic properties, so I use a liberal amount on a newly popped pimple instead of rubbing alcohol (but still wash the area with face face wash first). Gross as that sounds, it is so effective, I just have to put it out there.&lt;br /&gt;Getting back to its uses. For hair, I put two drops on my hands, spread it all over my hands then run them though my damp hair. I spread it on my hands first so the oil don&#x27;t aggregate in one spot on my hair and make that area too oily. As reference, I have shoulder length, straight, thick, normal black hair. So use more or less depending on your hair type. A little goes a long way with argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;Oh it&#x27;s also good with burns.</li>
            <li> Have only had this product for a week. It is too soon to say if it lives up to its promises.&lt;br /&gt;Will return with a review when I have an opinion.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> I love Mogador Argan Oil and have benefitted from it for a few years now. It makes the most wonderful face wash, even if you have oily skin. Put a quarter-sized amount on your fingertips and clean your face (works on even the most stubborn eye makeup too). Rinse a facecloth in hot water, squeeze it out and put over your face until it cools. Do this twice. Then wash off with warm water. I like to add another drop or two to my damp skin and put it all over my face, eyes, neck and decolette. I&#x27;m actually less oily now, and my skin has a glow. You can even tap a small drop into your foundation before putting it on. So many uses for this product -- elbows, knees, dark spots, chicken skin, eyes, lips, hair and cuticles. It&#x27;s replaced about half a dozen items in my arsenal.</li>
            <li> I use this on just about everything. My face, my nails, my skin and my hair. I love it- takes a little while to absorb, but when it does, my face feels amazing. And at night, I put it on extra thick and wake up with my face glowing.</li>
            <li> it would probably work wonders if I remembered to put it on regularly</li>
            <li> This product is magic. It turned my hair and skin to silk. The ordering process was convenient and secure. The product was shipped to me quickly and I received it within 3 days. Customer Service is TOP NOTCH - just like product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used argan oil (after hearing all the rants and raves about it, i had to try it), and it was definitely worth the money. The oil has a scent that is reminiscent of olives - i can see why some people think it is off, however, the clarity of the scent confirms that its not. (I work in an aromatherapy shop, so being able to detect oils that have gone off is becoming second nature to me). The scent disappears within a couple of minutes (less than 5 minutes) after applying it to the skin.    It comes with a dropper top which makes it very clean and easy to get a couple of drops. I use 3 drops on my hair (my hair is thin &amp; shoulder length) when its damp and its gives it shine without weighing it down (i&#x27;ve got wimpy hair so that&#x27;s something i adore in a product). My skin tends to be a bit oily so I mix the argan with a drop or two of orange essential oil before putting in on my face. I&#x27;ve found that I can&#x27;t use it every day on my skin because it becomes a bit too much, but a couple times a week is perfect.</li>
            <li> I was confused from conflicting info. on the net about dandruff and itchy scalp. Some say it&#x27;s from excessive oils being produced by the scalp, others say it&#x27;s really from dry scalp.  I didn&#x27;t think I had oily skin as my facial skin is quite dry.  Everything I&#x27;ve tried with shampoos for color treated hair with dandruff and itchy scalp doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate the issues.  So, I read about rubbing oils into the scalp - tried olive oil warmed in a bowl - worked great, but too messy.  This is much easier with the dropper and it works wonderful - got rid of 90% of the dandruff, but also took care of the itching and makes my hair look great! Just rub it in (not too hard) all over affected areas, wrap hair in towel 20-30 min. then wash until much of it is out and condition.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 days ONLY now , and i noticed a huge difference on my skin ! specially my face .. although i was so tired but this oil made my skin glows , bright and very smooth and tight ! I LOVE IT ! the seller was very helpful and it was shipped super fast and packaged with very great care . highly recommended .</li>
            <li> Great quality product ....easy to use..dark bottle great for protecting the oil . will buy this brand and from this buyer again</li>
            <li> The oil tames frizzy hair and works great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful on hair, nails, acne scars so far!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews for anything that I order from Amazon, but for this product I couldn&#x27;t resist. I&#x27;ve been using argan oil on my hair for 3 weeks and my hair stopped falling little by little. Specially my mom was complaining 3 wks ago that a good chunk (unusual amount) of her hair was falling. Then I bought this for her and myself and we&#x27;ve been using it for only 3wks. My mom says it&#x27;s a miracle oil as her hair stopped falling. same thing for my hair. Instead of taking all the vitamins out there that&#x27;s not natural, use this natural argan oil. I have really curly and frizzy hair after i wash it. So I started putting this oil on damp hair after I wash it and it makes my hair so shiny and reduces frizz and makes it wavy or less curly which I LOVE!! That makes me wanna stay away from using all the heat tools on my hair which basically damages your hair. This is the oil that I will use from now on.</li>
            <li> I am using now and love the product.  Moisturizes skin and nails wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Was not knowing what to expect-however been using on my face at night and am seeing a difference. Will but again.</li>
            <li> Okay, this product is wonderful for skin rejuvenation and such, and that&#x27;s why I bought it. I have only been using this oil for about five or six days considering that&#x27;s when I received the oil in the mail. Because of that short time using it I cannot give a full report on how it has worked for my stretch marks so far, but I pray it does well on them. Overall this product is great and even has a natural odor which is great. I hope you consider this product and it&#x27;s great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and people think I\\&quot;m 35. . I give myself my at home glycolic peels and use this afterwards and I tell you, my skin has never looked better.  It&#x27;s liquid gold to me!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where people get the idea that this is somehow lesser quality than the Watts, Josie Maran or Eden Allure stuff. Maybe some people don&#x27;t like brands that don&#x27;t have a label they know or like or something but this stuff is great. My wife loves what it does for her and I like it for a variety of reasons. Doesn&#x27;t even feel like oil in a weird way...just good stuff.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about these anti-wrinkle benefits everyone is talking about but I love this stuff for moisturizing my face. It is not oily and absorbs quickly and completely and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. If anything it is helping my wrinkles because I actually moisturize my face everyday since it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film and make me break out.</li>
            <li> using on hair and skin with good results. it soaks in quickly. It has a slight smell like olive oil which dissipates rapidly</li>
            <li> I thought at first that this product would be too expensive to use.  Then I found your brand.  Very reasonable and very high quality.  And, wow, what it does for my face, hair, and nails.  Expensive?  Not when I consider all the products I was using before for my dry, itchy skin that this one product has replaced.  I don&#x27;t need anything else.  And a little goes a long, long way. Don&#x27;t want to ever be without it again.</li>
            <li> Argan oil[[ASIN:B00397XUIK Golden Argan Oil ® 100% Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert -1oz(30ml)]]    This oil has met my expectations 100% my face is so dry and no anti-aging cream has done the job at the 1/4 of the price I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!  It has no odor and is not greasy.  I use this every day on my hair and face...hair is nice and soft and my face is blemish free!  I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> This has been a miracle for me.  I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for the past 25 years.  I&#x27;ve tried every expensive product and nothing has ever really worked.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and have only had very minor breakouts since I started using it.  The effect was almost immediate.  It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I&#x27;m using now and I&#x27;m hoping that it works in the summer when my skin is more oily.  I use it to moisturize my neck and hands too. It absorbs pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of natural home-made skin and hair treatments, but so far have mostly used them to complement the more expensive, professionally made skin and hair care products (usually from L&#x27;Occitane). My basic day creme, night cream and eye cream have always been professional. Now I think this oil might replace all these products, as it allows to achieve a better effect or at least the same, really saves time (and certainly money), and makes it easier and more compact to pack for travel. Even if my first impression fades after some time (I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week), I know it can most certainly replace a night cream. I thought that L&#x27;Occitane Immortelle mask does miracles when worn overnight, but I actually like the effect of argan oil better - it makes my skin really fresh and plump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have invented several other uses of it for myself that I would be happy to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EYES: use argan oil instead of your regular eye cream, but allow 3-5 minutes to absorb (probably not necessary for people with dry skin). If you don&#x27;t have time to wait, use oil blotting paper to remove excess oil before makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACE: I have a combination oily, acne-prone skin, and what I read about the astringent effect of argan oil is true in my case. I think my pores are smaller when I use it. It moisturizes and softens my skin so well, which probably appeases my own oil glands, so it becomes much less shiny. Argain oil has an exquisite ability to absorb into skin completely (or nearly completely depending on the \\&quot;mood\\&quot; of my skin and application) that I have not seen in other oils. I apply a few drops of it straight onto my skin after toner at night. For daytime I have a few options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply it on wet face at the end of the shower, then towel-dry slightly; use blotting paper to remove excess oil if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Use it undiluted (i.e., on dry skin), and then a few minutes later wipe your face gently with a a cotton disk soaked in alcohol-containig toner (I use Clinique 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Use a combination of 1 and 2 - apply when your face is still wet, and then remove excess with toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. This is how I think I&#x27;ll be using it in summer when it gets hot and humid. Wash your face with soap or regular facewash. Then wash again, but this time add a few drops of argan oil in soap lather. For now it leaves my skin a bit dry on those spots that tend to be drier, but in summer it should be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Combine with mineral water spray (Evian at Sephora, or some other) or rose or neroli water. Basically the same idea as in method 2, but instead of using it in the shower, moist your face with rose (or neroli or mineral) water, and then apply a drop or two of the oil. This should also be a good complement to summer time method 4, as each of these waters has a moisturizing effect (rose and neroli are also astringents).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Acne scars: it&#x27;s important to moisturize and soften them to heal. Cocoa butter is commonly used for the purpose, and argan is just as good. Just massage a little bit into the spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can certainly try to add a few drops of essential oil to the bottle of argan oil, according to desired effect (for example, lemon oil for whitening, neroli or lemongrass as astringent), but I prefer to keep the process simple, and just use it as is. From what I read about argan oil, it is packed with antioxidants and the main vitamins used in skin care, so, it can also be used alone. I am so tired of being dependent on countless skin-hair-body care products that I am just happy when I can use one for all these purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR: I have curly hair, and this oil enabled me to style it in a new way. If I plan to use hair dryer, I rub a drop of argan oil in my palms when they are wet, and then apply on wet hair after I have rinsed the conditioner, put a towel on my hair for a few minutes. This really helps to minimize frizz from blow drying. But make sure you use it sparingly! One drop too much might make your hair look somewhat lifeless, unless your hair is extra-coarse. I prefer not to use it if I let my hair dry naturally on that day, because it makes curls somewhat too tame - I prefer them lighter. If I see that the ends are getting frizzy during blow-drying, I also use a tiny bit of oil with water to moisten them. I still use a little bit of my regular hairstyling product. If you have curly hair and accidentally run out of hair conditioner, a drop of this oil can work as a detangler (although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good replacement for hair conditioner on a regular basis). This oil should probably be great for African hair, especially for those who heat-style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BODY MOISTURIZER: I use 2 times x 4 drops of this oil for my whole body before wiping with towel. It feels like nothing at all, but the skin is much softer. This is very important for those who begin their day in a yoga or some other physical activity class - no gross feeling when you sweat, as it is always the case even with the best body lotions. Even though the softening effect is very light, it remains for at least the whole day until the next shower. Again, it&#x27;s superquick to apply, which I can&#x27;t fail to appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MANICURE/PEDICURE: great as nail an cuticle oil. I also add a few drops of it into a non-oily body scrub (mine is Clinique) and use as a foot scrub. It makes the scrub particles glide easier, so you can remove those stubborn flakes of skin under and between the toes. Regular salt or sugar scrubs based in oil don&#x27;t do it so well - those cheap oils don&#x27;t really glide, but leave a nasty residue afterwards, and salt/sugar scratch the skin rather than polishing it. I am thinking of replacing the Clinique scrub with natural particles (jojba beads, crushed grapeseeds etc, available at brambleberry.com, and possibly amazon as well) mixed with argan oil - but because I still haven&#x27;t tried, I can&#x27;t recommend it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least: what made me buy this argan oil rather than any other are the good reviews, most of which said that the product is authentic. This seems to be the case. Before that I used Josie Maran argan oil, which is considered to be one of the best and purest in the market. Mogador is just as good, but much cheaper. Also, I like the fact that Mogador is not deodorized like Josie Maran, and is kept natural this way. The scent is very light, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It&#x27;s very important that the product is authentic, because argan oil is very rare, and the cheaper versions can often be diluted. This one isn&#x27;t, it really works.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this as a facial moisturiezer. I used it for almost two months, and all it did to my face was make it dry, flaky, and made my forehead breakout. It wasn&#x27;t bad on my arms as a moisturizer. I will also try using it for my hair. But definetly not on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been relying on leave-in conditioner to control frizzies, but it only works so-so. This product AMAZING! No frizz, just beautiful curly ringlets with healthy shine...not greasy at all. I use about 8 drops for medium length hair, so I expect this will last me a good long time. Regardless, I shall not go without my new beloved argan oil ever again!  I also use a tiny bit on my face for a dry patch that doesn&#x27;t seem to go away during the winter, and it got rid of it. Other reviews of argan oil have mentioned an odor, but the very slight smell that is in the bottle isn&#x27;t enough to change the smell of your shampoo, nor can I smell it on my face.</li>
            <li> After using (a drop or two on face) for a few weeks it made my skin look older,wrinkles,dullness, sagging and breakout. Could really notice a difference after taking some photos and was confused as to how much I seemed to age. When I checked one and two star reviews for this product I found that others felt the same, that this is an inferior product. I threw it out, who knows what&#x27;s in it.It does NOT have the USDA Organic Seal.Skin got back to normal after a few weeks of NOT using this product.It healed, thank God. Don&#x27;t need to spend money to speed up the aging process! I bought thinking I was getting something beneficial, and got quite the opposite. Maybe mine was rancid? Not sure, but possibly but not due to not using it the right way, as soon as it arrived.(shipping time was fast but who cares with a product like this)  Next time I will read more critical reviews if there are any before purchasing something that generally has high ratings.Especially if I will be putting it on my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Even from day 1 I noticed a huge difference. I have been using it for a few months and it has drastically improved my skin elasticity, eliminated wrinkles, and has helped to even out my skin tone. It absorbs completely and quickly, unlike other oils. This is the best product I have found for my face, and that is saying a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  its all natural and has cleared up my acne.  Keep getting compliments on my skin! would and will buy again</li>
            <li> The first time I bought Argan Oil I was surprised by its qualities. I used it in my hands before bed time. This time I deciden to change the brand and buoght Mogador Certified Organic Pure Argan Oil. The quality is so much better than the one I had before and over it the size is bigger.  I will buy it over and over again. Will not doubt in recomend it to everybody. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> well packaged and very moisturizing...I use it everyday and it will probably last forever.  I use it on my face, body and cuticles.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars as I have been using Mogadar Pure Argan Oil for only 2 weeks.  So far I love it! I am focused on using natural products on my skin and this product is superior to other non-natural products I have used for years. The price is amazing!  I can see an improvement to the creases under my eyes and I feel confident I will continue to use this product! My mother and sister are using this product as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best argan oil I&#x27;ve used and I have tried a LOT of brands at every price point. Some broke me out, smelled, didn&#x27;t sink in, etc... this is the REAL DEAL and you cannot beat the price for the QUALITY! Thank you for a great product!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best quality 100% Argan oil available.  The shipping was lightning fast and the customer service is excellent.  I LOVE how the product works, my skin is soft and no breakouts.  It is awesome all over the body, and just a couple drops go a long way.  The oil absorbs quickly, as others say and leaves no oil residue at all. A little goes a long way, and the benefits for your skin are wonderful.  If you are looking for a high quality Argan oil but don&#x27;t want to pay the extra 50 bucks for a designer name, this is the best value for your dollar.  Absolutely top quality without the sticker shock :)</li>
            <li> I initially reported an unpleasant smell.However,after opening the bottle and using the oil several times the smell has dissipated.It is a bit expensive but a little goes a long way.Will probably order it again if it continues to agree with my skin which is smooth and hydrated after using this product.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.  Very comparable to much more expensive brands.  Would definitely buy again and recommend to others.  Fast service.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after comparing this product to a name brand product from Sephora and decided that this was worth the risk to save some $.  and WOW I am in love! I am only 23 but I do take very good care of my skin both on my face and my body.  I was born with eczema and so I have very dry skin but also have very oily/acne prone skin.  It is a tough combination to get control over but this argon oil works wonders for me.  I use this almost immediately after I shower so my skin can absorb the oil. A few drops each on my legs, arms, stomach, chest.  It has greatly improved my blotchy skin patches and keeps me moisturized.  I also use this around my eyes and it has made a huge difference in my dark circles and my skin is tighter.  If you are acne prone I would not suggest using this on your face everyday, 2 times a week for me at night works best.  It has helped to get rid of the existing acne and also fade the acne scars on my face.  I have used this in my hair a few times also and it controls the friz in the summer heat.  I want everyone to know that this is not going to make you greasy and sticky, apply this to the skin when you get out of the shower and let it sink in.  If you do feel greasy then I think you are applying too much and wasting the product.  It takes a bit of experimenting to know how much works best for your body/face/hair but when you get it right it is so worth it!</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of this item.  It is unlike anything I have ever smelled.  Thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t last long.  I mix it with carols daughters body cream (all natural).  I like the way it makes my skin look and feel, so healthy and silky smooth.  My cuticles look pretty good too. The price is also descent compared to another brand I actually love but is quite pricey.  In a pinch I would buy this again and mix it with an aromatic fragrance that is pleasing to my nostrils.  Addition:  After using this product for a couple of months, the smell seems to have disappeared.</li>
            <li> Being a Moroccan, Argan oil has always been an essential element in my life; therefore, I do know the  characteristics of a good quality and authentic Argan oil. I strongly believe that Mogador Argan oil is pure and authentic. I did buy many Mogador Argan bottles  for  my wife, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law. They all have been using it on their skin, hair, and nails. They even stopped putting those synthetic moisturizers/substances that cause more harm. Mogador Argan oil is organic. Normally, whenever I put an artificial lotion on my dry skin (especially during winters), my skin starts itching. However, Mogador Aragan oil did not cause itching at all. My family and I love this product and we will keep purchasing it from Mogador Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my skin and hair for about ten days now, and it really is incredible. I&#x27;ll be 50 in a couple months, and have slight sun damage on my face (darker spots), fine wrinkles, and rosacea on my upper arms. When I was younger, I had fairly severe acne, and still encounter hormonal breakouts once and a while.  I use a henna/indigo combo on my long hair to condition and color it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For face: after I wash my face, while the skin is still damp, I rub on a few drops of oil  and let it sink in before I use my moisturizer. It really is miraculous. Dark spots on my forehead and cheeks from sun damage are fading, as are the dark circles under my eyes. Fine lines are diminishing as well. My skin glows in a beautifully healthy way, and I&#x27;ve received quite a few compliments in the past few days about how great I look. I do love what this does! I&#x27;ve found it works best on damp skin--it not only locks moisture in, it also makes the oil easier to use. I don&#x27;t need to use as much, it spreads more easily, and sinks in better. Oh yes! I had a small pimple outbreak on my chin, and this stuff cleared it up in a day. There must be some kind of antiseptic quality similar to Walnut oil that helps heal outbreaks, rashes and cuts. This makes my skin velvety soft--softer than when I use moisturizer by itself. When I first started using it, my skin drank it up like no one&#x27;s business. I don&#x27;t need to use as much anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body: the red spots on my arms are gone. The skin is soft and smooth. The texture on my neck and chest looks much better, too. I use this after shaving my legs, and alligator skin doesn&#x27;t happen anymore! Again, just a couple drops on damp skin works. Don&#x27;t need a lot! The condition of my nails has also improved--after I use it on my face or body, I always rub the excess into my nails and cuticles. I had ridges in my nails and they disappeared in about a week. My cuticles are also healthier--easier to push back and no hang nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair: I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times after I&#x27;ve washed my hair. It&#x27;s just been recently henna-ed also, so it&#x27;s hard to say the effect this has. It helps cut down on fly-aways for sure, without adding any weight. My hair is ridiculously shiny from the henna, so I&#x27;m not sure if this really adds anything. Also, I use coconut oil on my hair for deep conditioning once a week, so am not sure if the Argan oil is adding anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s big YES for my skin. I don&#x27;t think my hair needs it because of the other things I use on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People comment on the smell--I think it smells good. It definitely doesn&#x27;t smell sweet or perfumey--and it shouldn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s 100% Argan Oil and that&#x27;s it. In other words, it doesn&#x27;t smell like synthetic cosmetic products do. It smells a little like sesame oil, a little like walnut oil. The consistency is thick, the oil is a nice amber color. If you don&#x27;t use it on damp skin, there&#x27;s a bit of a tacky or sticky sensation that quickly goes away (as does the aroma). I am amazed at how quickly my skin absorbs it, though. It doesn&#x27;t just sit on the surface--it penetrates deeply and nourishes skin/hair/nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has become as essential as toothpaste and eyeliner for me!!! Also, I love that the proceeds go to support the Berber women who make it. All around 100% Incredible price and quick delivery. Thank you, Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I&#x27;ve used this for three months and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle! This really, really does help not just the look, but overall health, of my skin and nails.

            <li> Having used this for just a week I can see a remarkable difference in my skin texture. Its great for dry frizzy hair and mixing it up with any of your other daily beauty products makes such a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely going to keep buying this.</li>
            <li> Just one word, AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;I finally found my way to keep younger looking without spending $$$$ for clinic support.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> I do not usually review products but this one is fabulous.  I am a mature woman with wrinkles, sags, bags (you get the picture).  I cannot believe what this oil is doing for my skin.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil several times.  I have been reading that pure argan oil can be purchased cheaper than Josie&#x27;s.  This product is definitely cheaper.....and, I have enjoyed using it.  My only hesitation to reorder is the odor.  It does have a rather odd smell that could be off-setting to some users.</li>
            <li> Have Mercy...we were out of our Argan oil for a couple of weeks, talk about skin torture...that was it 😔. BUT, we received it yesterday &amp; my skin was QUICKLY happy &amp; moisturized. I can honestly tell a difference in my skin in a short 48 hours. My skin is moisturized &amp; happily soaking in more moisture with the hep of the Hyaluronic acid that I use in tandem with my Argan oil. The moral,of this story...Lord willing, we will NOT experience another situation without our (my husband &amp; I) Argan oil</li>
            <li> I ordered this and when it came I decided to try it on my skin, well it really works on wrinkles! I use this and my face cream and the results are amazing!!! My friend ordered a bottle and I got another for my 82 year old mother!</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.  You only need a small amount for your entire neck/face. Nothing goes to waste - I rub any remainder into my hands.  Incredibly enough my breakouts have cleared up and my face is much less oily.</li>
            <li> I am of African descent and have been wearing my hair in its natural state for about four years now.  I have recently started using natural oils as opposed to most of the commercial hair care products on the market.  I bought this argan oil to enhance my mixes.  I must say that it has been working quite well -adding softness and smoothness to my hair, my hair looks healthy and appears to be stronger as the amount of hair that breaks off is minimal now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a bonus.  I also have a very oily face and I either mix a drop of argan oil with a drop of jojoba oil (0r i use either oil straight) as my facial treatment (night or day).  Before this mix I would  wake up in the morning with a face slicked with oil.  Since I started this mixture I find that my face is much less shiny yet it has a soft glow.  I get no breakouts and am happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the mildly roasted fragrance of this oil.  It reminds me of nature.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> This oil feels wonderful on my face-light but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Terrific buy. Love argan oil and this was a steal. I have very dry skin and this is a perfect remedy!</li>
            <li> smelled horrible. the rubber on the eye dropper &amp;#34;rotted&amp;#34; and i think the oil goes &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; too. and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;wasn&#x27;t impressed especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have had dark spots on my face for years and now 98% gone.  81 years old and face is smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true. The best Argan oil I&#x27;ve used so far. Take my money.</li>
            <li> It seems to work pretty well on hair- definitely use sparingly though as it will weigh hair down and make it look oily if you use too much. On skin leaves you feeling a little oily as well.</li>
            <li> great stuff for the skin and hair. Will reorder</li>
            <li> I just love using this Organic Argan Oil for nourishing my skin! I highly recommend this product for anyone needing to give special attention to problematic skin ailments!</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days so I&#x27;m still waiting to see what the long term effects are but so far I am very happy with the product. The dropper makes it easy to keep from overpouring too much and the bottle is tinted just as it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Wow, wow, wow! I rarely write reviews but WOW WOW WOW! For anyone on the fence, jump off! This stuff is awesome. I read the reviews and many said this oil is just like Josie&#x27;s on QVC. They are not lying. This is just like Josie&#x27;s. Except you are not paying an outrageous amount of money like you do with hers. I compared the oils, side by side. Same exact everything except price. I can&#x27;t get hubby to use anything ever but he&#x27;s on board with this product and that is saying ALOT!</li>
            <li> great product, arrived just as i expected. on time and in great shape. light, wonderful oil, no bad smell, love it for hair and skin</li>
            <li> Still using, but it&#x27;s early so I cannot comment on results. Seems like a good product. Too early for me to make a valid statement.</li>
            <li> Its a good oil but I can not say that it&#x27;s the miracle oil that others have claimed. Shipping was extremely fast and the oil was package securely against breakage.</li>
            <li> Good product , I used it for my face and hair . Really keeps your skin moisturized in colder weather</li>
            <li> After the 5 star reviews about this product I decided to try it for myself.  I ordered this Argan Oil last week and it came a day earlier than I expected.  I tried it right away and sure enough I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I found a new beauty product that really works. This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.  It is great for my skin care.  I noticed that my eye lashes have gotten stronger and healthier since using it.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter uses it too, and has seen a miraculous reduction/elimination of facial outbreaks and skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I could have purchased this product from any number of retailers. Who I chose was random. The product is fine, I like the light sesame fragrance and the oil is a good quality. But the bottle was all that was in the box. The order came with NO paperwork so I have no reference # nor the opportunity to return if I needed to for any reason.</li>
            <li> I could go on all day about how amazing this oil is but I will break it down, excellent on hair, skin, nails. A lot of bang for your buck. and that little bottle goes a long way because you dont need much.</li>
            <li> i just love this oil so much! use it every night and it leaves skin feeling great, smells nice too</li>
            <li> I had a dry flaky patch on my forehead for 6 weeks and could not moisturize it away.  I tried this as a last resort before purchasing the very expensive Rodin face oil and it worked!  It helped with my scalp as well around the hairline where I get the same skin issue.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is organic, PURE Argan oil.  Many others have the argan oil mixed with other ingredients as a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; - but this oil is only Argan oil.  I only need a drop or two to rub in my hands and then over my hair to make it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair and on my face to make both very soft. No clogged pores. Works great!</li>
            <li> and I do think I am noticing a reduction in pore size even though my pores were not real large?? It definitely seems to have a medicinal property as I had a mosquito bite on my face that was quite large as my mosquito bites are generally large and weep&lt;br /&gt;a clear fluid (yuck, I know) this stuff really calmed and healed it faster than if I had not used it and I&#x27;m sure it probably helps with acne as well...just a guess. I use it along with (alternate it to see which I like best)  another more expensive oil I purchased prior and the more expensive oil is thinner which I like, but this really helps on my neck and chest to hydrate and waking with less lines on my chest after side sleeping all night so that&#x27;s a bonus. Thought I&#x27;d try it as I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and given the price had nothing to lose. I think it&#x27;s nice...has a nutty smell which is not offensive. Will continue to use a 100% pure oil in the future for neck and chest and perhaps face.... On the face I generally put a small amount of light moisturizer after a minute or so which helps to hydrate better.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned different ways to use this.  To add to what others have written, it works great in removing hair dye that has spotted or stained skin</li>
            <li> I Love Argan oil and this was the best. No smell and really absorbs easily.&lt;br /&gt;Good for skin and hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good oil, but not a mind-blowing oil like it was hyped up to be. Perhaps I need to use it for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> I use this on my fine, thin, highlighted hair at night to moisturize and wash it out in the morning.  Someone with thick hair and/or curls could probably use this any time with great results.  I also frequently apply this oil to my forehead as a moisturizer and have not had any issues with breaking out.  It moisturizes well, but is also very light - I think it even feels lighter than grapeseed and jojoba oils.  I prefer this to the Josie Maran and other argan oil products for hair and skin because it&#x27;s pure and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals or silicones.  If you want an effective natural product, I&#x27;d recommend this.  I think it&#x27;s a better value for the money than most of the other &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; products that probably contain no more than a few drops!</li>
            <li> I have heard about Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil for over 3 years now. I actually bought the really expensive version just for hair, and was not impressed really at all. It was OK, but not worth the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently got a small sample of multi - use argan oil at sephora, and now I am hooked. It makes your skin feel so good. The best part about it is the different uses of it. I put a few drops in my bath, and my skin feels so great. I put it on my lips as a lip moisturizer, and also mix it with my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very apprehensive to put &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on my face, but it has actually helped fade a few acne marks and has not caused any new outbreaks. It is an oil but it is not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also put it on my legs before bed and they feel so soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sample I got was the josie maran brand, and I really really loved it but it was a little too expensive to start using. I actually ended up ordering some for about 1/4 of the price on amazon (Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil ) and it works the exact same was except the josie maran brand has no smell at all, and the other kind I ordered has a very very slight smell (almost like coffee - I know that is weird) to it.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine uses Argan oil from a famous distributor.  She has lovely skin, so I thought I would try this one first instead of paying $60+ for the advertising.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I have mature dry skin.  It has actually healed a dry flakey patch on the side on my nose that I have had for years.  It took about 3 weeks for the dry patch to go away. I have ultra sensitive skin and this product DID make me break out just at first.  (I don&#x27;t know why and I don&#x27;t usually have acne).  But I waited it out and my face cleared up in about 4 days.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel so tight and crinkly anymore.  And I do believe it is giving me a slight glow.  (not shine).  I only use about a half teaspoon once in the morning and once in the evening after cleansing.  I have to wait about 20 minutes for it to soak in before I can apply makeup.  I am using very little foundation now thanks to this product. It has very little odor.  But like someone else said, it is reminiscent of olives.  The odor goes away in a few seconds.  I&#x27;ve been using this on my fingernails, toenails and heels also.  It has made a tremendous difference on my feet.</li>
            <li> I discovered argan oil a year ago after reading many beauty blogs. I wanted to find one that was organic and 100% argan oil from Morocco that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank. Mogador&#x27;s argan oil certainly fits the bill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you with oily/combination skin who are hesitant to put more oil on your face - this is the BEST facial moisturizer I have ever used. As someone with combination skin, I can assure you that this sinks into your skin after a few minutes and leaves your skin hydrated from the inside out; it does not leave your face oily! In fact, it provides the perfect canvas for  makeup application after you let it properly sink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is supposed to have amazing antioxidant and possibly even antibacterial properties, in addition to being an excellent moisturizer. I use it on my face but people even use on hair and the rest of their bodies as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a small bottle of Josie Maran’s argan oil and Mogador’s is comparable, if not better, at half the price! Don’t fall for the fancy Sephora ad campaigns! Mogador produces a very high quality product and deals directly with the producer in Morocco, which I think is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my face and my hair, my hair gives you high gloss and does not feel oily, I recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this brand the first time and must say it is very good.  I had bought some other brand a while back, but this one is better.</li>
            <li> Great for daily use! I started a regimen of argan oil two years ago, each morning around my eyes and mouth, and it has genuinely made a difference.  It takes just 4 drops per day, but honestly people ask me how I have such great skin.  And I&#x27;m in my late 60s!, this brand is the best.</li>
            <li> fantastic on my body; can&#x27;t use on my face as it caused acne, but I am prone to adult acne from almost anything; will buy it again</li>
            <li> Aragon oil great as always and enjoyed using it as it helps feeling my face smooth and radiant and recommending to all</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - bought my first bottle in Morocco and have been hooked ever since.  I like the scent also!</li>
            <li> I have been using this at night on my face after cleansing.  It has really made my skin soft but I still have fine lines.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of Argan oil. It is a great moisturizer. I use it for my face and 4b/c hair.</li>
            <li> I started to use the Argan Oil from the first day i received it. I tried to put on my hair in a day time but it looks vere oily.&lt;br /&gt;I put on my face instead of any day cream and it is works magically. The skin absorbs it very well and it looks smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased argan oil from another vendor here, and, while it worked fairly well, (I used it on practically anywhere that was at all dry, my face, my hair, stretch marks on my belly, anywhere,) it was heavier than I thought it should be and smelled rather like salami to me, not what I want my hair to smell like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out I came back to amazon to buy more, thinking I would do a bit more searching and review reading this time. I was led to mogador through reviews on other argan oil distributors and thought I would give it a try. Fast forward a couple of days and I have my new argan oil. This is what I was looking for all along! It is light and quickly absorbed, where the other stuff seemed to hang around for a while. Best of all, it has a rather strong, nutty odor, which I much prefer to deli meat! I would definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair and it does a good job of helping to keep it soft.  I use with other products and don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> My face used to get really dry fast no matter what lotion I used. Once I started using the pure argan oil, those problems went away. I just use 2 or 3 drops of the oil and rub it on my hands and apply to the face. I had it for 6 months and still have so much left.</li>
            <li> If use everyday you&#x27;ll be able to see the result. Love the product, and I actually recommend it to my sister.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for your hair.  Mine is damaged and looks like crap but this oil transforms it into a sleek, shining mass.  I use a generous amount to treat it and it only looks slightly greasy.  This is the real deal for a decent price</li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical about using oil on my skin because I&#x27;m prone to breakouts. I applied after washing my face and it didn&#x27;t feel too oily or smell bad like some people have mentioned. I was so impressed with the results on my face that  I apply it to my entire body now after my shower. It really helps my skin look more hydrated and it absolutely did not cause any breakouts!I have tried all the expensive brands (La Mer, Arcona, etc.) and this by far has worked the best! Drop a little in the palm of your hands, rub together and pat or rub on your skin - it&#x27;s amazing. I was so excited about the effects I bought some Organic Argan oil  shampoo and masque - I think this stuff is great!!!</li>
            <li> i bought it to apply it on my face, but it dries it up more.&lt;br /&gt;I also out it on my hair, not happy.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do, what it says it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I had been using a higher priced Argan oil, but thought I would look to see if I could find something similar for much less money. I&#x27;m so glad I gave this product a try! Yes, it does have an \\&quot; earthy \\&quot; smell to it (it reminds me of toasted nuts :)), but it didn&#x27;t bother me the first time I used it - now I don&#x27;t even notice it anymore. This oil is much better than the higher priced brand - it seems thicker to me and moisturizes better. My skin feels so soft! I just started using it on my hair and it has really changed my hair. I have terribly dry hair and this oil has made it shiny and smooth. If you have oily hair it may be too much for you, but for someone with dry hair it has been a life saver.</li>
            <li> I had heard many good things about this oil, I had been using a much more expensive oil and this is actually better.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic healthy and safe alternative to a moisturizer and this is great! I use it at night, because it may leave somewhat oily residue, and also use it for the nails. I like the earthy scent and am very happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not sure if I can tell the difference between other products that are cheaper...</li>
            <li> Great price for this product.  At first I was surprised &amp; happy that it lacked the stinkiness of other Argan oils.  However, a few weeks later, it developed a faint smell, as expected.  Still, a great product for the money.</li>
            <li> I do not like it no is do not do nothing do not west your money !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????? personal opinion sory</li>
            <li> Ok, if you are beginning to get winkles, this is the simple answer to smooth them out. This oil is light and is absorbed very quickly, leaving the skin moist and supple not greasy.  Many creams disappear too soon, but this organic Argan oil is great. Also helps to heal and  clear skin issues, blemishes, scratches.</li>
            <li> Love the product very much ! My sister who&#x27;s the one who introduce me this product. When I use it I never expected that it really works a lot , but it works! It lighten my skin &amp; it&#x27;s very soft. It&#x27;s been almost 2 yrs. I&#x27;ve been using this product...I definitely recommend this product ...</li>
            <li> Very good for the hair and for the skin also!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again soon! I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I could not find this product on the ecocert website. I am hoping that Mogadishu can provide the information proving that it is infact ecocert certified.</li>
            <li> You just need a little bit on your hands, and massage it in your skin.  It absorbs quickly - leaving you skin feeling like a newborn.  I use it on my face morning &amp; night.  Rub a little on my hair - especially the ends to reduce split ends.  And does wonders for minor scars.</li>
            <li> Not sticky, help with my curly unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see a big difference1</li>
            <li> I had never heard of argan oil until I tried a free sample out of a magazine. I liked it so I decided to purchase Mogador Certified 100% Argan Oil. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and love it so far. It makes my hair shiny, less stringy, straighter, and less frizzy. My hair stays this way until I wash it again a day or two later with very little upkeep. It also helped clear up my scalp. I have long, thick hair that goes past my shoulders and I use about 5-7 drops and rub it into my hair after I wash it. The first time I used about 10 drops, but it made my hair just a tad bit oily so 5-7 is right for me. This may be different for everyone, just try it a few times till you get it right. I little goes a long way. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good brand .No  scent</li>
            <li> great for your skin can tell a difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using any other moisturizers on my face, this is amazing. It&#x27;s thicker than another brand that I tried, it seems to go on better.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. My face is so smooth and it cleared up any breakout I had. Love this product. Will be placing an order again very soon.</li>
            <li> I have severe eczema on my face, arms, and back. I recently have been slowly changing my routine of drastic changes with making my lifestyle as clean, green and healthy as possible, I wanted to find a product that I could use to help with my skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;I found that argon oil was  the miraculously product that helped diminished the rough patches of skin on my body. It has not only healed my inflammation but it has taken away the red, scaly look on my skin and has made it beautiful and young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried countless anti-aging products to retain my youthful skin, and I have only been using this product for a week and have noticed remarkable difference in fine lines under my eyes. It has diminished fine lines and has tighten my skin. I have also noticed my skin is looking healthier than ever! I know it sounds like a gimmick, oil in a bottle, what can argon oil really do for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I have found this product and it has helped me regain my confidence in my skin and beauty. I won&#x27;t be using any other product. :)</li>
            <li> Argan oil is great, it works better than the moisturizer I used to use, I can&#x27;t feel it on, and it improved my moderate acne. Don&#x27;t spend money on Josie Maran&#x27;s oil when this is just as good. I will definitely continue to buy from Mogador.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!!!!  It is light, non-greasy, absorbs quickly, and is odorless. It really makes my skin look and feel very soft and smooth. I&#x27;m 57 years old and have very dry skin. I could tell a difference within two applications of this product. I also use it on my nails and cuticles as well as my feet. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet, but may do that eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in the winter because my skin was so much drier then and this has done the trick. It&#x27;s wonderful and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This oil is good quality for the price. I use it on my face. It&#x27;s great cause I have never broken out in a rash or pimples using it and it keeps my skin hydrated and supple. A little goes a long way. Just wish it smelled better. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brand when I couldn&#x27;t get what I wanted at the Whole Foods nearby. I am very happy with it. I use it on my face instead of a cream and it works very well.</li>
            <li> The oil is very light and absorbs into my face and neck very quickly leaving no feeling of oily residue. It is an excellent moisturizer. The seller was very quick to resend replacement product when it came to their attention that the original shipment had been damaged.</li>
            <li> I tried the Josie Maran argan oil and loved it, so I did some research and found that this one got good reviews on Amazon (and also at a much more affordable price!). Unfortunately, as soon as I tried it I knew something was off. It was so watered down that you don&#x27;t even need the dropper for the oil to drop-- it literally just flows right out of the dropper onto your hand or wherever. It makes me suspicious that it&#x27;s not completely pure, or that it&#x27;s been watered down somewhere along the way. The Josie Maran one is much thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I used it on my hands and they were not moisturized at all! Something is amiss. Disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> Mogador Certified Argan Oil is incredible.  I started using Argan Oil after I happened upon Morrocan Oil for my hair, and was moisturized back from the abyss.  Mogador is effective, and although I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, I want to prevent them and preserve. I&#x27;m 42, half-white/half-black combination skin...and the old adage about \\&quot;black don&#x27;t crack\\&quot; is very true.  And to be fair, my white mother was an olive-y German who aged well, as did her mother, so I&#x27;ve been genetically blessed. Anyway, Mogador is my way to preserve my skin without a bunch of chemicals.  It is my \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; moisturizer for night...I put a tiny bit on my forehead, where I am starting to see a couple of creases.  I also put a few drops around my eyes.  I have no wrinkles around my eyes.  Use this, STAY OUT OF THE SUN (especially if you have fair skin), hydrate with at least 60 ounces of water daily, eat omega-3s and loads of organic green veggies, and you&#x27;ll be set.  One bottle lasts 5 months.  Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> Superior hydration for face clears up any blemish and awesome for fine lines. Great on hair as well good shine!</li>
            <li> the product is ok, not really nothing special. I would not purchase this item again. I have not even continued to use it.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin. I&#x27;m 40, now have occasional acne, eczema/psoriasis AND I live way up North in the frozen tundra! I deal with bitter winds and dryness a lot. This is my second bottle and it is the only thing that has worked for my skin. I add it to my regular moisturizer and at night I use it straight to &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; treat. It does not clog my pores, I find it to be fairly fragrance free, with a very subtle nutty scent if any. I use this on my face primarily, and the flakiness is almost gone and it makes make-up go on much better. No stinging or burning when applied, as do some acne, eczema/psoriasis treatments. I like the MOGADOR brand the best. It is consistent and works the same as the previous bottle. The price is right, as if you buy real cheap, well you get what you pay for. It is a splurge well worth it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really is pure argon oil, smells a little funky....</li>
            <li> I saw no changes in my skin except irritation after using a few weeks.  Was hoping for much more after reading all the rave reviews.  Glad it works for some, but if you have really sensitive skin as I do, I&#x27;d avoid this product.</li>
            <li> I have really dry sensitive skin that was unbalanced for years.  I spent the last 15 years working my way through a number of different moisturizer products with various results.  Most worked great for a few weeks and then I would have a reaction. I wanted to try this product for a good solid run before reviewing it. I am happy to report it&#x27;s been almost 2 years since I started using this and I am super happy with the results.  I was nervous about trying a oil on my face. I have used coconut oil before, but it didn&#x27;t feel very hydrating. Both argan and coconut oil go on greaseless, but argan oil left my skin feeling more nourished and softer. I have since stopped using anything but this oil for a facial moisturizer.  It is great all year long.  I also like that this is a cert. organic product which may or may not matter to you. My skin looks and feels better everyday with the oil. At night, when I wash my make-up off, I lightly pat my skin dry. leaving a little bit of water on, and apply 2 drops.  In the morning, after my shower while my skin is still moist, I apply 2 more drops. I do wait about 15 minutes for the oil to be absorbed before applying my make-up.  I have also used this oil on my scars and noticed a significant improvement in appearance after a few weeks. Highlights: long lasting product because I only use 4 drops a day, it is certified organic, it has simplified my beauty routine as I only use a gentle cleanser and the oil with great results, and it&#x27;s great on my sensitive skin. I would recommend giving this a try if you are curious about Argan oil.</li>
            <li> You do not need anything else for your skin but this.  Such a luxury.  So happy with this.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this oil and it is wonderful.  Leaves my skin so smooth and the effect lasts a long time.  I have used on my hair and I am very pleased with the result.  It has a  very tiny bit of odor but it is not at all offensive and is gone immediately.  I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I use it on my hair and face. It makes my skin so smooth and my hair is very silk. I plan to continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> After showering I put it on my face and then rub whatever is left on my hands on my hair - leaves my hair moisturized and gives it a great shine.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is the only product that diminishes my wrinkles and moisturizes my skin, also giving it a glow - not much is needed but I have tried using other products and the wrinkles return so will always use this.  I don&#x27;t find it stops the sagging or thinning of aging skin so I use another product in conjunction with the oil - would be great to have one product that did everything but so far I haven&#x27;t found it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of everything that will help cure any skin imperfections and make you look 10 years younger, but never once have the products actually work. I have been suffering with mild acne. My face seemed to have large craters and it was lowering my self esteem. No creams would work, I then went to the doctors and they prescribed an antibiotic cream and still didn&#x27;t work. I then started looking on Amazon for creams that would help my eczema on my arms and make my skin look alive. I seen argan oil and Google the item. I read nothing but good things, the only negative thing I read about this oil was the smell. To be honest, I enjoy the smell of natural products.&lt;br /&gt;When I first received the oil, I was super excited. I was counting down the days to receive it. The first night, I mixed a few drops with some lotion and rubbed it on my arms. I placed a bit more oil on my hands with a little less lotion and put it on my face. The following morning when I woke up, I noticed my face felt moisturized. It didn&#x27;t feel dry and since I live in AZ, my face could really use this oil. Every day I noticed my acne blemishes were decreasing. Its been a week since I have begun using argan oil, and I have to say this was the best 18.99 I have ever spent. I am about 1/8 through the bottle because I share with my kiddos, and I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My acne cleared up within a week, I haven&#x27;t had any pimples or acne pop up. For the acne I also wash my face 2-3x a day with Clearasil face wash and St. Ives and then put some lotion and oil on. I will probably continue to use this oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim, I only use it on my face at night and I love how light weight it is, my skin does not feel oily at all and it dries very quickly. I did not break out from it, which was something I was worried about, my skin would feel great in the morning. I have not tried it on my hair and I don&#x27;t plan on too, since the bottle is small and I have long hair I would need a lot. But I think this is a great product for the face. I use it with my other products and it does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a miracle, but I received only a commercial product. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the product is good, for my skin and for my hair to, but nothing that a regular product bought from the traditional trade hasn&#x27;t done before at a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;I think I overestimate this product, having clear that all skin and hair have different ph, genetics and others.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is nice the texture on my face when I applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards, Andrea</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a time, and it is wonderful for the hair and skin.  I recommend it to all of you.</li>
            <li> I received this product rather quickly, and it was packaged well.  The product is what I anticipated, being good quality.  It is dispensed by dropper, which is interesting.  As is typical, it does have a slight aroma - - which is not offensive, but if you are unfamiliar with Argon oil, may take some getting accustomed to.  Overall, good experience in ordering and good quality product.</li>
            <li> I could never be without this oil again!....I use it on my face and hair and other parts of my body.  It keeps my skin soft and helps prevent breatkouts too!  Love this brand of Argan oil!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Argan Oil!  It goes a long way - It makes my skin feel very smooth - Thank God for the things he provides for us!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when buying this product, having had many bad experiences with finding a moisturizer that I was not allergic to. This argan oil is very soothing to my skin. As an added benefit, I found that it does indeed reduce the dark circles under my eyes. As for the seller, the product was sent quickly and packaged well. I would purchase from this supplier again.</li>
            <li> Arrived early. This is my second argan oil. I like the oil so much. Does not make my face look greasy and easy to absorb. My face is prone to acne. Argan oil helps for black head and acne.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I could swear it has got rid of all the wrinkles around my eyes. I recently gave up smoking after 40 years and someone told me about Argon oil to heal my skin on my face after so many years of smoking. I did some research and found that there was a lot of different company&#x27;s selling Argan oil but most of them had so many different ingredients in them that I didn&#x27;t know witch one to purchase. I also wanted one that was pure oil. Then I found this one and read all the reviews and decided to give this a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I put a small bit on my face at night and in the morning. I found it best to wait about 15 minutes before you put any make up on. I tried it on my hair but it made it greasy so I&#x27;m just keeping it for my face. I have noticed a significant decrease in the wrinkles around my eyes. About once a month I&#x27;ve always get a zit on my chin but since I&#x27;ve been using this I haven&#x27;t had one.</li>
            <li> This was great in taming any fly-aways on my hair.  Also made my skin soft but would not solely recommend as a solution for seborrheic dermatitis sufferers like myself.  The reason I purchased this product because it contained no harsh chemicals and all the good reviews it received.  I still order this product but mainly use it for my hair and feet.</li>
            <li> I guess we all strive for the fountain of youth.  I am no different, but in my case the Aran oil was a waste of  money.  Any lubricating skin cream applied faithfully throughout life will do  as well.</li>
            <li> Great. I really love this oil and my daughter does also. Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my very long hair that is turning gray.  Just a little of the Mogador Argan Oil goes a long way to making my hair soft and manageable.  I would recommend this to anyone seeking a healthy alternative to beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> very good on skin, I already use Dr. Haushka, so &amp;#34;impressing me&amp;#34; is not easy, but yes, its a really good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an authentic, pure, Moroccan Argan oil for years and years now, trying everything and anything in the market&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted something that&#x27;s most like the actual Argan Oil from Morocco (One that I&#x27;ve tried after family traveled there and came back with this miracle oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is the real deal, people. It&#x27;s thicker than many others, it&#x27;s not mixed with anything synthetic, it&#x27;s the real deal. It even smells the same. The smell isn&#x27;t fabulous, but it&#x27;s authentic, and therefore, to me, it&#x27;s the best smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really makes my skin feel amazing- so soft and smooth (and I normally have severely dry skin, especially during the winter). It works quickly and really does everything it&#x27;s set out to do. I am so happy I finally found this. I was starting to feel like the only way would be going all the way to Morocco for some oil :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I would say is problematic with it is that it&#x27;s not very large for the price, therefore you should not put that much of it, but even that&#x27;s not really a thing, because you&#x27;re not supposed to put too much, and it comes with a dropper, so clearly this is not really an issue. It was just something I thought the moment I received it.&lt;br /&gt;If you use it correctly and not overdo it, it&#x27;s still going to last a long time, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was using a more expensive brand of Argan and wanted to see if it was just as good. It is. Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Argon Oil so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  However, it met my expectations and the price point was better than a lot of others out there.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed by skin.  No oily feeling.  I use it at night on my face and hands.  It leaves a velvety finish. Perfect moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I had used another oil that contained Argan Oil and that is when I decided to buy pure Argan Oil instead.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C&lt;br /&gt;Florida</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  Light and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used this for quite awhile and it is wonderful.  Absorbs quickly and hydrates my skin like nothing else!</li>
            <li> Tried a different brand before this, and can tell the difference instantly.  Mogador argan oil has changed my skin, turned it into baby smooth and replenished the natural skin moisture.  i look and feel 20 years younger, i&#x27;m not kidding!  my husband is quite scared of this oil because of what it made my skin turn back time.  and all i use is two drops.  i can&#x27;t not use it now.  thank you for such an unbelievably miracle of nature!</li>
            <li> This is the best oil i have found so far, forget the fake stuff, like the J. Moran oil. Will re-order, and works great on hair too.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. my skin gets super dry and this stuff lasts long and is a great deal. and its nice to know that the stuff i am putting on my skin doesnt have a bunch of crap in it :) might be too oily if you have oily skin? idk</li>
            <li> Really not impressed. I expected something highly moisturizing for the area around my eyes, but other than making me look greasy, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. I used this stuff for a few weeks expecting to see some results, but no go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would honestly advise people to just eat this stuff. I used to live in Morocco and we would have it with breakfast as a dipping sauce for bread. I get more out of it that way than using it as a moisturizer. (It&#x27;s actually delicious, BTW.)</li>
            <li> Good product. Not too greasy if you use few drops and that&#x27;s all one needs to keep the hair non-dry and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product is a great for organic pure argan oil and the price is more than great.  I use it on my face and neck nightly and find it to be the best wrinkle preventive I have used.</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry skin. This product really helps my face. The price can&#x27;t be beat - have seen some for 3x this price.</li>
            <li> I became acquainted with argan oil in a trip that I made to Morocco, where I bougth it. I used it to the last drop and then could not find any place where to buy some more. So when I saw it in amazon I was delighted and ordered it. It was delvered very promptly and I have been using it for three months now and it is just as good as the one I first bought in Morocco, the only difference is in the aroma which is a little stronger. I am very happy with it and plan to continue buying it from you.</li>
            <li> I think as far as argan oil goes, this is pretty great, and an incredible value. It also arrived really quickly and well packed. But it didn&#x27;t do too much for me. I have only ever tried one other brand, and have similarly not responded in the beauty-breakthrough way most people describe for argan oil. As a result, I wouldn&#x27;t attribute the product&#x27;s lack of perfecting my skin to it, rather, maybe I need something different. As far as value goes, I&#x27;ve never seen argan oil this cheap (remember, this bottle is 2 oz, when most are 1).</li>
            <li> I love this product! Argan oil works well as a facial moisturizer. I was impressed with the fast delivery. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands, this one is very poor, it smells bad and the bottle leaks. I LOVE Argan oil, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff . Have been using it for 5 days what a difference it makes in my skin. Gives it a dewy glo. Absorbed fast acne is finally clearing up. Have my whole family using it now. Husband likes it as well helps calm his eczema .</li>
            <li> I went to Morrocco 10 years ago and have been hooked on Argan oil ever since. I have used other products but tried is one because it came in a 2 oz size. It smells rancid and I don&#x27;t know if it supposed to have this smell or is bad. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a number to call to see if this is what it is supposed to be. I am tossing because of the smell and going back to my smaller old brand. But I love argan</li>
            <li> I am blown away by this stuff all around.  For my hair, it does great great things!  I have long, thick, wavy curly hair (think Andie mcdowell).  In my 20 yrs that i even cared about having great looking hair (I&#x27;m 36) I have never found anything (cheap or expensive)that could do what this does.  My curls look amazing.  Truly, the effects of this product and nothing else ( i haven&#x27;t had a hair cut in 4 months and i use cheap shampoo/conditioner).  I often pulled my hair up bc it never looked good and i don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time on it.  This stuff has since changed that!  I only needed 3 droppers full on my entire head of very thick, middle of back length hair.  Even this may be too much though.  Curly girls, the search is over for great looking, fuss free hair!  Wowser!</li>
            <li> This is truly one of the best products that I have ever used. After getting out of the shower I apply it to my damp hair. I have only been doing it for a few days and there is already a huge difference. I have severely damaged hair from years of bleaching/flat ironing, and it has made my hair soft, shiny, and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before bed I also like to apply it to the outer corners of my eyes and my hands. I wake up with smooth, healthy looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a MUST have, I am a loyal customer for life!</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about a year now, daily, on my face. A lot of moisturizers leave my skin red as if I am allergic to some ingredient, and I have had enough of all that. I also haven&#x27;t had dry skin at all during wintertime. It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily, just healthy skin. Love it. A few drops a day. A bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few places for Argan oil and this is by far the best quality at the best price</li>
            <li> It leaves your face very smooth and radiant!</li>
            <li> I was worried about using this oil on my face.  I tend to have combination dry/oily skin.  There was no need for all the worrying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 2 drops of oil on each side of my face, one on my forehead, and one on my neck.  It does take some time to fully soak in, so I wait about 30 minutes before applying makeup, when I use makeup.  Most days my face is au naturel, except for this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a fabulous glow on my skin, has a lovely somewhat nutty, natural scent that is very light and dissipates quickly.  I have seen an improvement in fine lines on my face (I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s) after using this oil for just a few weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful moisturizing oil, and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks on my face , neck and decollette.. The results are fantastic. I live in a dry climate and I immediately noticed wonderful moisturization, smooth skin, and have received many compliments on my skin. It is a much better product for me than Josie Marin&#x27;s Argan oil. There is a slight odor, which goes away and is no problem. I am ordering another bottle, don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to put oil on my face, being used to only buying products that are oil-free, but am am so glad that I did. I have pretty wonky skin, dry/oily combination, prone to break outs and blackheads. I&#x27;ve been putting this stuff on my face twice a day for about 3 weeks now, and the results have been fantastic. No sign of a single zit, and my pores seem to have shrunk. The skin around my eyes has tightened as well, and my dark under eye circles are less noticeable. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a miracle product, but the fact that it hasn&#x27;t made me break out and is noticeably refining my skin definitely make it worth buying in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who uses it in his hair and he loves it. All natural, great value and a much&lt;br /&gt;better product than the high-priced ones they sell at the beauty supply stores that have chemicals added to it!</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so this isn&#x27;t the most thorough review. This argan oil smells like argan oil- meaning it has a nutty smell. It does NOT smell like the Moroccan Argan Oil (blue box) made for hair which smells heavenly. However, this is pure argan oil and I don&#x27;t find the smell off-putting. It smooths easily over skin and comes in a dark glass bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li> This is just what i needed! I do see a diffeeence...my skins feels smoother, i have no acne...and i look like im glowing!!! Seemed weird at fist to be putting on oil on my face...but it really doesnt leave you feeling oily at all..just loved it</li>
            <li> Every night I use about 6-8 drops on my damp face after washing.  I wake up with my face very soft and dewy.  I love it and will keep using this product!</li>
            <li> This is good and not as expensive as other brands.</li>
            <li> I have been thru Lancôme, Clinique etc... And nothing seems to help me. I have very sensitive skin everything gives me a rash- like on my face but I read about this oil n said \\&quot; ok let&#x27;s try this again sigh \\&quot; and guess what it makes my skin soft .. I don&#x27;t get a rash yayyyyyyyyy!!!!!!! But I haven&#x27;t seen any changes on the other things it mentions it helps like acne wrinkles etc .... But maybe it takes longer I have been using it for a month now ....</li>
            <li> Great product and moisturizer. This is the second order of this Pure Argan Oil and its been great this winter.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is just like another main stream brand with a much higher price tag.  I really appreciate that Mogador argan oil is Fair Trade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/20/13: I used this oil for several weeks and unfortunately discovered it caused my skin to break out.  I mentioned this to a friend and she had the same experience with this brand.  It&#x27;s thicker than other argan oils I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my body rather than my face now.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about argan oil is that it is all natural. I originally discovered Josie Maran Argan Oil as a free sample at Sephora and I loved it. BUT 1.7 ounces of Josie Maran Argan Oil costs $48 and that is way too much for me. So I sought out a cheaper alternative and after researching found this product which when I first bought this product I paid $18.84 for it. The price has now edged up to $25 but it is still a very good deal at less than half the price of Josie Maran for the same exact product. This product also comes in a glass bottle instead of a plastic one like some different brands sold on Amazon. Oil will absorb some of the chemicals in the plastic containers, so this product is of high quality and safe. I have bought Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil multiple times and will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;Things I use my argan oil for:&lt;br /&gt;*Dash a little on a cotton pad and it is an excellent chemical free makeup remover&lt;br /&gt;*I use it by itself at night as a moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;*I mix a few drops in my daytime moisturizer (makes your face a little greasy looking if used by itself.)&lt;br /&gt;*I rub a couple drops in my hair while it is still wet and it makes my hair super soft&lt;br /&gt;*I mix it in with my body lotion too&lt;br /&gt;*I also have been using it on my lips lately and my lips are no longer chapped&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an all natural alternative to chemical laced moisturizers</li>
            <li> I bought this argan oil from this seller on two occasions: 1 bottle for myself, and then another for my mother who wanted one after trying mine.  At first I was skeptical about the quality because the price is so low, but after comparing it to the much more expensive Josie Moran argan oil from Sephora, I found that this is identical, if not better.  I use this stuff on my face and hair.  I actually use a lot on my hair right after washing, on top of my leave in conditioner and it does not leave my hair greasy like other oils do.  In fact, this is the only oil that my hair tolerates.  I also noticed an improvement in my hormonal acne, which is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that those who are claiming that this is oily/greasy are probably using too much.  You really do not use a lot, specifically on the face, I only use about three pin-point worths combined with my moisturizer.  My bottle also did not have a distinct smell in the bottle or on the hair.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I have ordered and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product. A little goes a long way, and I use it on my face and in my hair. It is as good, if not better, than its much more expensive competitors, and it serves as my daily moisturizer. Some comments have indicated a mild organic smell, but I have not experienced this in either bottle. Shipping was fast and efficient and I could not recommend this product more highly.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days... I don&#x27;t know why I did not know about this sooner!  My face feels smooth, little blemishes are disappearing&lt;br /&gt;and I seem to think that my brown pigmentation marks on the side of my face are lighter.  Could this be?!!  I mix a few drops in with my night cream, after cleansing and exfoliating.  In the morning after my shower, while my face is still damp, I put it on and let it soak in.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin texture and appearance.  I think I found what I have been searching for.  The only teeny tiny detractor is the scent.  It does smell a little unusual, but that disappears after a few seconds.  I love it.  I will be purchasing from this seller again, delivery was quick and I am pleased with the size of the jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got dried out dyed hair, I use 3 drops before blowdrying and 3 drops after. sometimes my hands are really dry so I have to use another 3 because my hands absorb it, but it makes my hair silky smooth and soft. Love it</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter, she mixes it with a cream for acne ,time will tell if there is an improvement but it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product. I use it on my face and hair.  Does not clog pores and makes face smooth.</li>
            <li> Good price. Has a herbal/chemical smell which I am not that fond of. The product seems to work as well as others that were more expensive but had a more pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair. After shower, a few drops on my palms, and then spread on the hair, especially the ends. Since I started using it, I can go 3 months w/out a haircut (as opposed to split ends every 4 weeks), and my hair seems healthier and grows a little faster. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and I won&#x27;t stop any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it sometimes with my facial cream. Just add 1 drop. Amazingly soft skin! I buy it for presents too!</li>
            <li> Still using this product but really like the results so far.  I am using this product along with the Neocell Fish Collegen/HA.  Therefore, I&#x27;m not sure how this product acts alone.  However, the two together make a good combination for a smooth and moisturized complexion without the greasy results you get with some oils.  I&#x27;ve notice a decrease in the &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; lines at the corner of my eyes and my compexion is glowing.  I will continue to use this produce and give a full review once I have completed the bottle.</li>
            <li> Price is great on this and it&#x27;s organic. You can use this for a number of things but I use it mainly on my hair. I wish it smelled better, although it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell bad!</li>
            <li> I still use argan oil . and still buy new.I check one of two oil. This my quality rating is 3)</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t quite soak into the skin as I was hoping, and I noticed little change to my complexion.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I heard about this oil and I started researching about it and decided to try to find one and try it. I chose this one due to the great reviews and how it is certified by ECOCERT and cold pressed. It has done wonders for my face!!!! I have redness on my chin, nose and parts of my cheeks and it is completely gone! I also spent a lot of time in the sun one day, and got a sun burn on my chest. I put this oil on my chest and went to bed, 5 hours later when I woke up...it was COMPLETELY gone! I have never had a sun burn go away that fast EVER. For sun burns I have used aloe vera, and various moisturizing lotions and still had to wait about a week for it to go away and I would still start to peel. With this oil it not only went away in five hours, I never peeled! This is an amazing product and I would highly recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, my 16 year old daughter used on a break out on her chin before bed.  By morning all swelling was gone and redness.  And she has oil pron skin too!  I have never been about to use oil products on my face before this product. 2 drops make my skin so soft and reduces fine lines and this dry patch I always get at the corner of my mouth in the winter. I also put a few drops on the ends of my hair.  Love it.  Great for dry nails too.</li>
            <li> I love the way it melts into my skin and moisturizes without being oily or heavy. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This product will change your hair, skin, and nails. A must-buy. Clears and moisturizes acne-prone skin, makes hair shiny and smooth. I don&#x27;t even need to blow-dry my fluffy straight hair bc a drop makes it lie flat.</li>
            <li> I use this daily to help with my dry skin.  If goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  Not even aware that it is on.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my hair, but it is great for nails also, including toes. Very much satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This brand&#x27;s argan oil was everything I wanted: high quality and effective for my sensitive skin. I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Love it! Purchased one for me and my mom. My mother is in her 50&#x27;s and has never been keen on putting things on her face that are not 100% natural. She really loves this product as she noticed it helped with the appearance of lines; especially around the eyes. I mix 3 drops with my cream/lotion every day and I have oily/combination skin. There have been NO breakouts. I love how it moisturizes my skin and gives off this dewey glow. I really feel like i am doing something great for my skin when I use this product. Since then I have tried Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil and am more convinced that Mogador is the real deal. The oil has a nutty smell to this but its not overpowering and goes away once applied</li>
            <li> Love this oil I use it for everything, from my nails to moisturize the cuticle, to make my hair shine after i low dry it, to using it as a moisturizer at night on my face! It is 100% natural and it works quite well for everything I use it for! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great oil. Not too greasy. Helps my face stay moisturizer instead of so dry it gets flakey. Can wear it under makeup, but I forego my primer on days I do. Has a slightly nutty scent, but pleasant and not noticeable at all when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Mogador Organic Argan Oil can be used for many purposes. I use it to give my hair a shiny finish after washing it while also to get rid of frizz.  I have short hair so I use only three drops; I put a drop on three fingertips, rub the fingers on both hands together, run my fingers through my hair, then dry my hair.  The result is lustrous shiny hair with no frizz.  You can also use it to get rid of dry skin and blemishes, condition cuticles, as much more. This product is awesome. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;m definitely getting more.</li>
            <li> I love it... not so oily, it&#x27;s best for dry skin.  A+ for me!  Will purchase again in the future.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Nice skin product. Skin feels really soft and renewed after using it.</li>
            <li> pure and great for smoothing my hair</li>
            <li> After considerable amount of reading I decided to give argan oil a try. Received my shipment within 3 days. Product arrived in good condition. Not sure what to expect, first impression, a little watery but absorbed quickly into skin. Was worried it might be too much for my skin, have combination skin, but no breakouts so far. Happy about that. I am using this in combination with vit. C , so far they both work well together. Result, not sure yet. Will have to update at a later time.</li>
            <li> I read in a magazine that professional make up artists use Argan oil when applying foundation. I thought what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it.  I put this stuff on my face at least twice a day and have really noticed a difference in the softness and appearance of fine lines. It sort of plumps up your face to have a feel like  teenagers and children have (weird description, but that&#x27;s what it makes me think of). No scent which I like and I love the dropper so I know I am not contaminating the product when getting it out of the bottle. I use about 4-5 drops every application so this bottle will probably last 5-6 months, great value.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about Argan oil and have stayed away from it while the whole world was raving about it. I ordered this one after thinking about it for a long time. This is money well spent. I have been using this on my hair and skin and I love it already. Delivery was quick and the bottle reached safely.  It will take pages to explain how soft my hair and skin feel after only 3 uses of this oil. This brand seems like the real deal I am stocking up. I am going to reorder 3 more bottles for myself and my sister.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few months now.  After the first few days, my skin started looking really dull, but I kept using it.  After a couple weeks of dull skin, my skin slowly started getting better and better.  I can even go without foundation/make up.  All I need is a little eye liner and chap stick.  I wasn&#x27;t able to do this in my 20s, but my skin looks better now (more even).  Maybe this oil works from the inside out.  Takes out all the gunk built up through the years, which will take some time.  I bought one for my sister, &amp; she loves it too.  This is the only argan oil I have used, &amp; I will stick with this brand.  Why mess with a good thing, right?!&lt;br /&gt;Also, I forgot to mention that I haven&#x27;t had to exfoliate my face since I started using this oil.  I used to exfoliate once a week because my skin felt bumpy when I washed my face.  The bumpiness reminded me that I had to exfoliate.  Now, my face feels smooth every time I wash my face.  I am a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> It was recommended by a friend. She let me try some of hers for a few days. I ordered mine and am very happy. I have extremely dry skin and it is giving me the moisture that I have not gotten from other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that researches things to death.  I prefer to read the negative (1 or 2 star reviews especially) to see what people don&#x27;t like about a product.  There are a few one-star and two-star ratings that made me worry.  And there were some responses by the seller that struck me as defensive and that almost made me give more credence to these negative comments.  In the end, I bought Mogador Certified organic 100% pure argan oil and I&#x27;ve been using it for a week.  I love it.  It has the slightly nutty scent (I&#x27;m asian and it kind of reminds me of a very light sesame oil...sort of), glides on my skin really smoothly, and has been really amazing to my skin.  I have very sensitive skin and suffered from severe acne in college.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of over-the-counter as well as strong strong strong prescription medication (including Accutane!...though if I had truly understood how strong it was back then, I probably would have chosen not to).  I break out very easily and suffer from super oily skin and periods/patches of really unbearably dry flaky red/pink skin.  I was really worried that this Argan oil would make me break out.  However, it&#x27;s strangely evened out my complexion, making my T-zone less oily and my dry cheeks and nose-creases more moisturized.  When I put it on, I use a lot more than what the other posters have been saying.  Others use 2-3 drops for their face.  I use almost 10 and it soaks right in (maybe that just reflects how dry my skin is right now as the winter is starting).  Anyway, I no longer wake up with a slick oily face.  I wake up and my skin is moisturized and *not* oily looking or oily feeling.  I haven&#x27;t broken out at all (and other things I&#x27;ve used can break me out significantly in 2-3 days).  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week so I&#x27;m excited to see what my skin will look like in  1 month.  I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This is the most versatile product in my beauty product collection.  I use it every single day for my hands, or cuticles, or the ends of my hair.  I even use it on my face when it feels dry and my skin never breaks out.  It is the most soothing moisturizer on the planet.  Love, love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have bought plain extra virgin olive oil. Feels, smells and has the same effect as this product. Not at all Argan Oil</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!!  Can be hard to find a true pure argan oil, but this one is. This is as good, if not better, than the Josie Maran brand at a much more reasonable price point. Do not let the initial scent put you off. It will quickly dissipate, and is actually a sign of it being the true stuff from Morocco. This will be my new argan oil. So pleased to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough about Argan oil, it delivers on its claims. Its wonderful for skin and hair. I add this to my cosmetic regime for my hair, it has wonderful results, the shine is amazing. Very high quality oil.</li>
            <li> Low odor -- no adverse reactions or breakouts (my skin is very sensitive) -- cruelty free -- nice packaging (both appearance and usability)! I&#x27;ve been switching all of my beauty products over the last 6 months to pure, vegan, and cruelty free. This is great for your face, once you have transitioned from moisturizer to oil. It took me at least 3 months so be patient! Now my skin is so soft, more even, and I seem to have fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and hands ! Seems to be working great...my hands and face look younger ! Price is O.K.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting this on your face...too oily, greasy and does&#x27;t absorb. After I applied it to my face, it looked like a snake vomited me out. Or if you do put it on your face, use it at night and sparingly. And also, on my hair it was wayyy too greasy. With this, just use tiny amounts..it will go a long way. Great natural, true product. Just use sparingly and at night.</li>
            <li> I usually use some type of oil on my face and hair so I was looking forward to trying the Argan oil. My hairdresser uses it and swears by it. Since receiving I use it on my hair while damp (1 drop) and then I use on my face before my morning moisturizing routine. I like how my face responds to this product. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The cost per unit of measure is a bit higher, but unlike many of the competing offers this one seems high purity, doesn&#x27;t have any odor, a complaint I have noticed about other brands. I have a dry skin problem likely related to the fact I am living in an area where the water is supplied from a desalination plant and it exacerbates skin oil loss. I have found using it has helped alot.</li>
            <li> I apply this to my face and neck daily and my skin has more elasticity and feels great! It does not irritate the face and absorbs quickly. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is potent, so you don&#x27;t need much.  I put a couple drops and rub all over my face and scalp before moisturizing and it really has made a difference in the appearance of my skin.  I use around eyes without irritation, though i do need to apply sparingly there or it will be too oily to be comfortable due to potency.  No odor.</li>
            <li> Very good product love it ,use it every day in my face and  for my hair it has done a spectacular difference before was dry now is soft</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews that you could use it on hair, skin and nails. I recently went from a dark brown to blonde hair color and wanted something that would keep my hair moisturized. I really like the product and think it makes my hair shiny. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell but it&#x27;s not enough to quit using.</li>
            <li> First, I live in Korea. That is why it takes a lot of time to arrive at my house(about 50days). This was bad situation. But my sister who is real user said \\&quot;Best, hair&#x27;s shine is come back and its volume is good.</li>
            <li> The for stars is because i bought this argan oil to my sister, and she didn&#x27;t have time to report all the qualitys she might be realized using this product. But first of all, she lovely this argan oil because it doesn&#x27;t have any smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As quatro estrelas são apenas porque minha irmã ainda não usou efetivamente o óleo de argan. Mas ela gostou muito, de início, do fato de ele ser sem cheiro.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after hearing about it&#x27;s healing properties. I must say that I agree with others about the temporary odd, nutty smell. I actually mix it with my organic shea butter to put on my Eczema and it works well. I use this in my hair right after I wash my hair. I love the dropper bottle.</li>
            <li> The oil is great and seems to be of good quality. I love it! And its very affordable!</li>
            <li> I received my oil a few days ago and can already see differences in my skin. I usually have terribly oily skin where I am shinning within an hour and am constantly blotting my skin. Well, since using this oil for the past 4 days, I have had  minimal shine! For me, it is worth the price just for that. I also notice my skin is softer in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very concentrated so I only need to use a few drops and I can cover my face and neck. Because I am using so little at a time, this 2.1oz bottle will last me for a very long time - so the value is definitely there for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell...it smells like rotten nuts to me HOWEVER the smell only lasts a few seconds. By the time I massage it into my skin, the smell is gone. I would not stop using this product due to smell the benefits far outweigh a few seconds of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to purchase some for my 24 year old daughter!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of good reports of Argan Oil, and wanted to try some for both my hair and my skin. This product is well priced compared to many that are available.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I tried was to use a small amount in my hair, since I tend to get frizz. I only used a very small quantity, but found it a little too greasy for hair use.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is lovely on my face, neck and hands. It moisturizes without greasiness, all the oil is absorbed. I have a tendency to have dry skin, and use this oil every day. I use only a few drops on my face and neck, then rub the leftover oil on my hands. I do not need to wash my hands or rub off excess oil, because it completely disappears into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is lasting quite a long time, and I will buy another as soon as this one gets low.&lt;br /&gt;Super product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price...Been using it for about a month and it&#x27;s wonderful....Lives up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it works wonders.  Makes my skins and hair super soft.  The prices ia really great.</li>
            <li> I am 92 and it has improved my skin better than all other much costlier products I have used, people are shocked when they find out I am that age with such a clear and smooth complexion . I like the way it is absorbed into the skin and makeup goes on so well over it.&lt;br /&gt;It is the most remarkable product I have ever used !</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year and still have half the bottle. I have dry skin and argan oil makes an amazing face moisturizer. I only need a few drops twice a day and my skin looks soft and glowing, and I don&#x27;t get dry patches throughout the day. I feel that I get fewer breakouts with this product as well. The bottle is worth the money since I use significantly less argan oil than drugstore moisturizer, and it works much better. I also use it for hair treatments in combination with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Not the cheapest, but definitely amongst the best, and accurate to the fact that it&#x27;s organic with the evidence of a roasted, nutty,&lt;br /&gt;smell, unlike others that are, obviously mixed with other oils, like the ELMA &amp; SANA brand, calling it 100% organic when you&lt;br /&gt;can smell castor oil, or something similar, all over the place. They have some serious explaining to do to customers who can tell the&lt;br /&gt;difference from their brand and this one; cause I sure could, the moment I opened the bottles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have terrible skin before using this, but I did have some discoloration from old acne. This seems to be healing it - and it makes my skin very soft. I also use a few drops in my hair (in place of frizz-ease AND heat protectant), and my husband has been trying it out in place of his beard conditioner. We&#x27;ve both noticed it making our hair much softer and shinier. It&#x27;s pricey, but considering how few drops need to be used and how many uses it has, it&#x27;s a very good item to have. I don&#x27;t like the smell, but it&#x27;s not strong and can be masked by combining it with a drop or two of essential oils.</li>
            <li> This product caused my skin to breakout. Red bumps and acne appeared gradually over a two week period.  This product is not for me. I am going back to Bio Oil.</li>
            <li> This product actually makes my skin feel great and I am now using it every day instead of what I used to use. I put it under my sunblock  and it makes it easier to get the sunblock off.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I use it on my face, hair and nails.</li>
            <li> This is the best and most simple product for your skin -face, neck, body. I have used argan  oil for almost  3 years. It has made my skin healthier than I have ever seen it. I use it from forehead to elbow to feet. For about 2 years I was a brand that cost more -than-twice this brand (because I didn&#x27;t think to look on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;this brand is exactly the same in quality, the affect on my skin and purity. FYI this is a fine oil - it will get through your fingers, I apply directly on forehead - cheeks - neck -arms and smooth it in. The oil still on finger rob into cuticles, back of hands,ear lobe /back of ear area,etc. The oil does absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This argan oil, unlike some others, has almost no odor. It is an excellent moisturizer and wrinkle minimizer for my face and is light enough to be used under makeup. Usually I apply the argan oil, followed by a light moisturizer and then a light liquid foundation. As a 63 year old, it has also been helpful in plumping up the skin on my neck and upper chest. Although it might seem expensive, a little truly goes a long way. A 2 oz. bottle will last for 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> This has really tamed my hair and made it much softer and less frizzy. I have long hair and use more than the recommended few drops, however.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant buying oil in place of my Olay face cream..will never go back to face cream again! My hair is naturally curly &amp; a few drops of the oil does wonders. Goes on light, no greasy facial appearance. Most of all it has provided so much smoothness in my skin, especially around my eyes! Highly recommended product, will save you $$ in the long run!</li>
            <li> After reading many great things about this product I decided to give it a try for myself.  The product is quite concentrated so a little goes a long way.  I love how smooth and soft my skin looks and feels after I apply it.  I use just a few drops each morning and night after I clean my face.  I also apply a drop around my eyes and on my neck to keep the skin smooth and supple.  I have not been using the product long enought to know if it does everything it claims to do but so far I am pleased with the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> My argan is now oiled up nice</li>
            <li> I was not sure how my sensitive skin would react to an oil but I was trusting a good friend who has been using this product and swears by it.  I was amazed at how young she looks, as if she were in her twenties (we are mid thirties).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after using this product consistently every day since I received it, I see the results.  My fine lines have decreased, my skin tone has improved and I just look younger!  In fact, I was just carded a few days ago!!!  I will probably use this product for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to help my dry skin keep moist without it being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Love the Argan oil and even use it on my face with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I intend to keep purchasing this item as long as it&#x27;s available.  This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love 😍 love 😍 it.....&lt;br /&gt;For over ten years I have acne and it&#x27;s scares and this to a woman is such a confidence killer. I tries it al from proactive Clearasil etc. Then came my friend from Tunisia who during a girls night sleep over gave me a drop of the oil and it was soothing and soft on skin. She let me keep the bottle. And here we are 6 months later using the oil for everything....&lt;br /&gt;For the face I use a drop of argAn oil and small Shea Butter daytime and night argAn oil and treetea oil. I now have Clear skin not even on scarand I don&#x27;t have to usevit daily.&lt;br /&gt;I started last month to mix it with emu oil for stretch marks will see how it goes.</li>
            <li> I just got it yesterday and I ALREADY love it..This is really a wonderful oil..I will write more later..but I am so happy already!!</li>
            <li> Argan oil is my beauty obsession. My skin looks awe-mazing since using this. I mix this with my moisturizer am/pm and in my body lotion. I was using Josie Maran but it&#x27;s cost prohibitive and this is exactly the same thing for half the price AND a bigger bottle. #DEAL. Not only that, the delivery time was GREAT I ordered on 1.30.13 and rec&#x27;d it on 2.1.13 at the lowest shipping price. I&#x27;m one happy cupcake!</li>
            <li> I have been using argan oil for several months now and I absolutely love it!!!  This product is a must for anyone looking to avoid the harsh chemicals and toxins which are in most lotions and creams these days.  The oil goes on light and absorbs rather quickly.  There is no fragrance added for those concerned with artificial scents.  This oil can be used on your body, face and in your hair.  This is truly an excellent, organic oil.</li>
            <li> Economical and meets my expectations. This particular brand has a slight odor which I am not pleased to have in the product.</li>
            <li> Probably the best brand of Argan oil I have used.  I used to shell out big bucks for Josie Maran, which is also good, but this is just as effective at a lower price.  Sometimes, quality does come with a lower price.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> From the moment I first used this, I could almost feel the moisture penetrating my skin. I am blessed with very good skin, not too dry or too oily and this product does not interfere in that balance. It enhances and softens.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this so much, unfortunately a few days after using it my face broke out all over! My entire forehead was covered in zits, and I rarely breakout there. I occasionally use this product for my hair and it works well for that. I know everyone has different skin types and some products that work well for some don&#x27;t for others, so just use this with caution if you are acne prone. Also my mom, who is over fifty and never has problems with acne used this after I told her I couldn&#x27;t. She also broke out a bit on her cheeks, hers wasn&#x27;t to the extent of mine but it ha negative reaction with her skin as well</li>
            <li> This argan oil is nice and rich; it absorbs quickly into the skin. Great product for the body and hands.</li>
            <li> I had been using 100%&#x27;Argan Oil by Josie Maran, but it was 3x as expensive.  This product doesn&#x27;t have the fancy packaging but it is exactly the same oil.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with really dry skin. My skin is very dry and this oil just made it worse! This stuff just made my skin dryer. Not buying again.</li>
            <li> This positive about this product is that it is non oily after application but I don&#x27;t find that it moisturizes the skin. I&#x27;ve applied to hands and arms, face, neck and chest, feet and hair. It did leave a strange feel to the hair and i only used a drop rubbed between my hands before applying. I was disappointed as the reviews have made this sound like the wonder oil of the decade.  I still prefer the apricot oil but it is only for a longer period of time. I saw the results of apricot oil in Ladakh where it is applied to skin and hair as well as drizzling over pancakes or crepes. I don&#x27;t know what they are called.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway that my 2 cents for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Dear Amazon Friends,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been Amazon shopping for years. (Before most people heard of Amazon actually.)  Yet, this is the first review I have taken the time to write.  This is an AMAZING product, I&#x27;m 46 and my skin has been getting drier and duller looking over the past number of years.  Pure Argan Oil was not something I was familiar with, but I purchased it becasue of the reviews.  BIG, HUGE thanks to those who reviewed this becasue it has changed the look and feel of my skin.  I love it.  I love it.  Thnak you!</li>
            <li> I have tried Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil by Ecocert, 2oz size for the use of 2 bottle worth if you will. I wet my hair and applied the Organic Argon Oil. Then I dried it with the blow dryer, and curled it with the electric curling irons. I naturally have a problem with extremely dry and fine hair. Because my hair is so fine, and so dry, when I blow dry and curl my hair, I can&#x27;t get out of the bathroom before my hair start swelling up, so I most often wore my hair natural, because it is naturally wavy or curly.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 months I have been using this product, My hair looks so healthy, it seems like my split ends disappear, and it looks like it has been professionally done. The most noticeable to me is that my hair stays looking good all day. The reason it doesn&#x27;t last for 2 or 3 days or more is because I sweat in my scalp heavily every night when I sleep. I HAVE TRIED A MANY OF PRODUCTS TO FIND SOMETHING TO MOISTURIZE MY HAIR ENOUGH TO MAKE IT LAST ALL DAY... BUT UNTIL I FOUND Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil BY ECOCERT, THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE! Thank God that I ran across Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil BY ECOCERT.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;I must also tell you that I use it on my face also. Just like with my hair, I wet my face 1st, then drop a couple of drops on the palm of my hand a rub my hands together, then I apply it to my face. I also put 1 drop, on 2 of my fingers and rub them together with the same 2 fingers on the other hand to apply a concentrated version on my dark circles under my eyes. To my surprise, after doing this for 2 weeks, my neighbor and her daughter told me that my dark circles had lighten up tremendously!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004S2G4FG Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil 2oz (60 mL)]]</li>
            <li> true thing, absolutely love it! I was looking for the substitute for the oil a friend of mine brought from Morocco, and this one has exactly the same consistency and scent.</li>
            <li> I had been using Josie Maran Argan Oil for some time before I decided to switch to a cheaper alternative. This Argan Oil is a life and wallet saver! It delivers the same (or perhaps better) results at a great price!!! I use it at a beauty product. I apply it on my face before bedtime almost every night after cleansing. The appearance of the fine lines on my face have diminished significantly. Cannot ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do half of the things the positive reviews say.  Seems like just an over priced Oil. Wasn&#x27;t worth it for me. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I use this oil to heal my dry chapped hands and after two weeks I have experienced a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> I heard that putting argan oil on your face helps with blemishes - I used my points at Sephora to try out the smallest bottle of Josie Maran Argan Oil and I found that it was true - it cleared up any imperfections on my face and kept breakouts away.  I ran out and wanted to buy more but when I found out that the larger bottle was super expensive, I decided to look for another option. I came across this one here, on Amazon.  I decided to purchase it because it is an organic, 100% pure argan oil - the reviews were really good, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I&#x27;m glad I did purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - After using this product for a little while now I broke out all over my face and in places I NEVER break out.  And these weren&#x27;t normal pimples, they were painful, deep, cyst-like pimples and I have never had pimples like this before.  Also, I noticed the tone of my skin started to look off, and I had little red pumps that started to develop on my cheeks and chin.  I know this stuff says it is organic and pure argan oil which is why I was so happy with the purchase because it was pretty cheap but I think it isn&#x27;t true argan oil, at least the kind you should be putting on your face.  I went out right away and purchased the Josie Maran oil, I know it&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s worth it, my face is already healing and started to look better after a couple times of using the Josie Maran Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this purchase, I learned that you get what you pay for - if the stuff is cheap and it&#x27;s claiming it is pure organic argan oil most likely it isn&#x27;t - and I found out the hard way.  True argan oil isn&#x27;t cheap, so when you find a cheap bottle claiming it is 100% pure, question it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, sensitive skin. This product is great! My skin feels soft and it actually glows. A must have</li>
            <li> This product is top of the line. Having used a variety of Argan products over the years, this product has stood apart in quality and purity. I use regularly for skin and hair application and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great penitration, no cloudiness, oderless. Great value Great bottle &amp; dropper. Nine more words are required so here they are.</li>
            <li> For the price, this argon oil is great. I have tried more expensive oil, but this oil works just as well. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me this oil for my birthday and I love it. I wear it over my moisturizer and after my skin absorbs it  my face feels soft all day.</li>
            <li> Great skin moisturizer for evenings, but can be used during the day depending on the individual&#x27;s desire. I will recommed to friends.</li>
            <li> I do not like using the dropper. I prefer using a spray.  I found this brand of argon oil to be a bit heavier than another brand that I have purchased used in the past.</li>
            <li> Great vendor great product.. Thank you.</li>
            <li> To my surprise the lines around my mouth are disappearing and the wrinklles under my eyes have lessened.  My face and neck feel very soft, too.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this product by a friend and it seemed like it really would help my overly dry hands. So I ordered a bottle and over the course of a couple of weeks, it really has made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I have bought this about three times now. I am just believing that it has the properties it professes to have. I use it for my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff does smell a bit too earthy for my taste - in terms of size and value it is good - but I won&#x27;t be using it bc the odor isn&#x27;t too my liking.  I am sad bc it is an excellent value for Argan oil.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous and the customer service couldn&#x27;t have been better.  Placed the order and in two days there it was.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews on Amazon and decided to try.  Hope to never run out.  It is the first moisturizer zi apply, let it absorb, and apply a serum and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there!  Don&#x27;t be fooled by other BS Argan oil products out there that are seriously pathetic.  This one is the real deal.  I use it every night on my skin and I swear it does make a big difference in the quality of your skin.</li>
            <li> I was using a much more expensive brand of argan oil when I decided to try this one. The quality of this brand was just as good as the more expensive brand. I was afraid I would have a problem with the scent, but I could not smell anything. This is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> This is nice. It doesn&#x27;t smell so I don&#x27;t understand the complaints about the smell. I had previously used bio-oil but found out it had mineral oil and I wanted to use something more natural. It&#x27;s only been a few days and I haven&#x27;t noticed the dramatic changes I hoped for in my face but it does moisturizer nicely and when I applied to my hair it really makes it shiny.</li>
            <li> not for me... makes my skin age, rapidly. I read reviews be4 purchasing..&lt;br /&gt;I was swayed into buying it.. but i guess my journey forwarding its progress.&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is combination oily blotchy dull and it varies from different weathers..&lt;br /&gt;then this is not for you trus, maybe in a warmer climate this will have a satistfaction&lt;br /&gt;for all types of skin.</li>
            <li> This oil is beautiful...I use it on my face and body to help with dry skin. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Hey, it does what it says!  For a face product on Amazon that amazing right there!  I like it because I can use this with my skinceuticals retinol (my go to retinol) and it prevents peeling when I go a little overboard.  Does not cause any type of breakout at all and it normally seems almost everything clogs my pores, if anything it helps the occasional hormonal breakout.  I really like the effect on my neck and chest, really smooths the skin there where it is just starting to &amp;#34;crinkle&amp;#34; a little (not a word you want to use describing your skin!). While I love this I did find another brand that had twice the oil for only $10 more that works just as well.</li>
            <li> As much as I rely on reviews, it&#x27;s only right that I leave one about this Argon oil, which absolutely lives up to its reviews.  I began using it several weeks ago.  I&#x27;ve never used any type of oil on my skin.  Even non-comedogenic creams my dermatologist recommended would invariably cause pores to clog.  This is amazing.  After dipping my toe in the water, so to speak, I began to lightly coat my face every night.  No bad reaction, and my face is softer than ever.  But most importantly:  the blotchiness on the side of my face and neck has gone away.  I use about three drops a night (a little goes a long way) and I put it in the palm of my hand, then use the other hand to spread the oil.  As others have suggested, I rub the excess on my fingernails, and they&#x27;re looking healthier, too.  Since this bottle will last a long time, I figure it&#x27;s an affordable way to pamper yourself and look healthier, too.</li>
            <li> I read through many reviews and settled on this brand in particular - it did take me a few weeks to see results, but now, after about 2 to 3 weeks, my skin is softer, more supple and the winter dullness has faded.  I&#x27;ve also exfoliated with the Oil of Olay brush and cream, then applied the oil  and slept fitfully.  That combination seems to work best - There was a definite dryness that this oil has diminished and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in the texture and glow of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face at night and during the day, and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  The only difference during the day is that I wear spf on top.  I&#x27;d wear it alone if I could though.  I only need a few drops to cover my entire face.  It leaves my skin soft, and it&#x27;s non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d left feedback about the dropper coming in damaged and about the slightly rancid smell.  The seller contacted me soon after and quickly fixed my dropper issue.  They also explained that the smell is from the raw Argan pressed nuts.  They don&#x27;t deodorize it because it wouldn&#x27;t be organic if they did.  The smell is also faint and does not linger on the skin.  It does remind me slightly of sesame oil as some other reviewers have mentioned.  But it&#x27;s nothing offensive.  My friend who&#x27;ve been using the Josie Maran Argan Oil didn&#x27;t think anything wrong with the smell of the Mogador Argan Oil either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll most likely be purchasing another bottle once I&#x27;ve used this one up.</li>
