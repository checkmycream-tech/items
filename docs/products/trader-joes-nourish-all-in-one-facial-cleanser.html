            <li>For reference, I have very fair, oily skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks incredibly nourished.</li>
            <li>, I would also recommend their shea butter hand lotion, especially right now for the winter! :D</li>

            <li>I love this, and I will always buy this from now on along with the moisturizer, so perfect for my sensitive, combo, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the moisturizer as well, as it is light and feels so wonderful!</li>
            <li>My sister enjoyed this cleanser</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe to use on your eyes.</li>
            <li>And for such a great price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice daily since discovering it a couple of months ago, and my skin&#x27;s very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that I need to wash twice with this if trying to get water-proof sunscreen off, but that is true of many cleansers.</li>
            <li>I can now go out in the sun and my face remains OIL FREE...</li>
            <li>when i first tried it, i liked that it was mildly exfoliating</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stocking up b/c if you&#x27;re familiar with Trader Joe&#x27;s, you know how they discontinue everything.  </li>
            <li>It smells interesting and that takes a little getting used to, but I&#x27;m happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li>Great product and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li>not leave any residue on the skin and leaves my face feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>You can always return it there for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had been struggling to find something nice and natural to wash my face with.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so fresh and clean after each wash.</li>
            <li>Very good for dry and super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And these important elements are not in teeny weeny type, packed at the very bottom of the ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>It cleans well and leaves your face feeling fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Cleans deep into the pores and leaves your face feeling very smooth.  </li>
            <li>After using it my skin was left so clean and oil free.</li>
            <li>I rec checking the price at your TJ&#x27;s first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using Trader Joe&#x27;s products and I love everything I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>It is thick and rich and foams up and feels amazing, skin is clean feeling and not tight at all!</li>
            <li>Absolutely no irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li>and (i thought) gentle.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>For the price, you really have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for everyone except super oily or super dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on cleansing products that don&#x27;t work in the past, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across so far.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is mild and non-irritating enough for my senstive skin, is not drying, gentle enough to use around the eyes, yet gets my skin completely clean.</li>
            <li>will most likely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>None of them were able to get me the results that this little gem valued at $5.99 could do.</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s only useful as a summer cleanser.</li>
            <li>(neutrogena acne prone facial bar, which mostly cleared my skin and doesnt dry me out)</li>
            <li>This is a great face wash, I was very skeptical about trying a skin care product from a grocery store line at first.</li>
            <li>you live near a Trader Joe&#x27;s, pick it up in store.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>do wish it was a bit thicker because it goes fast with daily (morning and evening)</li>
            <li>I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin and this wash</li>
            <li>I naturally have oily skin, but after using this my skin isn&#x27;t oily anymore.</li>
            <li>I have combination dry/oily skin, so dry on the cheeks and oily on my t-zone (nose and forehead) and I also have really large pores.</li>
            <li>The face washes I&#x27;ve used in the past always left my face feeling dry, no matter what kind of moisturizer I used on it afterwards.</li>
            <li>not over dry my skin or irritate it which I appreciated.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my dry, sensitive acne prone skin clear!!</li>
            <li>I also suffer from occasional rosacea and since switching to this natural wash, I haven&#x27;t had a rosacea outbreak since.</li>

            <li> I cannot relate to the positive reviews on this product at all and found them to be unbelievable after my experience, but yes, all skin types are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very foamy and only takes a small amount.  </li>
            <li> but with continued use my face got slightly irritated and dry even though my face is normally oily.</li>
            <li> but it would get in my eyes and burn and redden them--it would also leave my face really dry and tight, which couldn&#x27;t be fixed even with a moisturizer (I tried 3 different ones).</li>
            <li> After I started using this (and pairing it with the oil-free moisturizer that goes with it), my skin no longer felt dry.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any issues with it leaving my skin dry.</li>
            <li> A single bottle lasts me about 5-6 months (I wash my face twice a day).</li>
            <li> You only need very little amount to wash the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never leave so my skin tight or dry.</li>
            <li> use due to the thinner</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about this cleanser, but I purchased it on a recommendation from a friend.</li>
            <li> My breakouts have tamed and I&#x27;ve noticed less pimples.</li>
            <li> so I add a few drops of sunflower seed oil to it (will not cause acne at all) to be a little less harsh during those times.</li>
            <li> Can be a little drying during a harsh Midwest winter</li>
            <li> They include retinyl palmitate, alpha lipoic acid, Co-Q 10, green tea, copper peptides, amino acids and a ton of vitamins.  </li>
            <li> since been using Shea Moisture raw Shea butter bar soap.</li>
            <li> Desperately needed help with dry skin due to a harsh winter.</li>
            <li> and I think this cleanser is one that everyone should at least try.</li>
            <li> I have mildly sensitive skin, this product irritated my face, left me feeling even drier and caused me to have terrible breakouts.</li>
            <li> Some of the prices listed online are wonky.</li>

            <li> Very good for dry and super sensitive skin. Absolutely no irritating ingredients. Helps keep my dry, sensitive acne prone skin clear!! Can be a little drying during a harsh Midwest winter so I add a few drops of sunflower seed oil to it (will not cause acne at all) to be a little less harsh during those times. I would recommend this for everyone except super oily or super dry.</li>
            <li> My sister enjoyed this cleanser and I think this cleanser is one that everyone should at least try. when i first tried it, i liked that it was mildly exfoliating and (i thought) gentle. but with continued use my face got slightly irritated and dry even though my face is normally oily. maybe it&#x27;s only useful as a summer cleanser. currently i use something else (neutrogena acne prone facial bar, which mostly cleared my skin and doesnt dry me out)</li>
            <li> This face cleanser is the best. It&#x27;s safe to use on your eyes. I use it every day to remove my eye makeup. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Wow. This cleanser is mild and non-irritating enough for my senstive skin, is not drying, gentle enough to use around the eyes, yet gets my skin completely clean. And for such a great price! I have noticed that I need to wash twice with this if trying to get water-proof sunscreen off, but that is true of many cleansers. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Purchased at my local Trader Joe&#x27;s for $5.99. Desperately needed help with dry skin due to a harsh winter. I have mildly sensitive skin, this product irritated my face, left me feeling even drier and caused me to have terrible breakouts. I cannot relate to the positive reviews on this product at all and found them to be unbelievable after my experience, but yes, all skin types are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you live near a Trader Joe&#x27;s, pick it up in store. You can always return it there for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since been using Shea Moisture raw Shea butter bar soap. It has healed my skin and breakouts have stopped.</li>
            <li> Picked a bottle of this up from my local TJ&#x27;s and though it is a bit runny it still performed well and seemed to remove all my makeup well.&lt;br /&gt;Did not over dry my skin or irritate it which I appreciated. Also like that it isn&#x27;t fragranced.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it was a bit thicker because it goes fast with daily (morning and evening) use due to the thinner consistency.&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!  It smells wonderful.. a nice light scent.  It&#x27;s very foamy and only takes a small amount.  And I like that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve used. I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin and this wash has proven to be so beneficial for me. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 years and I&#x27;m very happy with my skin. I never leave so my skin tight or dry. I also suffer from occasional rosacea and since switching to this natural wash, I haven&#x27;t had a rosacea outbreak since. I also highly recommend the moisturizer as well, as it is light and feels so wonderful!</li>
            <li> Cleans deep into the pores and leaves your face feeling very smooth.  Been using for a week now and feel very happy with the purchase. Like another reviewer stated check your local Trader Joes store because you will probably find it cheaper in-store than online.</li>
            <li> The face washes I&#x27;ve used in the past always left my face feeling dry, no matter what kind of moisturizer I used on it afterwards. After I started using this (and pairing it with the oil-free moisturizer that goes with it), my skin no longer felt dry. This cleanser is a lot gentler than the face washes you get everywhere else, but at the same time it leaves your skin feeling refreshed. And it&#x27;s cheaper too ($6 if u buy it at Trader Joe&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> A way to get Trader Joe&#x27;s products here in Hawaii</li>
            <li> Check out the ingredients in this cleanser:  you could pay a fortune for all this in a department store.  They include retinyl palmitate, alpha lipoic acid, Co-Q 10, green tea, copper peptides, amino acids and a ton of vitamins.  And these important elements are not in teeny weeny type, packed at the very bottom of the ingredient list.  They fill this cleanser with generous amounts of the good stuff.  I&#x27;ve used it twice daily since discovering it a couple of months ago, and my skin&#x27;s very happy with it.  Perfect for use with the Clarisonic.  For reference, I have very fair, oily skin. I also bought the sister moisturizer.  I&#x27;m stocking up b/c if you&#x27;re familiar with Trader Joe&#x27;s, you know how they discontinue everything.  Get it before it&#x27;s gone!  btw, I purchased an 8.45 oz bottle in the store for $5.99. Some of the prices listed online are wonky. I rec checking the price at your TJ&#x27;s first.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really do anything. don&#x27;t understand why the reviews are so good. just a regular face wash</li>
            <li> This is a great face wash, I was very skeptical about trying a skin care product from a grocery store line at first. A single bottle lasts me about 5-6 months (I wash my face twice a day). You only need very little amount to wash the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not leave any residue on the skin and leaves my face feeling squeaky clean. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with it leaving my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I had been struggling to find something nice and natural to wash my face with. I had been using a neutrogena face bar to wash my face but it would get in my eyes and burn and redden them--it would also leave my face really dry and tight, which couldn&#x27;t be fixed even with a moisturizer (I tried 3 different ones). I have combination dry/oily skin, so dry on the cheeks and oily on my t-zone (nose and forehead) and I also have really large pores. I bought this two or three weeks ago along with the moisturizer and it is AMAZING! For the price it cannot be beat. It just feels amazing! It does not burn or sting my eyes and my acne has been reduced and it seems to be balancing out my skin, since it is formulated by a dermatologist (check out this blog post: thelittlehenhouse.com/2011/10/13/the-best-kept-beauty-secret-at-trader-joes/) and says it works for all skin types--I believe it! It is thick and rich and foams up and feels amazing, skin is clean feeling and not tight at all! I have also in the last2-3 weeks since I have bought and used it 1-2 times a day (morning and night) I have noticed an incredible shrinking in my pores on my nose! I hadn&#x27;t even known that was possibly, I thought only makeup (aka.primers) could do that, but no! My skin feels and looks incredibly nourished. I love this, and I will always buy this from now on along with the moisturizer, so perfect for my sensitive, combo, acne-prone skin. It&#x27;s amazing! For the price, you really have nothing to lose. I&#x27;m new to using Trader Joe&#x27;s products and I love everything I&#x27;ve tried so far, I would also recommend their shea butter hand lotion, especially right now for the winter! :D</li>
            <li> HOLY GRAIL ITEM!! I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers. None of them were able to get me the results that this little gem valued at $5.99 could do. My skin feels so fresh and clean after each wash. And it does not aggravate my acne in any way, in fact, it might also be alleviating my acne symptoms lol.</li>
            <li> I NEVER leave reviews, but what the heck is this stuff. IT&#x27;S AMAZING! After using it my skin was left so clean and oil free. It has brightened my skin tone and evened it out. I naturally have oily skin, but after using this my skin isn&#x27;t oily anymore. I can now go out in the sun and my face remains OIL FREE...that never happens!! This product is truly amazing. I bought it at Trader Joe&#x27;s for $5.99.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about this cleanser, but I purchased it on a recommendation from a friend. It smells interesting and that takes a little getting used to, but I&#x27;m happy to have found this product. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on cleansing products that don&#x27;t work in the past, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across so far. It cleans well and leaves your face feeling fresh and hydrated. My breakouts have tamed and I&#x27;ve noticed less pimples. I would suggest this product to anyone looking for a great moisturizer.</li>
