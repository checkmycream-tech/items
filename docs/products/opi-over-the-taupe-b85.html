            <li>It is so creamy and gorgeous!  </li>
            <li>OPI over the taupe is a beautiful nude color.</li>
            <li>It was just beautiful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn both colors, but Over the Taupe is a great browney taupe shade.</li>
            <li>It is a bit lighter than You Don&#x27;t Know Jacques, but still gives the great look of a darker polish.</li>
            <li>And of course, you have the great wearability of the OPI line.</li>
            <li>its lighter then you don&#x27;t jacques both are great.  </li>
            <li>I consider it a warmer and lighter shade than You Don&#x27;t Know Jacques from what I&#x27;ve seen, and while YDKJ looks great, this suits my skin tone</li>
            <li>Great product-</li>
            <li>so I am happy with the purchase</li>

            <li>I am so in love with this color!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in so many drug stores, and I have not found what I was looking for... until now!</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>Love some OPI colors and names!</li>
            <li>this is a nice rich brown that looks so good on my nails!</li>
            <li>The taupe-y neutral colors may be trendy but they look crappy when they are applied.</li>
            <li>you need to apply 3 or 4 coats for it to be true to color!!</li>
            <li>Very beautiful and great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>Altho, OPI is excellent polish and last well.</li>
            <li>but I cannot wear most of my color at work.</li>
            <li>you add a shiny top coat</li>
            <li>it is even more wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although \\&quot;You don&#x27;t know Jacques\\&quot; is a more famous color and the reference brown polish, I think \\&quot;Over the taupe\\&quot; is a better alternative.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>it the color stores can&#x27;t seem to keep on the shelf, I find that Over the Taupe is a better color.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to love this mushroom colored polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter then You don&#x27;t know Jacques which was always my favorite.</li>
            <li>I wear this alot more and it goes with more stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>and now its her favorite color as well.</li>
            <li>although this one is a bit deceiving, as most taupe colors can be.</li>
            <li>I love this color and this brand.  </li>
            <li>seriously love this color</li>
            <li>I love this color</li>
            <li>(no need for top coat) and</li>
            <li>and I am excited to try more</li>
            <li>The color is exactly as pictured and just as beautiful in real life as you&#x27;d hope for it to be.</li>
            <li>very smooth-- shipped quickly--</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, too!</li>
            <li>This paints on smooth</li>
            <li>Both shades look great, but completely different than what you expect!</li>
            <li>this unique color and...</li>
            <li>I was sort of throwed off by the color at first, but I love it now since I wear it with Audrey 625 by China Glaze.</li>
            <li>This is my first O.P.I. nail polish and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It looks great, lasts long and  goes with any thing.  </li>
            <li>This is not standard for me either, as I have a fair-ish skin complexion &amp; many colors simply do not look very good on me.</li>
            <li>It lacks that purple undertone some taupes have, making it a true taupe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a true taupe colored fingernail polish for what seems like forever.</li>
            <li>Product works great just like every other OPI I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>First, OPI is fantastic nail polish to begin with.  </li>
            <li>the colour is a classy neutral that is definitely suitable for work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The polish was kind of sheer at first coat, but two coats is fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very longlasting, being OPI brand and all (can easily go for a week without chipping).</li>
            <li>The polish is pricey but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It looks great on feet and hands and really looks sharp if add a design.  </li>
            <li>Totally need 2 maybe 3 coats for a good even look but for sure my new standard reliable color!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I saw the Kardashians wearing a similar shade and had to try it out since I love neutrals.</li>
            <li>exactly what was promised.</li>
            <li>You will be pleased with the final look!</li>
            <li>Have aleady ordered some more----had to find in the stores and also higher in the sotres</li>
            <li>I am super pale and nudes just kind of blend in.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this polish, and I highly recommend buying from this seller as well. :)</li>
            <li>The polish lasts very well after applied.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Application is really good, only 2 coats needed and like every other OPI polish the brush is very practical.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When painting a single layer on my toes it appeared very brownish, but when having a professional use it on my hands it had more of a purple glow to it.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to see that there is very minimal, if any, purple undertones in this color as there are in so many other similar ones!</li>
            <li>This is my new go to neutral!</li>
            <li>Definitely a fall must have, it looks super chic and it is a neutral</li>
            <li>It was thin and runny and did not have good coverage.</li>
            <li>In other words, it&#x27;s about 60% brown, 35% grey, and 5% slightest hint of rose.</li>
            <li>a very classy color that fits in a work environment.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and vivid colors ..</li>
            <li>I am not one to waste money on &#x27;fad&#x27; colors, Ilike pretty colors that work with anything  I wear.  </li>
            <li>A little too gray and not enough taupe for me, but still a highly unusual but still workplace-friendly shade.</li>

            <li> Sometimes I add a bit of sparkles on one nail to make it a little bit more flashy.</li>
            <li> and when it&#x27;s dry it looks like chocolate!  </li>
            <li> but the color matched what I expected and always like opi</li>
            <li> Will definitely need a top-coat per usual.</li>

            <li> I will buy this again and plenty of other colors.</li>
            <li> The color was too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark, muddy looking brown.  </li>
            <li> Typical OPI quality.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this one.  </li>
            <li> I wear this colour when I&#x27;m going for a subtle look.</li>
            <li> Because taupe colours are so vague, the easiest way for me to describe it is in hexadecimal: #594741.</li>
            <li> Ugly!  </li>
            <li> this \\&quot;over the taupe\\&quot; is horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First, OPI is fantastic nail polish to begin with.  Add to that this unique color and... WOW!!!  This paints on smooth and when it&#x27;s dry it looks like chocolate!  Beautiful!</li>
            <li> The taupe-y neutral colors may be trendy but they look crappy when they are applied. Altho, OPI is excellent polish and last well.</li>
            <li> OPI&#x27;s over the taupe is a gorgeous taupey brown. It lacks that purple undertone some taupes have, making it a true taupe. Definitely a fall must have, it looks super chic and it is a neutral so it goes with everything! Shipping was quick, too!</li>
            <li> Over the taupe is a deep brown with beige highlights.&lt;br /&gt;This a very classy color that fits in a work environment. I like wearing nail polish but I cannot wear most of my color at work. This is one of the few unusual color that you can wear without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is really good, only 2 coats needed and like every other OPI polish the brush is very practical.&lt;br /&gt;If you add a shiny top coat it is even more wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although \\&quot;You don&#x27;t know Jacques\\&quot; is a more famous color and the reference brown polish, I think \\&quot;Over the taupe\\&quot; is a better alternative.</li>
            <li> My favorite polish! I bought it after seeing Alison Sweeney wear it on TV. I love it. Even though You Don&#x27;t Know Jacques it the color stores can&#x27;t seem to keep on the shelf, I find that Over the Taupe is a better color. I&#x27;ve worn both colors, but Over the Taupe is a great browney taupe shade. It is a bit lighter than You Don&#x27;t Know Jacques, but still gives the great look of a darker polish. And of course, you have the great wearability of the OPI line.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to love this mushroom colored polish. It is lovely ... but can be a little boring on its own.</li>
            <li> OPI over the taupe is a beautiful nude color. its lighter then you don&#x27;t jacques both are great.  you need to apply 3 or 4 coats for it to be true to color!!</li>
            <li> This is my new go to neutral! It&#x27;s lighter then You don&#x27;t know Jacques which was always my favorite. I wear this alot more and it goes with more stuff. Totally need 2 maybe 3 coats for a good even look but for sure my new standard reliable color! I need to stock up!</li>
            <li> awesome color!  can&#x27;t find it in any store but soo glad I found it online!  LOVE THE COLOR!</li>
            <li> Love this item. I saw the Kardashians wearing a similar shade and had to try it out since I love neutrals. The color is exactly as pictured and just as beautiful in real life as you&#x27;d hope for it to be. My mother saw me wearing it and now its her favorite color as well. When I went to my manicurist, she complimented this color... I&#x27;ve had it on my toe&#x27;s since I purchased it.    Typical OPI quality. Will definitely need a top-coat per usual. I&#x27;ll be using this color all summer!</li>
            <li> Product works great just like every other OPI I have ever purchased. Long lasting and vivid colors .. although this one is a bit deceiving, as most taupe colors can be. When painting a single layer on my toes it appeared very brownish, but when having a professional use it on my hands it had more of a purple glow to it. Both shades look great, but completely different than what you expect!</li>
            <li> A little too gray and not enough taupe for me, but still a highly unusual but still workplace-friendly shade. Even though it&#x27;s not exactly what I wanted, I wear it ALL the time.</li>
            <li> I wear this colour when I&#x27;m going for a subtle look. It&#x27;s utlra chic and feminine. Being used to a lot of pinks and reds, I tried to give this neutral colour a try and I absolutely love it! I get a lot of compliments when I have this colour on. Sometimes I add a bit of sparkles on one nail to make it a little bit more flashy.</li>
            <li> I love this color and this brand.  The polish lasts very well after applied.  Sometimes as long as two weeks.</li>
            <li> seriously love this color I am super pale and nudes just kind of blend in. this is a nice rich brown that looks so good on my nails! I love this color and I am excited to try more</li>
            <li> This is an understated, no-frills creme finish that is quite glossy (no need for top coat) and the colour is a classy neutral that is definitely suitable for work. Because taupe colours are so vague, the easiest way for me to describe it is in hexadecimal: #594741. In other words, it&#x27;s about 60% brown, 35% grey, and 5% slightest hint of rose. I consider it a warmer and lighter shade than You Don&#x27;t Know Jacques from what I&#x27;ve seen, and while YDKJ looks great, this suits my skin tone better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish was kind of sheer at first coat, but two coats is fine. It&#x27;s also very longlasting, being OPI brand and all (can easily go for a week without chipping).</li>
            <li> Nail polish is not what I have come to expect from OPI. It was thin and runny and did not have good coverage.</li>
            <li> Ordered this polish on Tuesday and received it the next day. Very fast shipping. I was sort of throwed off by the color at first, but I love it now since I wear it with Audrey 625 by China Glaze. The color reminds me of melted milk chocolate. Will order from One41 beauty agin!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this color! I&#x27;ve been searching for a true taupe colored fingernail polish for what seems like forever. I&#x27;ve been in so many drug stores, and I have not found what I was looking for... until now! This is a great color that looks great on my skin! This is not standard for me either, as I have a fair-ish skin complexion &amp; many colors simply do not look very good on me. I was very pleased to see that there is very minimal, if any, purple undertones in this color as there are in so many other similar ones! I am very happy to have purchased this from this seller also, I received the polish well before the delivery estimate! I bought this polish on Tuesday, October 2, and according to the delivery estimate I should receive it anywhere from (tomorrow) Tuesday, October 9 to Friday, October 12. Soon after I bought the polish, it was shipped and I received it last Friday October 5. I definitely recommend this polish, and I highly recommend buying from this seller as well. :)</li>
            <li> Great product- good coverage-- very smooth-- shipped quickly-- exactly what was promised. I would almost call the color a milky chocolate color. Very beautiful and great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> The color was too dark for me.  Do not plan to buy this color again. Over all OPI products are excellent</li>
            <li> This is my first O.P.I. nail polish and I absolutely love it. I will buy this again and plenty of other colors.</li>
            <li> It is so creamy and gorgeous!  I got lots of compliments when I wore this color.  The polish is pricey but worth every penny.  This will be my go to medium brown.  It is the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li> What can be said about this. this the best taupe color I have found. I use this every fall. I also love it when I want a neutral nail, this is great.</li>
            <li> I love this color! Great neutral! You will be pleased with the final look! Love some OPI colors and names!</li>
            <li> It looks great, lasts long and  goes with any thing.  I am not one to waste money on &#x27;fad&#x27; colors, Ilike pretty colors that work with anything  I wear.  It looks great on feet and hands and really looks sharp if add a design.  Have aleady ordered some more----had to find in the stores and also higher in the sotres</li>
            <li> this \\&quot;over the taupe\\&quot; is horrible.  It&#x27;s not taupe at all.  It&#x27;s a dark, muddy looking brown.  Ugly!  Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this one.  There&#x27;s nothing taupe about it.</li>
            <li> I havent used it yet but the color matched what I expected and always like opi so I am happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> One day at a nail salon I was picking a color and saw this one. It was just beautiful so I purchased it! Lovely color and am very happy with the purchase.</li>
