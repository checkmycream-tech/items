            <li> Great product I recommend it to anyone looking for awesome hair. No mess no residue nothing but good looks. Remember to buy in bulk</li>
            <li> This is the best hair gel ever invented by mankind and could possibly solve world hunger if applied properly.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this gel for about a year now. It works great and has a good scent. It does make fine hair clump like any other gel. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a very good hair gel. Consider the smaller size however, because the 32 oz is a big jug and will be on your counter for quite a while.</li>
            <li> GREAT Gel! Really fast shipping. I use this product everyday. It has a really good hold and a decent smell. This was a great deal because usually one tub is about $25 so this is a really great deal!</li>
            <li> Outstanding gel! The best on the market in my opinion. Holds great all day. Clean and smells very pleasant.</li>

            <li> Great value. nice smell. does not flake. firm hold, but not too firm.</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves no residue. Has a great smell and I been using this product for the last 3 years and I love it! I have short hair and one 32oz bottle will last me 4 to 6 months. Shipping took longer than expected but well worth it!</li>
            <li> I have always used this gel. it is a bit cheaper online than in stores at any local barber shop.</li>
            <li> No issues. Love this product! Real easy and convenient. Have been ordering gel for awhile online. Always get what I want .</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this stuff. He will not use anything else. He says it doesnt flake and it doesnt leave his head sore from the stiffness. It smells great as well and the seller got it to us quite quickly and in great condition</li>
            <li> My sons really love this gel. It also has a mild male scent. It does not flake or build up</li>
            <li> No problems was here on time .</li>

            <li> Solid product been using this gel for 2 years. Amazing hold and easy cleaning</li>
            <li> Solid firm hold and leaves no flakes or residue. Even When you apply liberally, youre able to style your hair as you like.  Ive used this gel for a few years now, and i really dont buy anything else. ive used styling glues and pomades, but it doesnt do the job quite like this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! works amazing for my hair. the only gel that kept my hair tamed while playing sports or doing outside activity.(Works good not amazing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it all depends on your hair. My hair has been short and medium. I say it works great for short and medium hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair darker, but hard so not touching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easily comes off with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product last forever! I use it everyday and it can last me up to 4-5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product? Yes, I would!&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase this product again? Yes, I would. Still haven&#x27;t ran out though. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/25/13: I&#x27;m still using this product and I haven&#x27;t ran out. I still got a full Johnny B Gel bottle left and about 1/4 of the first one. Not bad. BUY IT :D</li>
