            <li>I do have the Coppola Keratin treatment in my hair now (done a couple months ago) and have used both the Shine serum and also the Infusion Keratin Replenisher which did work fairly well.</li>

            <li>it looked amazing and felt like silk.</li>
            <li>I was told by hairdressers that this product was amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing how healthy my hair is after 1 week</li>
            <li>I have been receiving Coppola Keratin Treatments for 2 years now and I love this.</li>
            <li>It was softer and more manageable even on a rainy day.</li>
            <li>I then flatironed my hair and it was like silk, just ordered more...</li>
            <li>I think the venders selling it liquified it to make more of a profit.  </li>
            <li>The top screws off, so they can fill the bottle with whatever they like.  </li>
            <li>Even my hair dresser noticed the difference in how healthy my hair was.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Look that up for more details.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, after trying it that way, it seemed to work just OK.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Once I took the top off the pump fell apart, makes me think that someone refilled it with something else, not to mention it&#x27;s not doing what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to use more.</li>
            <li>better when I use this.  </li>
            <li>I have not had a keratin treatment, because I love my waves, but this product has worked miracles on my fine, frizzy, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>Great hair straightener for natural hair and improving strength and texture of hair with each use.</li>
            <li>but as this is product for keratin treatments, it is best when used in conjunction with the other recommended products.</li>
            <li>It seemed fine with me.</li>
            <li>and I am ready to purchase more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, and the syrum comes out almost looking like water which makes it tempting to use more than you really need.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!! :)</li>
            <li>it and it came out smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>The frizz is gone, and it is laying smooth and shiny all over my scalp.  </li>
            <li>the way, this arrived in brand-new unopened packaging with an expiration date in 2017; there is nothing about this that would lead me to believe it is anything but a genuine product.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try, guys!  </li>
            <li>I ironed my hair after the keratin was applied, and I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this application and the original salon treatment ($250).  </li>
            <li>The first link describes hundreds of cases of healthy women going bald after using the Coppola products.</li>
            <li>It came out great, very similar feel to the way hair is after you wash it the first time after a brazilian keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>its supposed to last for up to six months but, since I don&#x27;t have the money to get it done again, this product its working to keep it in good shape until I can afford to do it again.</li>
            <li>But I was thinking this one would work even better because if the \\&quot;intense RX\\</li>
            <li>The issue I have is that after one week the whole top broke off.</li>
            <li>For what it costs, I really wanted better instructions.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get the treatment because I am currently pregnant.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t condition your hair first!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the keratin smoothing system on my own hair because it simply doesn&#x27;t need it, but I still use the protein rx serum on my hair because it strengthens my hair</li>
            <li>It worked great both ways, and kept my hair straight in very humid conditions until the next shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I just put it in on clean hair and style as normal.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you enough how much i love this product.</li>
            <li>I also feel like i am not going as much for my treatments in the salon!</li>
            <li>That being said, i only paid twelve somethng for it, I dont know that I would shell out too much more, like the amount its being charged for it elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really seals the ends of my hair, but it feels like it does!</li>
            <li>It made my bleach blonde hair a lot more managable after one use</li>
            <li>but i am interested to know how it will affect my hair over time...</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t be able to feel it in your hair because the protein is meant to soak into your hair shaft to rebuild your hair, which is in turn what will make the hair smooth down.  </li>
            <li>two or three more times before I felt like I really had enough product in my waist-length hair.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;serum\\&quot; is a water-like substance, with no properties consistent with the real item.  </li>
            <li>It does not weigh my hair down, it is super easy to apply...</li>
            <li>I got and it seems very watery.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to do a thing for my hair really.</li>
            <li>It really helps when you want to stretch out a treatment for a month or</li>
            <li>I needed something that would rebuild my hair fast and in minutes</li>
            <li>This product really does work and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li>As with any keratin product you&#x27;ll get the longest lasting results if you use a shampoo free of sulfates and sodium.</li>
            <li>and she recommended the intense rx.</li>
            <li>When I applied the product it was very watery, so much so that it would slip through my fingers and not even be applicable to the hair.</li>
            <li>This is not at all the real product.  </li>
            <li>Came with a plastic bag  over it, that was unusual, then I shook it and could tell it was thinner</li>
            <li>I guess I should have realized it was so much cheaper than retail because it was sent in November 2014, with a recommended &amp;#34;Best</li>
            <li>I like this product but there isn&#x27;t much in the bottle...only 1 oz.</li>
            <li>and I use the whole bottle and some after one shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it after I shampoo and haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference so won&#x27;t reorder the product.</li>
            <li>It is very costly as well.</li>
            <li>have lost SO MUCH product</li>
            <li>My hair is still very damaged but as long as I use this after every wash, it is restored  to smooth silky hair.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I have straight long hair and use the spray only on the bottom half of my hair - just to get rid of frizz and the appearance of double ends - and it works beautifully!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have fine, long hair that can get very fizzy in the humidity and needs lots of moisture and protein, and im in my latter fourties, if that helps..  </li>
            <li>Intense RX Ionic Keratin Protein Restructuring - to be used prior to using heat rollers - great shine and additional protection  against the negative impact of dry hear.</li>
            <li>Plus my hair has never ever been so soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is always soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>So far it has helped strengthen my hair and I will probably repurchase.</li>
            <li>My hair is literally as soft as a baby&#x27;s now.  </li>
            <li>I get the keratin treatment done in the salon, and love it but still need something for everyday shine &amp; smoothness on my blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I use it sparingly on the damaged ends of my hair and along face, the hair that grows more slowly.  </li>
            <li>First, I colored my hair to get back my Red hair, then I used this product.  </li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair and then apply the product( which absorbs quickly) and then flat iron it on the highest temperature.</li>
            <li>this is an amazing elixir--for old, colored, dead, humidified, dead hair!!&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>I did my whole head like that and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will just purchase it from the salon or from Coppola directly.</li>
            <li>It does not work as I expected, too much money for it too.</li>
            <li>Just starting using this product, Its really helping my dry, highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>Oh, and for the ones who say their hair is breaking off- putting too much protein on your hair is just as bad as it lacking protein- over \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot;(for lack of better words) will cause your hair to break!</li>
            <li>Put it on damp hair, not dry hair!</li>
            <li>The last few inches of hair are still a little fried, but that might get better with time.  </li>
            <li>Very expansive and not worth it.</li>
            <li>I would say it lasts a few days at first and then as the product builds up longer and longer.</li>
            <li>This product contains a high percentage of formaldehyde and has been recalled by the Australian government due to the cancer causing ingredient.  </li>
            <li>Watered down very disappointed, this is a great product in its original state.</li>
            <li>for those with thin fine and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement but once blow dried and flat ironed</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s really nothing else to do other than apply to damp hair and blow dry.</li>

            <li> So far it has helped strengthen my hair and I will probably repurchase.</li>
            <li> My hair is literally as soft as a baby&#x27;s now.  </li>
            <li> I get the keratin treatment done in the salon, and love it but still need something for everyday shine &amp; smoothness on my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly on the damaged ends of my hair and along face, the hair that grows more slowly.  </li>
            <li> First, I colored my hair to get back my Red hair, then I used this product.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and then apply the product( which absorbs quickly) and then flat iron it on the highest temperature.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing elixir--for old, colored, dead, humidified, dead hair!!&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> I did my whole head like that and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will just purchase it from the salon or from Coppola directly.</li>
            <li> It does not work as I expected, too much money for it too.</li>
            <li> Just starting using this product, Its really helping my dry, highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> Oh, and for the ones who say their hair is breaking off- putting too much protein on your hair is just as bad as it lacking protein- over \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot;(for lack of better words) will cause your hair to break!</li>
            <li> Put it on damp hair, not dry hair!</li>
            <li> The last few inches of hair are still a little fried, but that might get better with time.  </li>
            <li> Very expansive and not worth it.</li>
            <li> I would say it lasts a few days at first and then as the product builds up longer and longer.</li>
            <li> This product contains a high percentage of formaldehyde and has been recalled by the Australian government due to the cancer causing ingredient.  </li>
            <li> Watered down very disappointed, this is a great product in its original state.</li>
            <li> for those with thin fine and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement but once blow dried and flat ironed</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s really nothing else to do other than apply to damp hair and blow dry.</li>
            <li> I have washed my hair since applying the initial treatment (about three days later, which is normal for me), and I needed much less the second time.  </li>
            <li> However the price tag is a little high</li>
            <li> The flat iron is a must.</li>
            <li> The down side is that there is not much in this bottle so if you have long hair you will go through this fast.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money - was completely ripped off.  </li>
            <li> Also there&#x27;s barely a scent unlike some of Coppola&#x27;s other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have used it on damp hair (followed by hair dryer and flat iron) and on dry hair (followed by flat iron).  </li>
            <li> it&lt;br /&gt;lasted a long time</li>
            <li> I have long hair and there is a bit of damage from styling and some dryness.  </li>
            <li> Please see this link of Coppola knowingly putting customers at risk and the very same products  being recalled in other countries:  </li>
            <li> Well today I tried it, I toweled dry my hair and did about 5 pumps for my very long hair.</li>
            <li> I blew my hair dry and</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I still use the oil and just before I am about to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> I blew dry my hair on the hottest setting until it was 90% dry.  </li>
            <li> I used this product as described and it made me hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> The instructions that come with it are somewhat vague - towel dry hair, apply serum, your hair will only absorb as much as it needs, then blow dry or flat iron and style hair.</li>
            <li> I will purchase again when the price go back down because it did stop my breakage.</li>
            <li> I then applied it to dry hair (without using it on my wet hair).  </li>
            <li> They recommend that you apply it to wet hair and</li>
            <li> I hate putting products in my hair just because I hate the way they feel &amp; nothing feels Better to me than fresh clean blown dried hair without anything on it...</li>

            <li> Not worth it at all.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you enough how much i love this product. I get the keratin treatment done in the salon, and love it but still need something for everyday shine &amp; smoothness on my blonde hair. I hate putting products in my hair just because I hate the way they feel &amp; nothing feels Better to me than fresh clean blown dried hair without anything on it... Using this product gives me everything I want and none of the stuffi don&#x27;t. Plus my hair has never ever been so soft &amp; shiny. Compliments all the time now on how shiny and good it looks. I also feel like i am not going as much for my treatments in the salon! I just used my bottle up this AM so while in the mall I was going to pick up a bottle but the price was double the amount then on Amazon.... If you want to extend the life of your treatment &amp; have the softest, shiniest hair you always wanted then get this stuff. Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This product is great to keep your hair in good shape after the Keratin treatment. I had the treatment done about 10 months ago and its supposed to last for up to six months but, since I don&#x27;t have the money to get it done again, this product its working to keep it in good shape until I can afford to do it again.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a salon that was marketing an in-salon treatment with it as a sort of \\&quot;in between pick me up\\&quot; for people who get the brazilian keratin treatment on their hair. I wasn&#x27;t sure how difficult it would be to use, and i didn&#x27;t have the salon treatment, but I figured I would try it anyway and bought some online. The instructions that come with it are somewhat vague - towel dry hair, apply serum, your hair will only absorb as much as it needs, then blow dry or flat iron and style hair. Well, I took about a dime-sized amount and rubbed it between my palms and put it in my hair... then did that two or three more times before I felt like I really had enough product in my waist-length hair. I did use a flat-iron on my still-damp hair, and then blow-dried. It came out great, very similar feel to the way hair is after you wash it the first time after a brazilian keratin treatment. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and will probably buy it again if nothing fabulous comes out to replace it before I run out!</li>
            <li> This is a great product my very damaged hair is like silk now, and it looks just beautiful!!!! I will never be without this product.</li>
            <li> Just starting using this product, Its really helping my dry, highlighted hair. It does not weigh my hair down, it is super easy to apply...Will continue to buy and use.</li>
            <li> Can someone tell me what the consistency of this product is suppose to be? I got and it seems very watery. Also there&#x27;s barely a scent unlike some of Coppola&#x27;s other products I&#x27;ve used. There&#x27;s a little \\&quot;emollient\\&quot; feel but otherwise it feels like water. It didn&#x27;t seem to do a thing for my hair really. I do have the Coppola Keratin treatment in my hair now (done a couple months ago) and have used both the Shine serum and also the Infusion Keratin Replenisher which did work fairly well. But I was thinking this one would work even better because if the \\&quot;intense RX\\&quot; name/description. I&#x27;ve only ordered this online, never tried it in a salon so I have no way of knowing either way I just hope the product wasn&#x27;t compromised before transit.</li>
            <li> I have the Keratin Straightening Treatment done regularly and my stylist uses this product line - so it is what is recommended for maintenance. It works great and the prices on Amazon are the best around!</li>
            <li> I have been receiving Coppola Keratin Treatments for 2 years now and I love this. My hair stylist recommended it and I have been using. However the price tag is a little high so when I saw this, I jumped on it. My stylist has actually placed this in my hair and had me sit under a dryer for 30 minutes. It really helps when you want to stretch out a treatment for a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this can be used on any type of hair is wanted but as this is product for keratin treatments, it is best when used in conjunction with the other recommended products.</li>
            <li> This product contains a high percentage of formaldehyde and has been recalled by the Australian government due to the cancer causing ingredient.  The faulty batch was sold in Australia between July 2010 and February 2011! Check product recall in Australia.  I hope none of the faulty batch were shipped to other parts of the world!</li>
            <li> I needed something that would rebuild my hair fast and in minutes and OMG this is magic!!!!! Trust me when I say it transformed my hair from straw to silk!!!</li>
            <li> I use it with the keratin infusion and its AWESOME!!! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a daily strengthening product.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but I knew my hair needed some Keratin, after being chemically straightened and I couldn&#x27;t get the treatment because I am currently pregnant. (didnt want the fumes) I used it and then blowdried and straightened, and definitely saw a difference in my hair. It was softer and more manageable even on a rainy day. That being said, i only paid twelve somethng for it, I dont know that I would shell out too much more, like the amount its being charged for it elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt seem to get a bum bottle either like some other reviewers thought they had. It seemed fine with me.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! I had a keratin treatment (formaldehyde-free) months and months ago and could not justify spending the money on another treatment, but after seeing the results I had to have something to keep my hair smooth in the horrible Florida humidity. This product really does work and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done. It&#x27;s consistency is a little thicker than water. I apply it differently than the directions state: I blow dry my hair and then apply the product( which absorbs quickly) and then flat iron it on the highest temperature. I would say it lasts a few days at first and then as the product builds up longer and longer. As with any keratin product you&#x27;ll get the longest lasting results if you use a shampoo free of sulfates and sodium.</li>
            <li> I had the keratin treatment done in a salon a month ago and I have been using the shampoo and conditioner my hairdresser gave me. I went back for a haircut and she recommended the intense rx. Well today I tried it, I toweled dry my hair and did about 5 pumps for my very long hair. I blew my hair dry and it and it came out smooth as silk. Trust me I am a product person and I am truly amazed.</li>
            <li> I have the keratin treatment done to my hair and my hair loves it!  When I used this, it was like getting a keratin treatment.  I&#x27;ve only used it once and I&#x27;m in love!  I wil update if anything changes.  I have fine, long hair that can get very fizzy in the humidity and needs lots of moisture and protein, and im in my latter fourties, if that helps..  This stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;I combed out 1&amp;#34; sections and applied a couple of squirts of the RX onto each and spread it into my hair. I did my whole head like that and let it air dry.  I then flatironed my hair and it was like silk, just ordered more...this one is a keeper</li>
            <li> I ordered the serum as pictured. And received a completely different item. It looks and smells like water. Very unhappy</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with this product because the lid was tampered with and was held together by tape.  When I applied the product it was very watery, so much so that it would slip through my fingers and not even be applicable to the hair. Needless to say, it did absolutely nothing to improve my hair.  I think the venders selling it liquified it to make more of a profit.  Next time I will just purchase it from the salon or from Coppola directly. Wasted my money, don&#x27;t waste yours.  It should be illegal to sell false goods and pass it off as the real one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great once a week treatment. Don&#x27;t condition your hair first! You only use a small amount and lowery and/or use a straightener.</li>
            <li> I put a quarter size in my hair after washing it; roll my hair in a bun for 30 mins to let it soak in. Then I blow dry. My hair is always soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is not at all the real product.  The \\&quot;serum\\&quot; is a water-like substance, with no properties consistent with the real item.  I agree with the other review - this is a bait and switch...total scam.  The top screws off, so they can fill the bottle with whatever they like.  I used it twice and tossed it in the trash.  A total waste of money - was completely ripped off.  Big bummer.</li>
            <li> If you have damaged hair this is the product to use every day after you wash it&#x27;s amazing how healthy my hair is after 1 week</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Even my hair dresser noticed the difference in how healthy my hair was. I have thick, coarse and unruly curly hair that is hard to manage despite using Moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner and Moroccan oil treatment. I still use the oil and just before I am about to blow dry my hair I use the keratin. The supplier was great to deal with and I am about to buy another lot now.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t know if it really seals the ends of my hair, but it feels like it does! I have straight long hair and use the spray only on the bottom half of my hair - just to get rid of frizz and the appearance of double ends - and it works beautifully! I use it once a week and just a few spritzes!</li>
            <li> This made my hair shinier and easier to blow out. I never had the keratin treatment which this is supposed to supplement but I do plan on using after I get that done to prolong the effects.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  I had the Coppola keratin treatment done on my hair back in August and this product has done wonders for extending the treatment!  I think this product is a MUST for anyone wanting to extend the life of their keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> I have been using once a week (per my stylist) for three weeks. So far it has helped strengthen my hair and I will probably repurchase. The issue I have is that after one week the whole top broke off. I did not drop or bang the bottle in any way so I am wondering if others have had this problem. I used a funnel and poured into a small travel size squeeze bottle and this works okay but...really?</li>
            <li> I have not had a keratin treatment, because I love my waves, but this product has worked miracles on my fine, frizzy, damaged hair.  I was waffling at the price at first, but was a little desperate after a summer of sun.  I shampooed and conditioned, towel dried and applied three dime-sized squirts into the ends of my hair.  I did another squirt or two on my head, massaging it in.  I blew dry my hair on the hottest setting until it was 90% dry.  My hair is literally as soft as a baby&#x27;s now.  It is definitely smoother, and the product has taken out some of the natural wave, but it&#x27;s not straight, and can still hold a curl.  The frizz is gone, and it is laying smooth and shiny all over my scalp.  The last few inches of hair are still a little fried, but that might get better with time.  I have washed my hair since applying the initial treatment (about three days later, which is normal for me), and I needed much less the second time.  The third time I didn&#x27;t use it at all (argan oil instead), but still had the silky softness and shine.  I am getting all sorts of compliments and am tossing my hair like a teenager.  Worth a try, guys!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Watered down very disappointed, this is a great product in its original state. Came with a plastic bag  over it, that was unusual, then I shook it and could tell it was thinner than I remembered, not cool!!</li>
            <li> Too much use is bad and will hurt your hair due to protein damage.  Look that up for more details.  I use it sparingly on the damaged ends of my hair and along face, the hair that grows more slowly.  I just put it in on clean hair and style as normal.  Hair feels smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li> Lives up to its promise. Great hair straightener for natural hair and improving strength and texture of hair with each use.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to renew my expensive keratin treatment.  The directions are not good.  They recommend that you apply it to wet hair and the hair will absorb what it needs.  Hum.  For what it costs, I really wanted better instructions.  Anyway, after trying it that way, it seemed to work just OK.  I then applied it to dry hair (without using it on my wet hair).  I ironed my hair after the keratin was applied, and I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this application and the original salon treatment ($250).  It&#x27;s pricey, but not as bad as having the salon treatment which requires you not washing your hair for 72 hours.  I now wash my hair every 6 to 7 days, and I am very pleased.  I now longer worry about my curley, frizzy hair.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I am a hairdresser and it is a product I actually use myself as well as on all of my clients (except males unless they have longer hair).  I am confused as to why people think the instructions are vague-- there&#x27;s really nothing else to do other than apply to damp hair and blow dry. It is a protein serum, no perfumes or anything else, so the consistency is that of water.  You shouldn&#x27;t be able to feel it in your hair because the protein is meant to soak into your hair shaft to rebuild your hair, which is in turn what will make the hair smooth down.  This product is great.  Put it on damp hair, not dry hair! I don&#x27;t use the keratin smoothing system on my own hair because it simply doesn&#x27;t need it, but I still use the protein rx serum on my hair because it strengthens my hair so I can continue growing it longer. I would recommend this to just about anyone because it is great for any type of hair. Oh, and for the ones who say their hair is breaking off- putting too much protein on your hair is just as bad as it lacking protein- over \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot;(for lack of better words) will cause your hair to break! Hope this clears some things up!</li>
            <li> I have used it on damp hair (followed by hair dryer and flat iron) and on dry hair (followed by flat iron).  It worked great both ways, and kept my hair straight in very humid conditions until the next shampoo.  Use small amounts, massage/comb through to distribute.  I had the mini Keratin Complex &amp;#34;blowout&amp;#34; salon treatment done three months ago, and it was starting to wear off (only supposed to last six weeks).  Hoping this will prove to be a long-term alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this arrived in brand-new unopened packaging with an expiration date in 2017; there is nothing about this that would lead me to believe it is anything but a genuine product.  There was a concern about this issue expressed in other reviews -- perhaps it was a matter of the seller.  Mine came from Deva Concepts.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It helped me extend my expensive salon Keratin treatment. I guess I should have realized it was so much cheaper than retail because it was sent in November 2014, with a recommended &amp;#34;Best by&amp;#34; date of October 2014.</li>
            <li> I used this serum all the time after having the Coppola keratin smoothing therapy treatment but it was like nothing. it did not change anything and did not improve or protect the treatment I did.  Very expansive and not worth it. One star because I couldn&#x27;t put nothing.</li>
            <li> It made my bleach blonde hair a lot more managable after one use but i am interested to know how it will affect my hair over time...</li>
            <li> I like it very much. My hair looks beautiful. I think its a very good product for my hair.  Ill buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, it made my hair silk and smooth, it&lt;br /&gt;lasted a long time and I am ready to purchase more! Reat Line!</li>
            <li> It does not work as I expected, too much money for it too.</li>
            <li> Once I took the top off the pump fell apart, makes me think that someone refilled it with something else, not to mention it&#x27;s not doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, I&#x27;m not going to buy again, can&#x27;t trust.</li>
            <li> The inside of the pump was broken and serum was like water.  Not worth it at all.  Not sure what is in the bottle but definitely not the serum that was promised.</li>
            <li> I chemically damaged my hair by accident and this product has saved my hair! My hair was in such bad shape. Worst than ever in my life. It was stripped of all it&#x27;s color, felt and looked like straw and was frizzy. I cried! After doing some research I found this product. It saved my hair!  First, I colored my hair to get back my Red hair, then I used this product.  At first, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement but once blow dried and flat ironed it looked amazing and felt like silk. My hair is still very damaged but as long as I use this after every wash, it is restored  to smooth silky hair. I learned my lesson and will continue to use this product even after my hair recovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is using the heat to bring out the beauty. The flat iron is a must.</li>
            <li> Coppola Keratin Complex Intense RX Ionic Keratin Protein Restructuring - to be used prior to using heat rollers - great shine and additional protection  against the negative impact of dry hear. Order was processed properly, packed well and delivered promptly. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This was a great price, it was the cheapest I have found&lt;br /&gt;Great for those with thin fine and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product but there isn&#x27;t much in the bottle...only 1 oz. I have a lot of hair and I use the whole bottle and some after one shampoo.  I will purchase again when the price go back down because it did stop my breakage.</li>
            <li> This product did not work me, however it didn&#x27;t do any damage to my hair either. It was definitely a waste of money because it doesn&#x27;t do what it claims.</li>

            <li> ive tried this a few times and just dont see a real difference. dissapointing. Maybe I need to use more. It feels like water.</li>
            <li> I was told by hairdressers that this product was amazing. I&#x27;m not impressed but I&#x27;ve kept using it hoping to change my mind.</li>
            <li> I have been using it after I shampoo and haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference so won&#x27;t reorder the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light, and the syrum comes out almost looking like water which makes it tempting to use more than you really need. I put it in my hair after I shower, usually go to bed with my hair wet and straighten or curl it in the morning and I am starting to feel a difference. My hair is smoother and softer. I really like this product!! :)</li>
            <li> Nice product.  I have long hair and there is a bit of damage from styling and some dryness.  This does seem to add a bit of strength back into it.  I notice that it does help to hold my style (curls from a curling iron) better when I use this.  The down side is that there is not much in this bottle so if you have long hair you will go through this fast. This will not repair damage, there is no such product that can do that no matter what they claim, but it will add a bit of shine and strength to your hair so if you are putting off a hair cut his may buy you some time.</li>
            <li> I used this product as described and it made me hair dry and frizzy. It is very costly as well.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing elixir--for old, colored, dead, humidified, dead hair!!&lt;br /&gt;BUT&lt;br /&gt;I have lost SO MUCH product&lt;br /&gt;(have bought 2 bottles so far)&lt;br /&gt;because of the TERRIBLE packaging...&lt;br /&gt;I KNOW it must be difficult to&lt;br /&gt;pkg. such a &#x27;liquid-ey- liquid,&lt;br /&gt;BUT&lt;br /&gt;c&#x27;mon....&lt;br /&gt;it is sooo expensive&lt;br /&gt;and TOO expensive to&lt;br /&gt;have some or lots&lt;br /&gt;drip or flow out!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s terrible...&lt;br /&gt;(but product is phenomenal)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
