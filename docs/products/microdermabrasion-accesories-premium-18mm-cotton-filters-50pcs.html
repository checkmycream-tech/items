            <li>Love that machine.</li>
            <li>Using these filters help keep my microdermabrasion machine&#x27;s tube from becoming clogged.</li>
            <li>Worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>I figured since it was suggested it would fit the tip I bought.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what size will fit</li>
            <li>Very useful and help in protecting from clogging my microdermambrasion machine.  </li>

            <li>Above all, I am able to clear up spots and adult acne that was on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Works very well with our at home microderm machine  as it catches all the dead skin mixed in with the crystals so we don&#x27;t have to do a huge breakdown &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>Used it with the diamond microdermabrasion portable machine by new home spa.</li>
            <li>It does not allow the machine to properly suction over the skin because too much air passes through where the sandpaper should be.  </li>

            <li> These are little cotton filters that you insert into the Microdermabrasion tip to catch oils and dirt from going up the tube.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s comes of my skin when giving myself a treatment is trapped by the filters stopping any particles from going into the machine.  </li>
            <li> they do work like they&#x27;re supposed to stopping virtually all trash, dead skin blood etc,,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pricey for small amount recieved</li>
            <li> i ordered wrong size</li>

            <li> you may insert the cotton filter inside the diamond tip.. very usefull, because it help to keep the hose clean..</li>
            <li> Great bargain and great price. If you buy a Microdermabrasion machine, you should automatically buy these and they come in handy and last long.</li>
            <li> Very useful and help in protecting from clogging my microdermambrasion machine.  I will buy it again very satisfied. Thank you</li>
            <li> I wish I had waited to see which size I would use the most.</li>
            <li> Well what can I say? This product serves it&#x27;s purpose and fits well with my diamond D machine. It works</li>
            <li> Giving myself my own microdermabrasion treatments has been so wonderful.  I don&#x27;t have to schedule an appointment with a spa.  I don&#x27;t have to pay $100-$150 a session so it saves me money.  Above all, I am able to clear up spots and adult acne that was on my skin.  Using these filters help keep my microdermabrasion machine&#x27;s tube from becoming clogged. Dirt or debris that&#x27;s comes of my skin when giving myself a treatment is trapped by the filters stopping any particles from going into the machine.  These filters also fit the machine perfectly.</li>
            <li> Nice filters.  Worked just fine.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> i ordered wrong size they are too big but thats my fault the product is great</li>
            <li> Buy them now, don&#x27;t wait, your gonna need them anyways. Must have with the machine so stock up! Word to the wise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having the same problem as Tita. I don&#x27;t know how to insert the filter as I&#x27;m using the same machine.</li>
            <li> Yes always excellent value and service</li>
            <li> The tip I received had the sandpaper like portion improperly placed within the tip.  It does not allow the machine to properly suction over the skin because too much air passes through where the sandpaper should be.  I can&#x27;t even use it.  Would give zero stars if allowed.</li>
            <li> Love using these with my Microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> Great price for product. And each filter can go up to four uses. Per directions. Used it with the diamond microdermabrasion portable machine by new home spa. Love that machine.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my Machine. Item arrived quickly . These are little cotton filters that you insert into the Microdermabrasion tip to catch oils and dirt from going up the tube. If you do not use these filters your machine would be ruined. I use the Microdermabrasion machine once a month.</li>
            <li> Works well with the machine I purchased.</li>
            <li> this works well for the single use applications for the microdermabrasion machine.  The quality is good too. Would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> excellence!! Very good.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because it was suggested when I purchased the forever tip. I figured since it was suggested it would fit the tip I bought. WRONG !  The filter is too big for the tip I bought. I tried putting it on over the hole on the wand anyway and twisting the head of the wand over it, but it keeps falling in. I don&#x27;t know what size will fit and I really need them because I am using it on the Nubrilliance machine which requires a filter. On the Nubrilliance the filter goes in the head of the wand, it the same on the forever diamond wand?  maybe I am doing this wrong.</li>
            <li> good quality products... short time for dispatching, was ideal, was exactly that I was looking for.. also feedback was very fast</li>
            <li> Pricey for small amount recieved</li>

            <li> I use these for the purpose they were designed for. I can&#x27;t say to much about these given what they are.&lt;br /&gt;But they do work like they&#x27;re supposed to stopping virtually all trash, dead skin blood etc,,&lt;br /&gt;They work good!!</li>
