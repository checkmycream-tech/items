            <li>lather is full and coverage is great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Arrived in good time, nice fragrance,</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold a lather well, but it conditions nicely, smells nice, and provides a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li>Definitely pleased with the shave soap!</li>
            <li>After receiving it I liked the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>do like the ingredients and the scent, and it feels nice, if I were to use a disposable this</li>
            <li>This soap works up a nice lather with a brush and has a very mild, pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>would be it, otherwise I&#x27;m back to looking for a great soap to compliment a great shave.</li>
            <li>At first glance I was happy.  </li>
            <li>Washed off easily and had a great, but mild scent.  </li>
            <li>The soap smells good, mixes easy, applies easy, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shave soap.</li>
            <li>Despite this, I still find that in combination with my brush and straight razor, I have a great shave every time.</li>
            <li>You do not need to use much at all which makes it a great bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells very nice - kind of like honey and patchouli but not for sensitive skin in my opinion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the soap I use before going out at night or right after a great clean shower feeling.</li>
            <li>My 80-something dad loved it - sort of a retro experience for him, as well as my husband and nephew who were using the shaving soap/brush for the first time.  </li>
            <li>The product is a great way to get off of aerosol cans and chemicals to a healthier and more natural shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>I’ve been looking for an all natural shaving soap and this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely, and the shave was super smooth.  </li>
            <li>When used with a safety razor, it provides a smooth, close shave without skin irritation, pulling, or knicks.</li>
            <li>I since found a way to use Noxema under it as a pre-shave, but alone it just isn&#x27;t comfortable to me</li>
            <li>but I like this one because it has a very distinct almost minty scent that lasts a bit longer and makes me feel more fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not big on strong scents, and this stuff has a nice fresh smell that I actually enjoyed.  </li>
            <li>A nice lather, smells fresh, and I get a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product for the price, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>At first, it lathered fine on my face, but the quality of the lather was weak, and the lather liked to cling more to itself than to my face.  </li>
            <li>This soap doesn&#x27;t lubricate very well either.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get much lather</li>
            <li>Gave this to my son, he was using a tube product before, but really likes this</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>I went to the local drugstore and bought a two dollar disk of popular shave soap and sixty seconds later had built a santa claus size epic white foam shaving cream beard which lasted for three passes easily.  </li>
            <li>As you have probably read in other reviews, this shave soap is not the most lathery soap in the world.</li>
            <li>A quick web search of reviews for this product yielded similar results.  </li>
            <li>My skin feel moisturized not dry after shaving and it has a really fresh invigorating scent.</li>
            <li>I tried again and again with more water with less water mixing it on my hand and in a cup using more or less soap I was unable to find a happy medium anywhere.  </li>
            <li>What little bit of lather (more like a watery foam than a lather)</li>
            <li>So much so that this tin will probably last a year.  </li>
            <li>When we remodeled our bathroom, we wanted to purchase a classy razor holder and brush.  </li>
            <li>Not for my sensitive skin, it has a burn/tingle sensation.  </li>
            <li>I thought since it was all natural it wouldn&#x27;t bother me, but it does.  </li>
            <li>Not one minute later, I noticed that the lather that started out fine dried out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stuck doing a few parts of my face at a time, and then redoing certain parts .  </li>

            <li> this soap was very disappointing in that it will not produce a thick layer of lather on your beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been looking for a shaving soap that won&#x27;t irritate my skin and this stuff is great.  Having recently transitioned from shaving cream to shaving soap, i&#x27;m finding a lot of them do actually irritate.  It lathers nicely, and the shave was super smooth.  Washed off easily and had a great, but mild scent.  I am not big on strong scents, and this stuff has a nice fresh smell that I actually enjoyed.  I think I will be using this for a while.  Good job guys.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shave soap. It&#x27;s not overpowering and very pleasant. The size of the tin and the amount of soap is also a plus. But, that being said, the lather is definitely lacking. Regardless of how much soap I get on the brush, I&#x27;m left with a very thin and bubbly lather is my shave bowl. This soap doesn&#x27;t lubricate very well either. Since using, I&#x27;ve started experiencing some irritation. Not a bad product for the price, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This soap works up a nice lather with a brush and has a very mild, pleasant smell.  When used with a safety razor, it provides a smooth, close shave without skin irritation, pulling, or knicks.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Quite happy!</li>
            <li> love it!!  great smell and leaves the face feeling moisturized. lather is full and coverage is great! definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells great, too &#x27;waxy&#x27; for me. Didn&#x27;t get much lather like I&#x27;m use to with other saving soaps.  Gave it to my son.</li>
            <li> As you have probably read in other reviews, this shave soap is not the most lathery soap in the world. Despite this, I still find that in combination with my brush and straight razor, I have a great shave every time. The soap smells good, mixes easy, applies easy, and gets the job done. I don&#x27;t know what else I can say other than give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of soaps to choose from for shaving but I like this one because it has a very distinct almost minty scent that lasts a bit longer and makes me feel more fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the soap I use before going out at night or right after a great clean shower feeling.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my son, he was using a tube product before, but really likes this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in good time, nice fragrance,</li>
            <li> Works great!  Lathers very well with just a few swirls of the brush across the soap.  So much so that this tin will probably last a year.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> When we remodeled our bathroom, we wanted to purchase a classy razor holder and brush.  Along with these, we purchased Bees for Blokes.  What a surprise this product turned out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather is great.  The scent is wonderful.  You do not need to use much at all which makes it a great bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought it for our son for Christmas and he loves it too.</li>
            <li> this soap was very disappointing in that it will not produce a thick layer of lather on your beard. instead you get a thin,quick drying layer of soap that dries up before you are half way through your shave.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  After reading about it I wanted it to be my go to product for shaving.  After receiving it I liked the smell of it.  The tub was filled just enough to leave a small lip around the inside edge of the container to prevent spilling and mess when swirling your brush in the product.  It&#x27;s thick and hard soap.  At first glance I was happy.  Then the catastrophic failure of the product for me....  It will not retain its foam for hardly any usable length of time. It would dry on my face in seconds.  I thought for sure I was using it wrong or the failure was on my behalf.  I tried again and again with more water with less water mixing it on my hand and in a cup using more or less soap I was unable to find a happy medium anywhere.  I have a very nice best badger brush so I know that isn&#x27;t the problem.  I went to the local drugstore and bought a two dollar disk of popular shave soap and sixty seconds later had built a santa claus size epic white foam shaving cream beard which lasted for three passes easily.  A quick web search of reviews for this product yielded similar results.  This tells me it wasn&#x27;t me.  I wanted the problem to be me.  I&#x27;m soooo disappointed.  I can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> What little bit of lather (more like a watery foam than a lather) I could generate with this shave soap dried on my face almost immediately.  They need to go back to the drawing board and add something to the ingredients that allows you to build a longer lasting, thicker lather.  Perhaps tallow?</li>
            <li> Excellent product! My husband loves the smell and lather.</li>
            <li> I’ve been looking for an all natural shaving soap and this stuff works great. A nice lather, smells fresh, and I get a really close shave. My skin feel moisturized not dry after shaving and it has a really fresh invigorating scent. Great way to start the morning!</li>
            <li> I read the other negative review about how the foam doesn&#x27;t last but ignored it for the ones in favor of the product.  I can&#x27;t imagine those people actually shave with it, maybe with a disposable razor, but it holds no lather.  I&#x27;m stuck doing a few parts of my face at a time, and then redoing certain parts .  Maybe I just shave slow these days, but other soaps seem to last for me.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the ingredients and the scent, and it feels nice, if I were to use a disposable this would be it, otherwise I&#x27;m back to looking for a great soap to compliment a great shave.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this soap.  At first, it lathered fine on my face, but the quality of the lather was weak, and the lather liked to cling more to itself than to my face.  Not one minute later, I noticed that the lather that started out fine dried out and I could not shave one pass without reapplying.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice - kind of like honey and patchouli but not for sensitive skin in my opinion. I used this and it felt like my skin was burning and ended up red and irritated. I since found a way to use Noxema under it as a pre-shave, but alone it just isn&#x27;t comfortable to me</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a lather well, but it conditions nicely, smells nice, and provides a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li> Not for my sensitive skin, it has a burn/tingle sensation.  I thought since it was all natural it wouldn&#x27;t bother me, but it does.  I like the lather, but not a fan of the essential oil smell.  I thought it would have a sweeter &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; type smell.</li>
            <li> I gave the Beauty and the Bees for Blokes Shave Soap for Father&#x27;s Day gifts, along with soap brushes that I bought from The Shave Factory (on Amazon) and the gifts were a big hit.  My 80-something dad loved it - sort of a retro experience for him, as well as my husband and nephew who were using the shaving soap/brush for the first time.  The product is a great way to get off of aerosol cans and chemicals to a healthier and more natural shaving soap.  Definitely pleased with the shave soap!</li>
