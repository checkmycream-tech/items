            <li> Best gel polish out there.</li>
            <li> Great color! I get so many compliments everytime I wear it. It does tend to peel after four or five days which is a downer.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I feel about this polish.  Looks nice, but it did not hold up for two weeks.</li>
            <li> Color is a little more blue then grey which was disappointing to me. But the polish itself is magical. 17 days and no chips!</li>
            <li> Its definetly n the blue family not grey.</li>
            <li> This polish is pretty BUT it looks almost gray in the picture on here and it is actually a light gray/blue with shimmer in it. It does look good but I was expecting gray when I bought it.</li>
            <li> The color is absolutely beautiful...however it started peeling on day two. by day three, a couple of nails chipped off in large tacky pieces. I have been doing my own gel nails for months and have tried several different brands. I even have the sensational lamp, but  have never actually used the color polish that came in the kit or any other sensational colors until now. Needless to say i am very disappointed. Its really unfortunate because the color is so pretty. I also did my sister&#x27;s gel nails using another sensationail color that peeled after a couple of days. This brand could do so much better! i&#x27;ll stick with Gelsish and Sally Hansen brands of gel polish.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. I love the color and the way it makes the nail strong. My only complaints were the amount of time it takes to do the nails and for some reason some kept peeling around the outsides on me and I had to keep re-doing them. Still learning how to apply it</li>
            <li> Love blue colors.  This one looks great.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the salon! Pretty color!</li>
            <li> beautiful color! already used it on my sister&#x27;s nails</li>
            <li> This is a great polish.  I love using the gel polish since it cuts down on the number of times I have to actually do my nails.  This color is closer to a slate blue than what it looks like, but I was very pleased with how it turned out.</li>
            <li> Works well and dries well</li>
            <li> Great color! Only gave 4 stars because I can never get Sensationail colors to stay on my hands. Lasts forever on my toes though!</li>
            <li> I thought the color looked grey in te picture but it&#x27;s a bluish grey still nice just my mistake</li>
            <li> I love the color - it&#x27;s a faint grey/bluish color. Lasted a little over a week - only because I get antsy and want to change colors frequently. Otherwise I&#x27;m sure it would have lasted much longer. It shipped quickly. NO complaints.</li>
