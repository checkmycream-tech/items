            <li>Castor Oil has some amazing properties from colon relief to boosting hair growth.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s filling nicely.</li>
            <li>Washing off the masque is very easy.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li>, my curls and waves have been popping a lot more, etc.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery and the product itself is great.</li>
            <li>:) Fantastic!</li>
            <li>this Oil is great for the hair scalp ... really liking the results that i am seeing ...</li>
            <li>i have use this Caster OIL for about two months now and i love it.</li>
            <li>I use it on my leg, for stiffness and it WORKS better than bengay,try it.</li>
            <li>so I could fill it with this oil and easily pour it out.</li>
            <li>The brand and quality seems fine</li>
            <li>The product is pure castor oil, and it works perfectly for all my personal care needs.  </li>
            <li>and I found that this castor oil gave me great results as one of the &amp;#34;base oils.&amp;#34; Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>Also when I use it to seal my hair on wash days, my hair feels very soft to the touch (can&#x27;t keep my hands from out of my head) and has a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, my edges are already coming back in.</li>
            <li>The bottle offeres a plethora of usage and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Has worked well for me and leaves my skin feeling surprisingly soft and clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great price and will last for a long time!</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it smells kind of weird after rinsing it but no other problems! :D</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Got this to help with hair growth, use it weekly in a mask, haven&#x27;t noticed much change.  </li>
            <li>so pouring it out can be tricky and you can accidentally pour too much.</li>
            <li>even if you have oily skin (supposedly it can actually help regulate oil production because it doesn&#x27;t strip your skins natural oils like soap, prompting your skin to produce even more).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the results this product has given me in such a short time and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product and seller</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product, using it to grow a very weak hairline</li>
            <li>A little olive oil added to the castor oil makes a lovely face wash - my face has not been clearer.  </li>
            <li>This oil makes my hair very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair softer, helps keep styles in place and offers shine.</li>
            <li>BTW I am completely natural, with type 4A/B, collar-length hair.</li>
            <li>I wish I had kept my old bottle</li>
            <li>I first used this brand when I did my first raw/vegan detox a few years ago</li>
            <li>When I finally got around to using it, it was like my previous castor oil, with the same consistency and smell, My problem is the bottle is a screw off top</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that with this 90 day castor oil challenge that I am currently on, I will get some additional growth (since this is what this product has been praised for and my hair only grew 5 inches the first year of my transition before I cut off the remainder of my relaxed ends.</li>
            <li>You will need to rinse out the cloth and wipe away the oil multiple times, so the only down side is that it&#x27;s more time consuming than just using regular soap or face wash).  </li>
            <li>My family also uses it for dry scalp and they say it works very well.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item about a year ago; however, being the product junkie that I am, it was rotated in and out between my other oils and not used consistently or exclusively.</li>
            <li>It also moisturizes my scalp like no other hair care product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who needs hair growth or getting rid of dry skin, scalp, etc.</li>
            <li> I use this oil as a masque on my hair-mix it with an egg or just egg yolk and add some lemon juice and apply on dry hair-leave on for 30-60 mins.</li>
            <li> With my first use of this I found it to be VERY, VERY THICK, so I thinned it out by mixing it with olive oil (50/50)and that has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> All of that proved to be WAY TOO MUCH as I was a greasy mess!!!</li>
            <li> I have only recently returned to using this again  because I am currently on a castor oil challenge in which you have to incorporate the use of this product into your hair regiment at least 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Only need a small amount at a time so this will last for very long time.</li>
            <li> I also dab on a little extra as a moisturizer if my skin feels too dry after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast but when I got the bottle, the safety seal was broken so it was oily in the bag.</li>
            <li> My edges have been thinning a lot over the past year, and after doing research I learned that castor oil can help thicken your hair and grow back your edges.</li>
            <li> I like my hair to feel moisturized but not greasy to the touch if you know what I mean, and you can easily go overboard with this product as a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Husband uses it everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it two times a day for the past two weeks</li>
            <li> My hair growth has improved by about 5 inches in the past two months of using this</li>
            <li> Initially I went steer crazy with it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize castor oil was so thick!  </li>
            <li> Pricey n smell unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to wash out</li>

            <li> Good price for this bottle! Husband uses it everyday! Arrived on the date it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Pricey n smell unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> My edges have been thinning a lot over the past year, and after doing research I learned that castor oil can help thicken your hair and grow back your edges. I&#x27;ve been using it two times a day for the past two weeks and I&#x27;m already seeing results! (I apply it to my edges and massage my scalp with it each time I apply it.)My hair has been a lot shinier and softer after washing it, my curls and waves have been popping a lot more, etc. Most importantly, my edges are already coming back in. I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the results this product has given me in such a short time and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery and the product itself is great. Use it on my skin to help with dry/rough patches. Only need a small amount at a time so this will last for very long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I decided to try the \\&quot;oil cleansing method\\&quot; on my face.  I mix it 50/50 with olive oil and use it to cleanse my skin  (massage in the oil mixture, then use very warm water and a wash cloth to wipe away.  No soap!  You will need to rinse out the cloth and wipe away the oil multiple times, so the only down side is that it&#x27;s more time consuming than just using regular soap or face wash).  I also dab on a little extra as a moisturizer if my skin feels too dry after cleansing.  Has worked well for me and leaves my skin feeling surprisingly soft and clean! (not oily as you might expect).  Would recommend others give it a try and see how it works for you...even if you have oily skin (supposedly it can actually help regulate oil production because it doesn&#x27;t strip your skins natural oils like soap, prompting your skin to produce even more).</li>
            <li> Castor Oil has some amazing properties from colon relief to boosting hair growth. I first used this brand when I did my first raw/vegan detox a few years ago and it&#x27;s been my must have ever since. The bottle offeres a plethora of usage and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for my hair &amp; I noticed it made my hair shinier &amp; thicker each week. My hair growth has improved by about 5 inches in the past two months of using this :) Fantastic! The only problem is that it smells kind of weird after rinsing it but no other problems! :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for my eyelashes and it works great!! My family also uses it for dry scalp and they say it works very well. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs hair growth or getting rid of dry skin, scalp, etc.</li>
            <li> I like this Castor Oil as a detangler for my hair. It leaves my hair softer, helps keep styles in place and offers shine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and quick shipping as always thank you!</li>
            <li> this Oil is great for the hair scalp ... really liking the results that i am seeing ... def. will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great for hair growth !!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize castor oil was so thick!  It&#x27;s my first time using it.  Got this to help with hair growth, use it weekly in a mask, haven&#x27;t noticed much change.  Very difficult to wash out and I feel like it makes my hair dryer.  The brand and quality seems fine I just don&#x27;t think castor oil is for me.</li>
            <li> This castor oil is great. I use this on my eyebrows and they thickened and actually grew and eyelashes. I also use this in my hair and it made it thicken my sides. Oh this is a keeper</li>
            <li> I ordered this bottle several months ago and it&#x27;s still lasting me. I use it for my hair and sometimes my skin. Good product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product, using it to grow a very weak hairline and it&#x27;s filling nicely.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about a year ago; however, being the product junkie that I am, it was rotated in and out between my other oils and not used consistently or exclusively. I have only recently returned to using this again  because I am currently on a castor oil challenge in which you have to incorporate the use of this product into your hair regiment at least 3 times a week. Initially I went steer crazy with it and I was putting it into my pre-poos, my deep conditioners as well as sealing my hair with it after moisturizing it. All of that proved to be WAY TOO MUCH as I was a greasy mess!!! I have since tapered back, and have decided to go the rest of my castor oil challenge using it to oil my scalp on wash days, use it in my deep conditioners and massaging into any areas of my hair which I feel could be improved upon either growth-wise or keep my hair soften. I like my hair to feel moisturized but not greasy to the touch if you know what I mean, and you can easily go overboard with this product as a little goes a long way! With my first use of this I found it to be VERY, VERY THICK, so I thinned it out by mixing it with olive oil (50/50)and that has worked well for me. Also when I use it to seal my hair on wash days, my hair feels very soft to the touch (can&#x27;t keep my hands from out of my head) and has a nice shine to it. I&#x27;m hoping that with this 90 day castor oil challenge that I am currently on, I will get some additional growth (since this is what this product has been praised for and my hair only grew 5 inches the first year of my transition before I cut off the remainder of my relaxed ends. I am currently using it along my hairline and nape by rubbing it into those areas, 3 times a week, so wish me luck. BTW I am completely natural, with type 4A/B, collar-length hair.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast but when I got the bottle, the safety seal was broken so it was oily in the bag. When I finally got around to using it, it was like my previous castor oil, with the same consistency and smell, My problem is the bottle is a screw off top so pouring it out can be tricky and you can accidentally pour too much. I wish I had kept my old bottle so I could fill it with this oil and easily pour it out.</li>
            <li> I have recently started cleaning my face with the oil cleansing method. I wash my face with a mixture of olive oil and castor oil. This is a great price and will last for a long time!</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Highly recommended product and seller</li>
            <li> I use this in my blend of oils to cleanse my face. The oil cleansing method has been awesome for me and I found that this castor oil gave me great results as one of the &amp;#34;base oils.&amp;#34; Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Dislike this item immensely. Harsh on the hair and very oily. Not as it was advertised to be at all!</li>
            <li> The product is pure castor oil, and it works perfectly for all my personal care needs.  A little olive oil added to the castor oil makes a lovely face wash - my face has not been clearer.  It also moisturizes my scalp like no other hair care product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> A very good price and a very good product. I use this oil as a masque on my hair-mix it with an egg or just egg yolk and add some lemon juice and apply on dry hair-leave on for 30-60 mins. This oil makes my hair very shiny and soft. Washing off the masque is very easy. I also use this oil under my eyes and on my eyelashes to promote their growth.</li>
            <li> Great quality product</li>
            <li> Use this in my hair and on my eye lashes all the time, love this product!</li>
            <li> i have use this Caster OIL for about two months now and i love it.I use it on my leg, for stiffness and it WORKS better than bengay,try it.</li>
