            <li>/&gt;These blotting sheets are great for women who have oily skin.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li>They really do a great job of removing the excess oil without causing that caked-on-makeup look.</li>
            <li>Great for times when you know you&#x27;ll be taking a lot of pictures too.</li>

            <li>While this is an amusing idea (\\&quot;C&#x27;mon oil!</li>
            <li>While they do seem to be fairly absorbent, I just don&#x27;t like the plastic feel of the sheets.  </li>
            <li>Nice brand, good quality.</li>
            <li>What a lovely product!</li>
            <li>I always keep them handy in my purse now.</li>
            <li>These are clearly a nice item to have, but I don&#x27;t consider them a must have.  </li>
            <li>Nice packaging.</li>
            <li>probably some kind of polymeric</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think this are the best blotting sheets I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li>This is the latest kind I tried.  </li>
            <li>They are colored and turn translucent as you use them, which is handy and makes it easy to find your oily zones.</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;ve tried most of them.</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena ones are great because they really work</li>
            <li>A couple of my friends wanted to try them and were so pleased that they placed an order.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not my favorite Neutrogena product.</li>
            <li>Another winning product from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these oil-blotting sheets.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t know how well they work on top of makeup, however.)</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really consider polypropylene a great beauty cream.</li>
            <li>As someone who has those oily T-zone issues, I can count on one or more trips to the restroom per day to deal with it.</li>
            <li>I find myself usin more and more through out the day.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s Neutrogena; I&#x27;ve trusted my skin to them many times over the years, confident that their high quality standards will keep my skin in great shape.  </li>
            <li>However, there are 50 sheets per pack, which means even if you use more than one sheet at a time, you&#x27;re still getting a pretty good bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and experienced no adverse reactions to these sheets.  </li>
            <li>They are compact, lightweight and therefore easily portable for on the go use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Has a tape strip that makes it easy to take one sheet out at a time.</li>
            <li>Great idea overall.</li>
            <li>Zero itching, irritation, or dryness, absolutely fantastic product.</li>
            <li>When I opened the pack, the whole inside cover was blank, a perfect place to put the directions instead of cramming EVERYTHING on back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The are simple, effective and a must have beauty item for the ladies!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>and they have never disappointed me.</li>
            <li>really do work fabulous without messing up my makeup or layering on more powder...</li>
            <li>Although they worked ok, I personally wouldn&#x27;t be spending that kind of money on these.</li>
            <li>They were much nice than I expected, the paper felt kind of silky</li>
            <li>Bought this to try it.been using clean n</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used powder to combat the shine, but the idea of actually removing the oil rather than just covering it up sounded good to me, so I decided to try these sheets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty satisfying to see the darkened patches on the sheet and know that the oil is really gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only downside is I think my face has been becoming more oily after using this.</li>
            <li>It is much more effective at removing oil from my skin in one blot than the rice paper, but it is an odd sensation to place the plastic feeling sheet on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These sheets are better than just using a tissue which are less efficient and can leave their own residue.</li>
            <li>As someone with oily skin, I really appreciate this product when water and soap is not be available.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the claim of \\&quot;oil control for 4 hours\\&quot; is accurate; however, even if it only works for an hour or two, I would still be satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The excess oil will be absorbed into the sheet.  </li>
            <li>I hope that you have success as well.  </li>
            <li>I think there is some kind of ingredient on the outside of the blotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You decide if it is worth your money.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s useful.</li>
            <li>While I am not CERTAIN as to the etymology of this event, I think that the ingredient label gives a good hint.</li>
            <li>These blotting papers were a new idea to me, but very cool.</li>
            <li>For instance, right before the annual Christmas picture.</li>
            <li>(And be honest, you know you enjoy it when you see all those black spikes stuck to a pore cleansing strip when you peel it off--right before you say \\&quot;yuck!\\&quot; and toss it in the trash.)  </li>
            <li>You can see right away on the paper when it&#x27;s picked up the oil from your face, and then when I look in the mirror, everything really does look fresh again.</li>
            <li>The little cardboard case is great to take along with you and easy to open and re-close.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of blotting paper rather than caking on more powder.</li>
            <li>These seem to do exactly that.  </li>
            <li>, I think that it is more likely that the ultramarines are synthetic powder that exchanges location with the oil on your face.</li>
            <li>I love using blotting papers to absorb excess shine, especially during hot weather.  </li>
            <li>and it was just so pretty when you could see it getting darker from all the oil it removed from your skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how it works, but it does work and I like it.</li>
            <li>Product works exactly as described, if you have oil on your face and you want to remove it</li>
            <li>One pack of sheets would probably last me a long time, so in that respect they are very nice too.  </li>
            <li>They make it very easy to discretely touch up your face without needing to wipe away makeup like a normal facial wipe would do.</li>
            <li>That way you can pull out as many or as few as you need precisely.</li>
            <li>But I looked at the ingredient list and there made mainly of polypropylene which is kind of industrial and not really</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, they certainly APPEAR to take the oil off of your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sheets are smart.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see that they do much, and I think it&#x27;s much easier to just use a powder to reduce shine.</li>
            <li>One sheet can do your whole face.  </li>
            <li>The sheets didn&#x27;t really seem to pick up any oil from the rest of my face though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The thing that really got me was at this time Amazon is selling these blotting sheets for two packages of 50 sheets for $12.</li>
            <li>It might, but probably this is just another product that can be sold that promises beauty but is really lacking.  </li>
            <li>She wants to save them for summer and try then.  </li>
            <li>By blotting your face, what you&#x27;ve really accomplished is the transfer of the powder, which would also mute the shine that the oil would cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never been much into face blotting sheets, but thought I would see what these were about.  </li>
            <li>I suppose if you touch your face gently with them and didn&#x27;t wipe, then it would just take the shine off.  </li>
            <li>Besides that it was that, the product works very well.</li>
            <li>Need to use 2 sheets to really get the oil/shine off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for asking my opinion,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have those problems with this product though and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face looking like I gently washed off the oil without washing off my makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying different blotting papers lately to see which kind is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t soak up much face oil.</li>
            <li>I stopped using them for the time being, but I really miss them..</li>
            <li>Keeps my overall appearance looking more natural and even.</li>
            <li>Clean and Clear (another favorite), l&#x27;Occitane Rice paper (ok but expensive for what you get), Shisedo (ditto), Sephora brand (eh, so</li>
            <li>To my surprise I found the Neutrogena Deep Clean Shine Control Blotting sheets to be so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>Many other blotting sheets have some powder on them which can leave clumps of powder.</li>
            <li>Test out Neutrogena Deep Clean Shine Control</li>
            <li>sneaking out of the house, trashing the car, binge drinking, the whole deal--bad skin!) makes the cost of this product, which is a bit higher than other blotting papers, a worthy trade-off.</li>
            <li>I live in Michigan and this has really been a life saver this summer.</li>
            <li>Ok... I&#x27;m a guy, I don&#x27;t typically use this type of product.  </li>
            <li>so) and Boscia green tea (good enough).</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to the older style of rice paper blotting sheets.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so I had high hopes for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use Deep Clean facial wipes as well, which are stellar.</li>
            <li>They work extremely well and easily.</li>
            <li>Overall, Neutrogena Deep Clean Blotting Sheets work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have terribly oily skin, but I also tend toward flakiness, so just patting on more powder isn&#x27;t a very good solution for me when I get shiny.</li>
            <li>In the summer if there is anything new I&#x27;ll update this review.  </li>
            <li>I gotta live with it for the rest of my days</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re blotting a small area (like your nose, perhaps), more than one sheet may need to be used.  </li>
            <li>If you are fanatic about your face and it gets shiny, then these can be very helpful, otherwise you could most likely live without them, but there are lots of things we like that we don&#x27;t need.  </li>
            <li>Considering how incredibly cheap it is to make, I am a little surprised at the cost of this</li>
            <li>and I was surprised that Neutrogena could fit 50 blotting sheets in that little pack.</li>
            <li>clear..</li>
            <li>Also no problem with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When I opened this, I was surprised at the texture of it.</li>
            <li>You can actually see the blue start to disappear as the oil is absorbed into the sheet.</li>
            <li>The sheets themselves are rather thin, kind of like onion skin typing paper</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a little surprised to find that these are almost identical to the Clean &amp; Clear blotting sheets.  </li>
            <li>Like some other facial rehabilitation products (such as Biore), the Neutrogena Deep Clean Shine Control Blotting Sheets gives you the satisfaction of letting you see exactly what&#x27;s coming off your face.  </li>
            <li>and it is not worth the price, almost paid double than clean n</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I think these blotting sheets definitely do their job, I&#x27;ve still found myself gravitating to powder instead, primarily because the powder also helps to hide the uneven color of my skin and</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that 50 of the sheets fit in such a small package.</li>
            <li>I just blot these on over my makeup, add a little powder and my makeup looks fresh again.</li>
            <li>the pack is very small, easy to carry.</li>
            <li>I just think its so cool (and a little gross)</li>
            <li>Not a very pretty image, but they really do work and take the shine off.  </li>
            <li>I generally have a favorable opinion of Neutrogena products</li>
            <li>I generally use one of these</li>
            <li>clear and does the same thing..</li>
            <li>They have a silkier texture and much softer than the ones that resemble wax paper that are rough on the face and</li>
            <li>(yes, I&#x27;m old enough to remember typing paper).  </li>
            <li>and it barely budges my makeup.</li>
            <li>However these sheets are neutral scented and much nicer than other sheets which sometimes have an odor.</li>
            <li>However, on the inside flap of the case is a piece of sticky tape; you remove the protective covering and the tape adheres to the topmost blotting sheet when you close the case, so that when you open it back up, a single sheet has been pulled out, ready for use.  </li>
            <li>Powder compacts were always a problem because the extra powder can leave my face looking dried out, and oilier spots get more powder stuck to them and my makeup winds up looking looks cakey and uneven.</li>
            <li>My problem is the \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone area, across the forehead and straight down my nose to my chin.  </li>
            <li>Though the sheets are thin and only about 2 by 3\\&quot; in size, just one takes up pretty much all the oil my skin has to offer.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the claim of \\&quot;oil control for 4 hours\\&quot; is accurate; however, even if it only works for an hour or two, I would still be satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The excess oil will be absorbed into the sheet.  </li>
            <li> I hope that you have success as well.  </li>
            <li> I think there is some kind of ingredient on the outside of the blotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You decide if it is worth your money.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s useful.</li>
            <li> While I am not CERTAIN as to the etymology of this event, I think that the ingredient label gives a good hint.</li>
            <li> These blotting papers were a new idea to me, but very cool.</li>
            <li> For instance, right before the annual Christmas picture.</li>
            <li> (And be honest, you know you enjoy it when you see all those black spikes stuck to a pore cleansing strip when you peel it off--right before you say \\&quot;yuck!\\&quot; and toss it in the trash.)  </li>
            <li> You can see right away on the paper when it&#x27;s picked up the oil from your face, and then when I look in the mirror, everything really does look fresh again.</li>
            <li> The little cardboard case is great to take along with you and easy to open and re-close.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of blotting paper rather than caking on more powder.</li>
            <li> These seem to do exactly that.  </li>
            <li> , I think that it is more likely that the ultramarines are synthetic powder that exchanges location with the oil on your face.</li>
            <li> I love using blotting papers to absorb excess shine, especially during hot weather.  </li>
            <li> and it was just so pretty when you could see it getting darker from all the oil it removed from your skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly how it works, but it does work and I like it.</li>
            <li> Product works exactly as described, if you have oil on your face and you want to remove it</li>
            <li> One pack of sheets would probably last me a long time, so in that respect they are very nice too.  </li>
            <li> They make it very easy to discretely touch up your face without needing to wipe away makeup like a normal facial wipe would do.</li>
            <li> That way you can pull out as many or as few as you need precisely.</li>
            <li> But I looked at the ingredient list and there made mainly of polypropylene which is kind of industrial and not really</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, they certainly APPEAR to take the oil off of your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sheets are smart.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see that they do much, and I think it&#x27;s much easier to just use a powder to reduce shine.</li>
            <li> One sheet can do your whole face.  </li>
            <li> The sheets didn&#x27;t really seem to pick up any oil from the rest of my face though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The thing that really got me was at this time Amazon is selling these blotting sheets for two packages of 50 sheets for $12.</li>
            <li> It might, but probably this is just another product that can be sold that promises beauty but is really lacking.  </li>
            <li> She wants to save them for summer and try then.  </li>
            <li> By blotting your face, what you&#x27;ve really accomplished is the transfer of the powder, which would also mute the shine that the oil would cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never been much into face blotting sheets, but thought I would see what these were about.  </li>
            <li> I suppose if you touch your face gently with them and didn&#x27;t wipe, then it would just take the shine off.  </li>
            <li> Besides that it was that, the product works very well.</li>
            <li> Need to use 2 sheets to really get the oil/shine off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for asking my opinion,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have those problems with this product though and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face looking like I gently washed off the oil without washing off my makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different blotting papers lately to see which kind is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t soak up much face oil.</li>
            <li> I stopped using them for the time being, but I really miss them..</li>
            <li> Keeps my overall appearance looking more natural and even.</li>
            <li> Clean and Clear (another favorite), l&#x27;Occitane Rice paper (ok but expensive for what you get), Shisedo (ditto), Sephora brand (eh, so</li>
            <li> To my surprise I found the Neutrogena Deep Clean Shine Control Blotting sheets to be so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> Many other blotting sheets have some powder on them which can leave clumps of powder.</li>
            <li> Test out Neutrogena Deep Clean Shine Control</li>
            <li> sneaking out of the house, trashing the car, binge drinking, the whole deal--bad skin!) makes the cost of this product, which is a bit higher than other blotting papers, a worthy trade-off.</li>
            <li> I live in Michigan and this has really been a life saver this summer.</li>
            <li> Ok... I&#x27;m a guy, I don&#x27;t typically use this type of product.  </li>
            <li> so) and Boscia green tea (good enough).</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to the older style of rice paper blotting sheets.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> so I had high hopes for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Deep Clean facial wipes as well, which are stellar.</li>
            <li> They work extremely well and easily.</li>
            <li> Overall, Neutrogena Deep Clean Blotting Sheets work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have terribly oily skin, but I also tend toward flakiness, so just patting on more powder isn&#x27;t a very good solution for me when I get shiny.</li>
            <li> In the summer if there is anything new I&#x27;ll update this review.  </li>
            <li> I gotta live with it for the rest of my days</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re blotting a small area (like your nose, perhaps), more than one sheet may need to be used.  </li>
            <li> If you are fanatic about your face and it gets shiny, then these can be very helpful, otherwise you could most likely live without them, but there are lots of things we like that we don&#x27;t need.  </li>
            <li> Considering how incredibly cheap it is to make, I am a little surprised at the cost of this</li>
            <li> and I was surprised that Neutrogena could fit 50 blotting sheets in that little pack.</li>
            <li> clear..</li>
            <li> Also no problem with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I opened this, I was surprised at the texture of it.</li>
            <li> You can actually see the blue start to disappear as the oil is absorbed into the sheet.</li>
            <li> The sheets themselves are rather thin, kind of like onion skin typing paper</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little surprised to find that these are almost identical to the Clean &amp; Clear blotting sheets.  </li>
            <li> Like some other facial rehabilitation products (such as Biore), the Neutrogena Deep Clean Shine Control Blotting Sheets gives you the satisfaction of letting you see exactly what&#x27;s coming off your face.  </li>
            <li> and it is not worth the price, almost paid double than clean n</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I think these blotting sheets definitely do their job, I&#x27;ve still found myself gravitating to powder instead, primarily because the powder also helps to hide the uneven color of my skin and</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that 50 of the sheets fit in such a small package.</li>
            <li> I just blot these on over my makeup, add a little powder and my makeup looks fresh again.</li>
            <li> the pack is very small, easy to carry.</li>
            <li> I just think its so cool (and a little gross)</li>
            <li> Not a very pretty image, but they really do work and take the shine off.  </li>
            <li> I generally have a favorable opinion of Neutrogena products</li>
            <li> I generally use one of these</li>
            <li> clear and does the same thing..</li>
            <li> They have a silkier texture and much softer than the ones that resemble wax paper that are rough on the face and</li>
            <li> (yes, I&#x27;m old enough to remember typing paper).  </li>
            <li> and it barely budges my makeup.</li>
            <li> However these sheets are neutral scented and much nicer than other sheets which sometimes have an odor.</li>
            <li> However, on the inside flap of the case is a piece of sticky tape; you remove the protective covering and the tape adheres to the topmost blotting sheet when you close the case, so that when you open it back up, a single sheet has been pulled out, ready for use.  </li>
            <li> Powder compacts were always a problem because the extra powder can leave my face looking dried out, and oilier spots get more powder stuck to them and my makeup winds up looking looks cakey and uneven.</li>
            <li> My problem is the \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone area, across the forehead and straight down my nose to my chin.  </li>
            <li> Though the sheets are thin and only about 2 by 3\\&quot; in size, just one takes up pretty much all the oil my skin has to offer.</li>
            <li> so the price is a little high for only 50 sheets.</li>
            <li> It even brings back a little of the nostalgia from when I had to use blotting sheets often in high school</li>
            <li> I have mid to upper 40 eyes too, so I really did have a hard time reading the directions on the back of the package.</li>
            <li> I had never tried these blotting papers before, so I was surprised that they weren&#x27;t actually made of the usual rice paper, but of a plastic sort of material.  </li>
            <li> such, it is possible that this product is doing less to REMOVE the oil from your face than it is to HIDE the oil on your face.</li>
            <li> There are plenty other blotting sheets out there for a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn Kovacich&lt;br /&gt;Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> No different than the other brands though.</li>
            <li> I have a combination of oily and dry skin and these sheets work like a charm.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel greasy after you use them like the rice paper sheets so, although they do feel a little different.</li>
            <li> I use them on my eyelids and my nose, too, and I end up having a fresh looking face instead of that stale makeup look.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say about this.</li>
            <li> Because of the humidity my face gets shiny after only a few hours after applying makeup</li>
            <li> My other concern is that the product turns transparent when you use it.</li>
            <li> These are extremely convienent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re packaged in a small box, so they&#x27;re discreet enough to slip into your purse, pocket, or gym bag.</li>

            <li> It is mostly a dry sheet, not really sure what it is made out of, but it just seems to be a sheet of plastic.  </li>
            <li> only thing I did not like about these sheets, is that they can become flimsy and a little hard to maneuver over your face after they have soaked up some oil.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of blotting paper rather than caking on more powder. That said, I&#x27;ve tried most of them. Clean and Clear (another favorite), l&#x27;Occitane Rice paper (ok but expensive for what you get), Shisedo (ditto), Sephora brand (eh, so so) and Boscia green tea (good enough). The Neutrogena ones are great because they really work and they don&#x27;t leave any residue. They are colored and turn translucent as you use them, which is handy and makes it easy to find your oily zones. If you haven&#x27;t tried blotting sheets, try these, they are excellent and great price to quality.</li>
            <li> These are little papers that help remove the oily spots from your face. I use Deep Clean facial wipes as well, which are stellar. These blotting papers were a new idea to me, but very cool. They make it very easy to discretely touch up your face without needing to wipe away makeup like a normal facial wipe would do. You can see right away on the paper when it&#x27;s picked up the oil from your face, and then when I look in the mirror, everything really does look fresh again. The paper seems to keep the oil in control for at a least a few hours. Great idea overall. They will now be in my purse all the time.</li>
            <li> I have always carried blotting paper in my purse.  To my surprise I found the Neutrogena Deep Clean Shine Control Blotting sheets to be so much easier to use.  They have a silkier texture and much softer than the ones that resemble wax paper that are rough on the face and crinkly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blotting sheets are great for women who have oily skin.  My problem is the \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone area, across the forehead and straight down my nose to my chin.  Instead of using a handkerchief or tissue that would leave my face blotchy and red from dragging it across your face, you simply take one of these blotting sheets and press it against your face.  The excess oil will be absorbed into the sheet.  One sheet can do your whole face.  You can actually see the blue start to disappear as the oil is absorbed into the sheet. Your makeup will not be affected at all and it leaves no powder residue behind.  To test this, I took one sheet and pressed it against my eyelid over my eyeshadow and eyeliner.  I could see the oil residue on the blotting sheet but no makeup.  I then took that blotting sheet and rub it against a white piece of printer paper to see if any makeup would rub off on it.  By golly there was none!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this are the best blotting sheets I have tried so far.  I wish they can came in 100 packs.  The little cardboard case is great to take along with you and easy to open and re-close.  The are simple, effective and a must have beauty item for the ladies!</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that 50 of the sheets fit in such a small package. Perfect to keep in the pocket of your purse for an emergency touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear makeup except for lipstick or gloss so I can&#x27;t comment on if it works while wearing makeup. But I did use it on my forehead and nose and was amazed how great they worked. Also no problem with my sensitive skin. One sheet was all I needed. A couple of my friends wanted to try them and were so pleased that they placed an order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> These sheets work great, my daughter loves them as well. It removes the oil and shine very effectively. The packing and the way the sheet is selected is a great idea! Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used to use the oil control sheets that were rice paper with powder on them but it was hard to find ones that matched my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These really do work fabulous without messing up my makeup or layering on more powder...I even like using them when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> These blotting sheets didn&#x27;t dislodge my makeup and soaked up the shine like a mop.  It takes a couple of sheets if the oil slick on your nose is really bad, but generally, these little guys get the job done.  I have sensitive skin and experienced no adverse reactions to these sheets.  Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> As someone with oily skin, I really appreciate this product when water and soap is not be available. I carry them with me on trips and at work and they have never disappointed me. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for touching up the T-Zone! I just blot these on over my makeup, add a little powder and my makeup looks fresh again.</li>
            <li> These strips are a bit too thin and flimsy; I could barely wipe them across my face. I don&#x27;t really see that they do much, and I think it&#x27;s much easier to just use a powder to reduce shine. The packaging is flimsy, too, and if you leave the package in the wrong place, all of the strips will get wet or will fall over the floor. Not my favorite Neutrogena product.</li>
            <li> Please note that I did not try this product as it was for women so I let my girlfriend try it out and this is what she had to say about it.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit that I have an oily complexion and when I saw these on the Vine Program I just had to try them. It took me a moment to figure out that there is a sticky spot on the inside of the flap that you have to remove the cover. Once you do that, you just press the cover onto the sheet and it will pull one out to use. As soon as I put the paper to my forehead, it turns darker blue/translucent. It looks like all the oil from my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you can only use one sheet once. So, it took me a couple sheets to get all the oil off of just my forehead. The sheets didn&#x27;t really seem to pick up any oil from the rest of my face though. I admit that I don&#x27;t wear makeup so I don&#x27;t know how well these work with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that really got me was at this time Amazon is selling these blotting sheets for two packages of 50 sheets for $12. That seems really expensive. Although they worked ok, I personally wouldn&#x27;t be spending that kind of money on these. There are plenty other blotting sheets out there for a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn Kovacich&lt;br /&gt;Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> These sheets may look like they&#x27;ve been cut out of blue surgical gloves and may feel the same when you use them.  However, when you see how well they work, you won&#x27;t care a bit.  Like some other facial rehabilitation products (such as Biore), the Neutrogena Deep Clean Shine Control Blotting Sheets gives you the satisfaction of letting you see exactly what&#x27;s coming off your face.  (And be honest, you know you enjoy it when you see all those black spikes stuck to a pore cleansing strip when you peel it off--right before you say \\&quot;yuck!\\&quot; and toss it in the trash.)  Depending on your skin type, you may be amazed at the quantity of oil pulled from your face.  The sheets themselves are rather thin, kind of like onion skin typing paper (yes, I&#x27;m old enough to remember typing paper).  However, on the inside flap of the case is a piece of sticky tape; you remove the protective covering and the tape adheres to the topmost blotting sheet when you close the case, so that when you open it back up, a single sheet has been pulled out, ready for use.  Close, stick, open, use, repeat.  Handy!  I don&#x27;t carry around a stopwatch, so I don&#x27;t know if the claim of \\&quot;oil control for 4 hours\\&quot; is accurate; however, even if it only works for an hour or two, I would still be satisfied.  The credit card-sized package means you can conveniently carry it around in your purse, wallet, pocket, or even your bra (although that might be a bit uncomfortable for long-term storage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that size.  Unless you&#x27;re blotting a small area (like your nose, perhaps), more than one sheet may need to be used.  However, there are 50 sheets per pack, which means even if you use more than one sheet at a time, you&#x27;re still getting a pretty good bang for your buck.  Plus, it&#x27;s Neutrogena; I&#x27;ve trusted my skin to them many times over the years, confident that their high quality standards will keep my skin in great shape.  Knowing that instead of caking my pores with more powder, I&#x27;m actually getting rid of the stuff which can make my skin go bad (and when it goes bad, it really goes bad--sneaking out of the house, trashing the car, binge drinking, the whole deal--bad skin!) makes the cost of this product, which is a bit higher than other blotting papers, a worthy trade-off.of the stuff which can make my skin go bad (and when it goes bad, it really goes bad--sneaking out of the house, trashing the car, binge drinking, the whole deal--bad skin!) makes the cost of this product, which is a bit higher than other blotting papers, a worthy trade-off.</li>
            <li> These sheets are great for blotting excess oil and keeping a shine-free complexion. I like to use them after work to blot before heading out for the evening. They work extremely well and easily. Just use one sheet for each area. You can only use the sheet once (they&#x27;re disposable not resuable) so the price is a little high for only 50 sheets. However these sheets are neutral scented and much nicer than other sheets which sometimes have an odor. I can use 1-2 sheets to blot my face so they last a while.</li>
            <li> When I opened this, I was surprised at the texture of it. The material reminds me of a thin trash bag instead of the rice paper I am used to. It is much more effective at removing oil from my skin in one blot than the rice paper, but it is an odd sensation to place the plastic feeling sheet on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and this is perfect for evening out the areas where I am more oily. It is the prefect size to discreetly keep in my makeup pouch in my purse. Another winning product from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I requested this product hoping for some help with blackheads on the nose.  But this is definitely a female&#x27;s product.  Of course I had to use it to try it out because I had to write a review of the product.  It promises to remove shine from the face.  It is mostly a dry sheet, not really sure what it is made out of, but it just seems to be a sheet of plastic.  Now on to if it helps, I am not really sure.  It might, but probably this is just another product that can be sold that promises beauty but is really lacking.  At the end of using this product, I did not notice any changes in my complexion.  Everything seemed the same. This could be because I do not use make-up, so forgive me for the perspective, but I still believe there is not a lot of value in this product.</li>
            <li> Ok... I&#x27;m a guy, I don&#x27;t typically use this type of product.  So I enlisted my wife&#x27;s help.  Out of the box they are not at all what you would expect.  They look (and feel) like one of those little breath fresheners that you put on your tongue.  It feels sort of plastic.  Not at all what I was expecting for something that I thought was to remove oil from your skin.  However, upon testing, when you blot your skin with it, it does bring oil away.  My wife was impressed as well.  She wants to save them for summer and try then.  In the meanwhile, with products like this, I tend to be of the opinion that if they do what they say they do with a minimum of effort on my part I&#x27;m happy.  These seem to do exactly that.  If you buy them I hope that you have success as well.  In the summer if there is anything new I&#x27;ll update this review.  Thank you for taking the time to read my review.</li>
            <li> I have terribly oily skin, but I also tend toward flakiness, so just patting on more powder isn&#x27;t a very good solution for me when I get shiny. I LOVE these oil-blotting sheets. They really do a great job of removing the excess oil without causing that caked-on-makeup look. I always keep them handy in my purse now.</li>
            <li> These are made of polypropylene, which is basically plastic. Considering how incredibly cheap it is to make, I am a little surprised at the cost of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, they certainly APPEAR to take the oil off of your face. (I don&#x27;t know how well they work on top of makeup, however.) My other concern is that the product turns transparent when you use it. While I am not CERTAIN as to the etymology of this event, I think that the ingredient label gives a good hint. The product contains, as an additional ingredient, \\&quot;ultramarines\\&quot;. While this is an amusing idea (\\&quot;C&#x27;mon oil! Fall in!\\&quot;), I think that it is more likely that the ultramarines are synthetic powder that exchanges location with the oil on your face. By blotting your face, what you&#x27;ve really accomplished is the transfer of the powder, which would also mute the shine that the oil would cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such, it is possible that this product is doing less to REMOVE the oil from your face than it is to HIDE the oil on your face. Until I have discovered which is the case, I shall consider this a 3 star product.</li>
            <li> The mission (which I chose to accept): Test out Neutrogena Deep Clean Shine Control Blotting Sheets.&lt;br /&gt;The subjects for this experiment:&lt;br /&gt;#1 Me: Female, Caucasian skin, 40s....mid to upper 40s....I remember Ford being president.&lt;br /&gt;#2 The Punk: Male, Caucasian skin, 16 and just got a driver&#x27;s permit, (so I am the one breaking out thinking about insurance costs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I get the little package and I was surprised that Neutrogena could fit 50 blotting sheets in that little pack. I was only expecting, like five.  However, the blotting sheets have the paper consistency a little thicker than a Bamboo rolling papers, so there were 50.  I have mid to upper 40 eyes too, so I really did have a hard time reading the directions on the back of the package. I never could read the ingredients. When I opened the pack, the whole inside cover was blank, a perfect place to put the directions instead of cramming EVERYTHING on back.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, this product markets to a younger crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sheets are smart. They have a plastic feel to them...like Christmas tissue paper and plastic. After an experiment, the sheet does know water from oil. Water does nothing to it, while oil absorbs into the sheet and turns the sheet translucent. I think there is some kind of ingredient on the outside of the blotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Punk also tried the sheets. He thought they were \\&quot;okay\\&quot;, what does he know, darn teenagers. (Unless it has the Axe logo on it, he&#x27;s not going to like anything). Being a boy, 16, and a punk, he did have some issues getting only one sheet out at a time. (Which was comforting to me as a mom knowing he didn&#x27;t know how to properly remove a rolling paper). But I digress....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the sheets were confiscated and I decided to carry them in my purse. They actually work well with make-up in an emergency.  For instance, right before the annual Christmas picture.</li>
            <li> I love using blotting papers to absorb excess shine, especially during hot weather.  I had never tried these blotting papers before, so I was surprised that they weren&#x27;t actually made of the usual rice paper, but of a plastic sort of material.  While they do seem to be fairly absorbent, I just don&#x27;t like the plastic feel of the sheets.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have never been much into face blotting sheets, but thought I would see what these were about.  They were much nice than I expected, the paper felt kind of silky and it was just so pretty when you could see it getting darker from all the oil it removed from your skin.  Not a very pretty image, but they really do work and take the shine off.  I don&#x27;t fully understand how they work with makeup, I imagine they would take your makeup off too, but I suppose if you touch your face gently with them and didn&#x27;t wipe, then it would just take the shine off.  These are clearly a nice item to have, but I don&#x27;t consider them a must have.  One pack of sheets would probably last me a long time, so in that respect they are very nice too.  If you are fanatic about your face and it gets shiny, then these can be very helpful, otherwise you could most likely live without them, but there are lots of things we like that we don&#x27;t need.  You decide if it is worth your money.</li>
            <li> IT says two packs, but I only got one. Besides that it was that, the product works very well. whether your sweating or feeling oily the pads of paper take care of any of that. the pack is very small, easy to carry. These are extremely convienent. I recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Well if you ever needed to blot yourself it would be now in this summer heat! I like these sheets, they blot up all the grease and sweat on your face but don&#x27;t seem to attract any powder that may be on you. Don&#x27;t know how that works but it&#x27;s useful. What I don&#x27;t care for is the plasticky feel of these sheets. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to the older style of rice paper blotting sheets. But I looked at the ingredient list and there made mainly of polypropylene which is kind of industrial and not really something I want rubbing over my face. I gotta live with it for the rest of my days and I don&#x27;t really consider polypropylene a great beauty cream.</li>
            <li> When I saw that Neutrogena was introducing blotting sheets, I was on board. What a lovely product! I have a combination of oily and dry skin and these sheets work like a charm. I was going to use them for my forehead and cheeks, but now I use them for my entire face. It even brings back a little of the nostalgia from when I had to use blotting sheets often in high school (thank you, puberty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re packaged in a small box, so they&#x27;re discreet enough to slip into your purse, pocket, or gym bag. They don&#x27;t feel greasy after you use them like the rice paper sheets so, although they do feel a little different. Small quibble aside, they&#x27;re very good for those areas which get shine overload.</li>
            <li> These sheets do what they say they will - they remove the oil (shine) from your face without disrupting your makeup.  They are compact, lightweight and therefore easily portable for on the go use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like about these sheets, is that they can become flimsy and a little hard to maneuver over your face after they have soaked up some oil.</li>
            <li> 1. No powder residue on your face. Many other blotting sheets have some powder on them which can leave clumps of powder. Best feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Need to use 2 sheets to really get the oil/shine off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Nice packaging. Has a tape strip that makes it easy to take one sheet out at a time. That way you can pull out as many or as few as you need precisely.</li>
            <li> nothing. Thanks for asking my opinion, while I didn&#x27;t have a try, it is a gift sent to my friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these strips on my oily forehead in the late afternoon and they absorb without stripping my makeup. I use them on my eyelids and my nose, too, and I end up having a fresh looking face instead of that stale makeup look. These sheets are better than just using a tissue which are less efficient and can leave their own residue.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and usually end up with an oily nose and forehead by afternoon. I&#x27;ve always used powder to combat the shine, but the idea of actually removing the oil rather than just covering it up sounded good to me, so I decided to try these sheets. Overall, Neutrogena Deep Clean Blotting Sheets work pretty well. Though the sheets are thin and only about 2 by 3\\&quot; in size, just one takes up pretty much all the oil my skin has to offer. It&#x27;s pretty satisfying to see the darkened patches on the sheet and know that the oil is really gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I think these blotting sheets definitely do their job, I&#x27;ve still found myself gravitating to powder instead, primarily because the powder also helps to hide the uneven color of my skin and the sheets don&#x27;t. My personal preferences aside, these sheets definitely do the job they claim to, and I would recommend them to anyone who prefers blotting paper over powder.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try it.been using clean n clear..and it is not worth the price, almost paid double than clean n clear and does the same thing..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often get oily skin, but when I go out for an evening with friends, I like to carry these along with me. Without fail I reach some point in the night where the shine starts to appear, and rather then try to cake on more makeup, I prefer to remove the shine. Keeps my overall appearance looking more natural and even.</li>
            <li> Nice brand, good quality.</li>
            <li> As someone who has those oily T-zone issues, I can count on one or more trips to the restroom per day to deal with it. Powder compacts were always a problem because the extra powder can leave my face looking dried out, and oilier spots get more powder stuck to them and my makeup winds up looking looks cakey and uneven. Not to mention they crumble up and mess up my purse sometimes. I don&#x27;t have those problems with this product though and it works very well. It leaves my face looking like I gently washed off the oil without washing off my makeup. I don&#x27;t know exactly how it works, but it does work and I like it.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say about this. It does what it says and that&#x27;s it. No different than the other brands though.</li>
            <li> I live in Michigan and this has really been a life saver this summer. Because of the humidity my face gets shiny after only a few hours after applying makeup and this helps keep my face look \\&quot;matte\\&quot; looking and it barely budges my makeup. I just think its so cool (and a little gross) how you can see all the oil that comes off. I have been using for about a month and have noticed a decrease in pimples and blemishes also. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to buy this. Great for times when you know you&#x27;ll be taking a lot of pictures too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different blotting papers lately to see which kind is my favorite.  This is the latest kind I tried.  I generally have a favorable opinion of Neutrogena products so I had high hopes for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little surprised to find that these are almost identical to the Clean &amp; Clear blotting sheets.  They&#x27;re the same color of blue and the same texture (not paper, probably some kind of polymeric material).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, these perform quite well.  I have combination skin with an oily T-zone.  I use foundation primer and finishing powder and that helps control the oil somewhat, but by midday, I usually still have a bit of shine on my nose and forehead.  I generally use one of these and it&#x27;s enough to get rid of the shine in both places -- they absorb oil quite well.  Using these does not disturb my makeup, either.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> Nope, didn&#x27;t do the job!  I&#x27;ve had the Japanese blotting sheets made in Japan and compared to them, there Nuetrogena ones are terrible.  It really didn&#x27;t soak up much face oil.</li>
            <li> Product works exactly as described, if you have oil on your face and you want to remove it this is the solution.  Zero itching, irritation, or dryness, absolutely fantastic product.</li>
            <li> The blotting sheets become an addiction once you know you have them, it does remove all the oil and shine from your face, it&#x27;s awesome and amazing and wonderful. Only downside is I think my face has been becoming more oily after using this. I find myself usin more and more through out the day. I stopped using them for the time being, but I really miss them..</li>
