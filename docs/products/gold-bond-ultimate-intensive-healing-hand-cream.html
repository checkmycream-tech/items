            <li>It was pleasant but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it sparingly for that reason, but it is a good lotion.</li>
            <li>This hand lotions does exactly what it says it will do and the best part, it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, which is great!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>They are healing, it&#x27;s amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>effective.</li>

            <li>I really love this lotion.</li>
            <li>and we all love it.  </li>
            <li>and I tried so many.</li>
            <li>I have tried many hand creams.  </li>
            <li>Then when I rubbed it in and I was in love.</li>
            <li>Just bought 2 more tubes of it.  </li>
            <li>Love how my hands feel after rubbing it in...</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>The scent is really nice, it absorbs quickly and it&#x27;s not greasy.  </li>
            <li>The best cream for cracked and dry hands.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands but this works the best!</li>
            <li>Also, more important to me, it is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Nice light smell, not oily, soothing and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a really good hand cream with out spending a ton of money and found Gold Bonds stuff and liked the smell initially.</li>
            <li>It also does have a fragrance which I am not used to in my regular Gold Bond product, but it is very pleasant and dissipates quickly so that if you don&#x27;t like it, it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was available in Canada.</li>
            <li>I picked this up at the grocery store primarily because it was cheaper than the others I was considering (neutrogena and, I think, Curel).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in card magic heaven right now.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li>This works great on my dry hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely sold on this line of products and this latest one for me is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly and this is great stuff for really dry skin</li>
            <li>Love this lotion...great for the purse and works really well...</li>
            <li>This hand cream is great, it even works well on very dry hands!  </li>
            <li>The wife has really enjoyed this product as it keeps her hands soft and smooth after she cleans and washes dishes.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Just like it says on the bottle; absorbs very quickly, has a very pleasant fresh scent and it definitely repairs dry and cracked hands.</li>
            <li>and I go through a lot but for the first time in months I have hands that are not itching!  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li>that O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s, Golden Touch, or</li>
            <li>It smells so good, and really does last even after a couple hand washes.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it heals my red, cracked hands!</li>
            <li>While I was pregnant I washed my hands so much the skin around my knuckles started cracking.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more of this next winter.</li>
            <li>The rest of the lotion dries ON TOP of the skin and flakes off leaving white residue on everything you touch.</li>
            <li>which means I have been washing my hands constantly as I am trying to make sure I don&#x27;t spread germs or acquire any of the germs which run rampant in health care facilities.  </li>
            <li>And the &#x27;hydralast&#x27; REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>I wanted I bought this product just to give it a chance and within 24 hours of the first application I can already see it working.</li>
            <li>The first day I tried this Gold Bond cream I thought, hey it doesn&#x27;t make them itch -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an art teacher, with my hands constantly in clay, and this stuff helps protect my hands for hours during the school day while not having to wipe my hands off with a paper towel after putting this on like I do with most lotions.  </li>
            <li>This is a lovely hand cream - thick but easy to apply/absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>works into skin fast, works to heal breaks and sores due to dryness (also fast), isn&#x27;t obtrusively greasy like many lotions and keeps working after water exposure!</li>
            <li>I used about half of the tube before throwing it out just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t judging it too quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this hand cream; I wash my hands often so they are always dry.  </li>
            <li>but I really do think it is helping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really works as advertised on the package:</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>- you don&#x27;t have to rub and rub and rub and then wait forever for it to really soak in like with so many other hand lotions.  </li>
            <li>works better than any other cream that</li>
            <li>This one also smells better and absorbs a little faster.</li>
            <li>This absorbs lightning fast and, as advertised, there is no heavy greasy feeling  </li>
            <li>It is also available at Walgreens for five dollars so not much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This is the first hand cream I&#x27;ve used that actually made my hands softer and nicer looking.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to make my hands feel soft and smooth and the small tube has lasted over a month now.  </li>
            <li>I have been absolutely devoted to Gold Bond lotion after I discovered it several years ago.  </li>
            <li>It really does make my hands look younger and feel smoother after I put it on.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at a grocery store once to give it a try, one of those impulse buys near the register, and have used in exclusively ever since.</li>
            <li>It only took 3 days of only 2 uses during the day at work, and once right before bed.</li>
            <li>And - very important when your skin is seriously wrecked</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY cream I&#x27;ve tried that actually takes dry hands and gives them what feels like NATURAL</li>
            <li>It really does help to HEAL dry hands too (compared to other lotions that just grease you up).</li>

            <li> My hands were not only dry but developing major cracks.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond healing hand cream is the only lotion or hand cream that actually does heal my dry and cracked skin.</li>
            <li> No more, thanks to using this product</li>
            <li> Not sticky and last long even after I wash my hands.</li>
            <li> After all of that, I have had only one minor skin crack around my thumb nail.  </li>
            <li> long lasting (I&#x27;m talking HOURS), and somehow (I don&#x27;t know how), there is NO residue.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, no ordor, not too thick  and does heal on first use.</li>
            <li> I have dry hands that crack and bleed in the winter if I don&#x27;t constantly apply lotion to</li>
            <li> my wife used,(doesn&#x27;t heal the problem but so long as you use it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick like Shea butter but doesn&#x27;t leave as much greasy coating.</li>
            <li> I get dry peeling skin just up from the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> This reall works on dry, cracked hands and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Magicians with dry hands can relate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got for husbands dry chapped hands.  </li>
            <li> After trying a few more expensive creams and not getting the results</li>
            <li> The only other hand cream that I&#x27;ve found comparable is Miracle Hand Repair (which I couldn&#x27;t find at local stores for some reason), which, at least on amazon, is more expensive.</li>
            <li> Yeah it might be a little more expensive than other lotions</li>
            <li> I have put my hands through a lot as I have also been less faithful about wearing gloves when just running outside for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does kinda moisturize because only a little absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this during a bout of very dry hands and feet, after my regular lotions (and several non-regulars I bought for the occasion) failed me epically, even when I was applying them almost every time I washed my hands (which I have to do a lot because I have a two year old who isn&#x27;t potty trained and loves messes).</li>
            <li> It lasts through at least 2 hand washings and no other cream in the world has done this for me.</li>
            <li> The tube is small, so unless you were looking for something to throw in your purse or suite case, you might consider a larger size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the tube is rather small and costs allot relatively to its size</li>
            <li> My hands take a beating during the winter, and after trying too many lotions just to be disappointed, I bought this on a whim.</li>
            <li> It is powerful when the cold tries to crack your fingers, but it doesn&#x27;t make your hands feel slimy.</li>
            <li> The subject line says it all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if you apply a lot or just a little.</li>
            <li> One thing to keep in mind is that the product might sting a little if your hands are cracked but the feeling goes away within minutes and as your hands heal it doesn&#x27;t sting anymore.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t hold out much hope after so much disappointment.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My hands have been so red, rough, and painful lately between winter dry air and a less-than-gentle dish soap I have been using.  </li>
            <li> They were starting to become painful and interfering with daily activities.</li>
            <li> It is really a small bottle for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li> Even then, the split is minor enough that it hasn&#x27;t bleed, hasn&#x27;t been painful, and is healing quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I picked this cream up in the store just to try yet one more cream to try to help my eczema and horribly HORRIBLY itchy hands.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, it absorbs in 10 seconds or less.  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle scent that isn&#x27;t unpleasant and leaves hands feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Throw out all of your other healing hand creams, and I&#x27;m not being dramatic!</li>
            <li> Oh, and the scent is subtle and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left residue and made my hands dry and horrible, i tried to like it</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone who, like me, suffers terrible dry irritated winter skin.</li>
            <li> So weird.  </li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> They crack and burn and are dry like sandpaper and just look terrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have been having an usually cold winter here in the Midwest.</li>

            <li> Wanted to love it but my hands have never felt drier!!!  So weird.  Would like to know what specific ingredient causes this...</li>
            <li> It is really a small bottle for the price I paid.  I&#x27;m using it sparingly for that reason, but it is a good lotion.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fantastic! I really love this lotion. It is powerful when the cold tries to crack your fingers, but it doesn&#x27;t make your hands feel slimy. The tube is small, so unless you were looking for something to throw in your purse or suite case, you might consider a larger size.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this cream.  Nice light smell, not oily, soothing and absorbs quickly.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Always buy this because it works</li>
            <li> Gold Bond healing hand cream is the only lotion or hand cream that actually does heal my dry and cracked skin. Especially good during the winter months. Only problem here is the price -- I buy the 3 oz tube at Target all the time for only $3.89.</li>
            <li> The best restoration cream I have ever used.  After surgery recommended by the nurse who treated me.. No regrets.</li>
            <li> This works great on my dry hands. Not sticky and last long even after I wash my hands.</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference between GB ultimate healing and the more expensive hand cream. In the future I&#x27;ll stick with GB ultimate healing and save the $.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome hand cream. It&#x27;s thick like Shea butter but doesn&#x27;t leave as much greasy coating. It really does help to HEAL dry hands too (compared to other lotions that just grease you up). Will be ordering more of this next winter.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is great, it even works well on very dry hands!  The scent is really nice, it absorbs quickly and it&#x27;s not greasy.  I bought it for my mother, my grandmother and myself and we all love it.  I would recommend this product.  I wish it was available in Canada.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and I tried so many. I have dry hands that crack and bleed in the winter if I don&#x27;t constantly apply lotion to and I was excited to try this. I used about half of the tube before throwing it out just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t judging it too quickly. It does kinda moisturize because only a little absorbs into the skin. The rest of the lotion dries ON TOP of the skin and flakes off leaving white residue on everything you touch. This happens with any amount applied. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you apply a lot or just a little. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Use Eos it&#x27;s the best &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> The wife has really enjoyed this product as it keeps her hands soft and smooth after she cleans and washes dishes.</li>
            <li> My hands have been so red, rough, and painful lately between winter dry air and a less-than-gentle dish soap I have been using.  I picked this up at the grocery store primarily because it was cheaper than the others I was considering (neutrogena and, I think, Curel).  Slathered it on as soon as I got to my car and I could almost hear my hands sighing with contentment.  This absorbs lightning fast and, as advertised, there is no heavy greasy feeling  - you don&#x27;t have to rub and rub and rub and then wait forever for it to really soak in like with so many other hand lotions.  And - very important when your skin is seriously wrecked - there is NO burning, no stinging, nothing like that.  Just instant soothing for your angriest skin.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been absolutely devoted to Gold Bond lotion after I discovered it several years ago.  Friends that have asked to use it when they see me putting it on have also become instant converts.  Probably five people I know use it faithfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been having an usually cold winter here in the Midwest. In addition, my father had been in the hospital/rehab facility for over a month now which means I have been washing my hands constantly as I am trying to make sure I don&#x27;t spread germs or acquire any of the germs which run rampant in health care facilities.  I have put my hands through a lot as I have also been less faithful about wearing gloves when just running outside for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to pick this up when I saw it to try to counteract some of the abuse my hands have been going through and it&#x27;s wonderful!  It doesn&#x27;t take much to make my hands feel soft and smooth and the small tube has lasted over a month now.  It also does have a fragrance which I am not used to in my regular Gold Bond product, but it is very pleasant and dissipates quickly so that if you don&#x27;t like it, it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  After all of that, I have had only one minor skin crack around my thumb nail.  Even then, the split is minor enough that it hasn&#x27;t bleed, hasn&#x27;t been painful, and is healing quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely sold on this line of products and this latest one for me is fabulous.  I just keep it in my purse and use whenever I am out and about.  Great!</li>
            <li> After reading different reviews on this thought I would try it out.  Have only used it for 4 days but I really do think it is helping.&lt;br /&gt;I can update as I use it more.[[ASIN:B00A8S6HM4 Gold Bond Ultimate Intensive Healing Hand Cream]]</li>
            <li> The best cream for cracked and dry hands. I&#x27;ve tried them all. This is the best.</li>
            <li> I get dry peeling skin just up from the cuticle.  It drives me crazy, and I find myself picking or biting at it.  Then that leads to my fingers looking like yuck.  This is the only product I  have found that works to stop that dryness AND not feel oily.  It is also available at Walgreens for five dollars so not much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This reall works on dry, cracked hands and is not greasy.  I have tried many other brands but this works the best!</li>
            <li> The only hand cream I found that truly is non-greasy like the tube says it is.</li>
            <li> The subject line says it all. My hands were not only dry but developing major cracks. They were starting to become painful and interfering with daily activities. This cream took care of the problem in no time.</li>
            <li> The skin at the end of my thumbs used to split in the winter - very painful. No more, thanks to using this product</li>
            <li> will purchase again, great price</li>
            <li> Expensive but it works great.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hand creams.  This is the first hand cream I&#x27;ve used that actually made my hands softer and nicer looking.</li>
            <li> Living in Chicago, every winter my hands are a nightmare! They crack and burn and are dry like sandpaper and just look terrible. I was looking for a really good hand cream with out spending a ton of money and found Gold Bonds stuff and liked the smell initially. It was pleasant but not overpowering. Then when I rubbed it in and I was in love. I instantly felt a cooling sensation on my hands, a sigh of relief. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who, like me, suffers terrible dry irritated winter skin.</li>
            <li> Really works as advertised on the package: works into skin fast, works to heal breaks and sores due to dryness (also fast), isn&#x27;t obtrusively greasy like many lotions and keeps working after water exposure! It has a subtle scent that isn&#x27;t unpleasant and leaves hands feeling soft and silky. I tried this during a bout of very dry hands and feet, after my regular lotions (and several non-regulars I bought for the occasion) failed me epically, even when I was applying them almost every time I washed my hands (which I have to do a lot because I have a two year old who isn&#x27;t potty trained and loves messes). The only other hand cream that I&#x27;ve found comparable is Miracle Hand Repair (which I couldn&#x27;t find at local stores for some reason), which, at least on amazon, is more expensive. This one also smells better and absorbs a little faster.</li>
            <li> Best. Hand cream. Ever. Throw out all of your other healing hand creams, and I&#x27;m not being dramatic! As a woman in my 30&#x27;s who has suffered with eczema for 25+ years, this has saved my hands. I&#x27;ve tried everything, from prescription creams to $20 drugstore brands that claim they are specifically for eczema...nothing works like this. It only took 3 days of only 2 uses during the day at work, and once right before bed. And the &#x27;hydralast&#x27; REALLY WORKS! It lasts through at least 2 hand washings and no other cream in the world has done this for me. I felt obligated to write a review on this because it has changed my life and I&#x27;ve only owned this for a week. I&#x27;ll be repurchasing for my office desk, handbag, sink, bedside table...etc. you get the point. This stuff rocks.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream; I wash my hands often so they are always dry.  While I was pregnant I washed my hands so much the skin around my knuckles started cracking.  This cream cleared that up in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and this is great stuff for really dry skin</li>
            <li> This product really works. Just like it says on the bottle; absorbs very quickly, has a very pleasant fresh scent and it definitely repairs dry and cracked hands. After trying a few more expensive creams and not getting the results I wanted I bought this product just to give it a chance and within 24 hours of the first application I can already see it working. One thing to keep in mind is that the product might sting a little if your hands are cracked but the feeling goes away within minutes and as your hands heal it doesn&#x27;t sting anymore.</li>
            <li> works better than any other cream that my wife used,(doesn&#x27;t heal the problem but so long as you use it it works.)&lt;br /&gt;the tube is rather small and costs allot relatively to its size</li>
            <li> Indeed it is the ultimate hand cream. Not greasy, no ordor, not too thick  and does heal on first use.</li>
            <li> I picked this cream up in the store just to try yet one more cream to try to help my eczema and horribly HORRIBLY itchy hands.  My hands this winter have been so bad I have tried almost every cream imaginable, lotions, prescriptions, corticosteriods, cream for cows udders, baby diaper rash ointment, working hands, coconut oil, olive oil, I could go on and on.  I slathered the others on - put on gloves, tried my best, and still ended up with hands so itchy I thought I&#x27;d lose my mind.  I even wrapped my hands in cold ice packs to try to stop the itching.  My hands still looked like h*** and I saw people looking at them probably wondering &amp;#34;why doesn&#x27;t that girl take care of her hands.&amp;#34;  The first day I tried this Gold Bond cream I thought, hey it doesn&#x27;t make them itch - but I didn&#x27;t hold out much hope after so much disappointment. But it is working - have been using it a lot and I go through a lot but for the first time in months I have hands that are not itching!  They are healing, it&#x27;s amazing stuff.  Just bought 2 more tubes of it.  Yeah it might be a little more expensive than other lotions but it actually works so it&#x27;s worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li> Magicians with dry hands can relate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drop that O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s, Golden Touch, or whatever else you&#x27;ve tried and pick this up NOW.  This is the ONLY cream I&#x27;ve tried that actually takes dry hands and gives them what feels like NATURAL moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was an O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s man before using this stuff, although I sometimes went the Corn Husker&#x27;s route, and I can tell you, without trepidation, that this is the only hand moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t end up affecting the edges of my cards after a week or so.  Just a dab will do you -- long lasting (I&#x27;m talking HOURS), and somehow (I don&#x27;t know how), there is NO residue.  Oh, and the scent is subtle and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is miracle cream.  I&#x27;m in card magic heaven right now.</li>
            <li> This hand lotions does exactly what it says it will do and the best part, it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, which is great!</li>
            <li> Left residue and made my hands dry and horrible, i tried to like it but I failed miserably. .. .....</li>
            <li> Got for husbands dry chapped hands.  Very good hand lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion...great for the purse and works really well...Love how my hands feel after rubbing it in...I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is liquid gold. My hands take a beating during the winter, and after trying too many lotions just to be disappointed, I bought this on a whim. I LOVE IT. It smells so good, and really does last even after a couple hand washes. More importantly, it heals my red, cracked hands!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely hand cream - thick but easy to apply/absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands greasy feeling.  The price is fair too!  (by deb, Richard&#x27;s wife)</li>
            <li> This hand cream is great!  It really does make my hands look younger and feel smoother after I put it on.  Also, more important to me, it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> The best hand cream I have found this winter</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve found so far, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Not too greasy and dries quickly. Long lasting. effective.</li>
            <li> The ONLY lotion/hand cream I have ever used that is actually NOT GREASY!!!  Seriously, it absorbs in 10 seconds or less.  I&#x27;m an art teacher, with my hands constantly in clay, and this stuff helps protect my hands for hours during the school day while not having to wipe my hands off with a paper towel after putting this on like I do with most lotions.  I bought this at a grocery store once to give it a try, one of those impulse buys near the register, and have used in exclusively ever since.</li>
