            <li> always use this stuff works great</li>
            <li> So far I have tried Duo Lash glue and this lash glue and Duo just didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of the Ardell lash glue. It is the first lash glue I ever used, and it holds the lashes all night. I had a very interesting night this past week where I can&#x27;t remember most of the night, Hangover style, and when I woke up I had a massive migraine and couldn&#x27;t find my pants, BUT my eyelashes were still perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a while for this glue to become tacky, but the plus side of this is that the lashes STAY. There is nothing attractive about dancing or even just walking around and having one of your lashes slide off the side of your face. I have used this glue with E.L.F natural lashes, and thicker Ardell drama lashes / Sonia Kashuk lashes. I&#x27;m very impressed with the staying power on all of the different types of falsies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an extremely important event coming up this weekend, and I&#x27;m counting on Ardell to get me through it. Short story long, I will be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Works great! I never have to worry about my lashes coming off very happy with the product thank you very much</li>

            <li> My eyelashes didn&#x27;t stay... they fall right off. I usually use the eyelash glue that is black, so maybe it didn&#x27;t work because it&#x27;s different than my usual. Wasn&#x27;t worth it for me.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good .. But I have had better.</li>
            <li> It stays on long but takes forever to get tacky</li>
            <li> Really good glue my lashes last all day long now on since i stared using it.</li>
            <li> This is the first eyelash glue I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;m in love. It gets tacky fast and I don&#x27;t need a lot at all. I had a problem with my delivery but the seller is one of the nicest I&#x27;ve ever had on Amazon. Simply amazing and I will be recommending to everyone.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to say, I wear false lashes pretty much every single day. I also spend a lot of time riding a motorcycle with the lashes on... wind, teary eyes, sometimes dust.. and this glue has never let me down.. it keeps right on sticking and it still pretty easy to remove at the end of the day.. I have worn lashes with this glue for 10 plus hours with no problem.  It&#x27;s thicker then duo and much easier to use. I know a lot of people compare duo and this one, but to me personally there is NO comparison. . I hate the duo glue, my lashes kept coming lose, it takes ages to get tacky and if you wait a few seconds too long it won&#x27;t stick at all. .. I&#x27;m gonna stick with lash grip for sure. All time favorite,  of all the glues I have tried, through out the years.</li>
            <li> This really does come out as white but dries clear and holds a gooood long time! I love it, thank you!</li>
            <li> It holds your lashes on very good but the glue comes pouring out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I love this glue. It keeps my false eyelashes on all day! It does come out white but dries clear! Delivery wasn&#x27;t a hassle and didn&#x27;t take forever. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> its good but takes quite a while to dry. but its good enough for me! if you arent in a rush it works great</li>
            <li> great eyelash glue, super strong.</li>
            <li> Glue works amazing! I love it!!!! Been using for a month now and no problems what&#x27;s so ever!</li>
            <li> Not an Ardell product.  Irritated my eyes.</li>
