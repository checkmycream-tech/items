            <li>I love this product....</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I guess the product would be okay if you like those with a powdery finish.</li>
            <li>just okay</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, like woody and a hint of vanilla.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even able to use the product, because it had all leaked out.  </li>
            <li>Love..</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I bought this at a hair salon and fell in love and then couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Men may love this, but too overpowering for me.....</li>
            <li>and i have used many.</li>
            <li>Tigi is more affordable and works better with my hair.</li>
            <li>I would love a refund or for them to send another bottle.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly; a favorite product.</li>
            <li>I work out on my lunch break and this smells amazing and helps keep my hair fresh !</li>
            <li>its the best dry poo I have ever used :)</li>
            <li>The spray in shampoo smells wonderful and does not make your hair white which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>this product is one of the best dry shampoos i have used</li>
            <li>I use it after a workout and it completely kills any oil and makes my hair smell great.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the product is translucent</li>
            <li>Adds nice volume to my hair and keeps it fresh between washes.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>It builds up very quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a light, clean, powdery scent.</li>
            <li>(people will ask you what perfume you are wearing it smells so good) and works amazing as dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is important for colored hair.  </li>
            <li>is the very strong, very manly scent.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t leave the white residue like most dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I threw the full product away after 2 uses b/c</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of dry shampoos and this one by far smells the best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The best dry shampoo I have found to date is Suave Professional</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not going to find more effective dry shampoo or hair powder.</li>
            <li>Smells good all day long.</li>
            <li>Ok, nothing is going to clean your hair like a good old fashioned lather with shampoo and water, but if you don&#x27;t expect \\&quot;just shampooed\\&quot; results with a dry shampoo, I think this product is fabulous.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this really pumps it up and thickens it for easy style.</li>
            <li>The fragrance has been described as too manly or strong by some, but I absolutely love it and have received numerous complements on it.  </li>
            <li>I have used several brands of dry shampoo, in all price margins, and this is the very best.</li>
            <li>It adds lots of volume leaving your hair look freshly styled.</li>
            <li>its well worth the price</li>
            <li>it smells great,does not leave any stains or powdery residue and gives your hair just the right amount of body .</li>
            <li>Works great, and is better than any other dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>* Good spray stream, gets down to your roots</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s only $11 with free shipping on Prime, so it seems to be a great deal compared to other options.</li>
            <li>I also love it for adding texture to freshly washed hair when I am styling and need something to help curls last longer as well as volumizing.  </li>
            <li>For my daughter, she loves it, and I&#x27;m glad I could order it at the same time</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasted me about 4 months, but only because I was washing my hair more often when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and it works well especially if you put it in your hair before you go to bed the night before.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and prefer it over Batiste, Aveno, Big Sexy Hair, Suave, and Bumble and Bumble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>favorite things about this dry shampoo are:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this dry shampoo, it&#x27;s almost like a perfume for your hair.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for folks who don&#x27;t want/need to wash their hair everyday but just want to touch up oily roots.  </li>
            <li>Always wants to smell my hair.  </li>
            <li>It also adds a thickening effect for those whose hair can&#x27;t really keep curls or updos.  </li>
            <li>I spray it at the roots - not too much - rub it in with my finger tips, brush and blow it out.</li>
            <li>I ran out of this so fast because you have to use a lot to get it to work.</li>
            <li>Too much like cologne.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t do anything much to soak up oil</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice this absorbs much oil on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I probably have 5 other brands of dry shampoo sitting in my bathroom and this product by far is the best dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly when i want to add volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product .....</li>
            <li>Dry shampoo is my go-to as a busy professional (and getting more use now that I have an infant).</li>
            <li>I have tried several dry shampoos and this is one of the better one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve given a shot.</li>
            <li>and It smells very masculine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other dry shampoos (from cheaper to more expensive) and this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a little strong for me, though, and sometimes gives me a headache.</li>
            <li>There are other dry shampoos that absorb oil better but the smell keeps me buying this one over and over again.</li>
            <li>, I happen to like it, and I don&#x27;t find it masculine smelling or overpowering...</li>
            <li>My only complaint is it does leave a slight white residue that you have to make sure and work into your hair, but that is pretty normal with most dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have extremely long and dry hair-this product keeps me from having to wash more than 3 times a week and has helped keep my hair from sustaining damage from multiple blow-dries.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky like some of the new ones do, but also isn&#x27;t as effective in terms of \\&quot;fluffing\\&quot; the hair - and the biggest negative for me</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is towards the end of the can, the product comes out more powdery white to where I have to rub the product into the roots to blend it in.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone that likes to use dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING, and it gets the oil out without leaving hair dusty looking or dry feeling.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I do wish more companies would offer fragrance free products, because let&#x27;s face it, even if the product meets your needs, if you don&#x27;t like the fragrance, then you&#x27;ll hate it.</li>
            <li>The sent is slightly masculine and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>All other brands that I have tried have left very noticeable white residue.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s masculine at all, per other reviews, but it also isn&#x27;t overtly feminine, either.</li>
            <li> After trying every dry shampoo I could get my hands on for several years, I received a sample of this in a birchbox was immediately hooked.  </li>
            <li> * Bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s $3 a can and outperforms the $25 products by a long shot.</li>
            <li> I often noticed that the shampoo would fade and a few hours later, my hair would be back to flat and oily.  </li>
            <li> I have thin blonde hair that gets flat and oily really fast</li>
            <li> so no white spots like some other products leave.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is one of my favorites in the dry shampoo market.</li>
            <li> I switched from Paul Mitchell dry shampoo to Tigi.</li>
            <li> I just ran out but am a little concerned with how long this bottle will last because I do seem to use a lot when I use it, and I recently went red so will be washing a lot less.</li>
            <li> I used this 5+ ounce bottle sparingly a single time, and the bottle is now completely empty.</li>
            <li> I would like the bottle to last a little longer but</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used other dry shampoos except for one I bought at the grocery store, so I have no real comparison, but this always seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> After sitting on the shelf unused for about a week, the bottle was completely empty.  </li>
            <li> but after 4 times the bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> I received this product empty.  </li>
            <li> I just wish I had not received an empty bottle.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and wanted to find something to help inbetween washings, (every other day)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was a defective container, because I also tried to buy this product from my salon, and the same thing happened.  </li>
            <li> Works, not worth 20 bucks in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and hated the way they felt and smelled.  </li>
            <li> Every time I use it my hair feels lighter and less oily.</li>
            <li> is because I could see it on my black brush.</li>
            <li> After using it for 6 months, my skin produces less oil</li>
            <li> I have really thick long hair and can&#x27;t shampoo everyday.</li>
            <li> My usual brand is TIGI Rockstar Dirty Secret, but after too many struggles with leaky products, I gave up on it.  </li>
            <li> However, i have dark hair and it makes my hair color look dull.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, past my shoulders that is very thick.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> recommended by my stylist; love the way it makes my hair feel and smell in between washes!</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and wanted to find something to help inbetween washings, (every other day) this product doesnt spray evenly and does not absorb oil. I just wanted someting along my part line, but this product didnt work.</li>
            <li> For my daughter, she loves it, and I&#x27;m glad I could order it at the same time I ordered my TIGI Work It Hairspray!</li>
            <li> This is amazing! It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t leave the white residue like most dry shampoo. I have thin blonde hair that gets flat and oily really fast and this makes it look great and gives me the perfect amount of volume. I would 100% recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> TIGI Tranforming Shampoo is amazing. It&#x27;s great when you are not wanting to over wash your hair,or even if you are just in a hurry. The spray in shampoo smells wonderful and does not make your hair white which is a huge plus. Another wonderful thing about this spray is that it also gives added volume and can be used to help create a thicker hair style.</li>
            <li> Works great, and is better than any other dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.  There is a white residue that lingers for a while, but is easily brushed out.  I love the smell of this product, also.</li>
            <li> Adds nice volume to my hair and keeps it fresh between washes. The fragrance is one of my favorites in the dry shampoo market.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. the smell is incredible</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for folks who don&#x27;t want/need to wash their hair everyday but just want to touch up oily roots.  Plus the smell is amazing.  My boyfriend loves when I use this.  Always wants to smell my hair.  The product works well and does what it is supposed to.  It also adds a thickening effect for those whose hair can&#x27;t really keep curls or updos.  The only complaint I have is towards the end of the can, the product comes out more powdery white to where I have to rub the product into the roots to blend it in.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived with broken cap</li>
            <li> I love this product....I color so don&#x27;t like to wash my hair daily and this really pumps it up and thickens it for easy style.</li>
            <li> Ok, nothing is going to clean your hair like a good old fashioned lather with shampoo and water, but if you don&#x27;t expect \\&quot;just shampooed\\&quot; results with a dry shampoo, I think this product is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs oil and adds volume. I&#x27;ve used many other dry shampoos (from cheaper to more expensive) and this is my favorite so far. I use it between shampoos (I shampoo every third day) and I am pleased with the results. I spray it at the roots - not too much - rub it in with my finger tips, brush and blow it out. Wha-la - done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concering the scent, I happen to like it, and I don&#x27;t find it masculine smelling or overpowering... HOWEVER, I do wish more companies would offer fragrance free products, because let&#x27;s face it, even if the product meets your needs, if you don&#x27;t like the fragrance, then you&#x27;ll hate it.</li>
            <li> I guess the product would be okay if you like those with a powdery finish. My problem with this is it leaked in transit and sprayed all over the container. What was left of it to try was just okay, I prefer Oscar Blandi Pronto because it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and actually adds volume. Amazon reimbursed me since they did not allow return of the product by mail.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Smells lovely, like woody and a hint of vanilla. Adds volume and absorbs grease.</li>
            <li> I purchased this September 2012.  I wasn&#x27;t even able to use the product, because it had all leaked out.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was a defective container, because I also tried to buy this product from my salon, and the same thing happened.  After sitting on the shelf unused for about a week, the bottle was completely empty.  What a waste!</li>
            <li> I will request a refund for this product. I used this 5+ ounce bottle sparingly a single time, and the bottle is now completely empty.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints with this product. It was recommended at the salon and that is where I initially purchased it. It is a GREAT deal on Prime and seems to be the best value on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I use this my boyfriend says I smell great, and I agree. The scent is awesome. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s masculine at all, per other reviews, but it also isn&#x27;t overtly feminine, either. It&#x27;s more of a light, clean, powdery scent. Smell is a personal preference, though, and it is fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used other dry shampoos except for one I bought at the grocery store, so I have no real comparison, but this always seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to. Every time I use it my hair feels lighter and less oily. I even use it after I wash sometimes to give my hair some extra body and texture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasted me about 4 months, but only because I was washing my hair more often when I first purchased it. I just ran out but am a little concerned with how long this bottle will last because I do seem to use a lot when I use it, and I recently went red so will be washing a lot less. That is the only reason I will give this 4 stars. Still, it&#x27;s only $11 with free shipping on Prime, so it seems to be a great deal compared to other options.</li>
            <li> Love..Love..Love..this item. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again. I bought this at a hair salon and fell in love and then couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. And behold...Found it on Amazon!!! Amazing !!! This just arrived and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!! Love this stuff!! They should call it Hair Crack!!!</li>
            <li> I probably have 5 other brands of dry shampoo sitting in my bathroom and this product by far is the best dry shampoo I have ever used. I would highly recommend it to anyone that likes to use dry shampoo. All other brands that I have tried have left very noticeable white residue. TIGI leaves hardly any, they only way I could tell it left any at all is because I could see it on my black brush.</li>
            <li> Works, not worth 20 bucks in my opinion. and It smells very masculine I didnt expect a unisex product to smell like mens</li>
            <li> The Catwalk by TIGI Dry Shampoo is an incredible product, one of the best beauty finds of my life.  I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and hated the way they felt and smelled.  I often noticed that the shampoo would fade and a few hours later, my hair would be back to flat and oily.  I was one of those people that washed their hair EVERY day until I discovered this product.  After using it for 6 months, my skin produces less oil and I can go 3 days without washing my hair.  Reduced washing and styling reduced damage and I now have longer, fuller hair.  I highly recommend this product and prefer it over Batiste, Aveno, Big Sexy Hair, Suave, and Bumble and Bumble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite things about this dry shampoo are:&lt;br /&gt;* Actually absorbs oil, and lasts all day (even 2 days)&lt;br /&gt;* Adds volume&lt;br /&gt;* Smells good&lt;br /&gt;* Bottle lasts a long time (I used 3x/week for 4 months)&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t feel gritty&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t look or feel powdery&lt;br /&gt;* Nozzle works properly every time&lt;br /&gt;* Good spray stream, gets down to your roots</li>
            <li> I´m really disappointed with this TIGI product. I´m not sure if it was just a problem of filling the spray bottle but after 4 times the bottle was empty. Wouldn´t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of dry shampoos and this one by far smells the best.  The sent is slightly masculine and lasts for a long time. There are other dry shampoos that absorb oil better but the smell keeps me buying this one over and over again.</li>
            <li> After trying every dry shampoo I could get my hands on for several years, I received a sample of this in a birchbox was immediately hooked.  I have purchased this product at least 5 times, and with my amazon prime account, the price and shipping cannot be beat.  The fragrance has been described as too manly or strong by some, but I absolutely love it and have received numerous complements on it.  It blends perfectly into my light brown, highlighted hair.  I have extremely long and dry hair-this product keeps me from having to wash more than 3 times a week and has helped keep my hair from sustaining damage from multiple blow-dries.  I also love it for adding texture to freshly washed hair when I am styling and need something to help curls last longer as well as volumizing.  I cannot say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> I ran out of this so fast because you have to use a lot to get it to work. Leaves you looking like you have white hair if you don&#x27;t brush it out a lot. It does smell really good.</li>
            <li> Somehow this product just disapates if you don&#x27;t use it!!  I loved the smell but I can&#x27;t have a product simply disappear because I do not use it.  Never heard of such a thing happening.</li>
            <li> smells great (people will ask you what perfume you are wearing it smells so good) and works amazing as dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have long hair, past my shoulders that is very thick. I do not wash my hair everyday and this product does the trick!  I use it after a workout and it completely kills any oil and makes my hair smell great.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky like some of the new ones do, but also isn&#x27;t as effective in terms of \\&quot;fluffing\\&quot; the hair - and the biggest negative for me is the very strong, very manly scent.  Men may love this, but too overpowering for me.....especially at this price.</li>
            <li> My salon said they stopped selling this product as they don&#x27;t make it anymore. But this is great for blondes. I work out on my lunch break and this smells amazing and helps keep my hair fresh !</li>
            <li> It was ok, but not the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used. It builds up very quickly</li>
            <li> This does well to absorb oil in my hair so that I can go an extra day without washing.  This is important for colored hair.  The fragrance is a little strong for me, though, and sometimes gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this dry shampoo, it&#x27;s almost like a perfume for your hair.</li>
            <li> Always my fav, works great and no powder residue in your hair! I would like the bottle to last a little longer but its the best dry poo I have ever used :)</li>
            <li> Works good but I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it. Too much like cologne.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is its smell! Smells good all day long. However, i have dark hair and it makes my hair color look dull. It doesnt help with any greasyness though, which is what i was hoping for. I use it mainly when i want to add volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> This product smells great. It adds lots of volume leaving your hair look freshly styled. Most importantly, the product is translucent so no white spots like some other products leave.</li>
            <li> Dry shampoo is my go-to as a busy professional (and getting more use now that I have an infant). My usual brand is TIGI Rockstar Dirty Secret, but after too many struggles with leaky products, I gave up on it.  I&#x27;ve tried Oscar Blandini - didn&#x27;t do anything much to soak up oil/recondition my hair for another day and was really expensive.  TIGI replaced their last leaky bottle with a TIGI Session Series Catwalk product that smelled SO AWFUL that (1) even my husband commented on it both times I used it (2) I was distracted at work all day b/c I kept \\&quot;smelling something\\&quot; and finally (3) I threw the full product away after 2 uses b/c it was disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best dry shampoo I have found to date is Suave Professional - it&#x27;s $3 a can and outperforms the $25 products by a long shot.</li>
            <li> this product is one of the best dry shampoos i have used and i have used many. it smells great,does not leave any stains or powdery residue and gives your hair just the right amount of body . i highly recommend this product .....its well worth the price</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice this absorbs much oil on my scalp. My hair still felt oil. Baby powder seems to works just as well.</li>
            <li> I switched from Paul Mitchell dry shampoo to Tigi. Tigi is more affordable and works better with my hair. I have used it for around three months now and am very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I have used several brands of dry shampoo, in all price margins, and this is the very best. It smells AMAZING, and it gets the oil out without leaving hair dusty looking or dry feeling. It also adds a great amount of volume. A bottle of it lasts quite a while too, even with daily use. You&#x27;re not going to find more effective dry shampoo or hair powder.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Smells great! I have really thick long hair and can&#x27;t shampoo everyday. This is my go to product!</li>
            <li> A very strong chemical plus perfume smell. Made me nauseous after an hour and had to wash my hair to get the smell out</li>
            <li> I received this product empty.  When you shake it, it sounds like there is possibly ONE tablespoon of liquid inside.  It doesn&#x27;t spray, it only spits.  I would love a refund or for them to send another bottle.  This is a great product and smells amazing!!!!  I just wish I had not received an empty bottle.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly; a favorite product.</li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos and this is one of the better one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve given a shot. I love the smell, and it works well especially if you put it in your hair before you go to bed the night before. My only complaint is it does leave a slight white residue that you have to make sure and work into your hair, but that is pretty normal with most dry shampoos.</li>
