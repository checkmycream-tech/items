            <li> It is long lasting too!</li>
            <li> Also, doesn&#x27;t last as long..</li>
            <li> The lacquer does not spread properly and the nail get a not very well polished look.</li>
            <li> color goes with everything all season long.</li>
            <li> Watermelon goes with pink, orange or red, and compliments every skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy the Essie brand again in other colors.</li>
            <li> Again, you do have to use a base coat and a top coat to make it last.  </li>
            <li> Other polishes don&#x27;t do that to me.</li>
            <li> Essie never lets me down.</li>
            <li> little kids to grannies ...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s hard to say with nail polish.</li>
