            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>so glad i bought this product,</li>
            <li>nice clean smell too, not perfumey.</li>
            <li>But it does smell nice, that much is true.</li>
            <li>Thx to my special Santa!  </li>
            <li>Extremely moisturizing and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived quickly and I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and not oily.  </li>
            <li>Like the other reviews, smells great and don&#x27;t have to worry about oil getting into my carpet.  </li>
            <li>The lemon/lime scent is pleasant enough, but I&#x27;m sensitive to strong fragrances so will not buy again.</li>
            <li>I received as a Christmas present, and love it!  </li>
            <li>But this lotion is extremely light, and really is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Which has me worried to let this be absorbed through my skin</li>
            <li>not too oily as it soaks right  into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Lasts through hand washings, a little pricier than I thought for the size as the salon sells it for MUCH cheaper but all in all a great product</li>
            <li>I love it so much I use it as a complete body lotion.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery from seller.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered this lotion at the nail salon</li>
            <li>stand to use every night before bed and then realized I love the lotion so much that I needed to keep a smaller version in my car and another in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so sure I will continue to use this product for a long time!</li>
            <li>very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I do not care what they put in there, to me, results is what really count.</li>
            <li>this lotion is very emollient, without being too overly greasy.  </li>
            <li>lotion smells great, is thick enough, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling</li>
            <li>This lotion moisturizes them wonderfully and lasts at least past 1 wash.</li>
            <li>so I didnt really mind spending the extra on myself</li>
            <li>I frequent.  </li>
            <li>I went as far as to purchase a pump bottle to keep on my night</li>
            <li>Most non-greasy lotions feel really heavy on my skin, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>Just a little of the cream goes a long way and gives your skin a soft refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, especially for winter use.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very moisturizing. for the skin especially in the summer months. Very nice on arms and legs.  Even used it on my husbands arms,&lt;br /&gt;which were very dry and wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hands and they look great.  It works for me after using it for almost a year. I do not care what they put in there, to me, results is what really count. Price is even better.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful. I wash my hands a lot and always end up walking around with ashy hands...until now! This lotion moisturizes them wonderfully and lasts at least past 1 wash. This is great!</li>
            <li> I received as a Christmas present, and love it!  Like the other reviews, smells great and don&#x27;t have to worry about oil getting into my carpet.  Thx to my special Santa!  Will definitely buy when this runs out!</li>
            <li> quite satisfied with this product. not too oily as it soaks right  into the skin.  a very good value, this.</li>
            <li> This product is Made in China - not just the plastic tube but the actual lotion. Which has me worried to let this be absorbed through my skin - I wish they would already implement actual consumer protection and quality control rules over there so you don&#x27;t have to be concerned that something harmful might be in the mix. But it does smell nice, that much is true.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  NOT GREASY. BEST EVER GREAT SIZE FOR HANDBAG .hIGHLY RECCOMMEND FOR ANYONE WHO HAS SEVERE DRY SKIN.</li>
            <li> My nail salon gave this product out for Christmas and Mother&#x27;s Day to all their clients.  I love it.  Just a little of the cream goes a long way and gives your skin a soft refreshing feeling. This is a product I will try to always have in the house and at the office.</li>
            <li> Love this hand/feet lotion.  It&#x27;s the best there is available.  It soaks into your skin and leaves it feeling luxurious.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product... feels great on your skin!</li>
            <li> Great product, definetly the best product for dry, chapped or cracked skin.  Lasts through hand washings, a little pricier than I thought for the size as the salon sells it for MUCH cheaper but all in all a great product so I didnt really mind spending the extra on myself</li>
            <li> I first discovered this lotion at the nail salon I frequent.  I went as far as to purchase a pump bottle to keep on my night stand to use every night before bed and then realized I love the lotion so much that I needed to keep a smaller version in my car and another in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion smells great, is thick enough, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and I recommend this product to everyone!</li>

            <li> I received a sample of this oil from my nail salon at Christmas.  I love it so much I use it as a complete body lotion.  Extremely moisturizing and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> for those days u need alittle extra help with dry skin at the office or anywhere.we have tried several other products..but this one works the best forall day confort</li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully scented, emollient lotion that is a real treat to use!  It is so soothing for dry, chapped skin.  The re-hydrating effect is long-lasting, so you don&#x27;t have to keep re-applying it.  It has a luxurious feel to it.  So comforting.  I highly recommend it, especially for winter use.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product. Both wife and I use it in Florida. Lots of showers here and dry skin if you do not put on a cream to moisturize.</li>
            <li> this lotion is very emollient, without being too overly greasy.  has a great feel. nice clean smell too, not perfumey.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great product.  Goes on smooth and not oily.  Will definitely order again.  Very fast delivery from seller.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because my aunt got it from the salon and i absolutely loved the smell of it, and boy am I glad I did. This lotion is like heaven. It smells divineee!!! The scent is like a mix between fruity and citrusy, I love it!! Once you put the lotion on and rub it into your skin, it just disappears. It&#x27;s not greasy at all, and even if you wash your hands a few minutes later, the lotion won&#x27;t wash off. Most non-greasy lotions feel really heavy on my skin, especially in the summer. But this lotion is extremely light, and really is non-greasy. After just one application of the lotion my skin felt silky smooth, and I have a bad habit of not moisturizing enough! I am so so so glad i bought this product, and I&#x27;m so sure I will continue to use this product for a long time!</li>
