            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is fabulous.</li>
            <li>and I get free shipping.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and shiny after each use.</li>
            <li>Cons not sulphate free.  </li>
            <li>Great price on Amazon compared to local retailers</li>
            <li>I used cheap all in one shampoo and conditioner for years.  </li>
            <li>set is great for colored hair, especially red which seems to fade faster.</li>
            <li>made my hair so soft loved it</li>
            <li>But my first impressions are that it does smell pretty good, and it does help significantly with frizz.</li>
            <li>FAST, AWESOME AND PACKAGED VERY TIGHT AND NICE.</li>
            <li>I had read several great reviews for this product and was excited to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was having problems with build up in my hair and wanted to find a shampoo/condiitoner that smelled good, didn&#x27;t cause build up and made my hair feel clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to get my original hair look with this.</li>
            <li>Love this product and it was a very affordable price!</li>
            <li>I have long wavy/curly hair and its been working great.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure that&#x27;s what happened here.  </li>
            <li>, my hair has grown significantly, it is well moisturized, etc.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t in its original package.</li>
            <li>It is nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>Smells just like the original set I bought from the store.</li>
            <li>after one washing, my hair is softer, shinier,  more manageable and yes, more alive than it is has been in ages.....</li>
            <li>Love the large quantity.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s anything special.</li>
            <li>Also, there&#x27;s nothing special about the way it smells.</li>
            <li>I was a hardcore devotee of the original formula, it never failed to make my hair clean, smooth, shiny, frizz free, and full of body.</li>
            <li>The price was great and it arrived before the expected date.</li>
            <li>Product holds true to healthier hair..</li>
            <li>but now i don&#x27;t really have to :)</li>
            <li>Me and my Mom love this Shampoo and Conditioner because are hair gets straight</li>
            <li>I love this more than most other shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li>Ive been buying this brand for almost 6 years now and I am so glad i found this seller, the price for both was very cheap and they last me over a month!!</li>
            <li>So being more realistic depending on your hair texture might be a great way to start before continuing to read other comments.</li>
            <li>My hair felt super soft and I could tell a huge difference in how healthy it was.</li>
            <li>My hair is always super sleek and shiny after a wash, I don&#x27;t even need to style it with this product.</li>
            <li>It really makes your hair soft and smell  good.  </li>
            <li>My cosmetologist recently told me to use on my regular hair color- care shampoo and conditioner, so these were perfect.</li>
            <li>this is a super deal on the matrix sleep shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li>It is a lot cheaper on line, and gets here quick.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product as I generally love Matrix.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad and the price is just right.</li>
            <li>It has a very fresh clean scent and really makes my hair feel very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>There is a noticeable difference in the texture of my hair and with the first use!</li>
            <li>I ordered it from Amazon (the smaller bottles) and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>It also helps my moms dry hair feel more healthy.</li>
            <li>About six months ago, I decided to try a more environmentally-friendly shampoo and conditioner, which worked fine for several months.  </li>
            <li>I keep looking for a product that will keep my hair straight and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I have used them a couple times (used to the blue bottles) and I am sure they are doing a fantastic job smoothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The shampoo isn&#x27;t clear and watery as most are nowadays.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money</li>
            <li>And it leaves the texture more soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Best beauty product I&#x27;ve discovered in a long, long time.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this is a great start for making my hair looks healthy and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;The only other product that beats Sleek is Moroccan Oil line, but it makes blond hair look darker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one works best, especially if you have color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find any other shampoo/conditioner that is this good.  </li>
            <li>This ranks right up there with a bottle of 5 dollar Dove shampoo in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kicking myself for not returning it right away or within the 30 day return window.  </li>
            <li>I found the identical bottle here on amazon, but all of the reviews said something wasn&#x27;t right about it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really makes your hair feel like silk in just the first wash i really enjoy using it</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li>Even if I choose not to dry my hair with a blowdryer, it air dries in nice beachy/wavy way</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo for my brother and not only does he love it and says that it cleared up his dry scalp, but I also loved the fast delivery that went along with the product.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair soft and easy to untangle after i use it.</li>
            <li>After blow drying my hair, it&#x27;s smooth and very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and easy to manage, exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This is a true testament to the high quality of these</li>
            <li>is a great shampoo for hard water.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and I cannot believe it was on amazon for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li>so finally ordered some more</li>
            <li>so I was able to try out all the products and this was the only one I&#x27;ve consistently bought since.</li>
            <li>so this really helps!</li>
            <li>She said it leaves her hair really soft and smooth and has reduced the flyaways.</li>
            <li>Fast, affordable and reliable!</li>
            <li>This is my first time to use it after my hairdresser tried it on my hair.  </li>
            <li>WOW it made my hair feel incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>and I am always complimented on how sleek and straight my hair looks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a blaxican my hair is straighter on the top and curlier in the back.</li>
            <li>First of all, I got both of these for the price of one at my salon.</li>
            <li>consistent in performance.  </li>
            <li>Overall not too satisfied.</li>
            <li>AND I NEED SOME MORE AS MY STOCK IS GETTING LOW!</li>
            <li>It controls the friz only on the top of my hair and not the bottom.</li>
            <li>THIS is the exact shampoo that was in the orange bottles.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so smooth and soft .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real thing !</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really love the Sleek line of products, and will definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li>It might relax the curl a bit, but hair is very shiny!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>this is the first time buying this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel really clean or soft after use.</li>
            <li>Before I started really reading the labels on hair products, I really liked this product; however, the shampoo contains- Sodium Hydroxide (it&#x27;s caustic, and is found in chemical relaxers, which are used to permanently straighten the hair, and can even dissolve the hair), and protein (which can cause even more frizz if it&#x27;s used often).</li>
            <li>I have long hair 24&amp;#34; and this has helped make my hair healthy...</li>
            <li>This is my secret to beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li>Yes, my hair is not straight, neither does the shampoo do miracles; but it does make the hair more manegable to straighten your hair with a blowdryer and/or a flat iron :)</li>
            <li>my hair stays super silky soft after each use its wonderful&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very particular about my hair and what I use on it.</li>
            <li>Did not work for me, my hair damaged and frizzy, this just made my hair more dry</li>
            <li>I decided to splurge and spend some money on myself, but what you get for your money here is not dramatic or life-changing results.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;real&#x27; stuff she loves looks more like conditioner (more solid white than regular shampoo) but this stuff has a more clear-ish look and feels different.  </li>
            <li>and it was the same love the new look.</li>
            <li>The set is marvelous for my very long thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick dry hair and this product is the best one I&#x27;ve tried in all my 58 years.</li>
            <li>My fiance has been using this make &amp; model of shampoo for many years, and this particular shampoo from this particular seller is distinctly different.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using it and its made a difference in how easily the flat iron glides through my hair.</li>
            <li>First use it was good, after few washes I didn&#x27;t see any major difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>Fast shipment</li>
            <li>I got very speedy shipment and delivery.</li>
            <li>The stars really have nothing to do with the product since I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch and they just didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>it has been 3 months since I bought this, I use it every day, and it has lasted me this whole time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really was what I was looking through Amazon</li>
            <li>too much build up.</li>
            <li>the conditioner does&#x27;t really seem to work all that well</li>
            <li>Istantly, after using this product, my hair was trasnformed straight just from BLOW DRYING.</li>
            <li>my hair was sooo straight, it had so much body</li>
            <li>So much easier to manage.</li>
            <li>Helped my hair SO much.  </li>
            <li>I dye my hair all the time, and my hair was really damaged.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The shampoo feels gentle and cleanses well without leaving that stripped feeling.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely manner, came in the size it said it would (have had a switcheroo happen before) and is the real shampoo/conditioner (sometimes people switch and put in cheaper stuff).</li>
            <li>I really like that line of Matrix products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conditioner really detangles my hair.&lt;br /&gt;3-5 minutes</li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner really conditions your hair.</li>
            <li>I could never use a whole bottle of shampoo without having to switch to something else</li>
            <li>This is not the real stuff..</li>
            <li>Save your money and get the real stuff from a salon.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; products were as described.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditoner, I usually pay around 15 bucks for a small bottle of each, and I got these for a great deal.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>the Sleek products really made a difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much smoother my hair is after using these products.  </li>
            <li>I am very please with this products and price as well</li>
            <li>I do not think this is there real thing.</li>
            <li>That may not be the case for everyones hair but for me this set doesn&#x27;t add much luster to my hair like I wanted.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser knew for sure when she recommended this particular shampoo and conditioner for my thick but fine, fly-away hair.  </li>
            <li>Then one day, I noticed my hair was becoming dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li>This is better than other shampoo and conditioners they are using.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Way more affordable than other comparable shampoos.</li>
            <li>, they tangled my hair more than what any other shampoo/ conditioner.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean scalp too well</li>
            <li>I bought these because I liked Matrix&#x27;s Total Results Sleek formula for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick and frizzy hair and this shampoo and conditioner leave my hair very soft and managable, smells great too.</li>
            <li>I live in a humid climate and this makes my hair much softer and more manageable than other shampoos.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair more straight and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>, it leaves your hair feeling super soft; it also completely untangles effortlessly.   </li>
            <li>My hair is so smooth now and also I do recommend this shampoo for anyone that has long hair.</li>
            <li>I like the shampoo as it smells good, soft on my hair and not much residual left over.  </li>
            <li>After the first use of the shampoo and conditioner, my hair was straighter, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li>The new one is still better than most &amp;#34;sleek&amp;#34; shampoos out there, but I was a little disappointed given how amazing the original formula was.</li>
            <li>This one does the trick - love that it is sold in a duo on Amazon and that it is less than I can buy it for here in town.</li>
            <li>(he has longer hair than mine), and I&#x27;ve noticed much less frizz from humidity and more softness and shine in his hair.</li>
            <li>I have use several different Matrix products, this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m on my second set of the liter sets and am a loyal customer to this stuff now.  </li>
            <li>bucks more and same big bottle size and almost all 5 star ratings:&lt;br /&gt;Way</li>
            <li>The Matrix sleek conditioner was very old and smelled rancid!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li>I give this a high recommendation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend product and seller to anyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To conclude, both shampoo and conditioner are of high quality and high effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because of the high review rating.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing in bulk.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but so far it is leagues ahead of many other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My hair was naturally silky and straight before I damaged it with straightener.</li>
            <li>But I normally purchase from my salon.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can’t think of anything negative to type about them.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>With my last shampoo/conditioner, I could go as long as 3 nights/4 days between washes, and I bet I won&#x27;t be able to do that using this product.</li>
            <li>Great for thick dry hair.</li>
            <li>when my hair looks this good and no longer dry, frizzy and dead.....</li>
            <li>need to use very less of shampoo and conditioner as it has good lather, so this will stay for long ,.</li>
            <li>They will last you and the price is right for the amount of shampoo and conditioner you will receive.</li>
            <li>I had to go buy a new bottle from a salon</li>
            <li>and I live in Vegas where it&#x27;s always dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After one shampoo and conditioning treatment, my hair was very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and was having trouble finding the large bottles in my local salon</li>
            <li>It was more straight after washing, and looked like I had (half a$$ed) flat iron it just after blow drying.</li>
            <li>Purchased for myself because they are huge and will last forever (for me at least) and were the cheapest available online.</li>
            <li>I feel an instant sleekness to my hair just after the first wash.</li>
            <li>After I used these for a month, my hair is not as moisturized as how it used to be when using the old sleek formula, and my scalp is itchy!  </li>
            <li>My daughter has naturally curly hair and loves this stuff!</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are exactly the same as the salon</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>; the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest.  :(</li>
            <li>There is a lot for a cheap price though which is why I didn&#x27;t give it less stars.</li>
            <li>Used with the conditioner, it makes my hair very soft and naturally shiny</li>
            <li>tried many different products over the years but one time my previous hairstylist recommended Sleek.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair, after using, is soft, less frizzy, and just better looking overall.</li>
            <li>This product really helps my hair stay straight with minimal frizzies.</li>
            <li>My hair is blonde, straight, and of a medium thickness, and I have highlights applied to the sides and crown every two months.  </li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is manageable, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It is so old, that it still has the old fashioned screw cap.</li>
            <li>Make my hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>Keeps my husband and daughters naturally curly hair manageable</li>
            <li>The conditioner, especially, smells very luxurious.</li>
            <li>She used the whole thing but said it had a different texture than when she bought in the store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and truly like it so far.</li>
            <li>naturally curly hair&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it and Amazon is the only place I can find it.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair so silky and so soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair really soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rule in completely on moisture, because only time will tell, but the conditioner feels nice and thick and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t feel harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid area and need help with frizz control for my long hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo and conditioner to detangle my long black hair.</li>
            <li>Every stylist who has touched my hair comments that even the ends are incredibly healthy, especially considering how rough I am on it (highlights, too long between trims, styling, etc).</li>
            <li>Overall a decent duo for the price.</li>
            <li>My motehr used to perm my hair when I was younger and as I got older I started dying it and using the straightener on it without any heat protection.</li>
            <li>before buying it, I had high expectations since I have very coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Same Shampoo and Conditioner as sold in high end salons.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good idea to alternate between shampoos bi-weekly, as the conditioning shampoo can get a little heavy on the hair from time to time.</li>
            <li>I spent part of the weekend getting rid of a lot of the stuff that did not do much of anything!</li>
            <li>but after my hair is styled its a bit flat and has lots of static :-/</li>
            <li>I did see a difference in making my hair more silk but based on certain comments, the silkiness was exaggerated.</li>
            <li>Great for thick hair that is hard to manage.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair with crazy loose curls and this has got to be the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This product is the new Matrix Total Results Sleek Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I’ve used a fairly broad variety of shampoos and conditioners in my life</li>
            <li>I come from a uniquely diverse set of genes, so my hair is naturally wavy (and I mean that literally; not really &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34;, but frizzy and far from straight.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but the prices here are hard to beat and certainly make it more affordable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li>(i generally don&#x27;t use a lot but</li>
            <li>Used to come in orange bottles, but is the same product as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist told me to get Matrix Total Results Sleek and get the leave-in cream and blow dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li>you have normal to thin hair, buy abba Pure Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner instead, its worth every dime of the extra money you pay and they come in big 33 ounce bottles too.</li>
            <li>I have had better results with a few other brands in the same price range but wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li>one complaint is it doesn&#x27;t feel like it rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I am an african american woman with all natural hair (never had a perm,color, chemicals, etc)</li>
            <li>so everyone KNOWS how natural african american hair looks and operates!</li>
            <li>Apparently it has different ingredients.</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;ve exposed my hair to an egregious level of heat, for far too long</li>
            <li>I ordered the Sleek shampoo and conditioner by mistake (I meant to order Total Repair), but I had no regrets once I used them.</li>
            <li>After the first few weeks of using it, it made my hair feel smoother.</li>
            <li>I had ti use a mask and a moisturizing shampoo for a few days first, bit</li>
            <li>I live in very dry country and needed something like this.</li>
            <li>This does keep the frizzies down on my very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair so much easier to manage &amp; cuts down on the frizz</li>
            <li>Leaves my normally dry, frizzy hair feeling soft and silky after every wash.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put gel or anything in my hair during the week because I don&#x27;t care too much what I look like at work, but this was enough to bother me and replace it since I didn&#x27;t like that weighed down look after blow drying.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other shampoos and conditioners to smooth hair (more expensive as well as less expensive) and always continue to come back to Matrix.</li>
            <li>i was afraid that it was not going to be the authentic product, but it is!</li>

            <li> It makes my hair feel really nice.</li>
            <li> Kind of how it looks when you are in humid weather and your hair clumps together instead of each hair separating.</li>

            <li> Even though I use better products on my hair, I was still needing to use a detangler after showering so I could comb through it, and even then it was still a bit of an effort.</li>

            <li> I love matrix sleek and smooth</li>
            <li> I purchased the big bottles to save money and it was an incredible deal.  </li>
            <li> Anyone with curls in their hair will love it to smooth them out easier.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than in store and lasts forever good sale</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i can more easily use a cheap suave than this</li>
            <li> I have tried some other salon products but this one is one of the best.  </li>
            <li> The price is great for this product and I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> love the smell, as it is clean but not to strong scented.</li>
            <li> They work great on my hair and keeps my hair soft and smooth every day.</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair, so it helps keep it strong, but even when I am not straightening, it tames my hair.   </li>
            <li> Good for normal hair  </li>
            <li> What’s more, you get 33 full oz.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and this set seems to make my hair look fuller and shiner</li>
            <li> and I can skip days without shampooing and be fine.  </li>
            <li> About two years ago I started to become more aware of the healthy of my hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super smooth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price for such huge bottles and it lasts quite awhile.</li>
            <li> With this product, my hair comes out smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Great product for frizzy hair especially when humid.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and tangle free after each use.</li>
            <li> I’ve noticed that my hair remains well moisturized  and feels smooth to the touch for two or three days after I wash and condition.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is fabulous.</li>
            <li> and I get free shipping.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and shiny after each use.</li>
            <li> Cons not sulphate free.  </li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon compared to local retailers</li>
            <li> I used cheap all in one shampoo and conditioner for years.  </li>
            <li> set is great for colored hair, especially red which seems to fade faster.</li>
            <li> made my hair so soft loved it</li>
            <li> But my first impressions are that it does smell pretty good, and it does help significantly with frizz.</li>
            <li> FAST, AWESOME AND PACKAGED VERY TIGHT AND NICE.</li>
            <li> I had read several great reviews for this product and was excited to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was having problems with build up in my hair and wanted to find a shampoo/condiitoner that smelled good, didn&#x27;t cause build up and made my hair feel clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to get my original hair look with this.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it was a very affordable price!</li>
            <li> I have long wavy/curly hair and its been working great.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure that&#x27;s what happened here.  </li>
            <li> , my hair has grown significantly, it is well moisturized, etc.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t in its original package.</li>
            <li> It is nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> Smells just like the original set I bought from the store.</li>
            <li> after one washing, my hair is softer, shinier,  more manageable and yes, more alive than it is has been in ages.....</li>
            <li> Love the large quantity.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s anything special.</li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s nothing special about the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I was a hardcore devotee of the original formula, it never failed to make my hair clean, smooth, shiny, frizz free, and full of body.</li>
            <li> The price was great and it arrived before the expected date.</li>
            <li> Product holds true to healthier hair..</li>
            <li> but now i don&#x27;t really have to :)</li>
            <li> Me and my Mom love this Shampoo and Conditioner because are hair gets straight</li>
            <li> I love this more than most other shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Ive been buying this brand for almost 6 years now and I am so glad i found this seller, the price for both was very cheap and they last me over a month!!</li>
            <li> So being more realistic depending on your hair texture might be a great way to start before continuing to read other comments.</li>
            <li> My hair felt super soft and I could tell a huge difference in how healthy it was.</li>
            <li> My hair is always super sleek and shiny after a wash, I don&#x27;t even need to style it with this product.</li>
            <li> It really makes your hair soft and smell  good.  </li>
            <li> My cosmetologist recently told me to use on my regular hair color- care shampoo and conditioner, so these were perfect.</li>
            <li> this is a super deal on the matrix sleep shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li> It is a lot cheaper on line, and gets here quick.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product as I generally love Matrix.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad and the price is just right.</li>
            <li> It has a very fresh clean scent and really makes my hair feel very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable difference in the texture of my hair and with the first use!</li>
            <li> I ordered it from Amazon (the smaller bottles) and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> It also helps my moms dry hair feel more healthy.</li>
            <li> About six months ago, I decided to try a more environmentally-friendly shampoo and conditioner, which worked fine for several months.  </li>
            <li> I keep looking for a product that will keep my hair straight and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I have used them a couple times (used to the blue bottles) and I am sure they are doing a fantastic job smoothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The shampoo isn&#x27;t clear and watery as most are nowadays.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money</li>
            <li> And it leaves the texture more soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Best beauty product I&#x27;ve discovered in a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this is a great start for making my hair looks healthy and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;The only other product that beats Sleek is Moroccan Oil line, but it makes blond hair look darker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one works best, especially if you have color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find any other shampoo/conditioner that is this good.  </li>
            <li> This ranks right up there with a bottle of 5 dollar Dove shampoo in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kicking myself for not returning it right away or within the 30 day return window.  </li>
            <li> I found the identical bottle here on amazon, but all of the reviews said something wasn&#x27;t right about it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really makes your hair feel like silk in just the first wash i really enjoy using it</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> Even if I choose not to dry my hair with a blowdryer, it air dries in nice beachy/wavy way</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my brother and not only does he love it and says that it cleared up his dry scalp, but I also loved the fast delivery that went along with the product.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft and easy to untangle after i use it.</li>
            <li> After blow drying my hair, it&#x27;s smooth and very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and easy to manage, exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is a true testament to the high quality of these</li>
            <li> is a great shampoo for hard water.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I cannot believe it was on amazon for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li> so finally ordered some more</li>
            <li> so I was able to try out all the products and this was the only one I&#x27;ve consistently bought since.</li>
            <li> so this really helps!</li>
            <li> She said it leaves her hair really soft and smooth and has reduced the flyaways.</li>
            <li> Fast, affordable and reliable!</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use it after my hairdresser tried it on my hair.  </li>
            <li> WOW it made my hair feel incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> and I am always complimented on how sleek and straight my hair looks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a blaxican my hair is straighter on the top and curlier in the back.</li>
            <li> First of all, I got both of these for the price of one at my salon.</li>
            <li> consistent in performance.  </li>
            <li> Overall not too satisfied.</li>
            <li> AND I NEED SOME MORE AS MY STOCK IS GETTING LOW!</li>
            <li> It controls the friz only on the top of my hair and not the bottom.</li>
            <li> THIS is the exact shampoo that was in the orange bottles.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so smooth and soft .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real thing !</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really love the Sleek line of products, and will definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> It might relax the curl a bit, but hair is very shiny!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> this is the first time buying this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel really clean or soft after use.</li>
            <li> Before I started really reading the labels on hair products, I really liked this product; however, the shampoo contains- Sodium Hydroxide (it&#x27;s caustic, and is found in chemical relaxers, which are used to permanently straighten the hair, and can even dissolve the hair), and protein (which can cause even more frizz if it&#x27;s used often).</li>
            <li> I have long hair 24&amp;#34; and this has helped make my hair healthy...</li>
            <li> This is my secret to beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes, my hair is not straight, neither does the shampoo do miracles; but it does make the hair more manegable to straighten your hair with a blowdryer and/or a flat iron :)</li>
            <li> my hair stays super silky soft after each use its wonderful&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very particular about my hair and what I use on it.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, my hair damaged and frizzy, this just made my hair more dry</li>
            <li> I decided to splurge and spend some money on myself, but what you get for your money here is not dramatic or life-changing results.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;real&#x27; stuff she loves looks more like conditioner (more solid white than regular shampoo) but this stuff has a more clear-ish look and feels different.  </li>
            <li> and it was the same love the new look.</li>
            <li> The set is marvelous for my very long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick dry hair and this product is the best one I&#x27;ve tried in all my 58 years.</li>
            <li> My fiance has been using this make &amp; model of shampoo for many years, and this particular shampoo from this particular seller is distinctly different.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it and its made a difference in how easily the flat iron glides through my hair.</li>
            <li> First use it was good, after few washes I didn&#x27;t see any major difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> Fast shipment</li>
            <li> I got very speedy shipment and delivery.</li>
            <li> The stars really have nothing to do with the product since I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch and they just didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> it has been 3 months since I bought this, I use it every day, and it has lasted me this whole time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It really was what I was looking through Amazon</li>
            <li> too much build up.</li>
            <li> the conditioner does&#x27;t really seem to work all that well</li>
            <li> Istantly, after using this product, my hair was trasnformed straight just from BLOW DRYING.</li>
            <li> my hair was sooo straight, it had so much body</li>
            <li> So much easier to manage.</li>
            <li> Helped my hair SO much.  </li>
            <li> I dye my hair all the time, and my hair was really damaged.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The shampoo feels gentle and cleanses well without leaving that stripped feeling.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely manner, came in the size it said it would (have had a switcheroo happen before) and is the real shampoo/conditioner (sometimes people switch and put in cheaper stuff).</li>
            <li> I really like that line of Matrix products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conditioner really detangles my hair.&lt;br /&gt;3-5 minutes</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner really conditions your hair.</li>
            <li> I could never use a whole bottle of shampoo without having to switch to something else</li>
            <li> This is not the real stuff..</li>
            <li> Save your money and get the real stuff from a salon.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; products were as described.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditoner, I usually pay around 15 bucks for a small bottle of each, and I got these for a great deal.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> the Sleek products really made a difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much smoother my hair is after using these products.  </li>
            <li> I am very please with this products and price as well</li>
            <li> I do not think this is there real thing.</li>
            <li> That may not be the case for everyones hair but for me this set doesn&#x27;t add much luster to my hair like I wanted.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser knew for sure when she recommended this particular shampoo and conditioner for my thick but fine, fly-away hair.  </li>
            <li> Then one day, I noticed my hair was becoming dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> This is better than other shampoo and conditioners they are using.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Way more affordable than other comparable shampoos.</li>
            <li> , they tangled my hair more than what any other shampoo/ conditioner.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean scalp too well</li>
            <li> I bought these because I liked Matrix&#x27;s Total Results Sleek formula for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and frizzy hair and this shampoo and conditioner leave my hair very soft and managable, smells great too.</li>
            <li> I live in a humid climate and this makes my hair much softer and more manageable than other shampoos.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair more straight and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> , it leaves your hair feeling super soft; it also completely untangles effortlessly.   </li>
            <li> My hair is so smooth now and also I do recommend this shampoo for anyone that has long hair.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo as it smells good, soft on my hair and not much residual left over.  </li>
            <li> After the first use of the shampoo and conditioner, my hair was straighter, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li> The new one is still better than most &amp;#34;sleek&amp;#34; shampoos out there, but I was a little disappointed given how amazing the original formula was.</li>
            <li> This one does the trick - love that it is sold in a duo on Amazon and that it is less than I can buy it for here in town.</li>
            <li> (he has longer hair than mine), and I&#x27;ve noticed much less frizz from humidity and more softness and shine in his hair.</li>
            <li> I have use several different Matrix products, this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m on my second set of the liter sets and am a loyal customer to this stuff now.  </li>
            <li> bucks more and same big bottle size and almost all 5 star ratings:&lt;br /&gt;Way</li>
            <li> The Matrix sleek conditioner was very old and smelled rancid!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li> I give this a high recommendation.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend product and seller to anyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To conclude, both shampoo and conditioner are of high quality and high effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the high review rating.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing in bulk.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but so far it is leagues ahead of many other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My hair was naturally silky and straight before I damaged it with straightener.</li>
            <li> But I normally purchase from my salon.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can’t think of anything negative to type about them.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> With my last shampoo/conditioner, I could go as long as 3 nights/4 days between washes, and I bet I won&#x27;t be able to do that using this product.</li>
            <li> Great for thick dry hair.</li>
            <li> when my hair looks this good and no longer dry, frizzy and dead.....</li>
            <li> need to use very less of shampoo and conditioner as it has good lather, so this will stay for long ,.</li>
            <li> They will last you and the price is right for the amount of shampoo and conditioner you will receive.</li>
            <li> I had to go buy a new bottle from a salon</li>
            <li> and I live in Vegas where it&#x27;s always dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After one shampoo and conditioning treatment, my hair was very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and was having trouble finding the large bottles in my local salon</li>
            <li> It was more straight after washing, and looked like I had (half a$$ed) flat iron it just after blow drying.</li>
            <li> Purchased for myself because they are huge and will last forever (for me at least) and were the cheapest available online.</li>
            <li> I feel an instant sleekness to my hair just after the first wash.</li>
            <li> After I used these for a month, my hair is not as moisturized as how it used to be when using the old sleek formula, and my scalp is itchy!  </li>
            <li> My daughter has naturally curly hair and loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are exactly the same as the salon</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> ; the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest.  :(</li>
            <li> There is a lot for a cheap price though which is why I didn&#x27;t give it less stars.</li>
            <li> Used with the conditioner, it makes my hair very soft and naturally shiny</li>
            <li> tried many different products over the years but one time my previous hairstylist recommended Sleek.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair, after using, is soft, less frizzy, and just better looking overall.</li>
            <li> This product really helps my hair stay straight with minimal frizzies.</li>
            <li> My hair is blonde, straight, and of a medium thickness, and I have highlights applied to the sides and crown every two months.  </li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is manageable, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It is so old, that it still has the old fashioned screw cap.</li>
            <li> Make my hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> Keeps my husband and daughters naturally curly hair manageable</li>
            <li> The conditioner, especially, smells very luxurious.</li>
            <li> She used the whole thing but said it had a different texture than when she bought in the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and truly like it so far.</li>
            <li> naturally curly hair&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it and Amazon is the only place I can find it.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair so silky and so soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair really soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rule in completely on moisture, because only time will tell, but the conditioner feels nice and thick and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t feel harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid area and need help with frizz control for my long hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner to detangle my long black hair.</li>
            <li> Every stylist who has touched my hair comments that even the ends are incredibly healthy, especially considering how rough I am on it (highlights, too long between trims, styling, etc).</li>
            <li> Overall a decent duo for the price.</li>
            <li> My motehr used to perm my hair when I was younger and as I got older I started dying it and using the straightener on it without any heat protection.</li>
            <li> before buying it, I had high expectations since I have very coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Same Shampoo and Conditioner as sold in high end salons.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good idea to alternate between shampoos bi-weekly, as the conditioning shampoo can get a little heavy on the hair from time to time.</li>
            <li> I spent part of the weekend getting rid of a lot of the stuff that did not do much of anything!</li>
            <li> but after my hair is styled its a bit flat and has lots of static :-/</li>
            <li> I did see a difference in making my hair more silk but based on certain comments, the silkiness was exaggerated.</li>
            <li> Great for thick hair that is hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair with crazy loose curls and this has got to be the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This product is the new Matrix Total Results Sleek Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve used a fairly broad variety of shampoos and conditioners in my life</li>
            <li> I come from a uniquely diverse set of genes, so my hair is naturally wavy (and I mean that literally; not really &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34;, but frizzy and far from straight.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but the prices here are hard to beat and certainly make it more affordable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li> (i generally don&#x27;t use a lot but</li>
            <li> Used to come in orange bottles, but is the same product as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist told me to get Matrix Total Results Sleek and get the leave-in cream and blow dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li> you have normal to thin hair, buy abba Pure Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner instead, its worth every dime of the extra money you pay and they come in big 33 ounce bottles too.</li>
            <li> I have had better results with a few other brands in the same price range but wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li> one complaint is it doesn&#x27;t feel like it rinses clean.</li>
            <li> I am an african american woman with all natural hair (never had a perm,color, chemicals, etc)</li>
            <li> so everyone KNOWS how natural african american hair looks and operates!</li>
            <li> Apparently it has different ingredients.</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;ve exposed my hair to an egregious level of heat, for far too long</li>
            <li> I ordered the Sleek shampoo and conditioner by mistake (I meant to order Total Repair), but I had no regrets once I used them.</li>
            <li> After the first few weeks of using it, it made my hair feel smoother.</li>
            <li> I had ti use a mask and a moisturizing shampoo for a few days first, bit</li>
            <li> I live in very dry country and needed something like this.</li>
            <li> This does keep the frizzies down on my very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair so much easier to manage &amp; cuts down on the frizz</li>
            <li> Leaves my normally dry, frizzy hair feeling soft and silky after every wash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put gel or anything in my hair during the week because I don&#x27;t care too much what I look like at work, but this was enough to bother me and replace it since I didn&#x27;t like that weighed down look after blow drying.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other shampoos and conditioners to smooth hair (more expensive as well as less expensive) and always continue to come back to Matrix.</li>
            <li> i was afraid that it was not going to be the authentic product, but it is!</li>
            <li> I’m not aware of any place selling professional quality items like this for such a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, dry, prone to frizziness, slightly curly  hair, and this works like magic.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy/wavy hair &amp; have been searching for products to tame it for over 10 years now.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the product was old, because other conditions just like this did not have grains or lumps.  </li>
            <li> It also make flat ironing easier and last longer.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it leaves your hair really flat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 35 year old male though and have short hair, and still have this humidified weighed down look to my hair after blow drying it.</li>
            <li> If you have normal or thin hair, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll like it too much.</li>
            <li> It was becoming difficult to find these in the store, especially on sale anymore!</li>
            <li> It is not the real thing or is YEARS past its expiration.</li>
            <li> I had problems with shampoo build up in my hair and had to wash it daily for as long as I can remember but have been using this for a year</li>
            <li> After using a flat iron, my hair looks shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde (lightened) hair that takes a lot of abuse from heat tools, and</li>
            <li> I will be using these same bottles for a LONG time!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is long and color treated and before using Sleek</li>
            <li> have long, bleached hair</li>
            <li> I use this on myself relaxed hair and my girls hair who is relaxed and natural, It doesnt leave a heavy build up and leaves it moisturized.</li>
            <li> Been using this shampoo for a long time.</li>
            <li> 33 ounces goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy and I am very picky when it comes to hair products.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; hair, and was looking for a shampoo/conditioner combo for the right price that would give my hair enough moisture and help tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty course, so I didn&#x27;t see the same dramatic straightening than others did.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I try other shampoo&#x27;s &amp;#34;just &#x27;cause&amp;#34; and I always end up going back to Matrix-Sleek.  </li>
            <li> My hair was still dry and not sleek.</li>
            <li> Before this shampoo my hair was so frizzy and dry</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry or brittle after a color or bleach, this is too drying.</li>
            <li> After I get out the shower, I can let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> BUT I HAVE DRY HAIR</li>
            <li> My hair tends to get dry after blow drying but not with this product!</li>
            <li> I have had the shampoo for a while now and finally made it through half  the bottle.</li>
            <li> Within the past few months, though, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair feels very greasy after it dries.</li>
            <li> Lit leaves your scalp very dry</li>
            <li> It has done wonders to my hair which usually is very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hair</li>
            <li> It left my hair weighed down like it left a heavy coating on my hair.</li>
            <li> However, it left my hair looking limp.</li>
            <li> and I can brush my hair under the shower with a wide comb.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I felt like it was so damaged that not much could be done to it.</li>
            <li> Its shampoo and conditioner, not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Once I applied a little heat to it (curlers, flat iron, etc)</li>
            <li> The only complaint I could possibly make about these products is that my hair is now so soft that it&#x27;s hard to keep a clip in it, but a little hairspray and back-combing takes care of that.</li>
            <li> and i only wash my hair 2 to 3 times a week and my hair is really dry and rough.the shampoos really hard to rinse out</li>
            <li> I shampoo every other day, and I never have a problem with dryness.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it any other way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d try other shampoo by Matrix as well - just to compare.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> but I compared it to other bottles I still had</li>
            <li> Initially my hair was getting a little greasy and had to wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling very heavy and flat...almost greasy.</li>
            <li> plus a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, and this is the only conditioner I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> These two bottles, the shampoo and conditioner cost less than what I usually pay for a smaller bottle at my salon anyways.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been getting a little harder to find</li>
            <li> I also do not recommend this product for someone with thinner hair, has an oilier than average scalp, or who prefers to have lots of volume in their style.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I had thick hair or curly hair it would have had a different result.</li>
            <li> It is the only product that tames my thick frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for a year, and hands down</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair</li>
            <li> I can get by with other shampoos, but this is my go to conditioner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found it cheaper from any other source!</li>
            <li> My hair started falling after starting on this shampoo-conditioner regimen and I am stuck with this huge bottle (my bad!)</li>
            <li> I decided not to buy anymore of this one, may be its not for thin, flat, dry hair.</li>
            <li> It also smells slightly stronger than the one at the store.</li>
            <li> Hair is less frizzy</li>
            <li> Also, with other shampoos and conditioners I can get away with only washing it every other day, but my hair just feels way too greasy and dirty by the second day when I use this.</li>
            <li> I would suggest anyone with long, color treated, or dull hair give this system a try.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the conditioner I received must have been old or replaced with some other product.  </li>
            <li> My daughter uses this and she has really long thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> He conditioner is a little runny in my opinion and it takes a generous amount to condition my slightly longer than shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was dull and dry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have not tried the new line, so I can not tell you what I think of it.</li>
            <li> I have thick and somewhat dry hair.</li>
            <li> it drys it as it smooths it because it prevents moisture from coming in to closed hair shaft but oily because its hard to wash out even with a claifying shampoo N alternating.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is just way to heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> After a few months, the conditioner smelled rancid.  </li>
            <li> My hair also tends to feel very heavy and weighted down after using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a hair product that can tame my unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I think this will help me tame my frizzy Latina hair quite well.</li>
            <li> and I like how her hair looks(hers is very thick and long) after blow drying.</li>
            <li> My hair is over 3 feet long and very thick.  </li>
            <li> I bought this combo after reading the reviews and after my friend recommended it for my heat damaged dry, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure that the lumps are.  </li>
            <li> Lazy man here.</li>
            <li> My hair did not feel the way it usually feel when I buy this at the store.</li>
            <li> No better product.</li>
            <li> This one that I had ordered had a bad smell to it, and did not make my hair feel or look the way that it normally does.</li>
            <li> I hardly notice a scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually saw this at Wal-Mart&#x27;s hair cutting salon on sale for $25</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> It was really thick and smelled like glue.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Amazon beat all other competitors for the price!!!!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not going to knock this product due to my issues of getting the wrong one</li>
            <li> but I bought the Total Results Matrix line and my hair is dry, opaque, this product was terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible conditioner it smells funny and has clumps in it</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt cleaner or smoother (and I have very thick, frizzy hair).</li>
            <li> and my hair is alot worse</li>
            <li> I am not happy.</li>
            <li> The one package was damaged, the cap of the bottle of the shampoo was broken and the shampoo was dropped out</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for years on my thin hair</li>
            <li> One bottle was broken and it leaked all over</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> and i have very thick curly hair!</li>
            <li> Along with the Matrix styling products, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Feel powerless to do anything about it.</li>
            <li> this smells awful, nothing like the last bottle I bought.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s expensive buying reg.</li>
            <li> not really impressed with this product, quit using it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife online because it is too expensive in the store.</li>
            <li> I just wish pureology wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> In my defense, I trusted this product blindly because of the Matrix tag.</li>
            <li> half-empty.. disappointment</li>
            <li> I have medium-thick hair, so I would hate to see what this would do for someone with thin hair.</li>
            <li> They were rancid when I got them. :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find they smelled a bit funky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over all, a very disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t like it either.</li>
            <li> Either this product is expired and is bad, or it has been replaced by something awful.  </li>
            <li> If they had disclosed, I would not have bought it because my hair and scalp responds badly to color-treated formula!  </li>
            <li> Very bad quality.</li>
            <li> ran out and switched over to Aussie and was so disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and feel like I have been ripped off.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time, but I was very disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible product!</li>
            <li> horrible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst out there either.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Either this product is expired and is bad, or it has been replaced by something awful.  This is the only product I use on my hair and have for years.  But I normally purchase from my salon.  This one that I had ordered had a bad smell to it, and did not make my hair feel or look the way that it normally does.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this and I cannot believe it was on amazon for such a cheap price! My hair is always super sleek and shiny after a wash, I don&#x27;t even need to style it with this product.</li>
            <li> I live in a humid climate and this makes my hair much softer and more manageable than other shampoos. It also helps my moms dry hair feel more healthy. The price is great for this product and I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I have thick, wavy hair and it seems that no matter what shampoo/conditioner I use, my hair gets tangled, especially in the back, after I shower and wash my hair. Even though I use better products on my hair, I was still needing to use a detangler after showering so I could comb through it, and even then it was still a bit of an effort. With this product, my hair comes out smooth and tangle free. After blow drying my hair, it&#x27;s smooth and very soft. I love it and will continue to use it! And bonus...it smells great!</li>
            <li> Its the best product i have ever used. It transforms my hair texture! Totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing. Doesn&#x27;t smell good at all and I don&#x27;t notice it doing anything different to my hair than what pantene does! Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I have tried many other shampoos and conditioners to smooth hair (more expensive as well as less expensive) and always continue to come back to Matrix. It smells great and does just what it says..smooths hair. My hair is thick and wavy and I am very picky when it comes to hair products. However, this one has always exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> MATRIX makes great shampoo and conditioner. I have tried some other salon products but this one is one of the best.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Great price wife loves it</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> Very good price.  Doesn&#x27;t include pumps</li>
            <li> Tried this a couple of years ago after years of abusing hair and I liked it...I should have stayed with it instead of trying things closer to home.....ended up spending a lot more than this costs so finally ordered some more and I have to say....I will Not use anything else....after one washing, my hair is softer, shinier,  more manageable and yes, more alive than it is has been in ages.....well the last time I used it.....I spent part of the weekend getting rid of a lot of the stuff that did not do much of anything! I have learned my lesson....when my hair looks this good and no longer dry, frizzy and dead.....I get it!! Thank you Matrix!</li>
            <li> I bought this combo after reading the reviews and after my friend recommended it for my heat damaged dry, thin hair. My hair was naturally silky and straight before I damaged it with straightener. I wanted to get my original hair look with this. First use it was good, after few washes I didn&#x27;t see any major difference. My hair was still dry and not sleek. My friend still swears by it and I like how her hair looks(hers is very thick and long) after blow drying. I decided not to buy anymore of this one, may be its not for thin, flat, dry hair. Herstyler shampoo conditioner combo from amazon worked for my hair so I totally switched to it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot and it makes your hair feel great.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one works best, especially if you have color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Came half-empty.. disappointment</li>
            <li> This is my secret to beautiful hair.  In college I worked at a salon supply store so I was able to try out all the products and this was the only one I&#x27;ve consistently bought since. My hair is long and color treated and before using Sleek I had a lot of problems with frizziness. Now, just as the bottle says, it is sleek and shiny. Every stylist who has touched my hair comments that even the ends are incredibly healthy, especially considering how rough I am on it (highlights, too long between trims, styling, etc). I&#x27;d reccomend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Very bad quality. It&#x27;s some generic shampoo. Spoiled my hair. No longer receiving any compliments.</li>
            <li> My hair feels great after use.</li>
            <li> Before I started really reading the labels on hair products, I really liked this product; however, the shampoo contains- Sodium Hydroxide (it&#x27;s caustic, and is found in chemical relaxers, which are used to permanently straighten the hair, and can even dissolve the hair), and protein (which can cause even more frizz if it&#x27;s used often).</li>
            <li> I have purchased this type of shampoo and conditioner several times before getting it from Amazon but unless you can get salon prices, this is the cheapest you will find the 33.8oz set of Matrix Sleek Look. It is my favorite stuff to use, it smells so good and makes my hair feel smooth and look shiny. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great product, economic size, perfect duo set. Good for normal hair  Smell nice also.  Fast shipment.  Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks but so far it is leagues ahead of many other products I&#x27;ve used. I have thick and somewhat dry hair. But with this product it&#x27;s no problem at all. I wash a max of 3 times a week so this really helps!</li>
            <li> My hair is blonde, straight, and of a medium thickness, and I have highlights applied to the sides and crown every two months.  I used this shampoo and conditioner for years, having been introduced to it by my stylist.  About six months ago, I decided to try a more environmentally-friendly shampoo and conditioner, which worked fine for several months.  Then one day, I noticed my hair was becoming dry and brittle.  I wondered if it could be the shampoo, so I went back to Matrix Sleek Look.  The moisture returned to my hair immediately.  I love this shampoo and conditioner.  It always works for me.  (I subtracted one star for lack of environmental friendliness.)</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipment</li>
            <li> I used to use Tresemme that&#x27;s four dollars for the same size bottle. I decided to splurge and spend some money on myself, but what you get for your money here is not dramatic or life-changing results. I&#x27;ll stick to the Tresemme in the future.</li>
            <li> My hair is over 3 feet long and very thick.  I have been searching for YEARS for a good conditioner that would make brushing my hair post-wash easier.  The Sleek Look by Matrix system is amazing.  I have no tangles in my hair after washing and my hair looks and feels great.  I would suggest anyone with long, color treated, or dull hair give this system a try.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product makes my hair feel, but the next day, it has a tendency to be too heavy and makes my hair stick straight out in the back..</li>
            <li> My color treated hair feels better after using this for a week.</li>
            <li> I love Matrix and have used it many times. I saw this was a good deal so I jumped on it. I have had the shampoo for a while now and finally made it through half  the bottle. Now I have no clue what I am washing my hair with. The smell and consistency has changed. I feel like I am washing my hair with bubble bath. I am very disappointed and feel like I have been ripped off. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!!! BUYERS BEWARE! Cleary I did not get what I paid for since they were selling a Matrix product. It has been mixed with something else.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used. I shampoo every other day, and I never have a problem with dryness. Used with the conditioner, it makes my hair very soft and naturally shiny (although I use semi-permanent color.) Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but the prices here are hard to beat and certainly make it more affordable. I got very speedy shipment and delivery.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo - salon quality - so much cheaper than salon prices!</li>
            <li> Great buy.  Great product for frizzy hair especially when humid. Love the large quantity. 1 2 3 4 5 6</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair so soft and manageable. It smells great AND it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, purchased locally.  However, the conditioner has grainy lumps in it, so I don&#x27;t continue to use it.  I don&#x27;t like how it feels and won&#x27;t put it in my hair.  Not sure that the lumps are.  I like the shampoo.  Perhaps the product was old, because other conditions just like this did not have grains or lumps.  I shook the contents, but that did not make the lumps disappear.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo/conditioner on the market. I have thick dry hair and this product is the best one I&#x27;ve tried in all my 58 years.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it was a very affordable price!</li>
            <li> Awesome products. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try. It is just way to heavy for my hair. By the end of the day my hair looked greasy and unwashed. It does smell great and there are no tangle issues.</li>
            <li> Super amazing product! Leaves my hair so smooth!!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my hairstylist.  Controls the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot; from my curly hair.  The price from Amazon is 1/3 what it costs in the stores.</li>
            <li> i used this product for a month and i only wash my hair 2 to 3 times a week and my hair is really dry and rough.the shampoos really hard to rinse out and my hair is alot worse off.just cause u buy it in a salon doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> Packaged so it would not leak.  It&#x27;s a good product for wavy hair been using it for years.  Price was OK</li>
            <li> Product arrived timely and in excellent condition.    I love, love, love Matric Sleek Look Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner.  It&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used and I will definitely be ordering this again.  Along with the Matrix styling products, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  My hair is manageable, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I feel an instant sleekness to my hair just after the first wash. It definitely gives my hair shine. I&#x27;m sticking with this product for some time.</li>
            <li> Been swearing by this shampoo and conditioner duo for years. You can&#x27;t beat this price!</li>
            <li> Ive been buying this brand for almost 6 years now and I am so glad i found this seller, the price for both was very cheap and they last me over a month!! I love matrix sleek and smooth and i have very thick curly hair!</li>
            <li> Great product ... I love Matrix products, you can count on them to do what they claim!&lt;br /&gt;The duo adds great moisture to my hair and helps eliminate frizz.  If you are looking for&lt;br /&gt;a product you can count on then Matrix is just what you want !!</li>
            <li> Got this for my dUghter-in-law that has curly hair. She loved it.</li>
            <li> good  as always... and great price..</li>
            <li> Most, if not all of these reviews are for Matrix Sleek Look, which has been discontinued. This product is the new Matrix Total Results Sleek Shampoo and Conditioner. Apparently it has different ingredients. Unfortunately I have not tried the new line, so I can not tell you what I think of it. I am only here to let you know that the reviews on this page are for a different product. Matrix Sleek Look WAS great, indeed. The stars really have nothing to do with the product since I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and adores it. She said it leaves her hair really soft and smooth and has reduced the flyaways. It&#x27;s a great price for such huge bottles and it lasts quite awhile. She said she recommends it to others looking for a good shampoo and conditioner for fine hair.</li>
            <li> They were rancid when I got them. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a hair product that can tame my unruly hair. I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch and they just didn&#x27;t do the job. I&#x27;ve read some reviews on this and I thought I&#x27;ll give it a try. Glad I did. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and and leaves my hair looking much tamer then before. The smell is not bad and the price is just right.</li>
            <li> My fiance has been using this make &amp; model of shampoo for many years, and this particular shampoo from this particular seller is distinctly different.  It looks and feels like something else- like generic shampoo.  The &#x27;real&#x27; stuff she loves looks more like conditioner (more solid white than regular shampoo) but this stuff has a more clear-ish look and feels different.  The smell is similar though.  She believes that it is simply not the same thing - possibly even an imposter posing as Matrix.  Either that or Matrix decided to change their formula.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner to detangle my long black hair.</li>
            <li> If you have problems with frizzy hair, buy these!  They will last you and the price is right for the amount of shampoo and conditioner you will receive.</li>
            <li> Fast, affordable and reliable!</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo as it smells good, soft on my hair and not much residual left over.  I use conditioner once in a while.  This is my first time to use it after my hairdresser tried it on my hair.  Just been using this for the last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner for years and always loved it.  Within the past few months, though, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair feels very greasy after it dries. Also, with other shampoos and conditioners I can get away with only washing it every other day, but my hair just feels way too greasy and dirty by the second day when I use this. My hair also tends to feel very heavy and weighted down after using this.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time, but I was very disappointed in the quality. The Matrix sleek conditioner was very old and smelled rancid! It is so old, that it still has the old fashioned screw cap. They haven&#x27;t used screw caps in years. I am not happy. I had to go buy a new bottle from a salon at double what I paid for this product.</li>
            <li> The one package was damaged, the cap of the bottle of the shampoo was broken and the shampoo was dropped out</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and will continue to do so.  My hair is smooth and tangle free after each use.</li>
            <li> A great price for a great combo!  My hairdresser knew for sure when she recommended this particular shampoo and conditioner for my thick but fine, fly-away hair.  And adding the &amp;#34;Matrix Total Results Sleek Silk Wonder Smoothing Oil&amp;#34; (which I also ordered through Amazon) completes the task of taming my lion&#x27;s mane.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I straighten my hair, so it helps keep it strong, but even when I am not straightening, it tames my hair.   Because it&#x27;s not a cleaner, I ocassionally have to switch out, but it works so well for me I always come back.</li>
            <li> Saves me a trip to the salon.  Great for thick hair that is hard to manage.  I can get by with other shampoos, but this is my go to conditioner!</li>
            <li> Started using this combo as suggested by my stylist. It has transformed the texture of my hair and it has actually started clearing up the acne I have on my upper back and shoulders. HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li> Great smelling shampoo and moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner.  Been using them for years.  Make my hair soft, shiny and manageable. Amazon gives a great price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this combo for years and receive many compliments on my hair.....tames the hair and keeps it shiny.....also good price on amazon and delivered to your door....another plus.</li>
            <li> BIG FAN of Matrix products. Tried the Biolage for Moisture, nice product. Amazon was out and I bought this line. WOW it made my hair feel incredibly smooth. The weightless frizz control is impressive. Hair is super clean, and has a continuous wonderful smell. Amazon beat all other competitors for the price!!!!  Luv me Amazon and Matrix!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps my husband and daughters naturally curly hair manageable</li>
            <li> I give this a high recommendation. This shampoo hydrates the hair so well, just out of the shower, that I could run my fingers through my hair without any tangles to deal with. I live in very dry country and needed something like this. Before this shampoo my hair was so frizzy and dry now it isn&#x27;t. My hair is so smooth now and also I do recommend this shampoo for anyone that has long hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I liked Matrix&#x27;s Total Results Sleek formula for a long time.  After I used these for a month, my hair is not as moisturized as how it used to be when using the old sleek formula, and my scalp is itchy!  Why does the back side of the bottles talk about color-treated hair on product info.??  The seller didn&#x27;t give any disclosure that this formula is for color-treated hair.  If they had disclosed, I would not have bought it because my hair and scalp responds badly to color-treated formula!  Over all, a very disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> Terrible product! My hair was more frizzy and the smell of the product is nauseating.</li>
            <li> Lit leaves your scalp very dry</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for years on my thin hair and I am always complimented on how sleek and straight my hair looks! Even if I choose not to dry my hair with a blowdryer, it air dries in nice beachy/wavy way so it&#x27;s a win win!</li>
            <li> my hair stays super silky soft after each use its wonderful&lt;br /&gt;i have been using this product for many years</li>
            <li> I would buy it, it works great. After the first few weeks of using it, it made my hair feel smoother.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product as I generally love Matrix. However, it left my hair looking limp. I have medium-thick hair, so I would hate to see what this would do for someone with thin hair.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved this deal! Great product with a good price. We will probably look for this deal again in the future.</li>
            <li> Please email me. One bottle was broken and it leaked all over</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my brother and not only does he love it and says that it cleared up his dry scalp, but I also loved the fast delivery that went along with the product.</li>
            <li> it has been 3 months since I bought this, I use it every day, and it has lasted me this whole time.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, as it is clean but not to strong scented.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does wonders for my hair! I have used it since 2008, as recommended by my hairdresser to repair damage. Excellent deal, and fast shipping as well! Highly recommend product and seller to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the way the shampoo and conditioner smells. It has a very fresh clean scent and really makes my hair feel very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great price and delivery...love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> It really makes your hair soft and smell  good.  I tried  at a friends house  without her knowing  .I definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Great product !! I have been using it since August 2013 and Love it... Great prices by this seller and quick shipment.... Product holds true to healthier hair.. I have long hair 24&amp;#34; and this has helped make my hair healthy... Gotta love the price to Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years now and my hair feels good and not tangly at all . my friend had recommended this product to me and I totally love it now .you need to use very less of shampoo and conditioner as it has good lather, so this will stay for long ,.</li>
            <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner set came just as described...I&#x27;ve never found it cheaper from any other source! Thanks for the great service!!</li>
            <li> It has done wonders to my hair which usually is very dry.  Love both the shampoo and conditioner and for the price is even better.</li>
            <li> What I appreciate most about these two items is their effectiveness after you’ve used them. I’ve noticed that my hair remains well moisturized  and feels smooth to the touch for two or three days after I wash and condition. This is a true testament to the high quality of these products.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used a fairly broad variety of shampoos and conditioners in my life and I think this might be the best combination I’ve come across. I honestly can’t think of anything negative to type about them.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to their superior performance, I also really like their pleasant scent. The conditioner, especially, smells very luxurious. What’s more, you get 33 full oz. of both Shampoo and Conditioner with this package. That’s a very good value. I’m not aware of any place selling professional quality items like this for such a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, both shampoo and conditioner are of high quality and high effectiveness. They feel good, smell good and are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the high review rating. I live in a very humid area and need help with frizz control for my long hair. This shampoo and conditioner are just alright. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s anything special. I have had better results with a few other brands in the same price range but wanted to try something different. This ranks right up there with a bottle of 5 dollar Dove shampoo in my opinion.</li>
            <li> the best product you can buy for your hair. The best deal you can find for both and no matter how long you use it, your hair will always react well to it.</li>
            <li> After the first use of the shampoo and conditioner, my hair was straighter, shiny, and soft. My hair seemed more healthy after continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a blaxican my hair is straighter on the top and curlier in the back. This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair more straight and less frizzy. It also make flat ironing easier and last longer.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; hair, and was looking for a shampoo/conditioner combo for the right price that would give my hair enough moisture and help tame the frizz. I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple days now, and will update if I remember. But my first impressions are that it does smell pretty good, and it does help significantly with frizz. I can&#x27;t rule in completely on moisture, because only time will tell, but the conditioner feels nice and thick and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t feel harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is it doesn&#x27;t feel like it rinses clean. With my last shampoo/conditioner, I could go as long as 3 nights/4 days between washes, and I bet I won&#x27;t be able to do that using this product. I also do not recommend this product for someone with thinner hair, has an oilier than average scalp, or who prefers to have lots of volume in their style.</li>
            <li> I still have not received this item, I know I will love it when I get it but where is it? Feel powerless to do anything about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered several times. Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> This article is best recommended. It really was what I was looking through Amazon I found what I wanted.</li>
            <li> this smells awful, nothing like the last bottle I bought.</li>
            <li> I have LOVED this shampoo for years and it&#x27;s expensive buying reg. sized bottles when i get my hair done, but this is a great deal!!!! the product itself is amazing!!! if you have never tried it DO IT! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feels after using it... When its drier weather, it makes my hair feel more silky and I don&#x27;t need to use any products (i generally don&#x27;t use a lot but anti-frizz I have to). I have long wavy/curly hair and its been working great. Initially my hair was getting a little greasy and had to wash my hair everyday but now i don&#x27;t really have to :)</li>
            <li> My Kids love it. This is better than other shampoo and conditioners they are using.&lt;br /&gt;The price is better too.</li>
            <li> I had read several great reviews for this product and was excited to find it on Amazon.  Unfortunately, the conditioner I received must have been old or replaced with some other product.  It was really thick and smelled like glue.  I spoke to a hair dresser who told me that shampoo and conditioner have a 2 year shelf life.  Sometimes people will sell expired product on Amazon or Ebay.  Pretty sure that&#x27;s what happened here.  I&#x27;m kicking myself for not returning it right away or within the 30 day return window.  I feel like I got ripped off and I would NEVER recommend people purchase products from this seller again.  I know I won&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> This shampoo really makes your hair feel like silk in just the first wash i really enjoy using it i am happy with the way my hair feel</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry or brittle after a color or bleach, this is too drying. I had ti use a mask and a moisturizing shampoo for a few days first, bit it&#x27;s great for color retention.  Only lather once, do not repeat.</li>
            <li> I had oily strands and dandruff.  silicone destroys you hair.  it drys it as it smooths it because it prevents moisture from coming in to closed hair shaft but oily because its hard to wash out even with a claifying shampoo N alternating.  too much build up. horrible&lt;br /&gt;i can more easily use a cheap suave than this</li>
            <li> My cosmetologist recently told me to use on my regular hair color- care shampoo and conditioner, so these were perfect. I have used them a couple times (used to the blue bottles) and I am sure they are doing a fantastic job smoothing and moisturizing. My hair feels good.</li>
            <li> Love quality and price</li>
            <li> I have use several different Matrix products, this is not my favorite. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel really clean or soft after use. It&#x27;s not the worst out there either.</li>
            <li> nice smell but not that great.  not really impressed with this product, quit using it. the conditioner does&#x27;t really seem to work all that well</li>
            <li> I keep looking for a product that will keep my hair straight and frizz free. This is OK but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife online because it is too expensive in the store. She used the whole thing but said it had a different texture than when she bought in the store.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works great and lathers up really well. He conditioner is a little runny in my opinion and it takes a generous amount to condition my slightly longer than shoulder length hair. Overall a decent duo for the price. I just wish pureology wasn&#x27;t so expensive so I didn&#x27;t have to look for alternatives!</li>
            <li> I am an african american woman with all natural hair (never had a perm,color, chemicals, etc) so everyone KNOWS how natural african american hair looks and operates! Istantly, after using this product, my hair was trasnformed straight just from BLOW DRYING. With 6 months (good things come to those who wait!) my hair was totally different. It was more straight after washing, and looked like I had (half a$$ed) flat iron it just after blow drying. Once I applied a little heat to it (curlers, flat iron, etc) my hair was sooo straight, it had so much body, my hair has grown significantly, it is well moisturized, etc. This is the only product I will use for the rest of my life. I have never been so pleased! &lt;3</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite shampoo and conditioner. It smells good, but not from chemical perfume. I&#x27;ve been buying it at Amazon for ages, because it is a great price here. I often use it on my Maltese who has hair to the floor, and it is excellent for her too.</li>
            <li> First of all, I got both of these for the price of one at my salon. My hair has never felt cleaner or smoother (and I have very thick, frizzy hair).</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It makes my hair feel really nice. It gets rid of tangles. It doesn&#x27;t have too strong of a smell but the smell it has is nice.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. I love this shampoo and conditioner my hair feels amazing. So much easier to manage. My hair looks great. I also love the way they smell. Definitely going to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever used so far. I will definitely buy this product again! I shared it already with family members and they are fascinated.</li>
            <li> Helped my hair SO much.  I dye my hair all the time, and my hair was really damaged.  This has helped my hair feel so much better.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and truly like it so far. The shampoo isn&#x27;t clear and watery as most are nowadays. It is thick and moisturizing. I think this will help me tame my frizzy Latina hair quite well.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair color seemed like if I just dyed it. I also like that shine it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be shampoo and conditioner but I got 2 shampoos. Not happy.</li>
            <li> I do not like this shampoo/conditioner set at all. Left my hair feeling very heavy and flat...almost greasy.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo in a smaller quantity from a salon.  I purchased the big bottles to save money and it was an incredible deal.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it any other way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t and never will use anything else.  Great for naturally curly hair&lt;br /&gt;and consistent in performance.  Can use daily and it always makes my hair&lt;br /&gt;look great!  Hoping the product is never changed!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and GREAT price:):)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using matrix for years now.  I can&#x27;t seem to find any other shampoo/conditioner that is this good.  My whole family uses it and Amazon is the only place I can find it.  I have fine hair, and this set seems to make my hair look fuller and shiner</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used the Matrix Total shampoo/conditioner duo for years. We think they&#x27;re wonderful for the way they make our hair feel. It&#x27;s been getting a little harder to find so thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!    The shampoo feels gentle and cleanses well without leaving that stripped feeling. The conditioner!!! omg it&#x27;s amazing, it leaves your hair feeling super soft; it also completely untangles effortlessly.   It smells so good.  After I get out the shower, I can let my hair air dry and it&#x27;s super smooth! Blowing drying has been easier as well. I have long hair with crazy loose curls and this has got to be the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It was kind of ok for my hair but my hairfall increased a lot.</li>
            <li> This product works great GREAT GREAT!</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this and she has really long thick wavy hair. It makes it smooth and shines!! Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Was received very quickly and my daughter loves this product! She states her hair is bouncy and shiny and sleek! Just what she&#x27;s been looking for! Will purchase again, and again, and again....</li>
            <li> Perfect transaction!  Only shampoo I will use!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t in its original package.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is fabulous. It smells amazing and leaves your hair feeling so silky smooth all day.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and wonderful customer service</li>
            <li> I order this shampoo and conditioner online because its WAYYYY cheaper than if I were to purchase it at a salon, and I am VERY pleased by it. It arrived in a timely manner, came in the size it said it would (have had a switcheroo happen before) and is the real shampoo/conditioner (sometimes people switch and put in cheaper stuff). Very happy.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money</li>
            <li> I really like that line of Matrix products.&lt;br /&gt;I have long, bleached hair and I live in Vegas where it&#x27;s always dry.&lt;br /&gt;I tried many different products over the years but one time my previous hairstylist recommended Sleek.&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner really detangles my hair.&lt;br /&gt;3-5 minutes and I can brush my hair under the shower with a wide comb.&lt;br /&gt;I still put leave-in oil or conditioner but this is a great start for making my hair looks healthy and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;The only other product that beats Sleek is Moroccan Oil line, but it makes blond hair look darker.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo for my hair,&lt;br /&gt;and smells fine!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d try other shampoo by Matrix as well - just to compare.&lt;br /&gt;And, the price is a good deal! I&#x27;d recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  Very good price for the money. I would consider telling my friends and family about this.</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable difference in the texture of my hair and with the first use! My hair is pretty course, so I didn&#x27;t see the same dramatic straightening than others did. But it keeps the frizz at bay!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner really conditions your hair. I&#x27;ve gone through more than 30 bottles. The only downside is that it leaves your hair really flat.</li>
            <li> this is the shampoo and conditioner used by my hair dresser.  I absolutely love how it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ive ever used. My hair tends to get dry after blow drying but not with this product! The price on this site compared to the price in a salon is unbeatable. You will save atleast 15.00 buying on here!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. They work great on my hair and keeps my hair soft and smooth every day.</li>
            <li> this was a really good deal. i was afraid that it was not going to be the authentic product, but it is!</li>
            <li> Great products and turnaround time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for a year, and hands down it is my favorite.  Keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo i ever used&lt;br /&gt;Smellls amazing</li>
            <li> I love this more than most other shampoo and conditioners. I fried my hair once from chemicals and nothing keeps the moisture in except this works pretty good. i buy it a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it and its made a difference in how easily the flat iron glides through my hair. And it leaves the texture more soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it...</li>
            <li> It is the only shampoo that decreases frizz for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome, fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. Leaves my normally dry, frizzy hair feeling soft and silky after every wash. Way more affordable than other comparable shampoos.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I had problems with shampoo build up in my hair and had to wash it daily for as long as I can remember but have been using this for a year and I can skip days without shampooing and be fine.  Love the smell.  I could never use a whole bottle of shampoo without having to switch to something else bc I would get shampoo  build up but I&#x27;m on my second set of the liter sets and am a loyal customer to this stuff now.  :)</li>
            <li> I use this on myself relaxed hair and my girls hair who is relaxed and natural, It doesnt leave a heavy build up and leaves it moisturized. It also good at detangling. I love matrix products.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used for dry color treated hair.  I will continue to keep buying.</li>
            <li> I love how this product leaves my hair.  Yes, my hair is not straight, neither does the shampoo do miracles; but it does make the hair more manegable to straighten your hair with a blowdryer and/or a flat iron :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and super fast shipping, will purchase again</li>
            <li> Been using this line of Matrix for years now and I love it. Can&#x27;t beat the price either! Side note, it&#x27;s a good idea to alternate between shampoos bi-weekly, as the conditioning shampoo can get a little heavy on the hair from time to time.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and excellent product at good price.</li>
            <li> Best beauty product I&#x27;ve discovered in a long, long time. I come from a uniquely diverse set of genes, so my hair is naturally wavy (and I mean that literally; not really &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34;, but frizzy and far from straight. That said, I&#x27;ve exposed my hair to an egregious level of heat, for far too long (also went through a brief stage of wanting my hair color to be anything but what I was actually born w). Worth the purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly advice purchasing a universal pump for a liter size bottle of shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for years and tgis oroduct always makes my hair look and feel amazing!  I use the smallest amount of both in my shower each time.  I will be using these same bottles for a LONG time!!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! My motehr used to perm my hair when I was younger and as I got older I started dying it and using the straightener on it without any heat protection. About two years ago I started to become more aware of the healthy of my hair but I felt like it was so damaged that not much could be done to it. My hair stylist told me to get Matrix Total Results Sleek and get the leave-in cream and blow dry my hair straight. I ordered it from Amazon (the smaller bottles) and fell in love with it! My hair felt super soft and I could tell a huge difference in how healthy it was. My hair stylist was so pleased with it when I went back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out and switched over to Aussie and was so disappointed! Before I ordered more online I actually saw this at Wal-Mart&#x27;s hair cutting salon on sale for $25 so of course got it. I won&#x27;t ever use a different product again!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a better product. There is a lot for a cheap price though which is why I didn&#x27;t give it less stars. If you have normal or thin hair, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll like it too much. It left my hair weighed down like it left a heavy coating on my hair. Kind of how it looks when you are in humid weather and your hair clumps together instead of each hair separating. Maybe if I had thick hair or curly hair it would have had a different result. I&#x27;m a 35 year old male though and have short hair, and still have this humidified weighed down look to my hair after blow drying it. Its not horrible, but noticeable. I don&#x27;t put gel or anything in my hair during the week because I don&#x27;t care too much what I look like at work, but this was enough to bother me and replace it since I didn&#x27;t like that weighed down look after blow drying. I&#x27;m not throwing it out, but I am def reserving it to pawn off on guests that shower @ my place. Also, there&#x27;s nothing special about the way it smells. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it doesn&#x27;t smell great. I hardly notice a scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal to thin hair, buy abba Pure Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner instead, its worth every dime of the extra money you pay and they come in big 33 ounce bottles too. Check my review on that. Your hair will come out feeling like silk after a shampoo and conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;15 bucks more and same big bottle size and almost all 5 star ratings:&lt;br /&gt;Way Better Shampoo&#x3D; http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014F812E&lt;br /&gt;Way Better Conditioner&#x3D; http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Conditioner-TruMint-select-option/dp/B000WHU772/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_bt_1</li>
            <li> This is not the real stuff.. or it&#x27;s expired. Makes my hair stringy and oily looking.  I would not purchase again. Save your money and get the real stuff from a salon.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I thought these shampoos were going to smell amazing&lt;br /&gt;But I was disappointed to find they smelled a bit funky.&lt;br /&gt;They also did not work well , they tangled my hair more than what any other shampoo/ conditioner. Overall not too satisfied.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; products were as described.</li>
            <li> FAST, AWESOME AND PACKAGED VERY TIGHT AND NICE. I LOVE THIS DUO! IT SMELLS AWESOME AND I GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME THAT I SMELL GOOD AND WHEN I TURN MY HEAD I CAN SMELL THE CLEANESS AS WELL.  JUST OVER ALL GREAT SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER. MY DAUGHTER HAS OILY HAIR SO THIS DOESNT WORK WELL FOR HER BUT I HAVE DRY HAIR AND IT&#x27;S FANTASTIC!  I BEEN WAITING TO CATCH A GOOD PRICE ON IT AGAIN AS IT SEEMS THE PRICE HAS WENT UP AND I NEED SOME MORE AS MY STOCK IS GETTING LOW!</li>
            <li> Its shampoo and conditioner, not much else to say. It isn&#x27;t anything special, though Its not the cheep kind you get at the dollar store it isn&#x27;t anything to die for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not something I plan on buying in the future. It makes my hair look greasy the day after I used it. It controls the friz only on the top of my hair and not the bottom. It makes my hair shiny and silky, but only on the day I used it on. I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t like it either.</li>
            <li> I was a hardcore devotee of the original formula, it never failed to make my hair clean, smooth, shiny, frizz free, and full of body. The new one is still better than most &amp;#34;sleek&amp;#34; shampoos out there, but I was a little disappointed given how amazing the original formula was.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and cheaper than you can buy it in a salon!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditoner, I usually pay around 15 bucks for a small bottle of each, and I got these for a great deal.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product! It is not the real thing or is YEARS past its expiration. I have been using this product for 10+years. It is nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner for a great price!</li>
            <li> My daughter has naturally curly hair and loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Lazy man here. Purchased for myself because they are huge and will last forever (for me at least) and were the cheapest available online. But after using them, I now realize why my fiancé refuses to use grocery store brand shampoo. This stuff is the bees knees. My hair looks phenomenal.</li>
            <li> My cousin told me about this shampoo and conditioner several years ago and I have been using it ever since. I was having problems with build up in my hair and wanted to find a shampoo/condiitoner that smelled good, didn&#x27;t cause build up and made my hair feel clean and soft.  This one does the trick - love that it is sold in a duo on Amazon and that it is less than I can buy it for here in town.</li>
            <li> I was worried about ordering my salon shampoo online. The shampoo and conditioner are exactly the same as the salon and I get free shipping. Very pleased. I highly recommend purchasing in bulk.</li>
            <li> I absoultely love this shampoo. It&#x27;s the only kind I&#x27;ve found that makes my hair happy. I use to purchase it in the store...it was an all orange bottle. I found the identical bottle here on amazon, but all of the reviews said something wasn&#x27;t right about it. It didn&#x27;t smell the same, wasn&#x27;t the same product even though the bottle was identical, so the reviews steered me to this and I&#x27;m glad I chose it. THIS is the exact shampoo that was in the orange bottles.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and manageable! Love the smell!!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and was having trouble finding the large bottles in my local salon so I ordered mine here on Amazon. These two bottles, the shampoo and conditioner cost less than what I usually pay for a smaller bottle at my salon anyways. The combination of shampoo and conditioner makes my hair look great. Would recommend for anyone with hair that is frizzy or fly-away like mine. After using a flat iron, my hair looks shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> There were literally zero tangles in my damaged, frizzy hair after I used this today. I was in shock. It works miracles and has a pleasant, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal! I love it. It makes your hair so silky and so soft. Made my hair gorgeous. Good for people that use bleach.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Smells just like the original set I bought from the store.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!  I have thick, coarse, dry, prone to frizziness, slightly curly  hair, and this works like magic. My hair, after using, is soft, less frizzy, and just better looking overall.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and frizzy hair and this shampoo and conditioner leave my hair very soft and managable, smells great too.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. Used to come in orange bottles, but is the same product as far as I can tell. Great scent, great performance, awesome value.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. It leaves my hair smooth and shiny after each use.</li>
            <li> Great Products. Leaves hair really soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and have used this shampoo a long time for no friz and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> This is great for frizzy or unmanageable hair . Makes my hair so smooth and soft . The only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean scalp too well so I switch off every couple washes to prevent buildup .</li>
            <li> It was becoming difficult to find these in the store, especially on sale anymore! Glad that I found them. This is the BEST shampoo for someone who has long hair that tends to get a lot of heat damage.</li>
            <li> You can instantly feel your hair relax and soften with this shampoo and conditioner.Well worth the price!!! Love it and would buy again</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have long thick hair, and this is the only conditioner I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy. it leaves my hair soft and easy to untangle after i use it. I am very particular about my hair and what I use on it. great product.</li>
            <li> My hair did not feel the way it usually feel when I buy this at the store. It also smells slightly stronger than the one at the store. My hair was dull and dry.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this.  The conditioner makes my hair silky as soon as I apply it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real thing ! Works great, cheap price but quality product. Much cheaper than in store and lasts forever good sale</li>
            <li> Will be buying more great price! I love how sleek and shine my hair is. It&#x27;s not heavy so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair</li>
            <li> Easy on your hair And leaves you with a healthy shine.  (Learned of Matrix because my hairdresser uses it)</li>
            <li> I thought all shampoos were the same. Not so!  This product really helps my hair stay straight with minimal frizzies.</li>
            <li> Me and my Mom love this Shampoo and Conditioner because are hair gets straight we like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Hair looks great and sleek and shiny.  Just what I needed.  Cons not sulphate free.  Conditioner styles so need to wash more often.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner. Makes my hair soft and smooth. Great price on Amazon compared to local retailers</li>
            <li> It did not straighten my hair but added to my frizz. Did not work for me, my hair damaged and frizzy, this just made my hair more dry</li>
            <li> The set is marvelous for my very long thick hair. It is the only product that tames my thick frizzy hair. Most of the time, I do not even need to&lt;br /&gt;straighten my hair because of this product. I highly recommend it. My daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff...It&#x27;s Matrix and there is no substitute! Great for thick dry hair. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and Conditioner combination is good. Hair is less frizzy</li>
            <li> Sometimes I try other shampoo&#x27;s &amp;#34;just &#x27;cause&amp;#34; and I always end up going back to Matrix-Sleek.  Buying a combo-pack online which saves me $$ makes it even better!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo if your hair is dry or frizzy and I&#x27;ve tried all kinds it has a pleasent scent</li>
            <li> I ordered the Sleek shampoo and conditioner by mistake (I meant to order Total Repair), but I had no regrets once I used them. I have long blonde (lightened) hair that takes a lot of abuse from heat tools, and the Sleek products really made a difference in the texture of my hair. After one shampoo and conditioning treatment, my hair was very soft and shiny. I can actually run my fingers through my hair from root to tip and they don&#x27;t get stuck. My husband has been using it as well (he has longer hair than mine), and I&#x27;ve noticed much less frizz from humidity and more softness and shine in his hair. The only complaint I could possibly make about these products is that my hair is now so soft that it&#x27;s hard to keep a clip in it, but a little hairspray and back-combing takes care of that. I really love the Sleek line of products, and will definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> I used cheap all in one shampoo and conditioner for years.  I can&#x27;t believe how much smoother my hair is after using these products.  And no itching, dandruff or noticeable residue like I&#x27;ve experience with the all in one products, either.</li>
            <li> This does keep the frizzies down on my very curly hair.  It might relax the curl a bit, but hair is very shiny!</li>
            <li> this is a super deal on the matrix sleep shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this products and price as well</li>
            <li> Good. This product is a gift.</li>
            <li> My daughter swears her hair grows more with this.....</li>
            <li> This product is good, the smell is amazing. before buying it, I had high expectations since I have very coarse hair. I did see a difference in making my hair more silk but based on certain comments, the silkiness was exaggerated. So being more realistic depending on your hair texture might be a great way to start before continuing to read other comments.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my hairdresser wasn&#x27;t avail at the time and someone else was working and I explained to her that my hair is curly and that I wanted something for my curls and I had wavy/curly/frizzy hair and she recommended this! Well I am almost done with the bottles and although I do like them, I now realized it&#x27;s for curly hair that needs to be straightened or whatnot lol I told my hairdresser and she asked me who recommended them and that what it was actually for and she recommended something else for me. I have been embracing my curls now after years of straightening so I have been doing the wash and go deal and I&#x27;m not going to knock this product due to my issues of getting the wrong one but it did make my hair nice even though I didn&#x27;t straighten it  lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/11/2015&lt;br /&gt;I am still using Biolage products! Now I use the hydration one but I can&#x27;t find any better products YET!</li>
            <li> I always used the Biolage product they were excellent but I bought the Total Results Matrix line and my hair is dry, opaque, this product was terrible.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product...I will definitely keep buying!!!</li>
            <li> Love the product and will order again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo I will never buy anything but it so glad you have the deal amazon thank you</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy/wavy hair &amp; have been searching for products to tame it for over 10 years now.  The combination of Matrix total results sleek shampoo &amp; conditioner with It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave in conditioner makes my hair so much easier to manage &amp; cuts down on the frizz drastically!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike about the shampoo &amp; conditioner; the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest.  :(</li>
            <li> Great service!  Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Been using this shampoo for a long time. Great price</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it makes my hair look great!</li>
            <li> Glad I made this purchase.  My hair is soft and easy to manage, exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> All of the above-mentioned products that I purchased @ Amazon.com are totally awesome!! Fast, dependable, reliable &amp; prices are great too!!</li>
            <li> I Love matrix products!! keeps your hair smooth and strong and smelling great! plus a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Works great I love it and the smell is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on  for years, but find myself always coming back to this product. I have very dry hair and I find that Matrix sleek works great for for me. The price was great and it arrived before the expected date. The one think I found was that the bottles seemed smaller but I compared it to other bottles I still had and it was the same love the new look.</li>
            <li> No better product. Timely delivery. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> After a few months, the conditioner smelled rancid.  I do not think this is there real thing.</li>
            <li> made my hair so soft loved it</li>
            <li> Great deal and fast deliver.  Will buy if when product runs out.  This is the best combination of hair product.</li>
            <li> It is a lot cheaper on line, and gets here quick.Anyone with curls in their hair will love it to smooth them out easier.</li>
            <li> I like this product and the Duo is a great economic deal.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Goes very good with my hair</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. Same Shampoo and Conditioner as sold in high end salons. Great packaging.</li>
            <li> Terrible conditioner it smells funny and has clumps in it I don&#x27;t know but it seemed like it had something in it.</li>
            <li> This was a great value. Have been using this for years.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great shampoo for hard water.&lt;br /&gt;This set is great for colored hair, especially red which seems to fade faster.</li>
            <li> Always luved all matrix products dames goes wid it tooo</li>
            <li> I like the smoothing effect that this has while rinsing in the shower but after my hair is styled its a bit flat and has lots of static :-/ That may not be the case for everyones hair but for me this set doesn&#x27;t add much luster to my hair like I wanted.</li>
            <li> 33 ounces goes a long way.  The conditioner seems like a quality product.  I will evaluate after some use.  this is the first time buying this product.  the only reason for not getting 5 stars is waiting to get an overall evaluation .</li>
            <li> Where do I start? It is such a contradiction to its name. My hair became ultra frizzy and unmanageable after using this product. The irony is that my hairdresser recommended it to me because of frizz! My hair started falling after starting on this shampoo-conditioner regimen and I am stuck with this huge bottle (my bad!) for the next three months. In my defense, I trusted this product blindly because of the Matrix tag. From now on, I am going to stick to Biolage. That is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;And oh yes, I am going to change my hairdresser too.</li>
