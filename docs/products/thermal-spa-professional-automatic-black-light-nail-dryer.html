            <li>My Clients love it</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>Have always used Lanel, and find this to be just as good for a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and would buy it again if had the opportunity.  </li>
            <li>My nails look terrific and they are able to grow in nicely since I can always get a salon polishing.  </li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time a few days ago and am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>Even using the fast drying topcoat, I would have to sit around for a good fifteen minutes just to make sure my mani was thoroughly dry and</li>
            <li>So so far so good, I will try it out without the fast drying topcoat to see and I will do an up</li>
            <li>The unit is pricy, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Was very pleased not only with the super fast shipping</li>
            <li>This makes drying my nails very fast.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item like the first week of this month used it two days</li>
            <li>I was concerned with it having &amp;#34;black lights&amp;#34; and me having fair skin, but they are not strong at all</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it about three times, each time having used a fast drying topcoat, my favorite is Seche Vite and the combination of the Seche Vite with this fan makes for a super shiny and completely dry manicure.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by a professional nail technician and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Easy to care for, maintain and clean and didn&#x27;t take up as much space as I expected</li>
            <li>But I use the cycle 2 times to be sure my nails are completely dry.</li>
            <li>It was actually better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>She loves it and says it works really well.</li>
            <li>Salon quality and style at much lower price.</li>
            <li>Bought for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>but it was very well packaged as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Also the Second client I used it on the fan started making a super loud noise.</li>
            <li>i called them and they replaced me a new 1...then</li>
            <li>I like to leave it out on a counter since it&#x27;s awkward to keep moving in and out of a cabinet, but it doesn&#x27;t look attractive when I have company.</li>
            <li>I now put my nails in ice water for 3 minutes, or as long as I can stand it, between coats and my nails dry just fine.</li>
            <li>Unless you do manicures professionally and think this will help your customers, save your money.</li>
            <li>I called the company who made it to see if a dull light was normal.</li>
            <li>Got the item quick but black lights do not work</li>
            <li>For the past couple of years, due to hygienic reasons and in order to save some money, I&#x27;ve started to do my nails at home and this dryer is amazing.</li>
            <li>It really does dry your nails in 6 minutes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hands down much better than our little battery operated one that only did one hand at a time.</li>
            <li>I sent the unit back and got another one and a light in that one was dull too.</li>
            <li>have to go through the 6 minute cycle 5 times and still not completely dry..</li>
            <li>Clients appreciate leaving with dry nails professionally finished.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the black lights they sent were just regular light bulbs with some purple paint on them which was more than half peeled or chipped off.  </li>

            <li> and so I splurged a little and so far</li>
            <li> She is only 2 but absolutely loves having her nails painted, but unfortunately with her young age she never sits still long enough to let them dry.</li>
            <li> My nails are dry and smudge proof in record time.</li>
            <li> I could have used a small fan from home and put a black light bulb in a small lamp for a few dollars instead of $125  plus the bulb went out after 2 uses  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li> broke again after few months,,,i am going to send it back again.!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have regrets with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Dry nails in 6 minutes!!  </li>
            <li> I read air blowing from the dryer and heat of the black lights is what helps dry my nails.</li>
            <li> One of the black lights was duller than the other</li>
            <li> It is a heavy piece so it almost requires a designated table as its too heavy to move around a lot.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> she loves its and uses it almost everyday</li>
            <li> really disappointed because this is a big set back to my business, and</li>
            <li> I have used one like it in the past and it worked well.</li>
            <li> The one (small) issue is its size and weight.  </li>
            <li> and it still was dull.</li>
            <li> I am a professional nail tech and this is absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> the sad part is I&#x27;m all the way from Trinidad😠.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels and looks expensive, not flimsy at all.  </li>
            <li> bad product.</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed because the listing states &amp;#34;thermal&amp;#34; but the lights don&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li> I want to return it sooo bad!!</li>
            <li> Terrible !</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just used it for the first time a few days ago and am very impressed.  Dry nails in 6 minutes!!  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.  Takes two cycles with top coat but not a smudge after.  Great investment.</li>
            <li> I read air blowing from the dryer and heat of the black lights is what helps dry my nails. One of the black lights was duller than the other so I changed it and it still was dull. I sent the unit back and got another one and a light in that one was dull too. I called the company who made it to see if a dull light was normal. The person I spoke to said she&#x27;d find out and get back to me. She never did...no customer service... so I sent it back. I now put my nails in ice water for 3 minutes, or as long as I can stand it, between coats and my nails dry just fine. Best of all, I don&#x27;t wake up with sheet marks!!  Unless you do manicures professionally and think this will help your customers, save your money.</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed because the listing states &amp;#34;thermal&amp;#34; but the lights don&#x27;t do anything.  Only one of my lights worked when I received it, and it&#x27;s literally only fans blowing air.</li>
            <li> this arrived quickly and works great... my clients are happy. the only problem is how to change the filters, no directions.</li>
            <li> ridiculous price for just a fan and black light  I could have used a small fan from home and put a black light bulb in a small lamp for a few dollars instead of $125  plus the bulb went out after 2 uses  I want to return it sooo bad!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item like the first week of this month used it two days and it stopped working just like that really disappointed because this is a big set back to my business, and the sad part is I&#x27;m all the way from Trinidad😠.</li>
            <li> This dryer is very good! It was actually better quality than I expected. It is a heavy piece so it almost requires a designated table as its too heavy to move around a lot.</li>
            <li> Used maybe a dozen times.  Button to turn on broke, can&#x27;t replace.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> After  3 months used...it&#x27;s die....i  am going to contract them...will see how they handle it. bad product. Update.....i called them and they replaced me a new 1...then broke again after few months,,,i am going to send it back again.! good thing still 1 year warranty...</li>
            <li> Great machine. Have always used Lanel, and find this to be just as good for a more reasonable price. Nicer looking aesthetically, too.</li>
            <li> LOVE this nail dryer. It really does dry your nails in 6 minutes! The unit is pricy, but it&#x27;s worth it. Also, if you have to replace the bulbs, they&#x27;re only about $6 each. Totally worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This makes drying my nails very fast.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  I don&#x27;t have regrets with this purchase.  I use it for my personal spa pedicures at home.</li>
            <li> I tried this at the salon where I occasionally get a manicure. It worked so well that I ordered one for at home. I absolutely love this product! My nails are dry and smudge proof in record time. The polish seems to last longer too. I would definately recomend this to anyone looking for a great nail dryer.</li>
            <li> I have not used this machine yet.  I have used one like it in the past and it worked well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this nail dryer for our salon and spa. It works great and looks very high end!  Love it</li>
            <li> My daughter received this for a Christmas present from her grandmother.  She loves it and says it works really well.</li>
            <li> I received this item as a christmas gift (thank you honey) and I absolutely love it! For the past couple of years, due to hygienic reasons and in order to save some money, I&#x27;ve started to do my nails at home and this dryer is amazing. Its fast, efficient and quite frankly it&#x27;s like bringing the nail salon to your very own home! Ladies (and gents), you will not regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> Salon quality and style at much lower price. Bought for my wife and she absolutely loves it. Easy to care for, maintain and clean and didn&#x27;t take up as much space as I expected</li>
            <li> Got the item quick but black lights do not work</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail dryer on  October 7th, I had it in my hands two day later on the 9th.  Was very pleased not only with the super fast shipping but it was very well packaged as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a nail dryer for my personal use, I am a nail polish hoarder/addict &#x3D;) and I do my nails two to three times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels and looks expensive, not flimsy at all.  I was concerned with it having &amp;#34;black lights&amp;#34; and me having fair skin, but they are not strong at all and they give a nice warmth to your drying nails so I left them on there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it about three times, each time having used a fast drying topcoat, my favorite is Seche Vite and the combination of the Seche Vite with this fan makes for a super shiny and completely dry manicure.  Even using the fast drying topcoat, I would have to sit around for a good fifteen minutes just to make sure my mani was thoroughly dry and most of the time I would &amp;#34;ding&amp;#34; a nail or two, but now I run a six minute cycle and I&#x27;m done. So so far so good, I will try it out without the fast drying topcoat to see and I will do an up date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is somewhat of an overkill for home use, like in my case that it&#x27;s for my personal use but caring for my nails is my passion and so I splurged a little and so far, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It wrk great she loves its and uses it almost everyday I cant keep her away from it</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for me and my daughter.  She is only 2 but absolutely loves having her nails painted, but unfortunately with her young age she never sits still long enough to let them dry. This solved our problem!! She loves to put with her hands under it, especially when the lights come one.  What a wonderful product.  I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week but so far so good.  It looks/feels like it&#x27;s durable and built to last.  It&#x27;s hands down much better than our little battery operated one that only did one hand at a time. So far I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and would buy it again if had the opportunity.  It works great and even dries that stubborn glitter polish in no time! What a wonderful product!! I have no complaints at all.  It definitely gets 5 stars from our home!  &#x3D;)  We LOVE OUR NAIL DRYER!!!  &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Although it seems like an extravagance, this nail dryer is already saving me money on manicures.  My nails look terrific and they are able to grow in nicely since I can always get a salon polishing.  The one (small) issue is its size and weight.  I like to leave it out on a counter since it&#x27;s awkward to keep moving in and out of a cabinet, but it doesn&#x27;t look attractive when I have company.</li>
            <li> Love it wonderful Addition to my salon My Clients love it</li>
            <li> Bought for a Christmas present and they were wowed!</li>
            <li> This nail dryer is working great in our salon...very satisfied!  I would recommend it to anyone.  Clients appreciate leaving with dry nails professionally finished.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is best polish dryer i have bought for my buisness.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Recommended by a professional nail technician and was not disappointed. Hardens polish to last longer and dries in time specified. Would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I Love this drier!!  Unfortunately the black lights they sent were just regular light bulbs with some purple paint on them which was more than half peeled or chipped off.  Had I not had to go out after spending $100 this dryer to then spend another $14 set of blacklight bulbs</li>
            <li> Terrible ! I am a professional nail tech and this is absolutely terrible. .u have to go through the 6 minute cycle 5 times and still not completely dry.. Also the Second client I used it on the fan started making a super loud noise. .HOW EMBARRASSING !!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  I save a lot of money by not going to the nail salon.  But I use the cycle 2 times to be sure my nails are completely dry.</li>
