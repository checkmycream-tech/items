            <li> my sister love it, it really works</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It smells good and gives you whitening effect &amp;smooth skin tone right away.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> First off, the service and shipping was great.  I&#x27;ve been using the cream about 3 times a week and I feel it is a good primer. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it actually will whiten or brighten my skin. I like that it comes with a little spatula.  I also bought the milky pack (used it once) and while this one does brighten the skin in a matter of minutes, it made me break out. I may use it on my body (knees and elbows) instead.</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> As seen&lt;br /&gt;Amazing and nice quality</li>
            <li> I like the cream and the milky pack, but not the sent they have.</li>
