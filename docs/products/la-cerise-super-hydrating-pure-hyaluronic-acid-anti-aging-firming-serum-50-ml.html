            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My face looks better than it has looked in years!</li>
            <li>but she liked the results.</li>
            <li>I see a more healthy, radiant skin, I even use it on my lips and they have a healthy blush to them now.</li>
            <li>The product helped make my skin feel softer and gave it a more youthful glow.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I took a chance on this product.</li>
            <li>I have used Hyaluronic products off &amp; on for many years...</li>
            <li>I just love this serum, and I am so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is very nice and it dries fast and not oily.</li>
            <li>Excellent to smooth your skin prior to applying liquid make-up.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good to smooth out fine lines.</li>
            <li>and it does not have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the La Cerise Hyaluronic Acid Super Anti-Aging serum.  </li>
            <li>The Hyaluronic Acid Super Anti-Aging serum makes a visible difference in my skin, and that&#x27;s saying something!  </li>
            <li>I put a couple of &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; of the product around my face/neck, and smooth it on.</li>
            <li>The effects are fantastic...</li>
            <li>so far, so good.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed almost immediately and smooths the wrinkles around the eyes and neck.  </li>
            <li>So far feels very smooth, having not been using that long, but tone is better.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I use it at night and in the morning and use four pumps each time so it goes pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>and it definitely helps hide those fine lines and gives elasticity to your skin.</li>
            <li>This also reduces the appearance of fine lines and make you look younger.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of bumps and acne scars and this product made my skin look so much smoother.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>After putting it on, I can really feel the tightness kick in.</li>
            <li>My make up goes on much smoother</li>
            <li>I do not see much improvement.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and you can get through your skincare routine that much quicker.</li>
            <li>Absolutely use this serum, I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not liking it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems to really help my complexion.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>The effect is that my skin looks smooth, pore less and line free especially after put some moisturizer or facial oil on top.</li>
            <li>so high up in the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try the La Cerise retinol serum next (it also has hyaluronic acid in it) and use the derma roller first.  </li>
            <li>but the consequences are literally marked on my skin</li>
            <li>I have purchased other products at a much higher price that haven&#x27;t worked as well as this serum.</li>
            <li>The La Cerise HA serum has none of theses deficits: I was surprised at how much product you get for the price; pump bottle; I love the texture- its a little thick in a gel form.</li>
            <li>Does not seem to work any better than other products I have tried in the past</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I had been using an HA serum called Ul***a Forte for mature skin on the recommendation of a friend; It was good, but the amount for the price was ridiculous,I hate the bottle w/ dropper thing, the texture was runny, the effects weren&#x27;t long lasting.  </li>

            <li> , I have some depressed scaring, enlarge pores, and dull skin tone...</li>
            <li> Hope it works on those awful laugh lines between the nose and the sides of the mouth.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy something with Phenoxyethanol(a preservative is restricted in Japan) so high up in the ingredient list. With this price, you would expect a more impressive formula.</li>
            <li> I do see some improvement in my skin. This product definitely does improve skin tone. I have noticed an improvement in texture, tone and it has been me look slightly younger in the short space of time I have used it. Good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this awesome serum. The only hyaluronic acid I could find were moisturizers and were too oily for my oily, acne prone, skin. This is the best fit for my skin. La Cerise products are perfect for my type of skin.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of bumps and acne scars and this product made my skin look so much smoother. In just a few days my pores were smaller and the bumps were gone. I can definitely see improvement and will probably buy it again. Also there is no burning or redness after using it and it does not have a strong smell. It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or dry.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. After putting it on, I can really feel the tightness kick in. It has also made my skin softer.I have purchased other products at a much higher price that haven&#x27;t worked as well as this serum.</li>
            <li> Good quality and good price. Works pretty good to smooth out fine lines. I can see a difference in about 5 min. Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> One word.... AWESOME!  I&#x27;ve been using for a year and it definitely helps hide those fine lines and gives elasticity to your skin. I&#x27;m 39 and I think it works awesome.  My mother also tried it and she noticed a slight tightening but she liked the results. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My make up goes on much smoother and I also feel that my skin looks brighter without makeup since I&#x27;ve started using it. It smells good too, will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> GOES ON NICELY, MAKES SKIN FEEL VERY NICE AFTER APPLICATION.  WAITING TO SEE RESULTS, I WILL PROBABLY BUY IT AGAIN</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30, had horrible acne in my 20&#x27;s finally I got rid of that but the consequences are literally marked on my skin, I have some depressed scaring, enlarge pores, and dull skin tone... But I have to say that using the Sample I got with my roller (which I am yet to use the last) I see a more healthy, radiant skin, I even use it on my lips and they have a healthy blush to them now. I will definitely purchase the big bottle ... This product is not magical, it helps improve the skin, and it works... but isn&#x27;t going to get rid of scars.</li>
            <li> I do not see much improvement. Does not seem to work any better than other products I have tried in the past</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the La Cerise Hyaluronic Acid Super Anti-Aging serum.  The product helped make my skin feel softer and gave it a more youthful glow.  It feels very refreshing when applied.  I use it at night and during the day before I put on moisturizer.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took a chance on this product. I had been using an HA serum called Ul***a Forte for mature skin on the recommendation of a friend; It was good, but the amount for the price was ridiculous,I hate the bottle w/ dropper thing, the texture was runny, the effects weren&#x27;t long lasting.  The La Cerise HA serum has none of theses deficits: I was surprised at how much product you get for the price; pump bottle; I love the texture- its a little thick in a gel form. I apply it on clean,damp skin; about a pea size amount. I put a couple of &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; of the product around my face/neck, and smooth it on. It dries fast and you can get through your skincare routine that much quicker. The effect is that my skin looks smooth, pore less and line free especially after put some moisturizer or facial oil on top. I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and will continue to use it.  My skin looks good all day.</li>
            <li> I have used Hyaluronic products off &amp; on for many years... I have to say that this is the best serum I&#x27;ve used. It isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my skin as others have.  The effects are fantastic... I love it!</li>
            <li> I started using this product line a few months ago.  I can see a difference, it works for me....so far, so good.</li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Acid Super Anti-Aging serum makes a visible difference in my skin, and that&#x27;s saying something!  It is absorbed almost immediately and smooths the wrinkles around the eyes and neck.  It also works great for those little lines on the upper lip under my nose, I hate those.  I use it at night and in the morning and use four pumps each time so it goes pretty fast.  Four pumps covers my face, neck, and upper chest with a little left over for my hands. (Going to try to use three so it lasts longer.) Absolutely use this serum, I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not liking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try the La Cerise retinol serum next (it also has hyaluronic acid in it) and use the derma roller first.  I will report back on how that works.  Hope it works on those awful laugh lines between the nose and the sides of the mouth.  Will let you know.  Hope this has been helpful.</li>
            <li> Seems to really help my complexion.</li>
            <li> My face looks wonderful since I started using it.  You don&#x27;t need much.  My face looks better than it has looked in years!</li>
            <li> This is very nice and it dries fast and not oily. This also reduces the appearance of fine lines and make you look younger.</li>
            <li> Great product, but it took a while to see results. Considering trying the product again to give it another chance.</li>
            <li> I also have used this product for a couple of months now. It truly has evenly toned my skin and diminished any wrinkles on my face that were beginning to appear. My pores are smaller now. I will continue ordering and using this product. I just love this serum, and I am so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t do what it was advertised to do, left my skin dry, and would break me out.  I will not be ordering this product again.  It did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> So far feels very smooth, having not been using that long, but tone is better. Looking forward to see over time how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Excellent to smooth your skin prior to applying liquid make-up. Provides good moisture without being oily or greasy. Would recommend this to my friend.</li>
