            <li>To me, If you&#x27;re going to go this aggressive, try a good straight razor - or have the perfect razor to use with these.</li>
            <li>They are pretty much perfect.</li>

            <li>#34;Nobody makes me bleed my own</li>
            <li>Very easy to find on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>However I&#x27;ll look for something more bang for your buck when these run out.</li>

            <li>Love them when paired with the safety razor I bought.</li>
            <li>I love these for use on my safety razor.</li>
            <li>to try out any other blades cause these blades are considered the best.</li>

            <li>A bit to sharp for my face, great blades otherwise!</li>
            <li>excellent blades, worth the extra money</li>
            <li>and I bought them with Merur&#x27;s Safety Razor to get the free shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li>50 cents per blade.&lt;br /&gt;Performs great for multiple shaves (I use this in my safety</li>
            <li>and they appeared to have a genuine feather plastic wrap on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sharpest blades that promises a smooth shave, a must buy.</li>
            <li>They have done an amazing job so far!</li>
            <li>German stuff is not that good at all.  </li>
            <li>They sure have lived up to their reputation so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a dozen types of razors, and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>These are great as your first blades and they have neat little packaging.</li>
            <li>Good sharp blades.</li>
            <li>super sharp too with an outstanding smooth and flexible blade...</li>
            <li>That being said I prefer to be able to everyday use more midrange options which are bargains and do not come with gobs of adhesive like these</li>
            <li>However, I couldn&#x27;t honestly tell the difference between these and other good quality sharp blades.</li>
            <li>Everyone talked about how sharp they are and that you really need to have a good technique before using.</li>
            <li>I know for sure that a .003&amp;#34; shim makes a big aggressiveness change in my razors.</li>
            <li>Let me first say that he takes his time with this method of shaving and is still getting the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with a double edge razor for more than 30 yrs.</li>
            <li>I do that before I try any blade for the first time.</li>
            <li>amazing sharp blades....</li>
            <li>Bought as a present, arrived as expected and experienced no problems.</li>
            <li>I think I do much better with the Wilkinson Sword Classic when I&#x27;m in a hurry, and Personna Lab Blue when I can take my time.</li>
            <li>Either the quality has really gone downhill on this blade, or the seller (based in Malaysia) is selling a knock-off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I have some around, it defines one extreme edge of my razor blade line up.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had a better shave with other razors.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li>I feel like if you are patient and treat these like the razor sharp blades they are, you are going to be incredibly pleased with these whether you are new at this or a seasoned DE veteran.</li>
            <li>Definitely not for you if you have super sensitive skin or suffer from acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to shaving</li>
            <li>By the end of the first shave or beginning of the second, they start to tug.</li>
            <li>Been using these blades since day 1, they&#x27;re super sharp and it took some getting used to them before I could shave without any nicks/cuts.</li>
            <li>Merkur is simply nothing in comparison, it takes about 10 to 20 shaves to really understand the difference between two.</li>
            <li>No razor burn, bumps or redness and most notably, no nicks!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is new to DE shaving and these are the second brand of blades he tried.</li>
            <li>and they mow through my heavy beard like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>I was not sure that I had made the right selection for a newbie.</li>
            <li>This is by far the sharpest long lasting blade I have ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good sharp blades. However, I couldn&#x27;t honestly tell the difference between these and other good quality sharp blades. Nonetheless, these were very good and I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Bought as a present, arrived as expected and experienced no problems.</li>
            <li> These are great as your first blades and they have neat little packaging. I&#x27;m new to shaving and I bought them with Merur&#x27;s Safety Razor to get the free shipping from Amazon. I shave about every 2-3 days on average and one blade lasts in an excess of 3 weeks. However I&#x27;ll look for something more bang for your buck when these run out. Superb quality!</li>
            <li> 50 cents per blade.&lt;br /&gt;Performs great for multiple shaves (I use this in my safety razor).&lt;br /&gt;Stainless steel - doesn&#x27;t rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on, but this is why I buy these and will continue to buy them. They are pretty much perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I have some around, it defines one extreme edge of my razor blade line up. Derbys define the other. That being said I prefer to be able to everyday use more midrange options which are bargains and do not come with gobs of adhesive like these do...ugh. A little wax that wipes off is acceptable to me. This is annoying given a couple thousands of an inch matters greatly in razor cutting geometry. I know for sure that a .003&amp;#34; shim makes a big aggressiveness change in my razors.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are some of the sharpest I&#x27;ve tried, but they are for one use only. By the end of the first shave or beginning of the second, they start to tug. Personally they give me a bit too close of a shave. Definitely not for you if you have super sensitive skin or suffer from acne. For my skin and beard, I like Wilkinson Swords. Not as sharp, but they last me 3 uses no problem. Just rinse with alcohol before and after every shave.</li>
            <li> These appeared authentic. They look just like other Feather blades I&#x27;ve used in the past and they appeared to have a genuine feather plastic wrap on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they are INCREDIBLY DULL. Oh you should see the razor burns and bumps and red rash I&#x27;ve got on my face now. I&#x27;ve always selected this brand because they were the sharpest, and cut through my coarse hair. Not the ones I received today from Mulberry Life. Pulling, grabbing, raking across my face. Awful, awful blade. I tried another one out of the package and it&#x27;s the same thing. Either the quality has really gone downhill on this blade, or the seller (based in Malaysia) is selling a knock-off. Ouch!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a dozen types of razors, and this is my favorite by far. I only buy this brand now.</li>
            <li> Sharpest blades that promises a smooth shave, a must buy.</li>
            <li> These blades are crazy sharp!! They have done an amazing job so far! Have yet to try out any other blades cause these blades are considered the best. They sure have lived up to their reputation so far!</li>
            <li> Ninja assassin sharp. Not for beginners learned it the hard way.</li>
            <li> Best blades you can find.  Some of them a not real but so far this order was cutting as original blades that came with my Japanese razor.  German stuff is not that good at all.  Merkur is simply nothing in comparison, it takes about 10 to 20 shaves to really understand the difference between two.</li>
            <li> excellent blades, worth the extra money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first blade lasted for almost a month of shaves before I started feeling it drag against my beard hairs...that&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;super super sharp too with an outstanding smooth and flexible blade...almost 2 months with ZERO knicks/cuts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving with a safety razor for a few years but was always hesitant to try Feather. Everyone talked about how sharp they are and that you really need to have a good technique before using. I finally gave them a try and they mow through my heavy beard like a hot knife through butter. Knowing these exist, I can never go back to another blade again.</li>
            <li> Been using these blades since day 1, they&#x27;re super sharp and it took some getting used to them before I could shave without any nicks/cuts. Extremely close shave and great value!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is new to DE shaving and these are the second brand of blades he tried. I bought him these and the merkur blades. After reading some of the reviews for these Feather blades I was not sure that I had made the right selection for a newbie. Let me first say that he takes his time with this method of shaving and is still getting the hang of it. He also took the time to actually learn the basics of double edge shaving and watched tutorials on Youtube as well. He didn&#x27;t jump into this on a whim and he understands what &amp;#34;sharp blade&amp;#34; means. After using the Merkurs he tried these and they are spectacular! Nothing against the Merkur blades (everyone has to find what works for them) but after he shaves with these, his skin is the smoothest it has ever been! I didn&#x27;t know his face could be that smooth! In fact his skin seems healthier after having used these blades.  No razor burn, bumps or redness and most notably, no nicks! I feel like if you are patient and treat these like the razor sharp blades they are, you are going to be incredibly pleased with these whether you are new at this or a seasoned DE veteran. Using the proper angle, I don&#x27;t know how anyone could tear their face to shreds with these, like some of the other comments have suggested.</li>
            <li> No explanation needed - they work great!</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp. Last me for 3 shaves or change it out weekly. They are packed each by themselves and are a quality razor blade.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a double edge razor for more than 30 yrs. I have tried many brands including Merkur, Gillette etc. This is by far the sharpest long lasting blade I have ever used. I get at least 10 shaves per blade More if I shave every day, but I&#x27;m now retired so I don&#x27;t have to shave every day.  Cost is also cheaper than most blades.  Very easy to find on Amazon.  Would highly recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li> Baby Smooth Shave, great company with my Merkur Vision 2000. I get 4 shaves out of it. These are great.</li>
            <li> These are inexpensive and the shave is ok but I&#x27;ve had a better shave with other razors. Thought I&#x27;d try these out but doesn&#x27;t get close enough for my taste. These are great starter razors but I&#x27;ll try others before buying these again.</li>
            <li> Great value for an add on item. These are sharp!  Love them when paired with the safety razor I bought.</li>
            <li> I love these for use on my safety razor. I get about 5 shaves from each blade.</li>
            <li> These are great, just not for me. I like a smooth-shaving, coated blade. Sharp, but not &amp;#34;Nobody makes me bleed my own blood!&amp;#34; sharp. I think I do much better with the Wilkinson Sword Classic when I&#x27;m in a hurry, and Personna Lab Blue when I can take my time. To me, If you&#x27;re going to go this aggressive, try a good straight razor - or have the perfect razor to use with these. A EJ DE89 works, but I have to be slooooow and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro-Tip: Palm Strop every blade before using, it only takes a few seconds. The Wilkinsons and some Personnas don&#x27;t seem to need it, but it makes Feathers a little less likely to slice me up, same with Astra. I do that before I try any blade for the first time.</li>
            <li> A bit to sharp for my face, great blades otherwise!</li>
            <li> amazing sharp blades....i will never us a safety razor again</li>
