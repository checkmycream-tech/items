            <li>Perfect for setting foundation, really compact.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m thinking it probably won&#x27;t be as nice</li>

            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s what you like, then you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to kabukis that have more densely packed bristles.</li>
            <li>Okay, I LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li>have used many brushes and none compare to this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have had for more than six months and no bristles have come out yet...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how they can charge you more then the price advertised</li>
            <li>and i am enjoying it.</li>
            <li>I love the softness of the bristles.</li>
            <li>Also, like someone else wrote, these bristles appear to be synthetic, which is fine (better).</li>
            <li>There is a more expensive one on Amazon in the 50 dollar range which I assume is wonderful, but I am happy with the value here.  </li>
            <li>He literally sits there at night just rubbing it on his face because it feels so good, haha.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for using with bronzer on my chest and body when I&#x27;m going out, but I haven&#x27;t been able to use it for that yet since my husband has gotten a hold of it.</li>
            <li>soft and works well - NICE brush!</li>
            <li>This brush feels amazing and it is super soft, I love it!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you, this Kabuki Brush is great.</li>
            <li>It was such a great price I had to have it.</li>
            <li>this brush is fantastic for makeup application.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because it&#x27;s a fantastic brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can buy a very nice kabuki at target for the same price without shipping.</li>
            <li>AMAZON was wonderful, as usual, and agreed to refund my money.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work for me, but it turns out I really like the brush and would purchase again!</li>
            <li>It is very soft and feels nice</li>
            <li>This brush is nice and soft and applies make up well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice and soft andnfor</li>
            <li>full, doesn&#x27;t shed even after washing</li>
            <li>It works really well for applying my mineral powder compact that I got from Honey Bee Gardens. :)</li>
            <li>Problem free purchase with fast arrival/ accurate description.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of bronzer (pregnant and can&#x27;t tan anymoure) on both face and neck/chest area.</li>
            <li>Im more than pleased especially for the price!</li>
            <li>but this brush is HUGE and Flares and spreads powder in a flash, very evenly and lightly</li>
            <li>The bristles are not very dense; and as I mentioned earlier, it would be perfect to use for bronzer or a light dusting of powder for when you don&#x27;t want the makeup too compact on the brush.</li>
            <li>First of all the shipping is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is just as amazing as the smaller brush</li>
            <li>love the brush thus far.</li>
            <li>Its useful for after shine mineral make-up.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very large and widespread.  </li>
            <li>This fluffy powder brush is super soft and feels great on your face.</li>
            <li>It was my first time buying make up brushes and while I don&#x27;t use it often I do love it, it&#x27;s soft, easy to wash and use and has a very low price for this sort of item.</li>
            <li>very soft!!!</li>
            <li>Would not have purchased if I could have felt it in person first.</li>
            <li>, i love how big it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, and great quality.</li>
            <li>Its soft and your powder goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>ok, so I bought the smaller brush and used it first</li>
            <li>It will do the job nicely for an inexpensive brush just be careful when cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.</li>
            <li>My first kabuki Brush,it seems to serving its purpose.</li>
            <li>bristles fall out after first use</li>
            <li>The hairs are super soft and there is no problem in cleaning the brush</li>
            <li>I wanted something really large to use for my finishing powder but didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it everyday since I got it, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Its very soft and nice, but way too wide of a brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice brush for a powder or blush but the bristles could have been a little</li>
            <li>doesnt shed, works really well</li>
            <li>really helps with my blending.</li>
            <li>Feels high end!</li>
            <li>It picks up powders really well and applies it evenly over the face.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed it&#x27;s bristles like some brushes I&#x27;ve used; which is a much added bonus.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great quality synthetic fluffy brush!</li>
            <li>which I would normally be pissed about but in this case worked in my favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I can live with it.</li>
            <li>Very soft, wish it had a longer handle though.  </li>
            <li>It is so very soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and the brush is actually pretty big for a kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>very rarely am i so pleasantly surprised with an item!</li>
            <li>So if you want a soft brush, this is the one!</li>
            <li>as for regular mineral make up, didnt find it useful bc its way to soft and big for the make up to really cover your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a vegan and clearly bought this impulsively without reading the print.</li>
            <li>This brush is perfectly soft, holds the powder, and applies it evenly to your skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft but the bristles are too loose/sparse and don&#x27;t hold and apply face powder well.</li>
            <li>I somehow managed to keep for nearly two years.</li>
            <li>The SYNTHETIC bristles, although soft, also appear to have been manufactured</li>
            <li>It is soft and evens out your make up and any flaws on your face</li>
            <li>So soft and lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Brushes are too soft to me.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely soft and I like it for applying mineral foundation and powder.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember) started loosing bristles early on</li>
            <li>The brush was way to soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, but not too soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hang on&amp;#34; to my foundation like some brushes, Therefore it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy and remains so soft.</li>
            <li>It may work well for removing excess powder from your face, but is too soft for foundation or caked powder application...</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t shed a single hair since I purchased, very soft bristles, and decent sized handle.</li>
            <li>I wanted a large-ish buki brush but soft enough for my finishing powder and sensitive face.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s very soft and thick, and I think I&#x27;m going to enjoy working with it in the near future</li>
            <li>Brush is very, very soft, even after shampooing and cleaning prior to use.</li>
            <li>very soft bristles and gentle...use it for overall face application of powdered makeup...</li>
            <li>The brush is rather expensive, although I kind of expected that for a 100% natural GOAT hair bristle brush (and I&#x27;m fairly certain goat hair can be obtained from a goat WITHOUT harming the goat), but I likely would not have purchased a 100% SYNTHETIC bristle KABUKI brush for the price this brush is selling for ($6.00+ as of August 2013).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only issue is that since it is SO soft I have my doubts on how well it will wash up and keep its life.</li>
            <li>If the product is retained with a different description on the AMAZON website, I encourage future purchasers to consider looking elsewhere if you desire a 100% NATURAL bristle KABUKI brush, as do I!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for four days now and not a single bristle has fallen out and it hasn&#x27;t got \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; at all.  </li>
            <li>They will also likely either remove the product from their website because of the INCORRECT way it is currently advertised (that is, as of early August 2013), OR they will correct the description.  </li>
            <li>A bronzer brush is supposed to create a natural glow on the parts of your face that would get sun, which is easier with a large, fluffy brush with a flat head.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this brush directly from AMAZON because AMAZON will replace damaged or defective products if you buy directly from them, whereas if AMAZON only ships a product sold by one of the other market place vendors, a damaged, defective, or otherwise unsatisfactory product can only be returned for refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it is very soft, a little too soft</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Its useful for after shine mineral make-up.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very large and widespread.  </li>
            <li> This fluffy powder brush is super soft and feels great on your face.</li>
            <li> It was my first time buying make up brushes and while I don&#x27;t use it often I do love it, it&#x27;s soft, easy to wash and use and has a very low price for this sort of item.</li>
            <li> very soft!!!</li>
            <li> Would not have purchased if I could have felt it in person first.</li>
            <li> , i love how big it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, and great quality.</li>
            <li> Its soft and your powder goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> ok, so I bought the smaller brush and used it first</li>
            <li> It will do the job nicely for an inexpensive brush just be careful when cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.</li>
            <li> My first kabuki Brush,it seems to serving its purpose.</li>
            <li> bristles fall out after first use</li>
            <li> The hairs are super soft and there is no problem in cleaning the brush</li>
            <li> I wanted something really large to use for my finishing powder but didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday since I got it, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Its very soft and nice, but way too wide of a brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush for a powder or blush but the bristles could have been a little</li>
            <li> doesnt shed, works really well</li>
            <li> really helps with my blending.</li>
            <li> Feels high end!</li>
            <li> It picks up powders really well and applies it evenly over the face.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed it&#x27;s bristles like some brushes I&#x27;ve used; which is a much added bonus.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great quality synthetic fluffy brush!</li>
            <li> which I would normally be pissed about but in this case worked in my favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> Very soft, wish it had a longer handle though.  </li>
            <li> It is so very soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and the brush is actually pretty big for a kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> very rarely am i so pleasantly surprised with an item!</li>
            <li> So if you want a soft brush, this is the one!</li>
            <li> as for regular mineral make up, didnt find it useful bc its way to soft and big for the make up to really cover your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a vegan and clearly bought this impulsively without reading the print.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfectly soft, holds the powder, and applies it evenly to your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but the bristles are too loose/sparse and don&#x27;t hold and apply face powder well.</li>
            <li> I somehow managed to keep for nearly two years.</li>
            <li> The SYNTHETIC bristles, although soft, also appear to have been manufactured</li>
            <li> It is soft and evens out your make up and any flaws on your face</li>
            <li> So soft and lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Brushes are too soft to me.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely soft and I like it for applying mineral foundation and powder.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember) started loosing bristles early on</li>
            <li> The brush was way to soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, but not too soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hang on&amp;#34; to my foundation like some brushes, Therefore it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy and remains so soft.</li>
            <li> It may work well for removing excess powder from your face, but is too soft for foundation or caked powder application...</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t shed a single hair since I purchased, very soft bristles, and decent sized handle.</li>
            <li> I wanted a large-ish buki brush but soft enough for my finishing powder and sensitive face.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s very soft and thick, and I think I&#x27;m going to enjoy working with it in the near future</li>
            <li> Brush is very, very soft, even after shampooing and cleaning prior to use.</li>
            <li> very soft bristles and gentle...use it for overall face application of powdered makeup...</li>
            <li> The brush is rather expensive, although I kind of expected that for a 100% natural GOAT hair bristle brush (and I&#x27;m fairly certain goat hair can be obtained from a goat WITHOUT harming the goat), but I likely would not have purchased a 100% SYNTHETIC bristle KABUKI brush for the price this brush is selling for ($6.00+ as of August 2013).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only issue is that since it is SO soft I have my doubts on how well it will wash up and keep its life.</li>
            <li> If the product is retained with a different description on the AMAZON website, I encourage future purchasers to consider looking elsewhere if you desire a 100% NATURAL bristle KABUKI brush, as do I!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for four days now and not a single bristle has fallen out and it hasn&#x27;t got \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; at all.  </li>
            <li> They will also likely either remove the product from their website because of the INCORRECT way it is currently advertised (that is, as of early August 2013), OR they will correct the description.  </li>
            <li> A bronzer brush is supposed to create a natural glow on the parts of your face that would get sun, which is easier with a large, fluffy brush with a flat head.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this brush directly from AMAZON because AMAZON will replace damaged or defective products if you buy directly from them, whereas if AMAZON only ships a product sold by one of the other market place vendors, a damaged, defective, or otherwise unsatisfactory product can only be returned for refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it is very soft, a little too soft</li>
            <li> Not a super soft brush like the large black one from elf</li>
            <li> This brush is too soft for foundations due to its long hair.</li>
            <li> the way, this brush has a rather short aluminum-like handle, not especially easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Doubt it will last as long as my other one but at this price who cares.</li>
            <li> This brush is larger than the average \\&quot;large\\&quot; brush and has a flat head, which I like.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use for my homemade dry shampoo that I made.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent over $200 on make up brushes from sephora.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I do not really like it</li>
            <li> Something labeled as a bronzer brush that is stiff and angled or tapered to target one area is actually a blush brush.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t owned any other kabuki brushes, so I don&#x27;t know how to compare it.</li>
            <li> the two other brands I bought (one was Revlon</li>
            <li> the other</li>
            <li> I will probably try other products from this line.</li>
            <li> The product arrived (damaged, unfortunately) and was 100% SYNTHETIC, clearly stated as such on the product packaging!!  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the bristles are a little floppy/ flimsy for my liking.</li>
            <li> dried well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and haven&#x27;t seen any stray hair falling out</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it does what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li> Obviously the claim is false advertising ...</li>
            <li> Prefect little brush!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t/hasn&#x27;t shed in the past 2 weeks even after washing it.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are longer than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past and not as dense, so they flex as you apply makeup.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush disappointed me.</li>
            <li> Nasty!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very soft, wish it had a longer handle though.  Good for face powder or blush</li>
            <li> This brush is perfectly soft, holds the powder, and applies it evenly to your skin.  I have had no problems with the bristles falling out.  Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you, this Kabuki Brush is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but the bristles are too loose/sparse and don&#x27;t hold and apply face powder well. Would not have purchased if I could have felt it in person first.</li>
            <li> It is stated that this brush is made from goat hair. However, when I received it the packaging said it was made from all synthetic materials. Now, I for one prefer synthetic bristles. I am a vegan and clearly bought this impulsively without reading the print. It was such a great price I had to have it. After realizing it was \\&quot;goat hair\\&quot; before arriving  here I was bummed and thought I&#x27;d have to return it! Obviously the claim is false advertising ...which I would normally be pissed about but in this case worked in my favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the brush thus far. I had a 50 dollar bronzer brush from The Body Shop I somehow managed to keep for nearly two years. I loved that dang thing! So big, cleaned well, dried well. It was time to replace it and they discontinued the style. This Kabuki brush was 7 dollars. Even bigger. Ever softer. Applies wonderfully. I use a lot of bronzer (pregnant and can&#x27;t tan anymoure) on both face and neck/chest area. This is perfect for that kind of application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that since it is SO soft I have my doubts on how well it will wash up and keep its life. Doubt it will last as long as my other one but at this price who cares. I&#x27;ll re-buy as necessary.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush directly from AMAZON because AMAZON will replace damaged or defective products if you buy directly from them, whereas if AMAZON only ships a product sold by one of the other market place vendors, a damaged, defective, or otherwise unsatisfactory product can only be returned for refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the rating of only 1-star for this product, it was advertised as 100% Goat Hair.  The product arrived (damaged, unfortunately) and was 100% SYNTHETIC, clearly stated as such on the product packaging!!  The brush is rather expensive, although I kind of expected that for a 100% natural GOAT hair bristle brush (and I&#x27;m fairly certain goat hair can be obtained from a goat WITHOUT harming the goat), but I likely would not have purchased a 100% SYNTHETIC bristle KABUKI brush for the price this brush is selling for ($6.00+ as of August 2013).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this brush has a rather short aluminum-like handle, not especially easy to hold.  The SYNTHETIC bristles, although soft, also appear to have been manufactured flimsily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am, of course, returning the brush.  AMAZON was wonderful, as usual, and agreed to refund my money.  They will also likely either remove the product from their website because of the INCORRECT way it is currently advertised (that is, as of early August 2013), OR they will correct the description.  If the product is retained with a different description on the AMAZON website, I encourage future purchasers to consider looking elsewhere if you desire a 100% NATURAL bristle KABUKI brush, as do I!</li>
            <li> I am not a make up pro person, i only wanna buy this so i can use it for my baby. putting baby powder on my baby&#x27;s bottom etc. (can not use it yet though, deliver in october ) xD i love the feeling it gives on my face .. very soft!!! i was kind of scare to buy this but when i receive it i want moreeee!! xD</li>
            <li> I wanted a large-ish buki brush but soft enough for my finishing powder and sensitive face.  The hairs are super soft and there is no problem in cleaning the brush</li>
            <li> This brush is nice and soft and applies make up well.  It works wonderfully for applying powdered foundations.  This is a great brush for anyone who wants the nicest make up tools and accessories.</li>
            <li> Softest brush i&#x27;ve ever laid my hands on. Great for powder or bronzer! I&#x27;ve spent over $200 on make up brushes from sephora. Trust me when i say, You are getting an amazing deal on this brush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush for a powder or blush but the bristles could have been a little stronger.but it&#x27;s nice and soft andnfor that price it&#x27;s exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> doesnt shed, works really well, i love how big it is. really helps with my blending. i love it, its great quality</li>
            <li> Its very soft and nice, but way too wide of a brush. Its useful for after shine mineral make-up. as for regular mineral make up, didnt find it useful bc its way to soft and big for the make up to really cover your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for me its was useless, bc i was looking for something smaller, a more confined kabuki brush, thats why i gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> very rarely am i so pleasantly surprised with an item! soft and works well - NICE brush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. Im more than pleased especially for the price! It&#x27;s thick, and great quality. It doesn&#x27;t/hasn&#x27;t shed in the past 2 weeks even after washing it. I use it for setting my foundation, highlighting, and blending bronzer. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great quality synthetic fluffy brush!</li>
            <li> I need a kabuki In my life, bought this and I am happy with it, it is very soft, a little too soft but I can live with it. I&#x27;m satisfied with this product. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and haven&#x27;t seen any stray hair falling out which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Not a super soft brush like the large black one from elf but this brush is HUGE and Flares and spreads powder in a flash, very evenly and lightly</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and is the perfect size! I haven&#x27;t ever used one this size but I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> When this arrived, the box that the brush came in was halfway open, and smashed in, and there was dust on the brush! Nasty!!!!</li>
            <li> Brush is very, very soft, even after shampooing and cleaning prior to use. Great price for good quality brush with no shedding thus far. Great for powder application.</li>
            <li> A good quality brush. Hasn&#x27;t shed a single hair since I purchased, very soft bristles, and decent sized handle. I love using this to put on my mineral veil finishing powder.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use for my homemade dry shampoo that I made.  The bristles are very soft and the brush is actually pretty big for a kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> this brush is fantastic for makeup application. It is soft and evens out your make up and any flaws on your face</li>
            <li> I actually use this when I&#x27;m drawing, not for make-up, so I cannot rate it that way.  But it&#x27;s perfect for dusting my artwork, travels well and doesn&#x27;t take up much space on my desk.</li>
            <li> This brush is too soft for foundations due to its long hair. I do not really like it</li>
            <li> Awesome product great to have in your purse for that quick touch up in the middle of the day!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for setting foundation, really compact. Bristles are soft and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> So soft and lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t owned any other kabuki brushes, so I don&#x27;t know how to compare it. But this feels great on my skin, and seems to be made well. No hairs have fallen out yet, and it&#x27;s been a couple months.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it does what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to apply powder but it is so big, it gets in in my eyes, so i use it for blush.  Wonderful soft brush that applies evenly.  Next time i&#x27;ll order a smaller one.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT WOULD BUY AGAIN AND RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  Great service from company !</li>
            <li> Love these brush its awesome. Its soft and your powder goes on smooth. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I never used a brush before to apply my foundation. This brush works beautifully!</li>
            <li> Like this product a lot! Only complaint is that the bristles are a little floppy/ flimsy for my liking. I prefer the medium one for my use, but thats my own preference. Problem free purchase with fast arrival/ accurate description.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever had a Kabuki brush, so I can&#x27;t say that this is the best one ever. But it&#x27;s very soft and thick, and I think I&#x27;m going to enjoy working with it in the near future</li>
            <li> Brushes are too soft to me.  It&#x27;s also very large and widespread.  If that&#x27;s what you like, then you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality brush for the price. It is extremely soft and I like it for applying mineral foundation and powder. I&#x27;m used to kabukis that have more densely packed bristles. The bristles on this brush are longer than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past and not as dense, so they flex as you apply makeup. I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work for me, but it turns out I really like the brush and would purchase again!</li>
            <li> It was my first time buying make up brushes and while I don&#x27;t use it often I do love it, it&#x27;s soft, easy to wash and use and has a very low price for this sort of item.</li>
            <li> Okay, I LOVE this brush. I originally bought it for using with bronzer on my chest and body when I&#x27;m going out, but I haven&#x27;t been able to use it for that yet since my husband has gotten a hold of it. He literally sits there at night just rubbing it on his face because it feels so good, haha. So if you want a soft brush, this is the one! The bristles are not very dense; and as I mentioned earlier, it would be perfect to use for bronzer or a light dusting of powder for when you don&#x27;t want the makeup too compact on the brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good brush. full, doesn&#x27;t shed even after washing</li>
            <li> Good product.  Daughter loves this brush</li>
            <li> Great brush at a very reasonable price.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Bristles are good quality.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This brush feels amazing and it is super soft, I love it! Feels high end! Well worth the price, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it&#x27;s a fantastic brush.&lt;br /&gt;I have used many brushes and none compare to this one.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I would order from this company again. I received the brush in just a matter of days.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s way soft and just the perfect size.</li>
            <li> ok, so I bought the smaller brush and used it first and I&#x27;m thinking it probably won&#x27;t be as nice but I was wrong. This is just as amazing as the smaller brush it&#x27;s just larger. Great brush for the price.</li>
            <li> The thing I love the most about this brush is that It Does Not Shed! I&#x27;ve bought others and they&#x27;ve all shed all over my face. The size of this brush is also perfect for me. It blends wonderfully, and it&#x27;s so soft. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better Kabuki Brush!</li>
            <li> very soft bristles and gentle...use it for overall face application of powdered makeup...have had for more than six months and no bristles have come out yet...the two other brands I bought (one was Revlon the other I don&#x27;t remember) started loosing bristles early on</li>
            <li> The brush was way to soft</li>
            <li> This brush is larger than the average \\&quot;large\\&quot; brush and has a flat head, which I like.  Something labeled as a bronzer brush that is stiff and angled or tapered to target one area is actually a blush brush.  A bronzer brush is supposed to create a natural glow on the parts of your face that would get sun, which is easier with a large, fluffy brush with a flat head.  There is a more expensive one on Amazon in the 50 dollar range which I assume is wonderful, but I am happy with the value here.  Also, like someone else wrote, these bristles appear to be synthetic, which is fine (better).</li>
            <li> This fluffy powder brush is super soft and feels great on your face. It picks up powders really well and applies it evenly over the face. I have been using it everyday since I got it, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this brush! It&#x27;s soft, but not too soft. It&#x27;s big, but not too big. It works really well for applying my mineral powder compact that I got from Honey Bee Gardens. :)</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. It is so very soft. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hang on&amp;#34; to my foundation like some brushes, Therefore it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy and remains so soft. It doesn&#x27;t shed it&#x27;s bristles like some brushes I&#x27;ve used; which is a much added bonus.</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush disappointed me. It may work well for removing excess powder from your face, but is too soft for foundation or caked powder application...</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this incredible Kabuki brush!!  I wanted something really large to use for my finishing powder but didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune.  I absolutely LOVE this brush!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for four days now and not a single bristle has fallen out and it hasn&#x27;t got \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; at all.  Impressive.</li>
            <li> Prefect little brush!</li>
            <li> First of all the shipping is fantastic. It came in 2 days which I was not expecting. The brush is a nice size and fits into your hand nicely. It is very soft and feels nice but the bristles were bent when I opened the box. Not a big deal I guess. It will do the job nicely for an inexpensive brush just be careful when cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. After purchasing this at the price of 11.00 I received my bamk statement and was actually charged &amp;16.95 plus shipping. I can buy a very nice kabuki at target for the same price without shipping. I don&#x27;t understand how they can charge you more then the price advertised</li>
            <li> Because it  work great&lt;br /&gt;If it work I will like it&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to my friends and my family</li>
            <li> I like the price and i am enjoying it.My first kabuki Brush,it seems to serving its purpose.I will probably try other products from this line.</li>
            <li> bristles fall out after first use</li>
            <li> I love the softness of the bristles. Soooooo soft!works great with browner and I now use every day in winter. All over face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li> my favorite brush ever! has been my go to for my powder application!</li>
