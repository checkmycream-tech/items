            <li>I am having the best shaves of my life.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;10/10 would recommend :D</li>
            <li>I bought this to shave my legs and armpits and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>So, done deal, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!!</li>
            <li>being said, this is a very good razor.</li>
            <li>Absolutely an incredible device for the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is a great value for money along with great functionality!!</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>Do they give a great shave?  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good price, and a great shave.  </li>
            <li>these Weishi shavers and me are becoming best pals.  </li>
            <li>Good affordable DE razor.</li>
            <li>Some may complain that it isn&#x27;t \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot;, but when dealing with something designed to cut your whiskers consider that a good thing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a good value.  </li>
            <li>I threw away the blades that come with this razor and bought good quality blades, but still doesn&#x27;t shave well.</li>
            <li>good weight  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has good heft to it (people find it lighter when compared to the vintage Gillette razors;however, by itself</li>
            <li>its the best shaver ive gotten so far .. great for the price ..</li>
            <li>I love these Weishi razors!</li>
            <li>I love this razor!</li>
            <li>Shaves nice.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even liked these razors, I just wanted to try but ended loving it.</li>
            <li>Do not let the price point scare you away, this is a good purchase. :)</li>
            <li>excellent product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Is under fifteen dollars sound good to gingerly try it out?  </li>
            <li>In fact with blades from Dollar General it did great!  </li>
            <li>This is a DE razor for those with a very light beard.</li>
            <li>Love it.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>they tell us on TV that the more blades the better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this single-bladed ancient-design razor 3 days, and never had a better shave.  </li>
            <li>It opens up via a screw in the bottom, and the top automatically opens like a butterfly.</li>
            <li>I like Amazon&#x27;s detailed descriptions and reviews over the sketchy listings on the popular auction site, and that&#x27;s why.</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34; shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Couple of months later and still very happy.</li>
            <li>Really respectable looking, though I do believe the people who got defective ones, too.</li>
            <li>Most vintage Gillettes are nickle plated brass, nothing to rust.</li>
            <li>Dorco is generally my favorite</li>
            <li>The Weishi is just beautiful to behold, nicely machined and weighted, and heavily chrome-plated.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap and reliable.</li>
            <li>And this one is particularly cheap up front.  </li>
            <li>Close, comfortable shaves, and with the 100 pack of blades I bought</li>
            <li>great beginner razor especially for the price</li>
            <li>If you want a great shave that compares to a standard Gillette this should be the razor for you.  </li>
            <li>Being 77 years old, it was great to go back to the time I enjoyed shaving the most.</li>
            <li>First of all, before you buy one of these Gillette copycats make sure the manufacturer put their name on it.</li>
            <li>It does have a sweet spot.</li>
            <li>(I know, I&#x27;m supposed to get a brush and soap for the full effect, but</li>
            <li>like I said - tryout), and I&#x27;m getting a very close, easy and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>My husband says, &amp;#34;This works as well as my 1954 Gillette Super Speed safety razor.</li>
            <li>for shaving, it&#x27;s just another mild Weishi in chrome.  </li>
            <li>but it seems like Astra does better in this particular razor.</li>
            <li>It is a very forgiving shaver yet leaves my skin \\&quot;smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.\\</li>
            <li>Are DE razors cheap and environmentally responsible?  </li>
            <li>I currently own one Super Speed and two adjustables, all of which are over forty years old, and all are almost like new.</li>
            <li>I have experienced no nicks, burns or skin irritation, and my first Feather blade is still sharp after daily use for a full week!  </li>
            <li>Someday, I&#x27;ll find a vintage safety razor at a flea market and replace this with a machined, tank-like classic, but this was a cheap and simple way to try it out, and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the product and</li>
            <li>I have a few more models of this razor, although they cost a bit more.</li>
            <li>Worked great for 2 weeks, then the twist function to open doors for blade quit working--almost like the internal gear was stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My shavers live in two of those ceramic dollar store toothbrush holders, so nothing against the box, but  if you try to travel with razor blades as a carry-on item, the friendly airport TSA people will confiscate them, anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little heavy, which is perfect for a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First thing I need to get off my chest: ditch the blade that&#x27;s included with the razor.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and its getting easier to use</li>
            <li>First safety razor I have owned.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m shaving with moderate care, and it&#x27;s easy and maybe even fun.  </li>
            <li>but so far this razor has been giving me great shaves and less nicks than some others i have in rotation.  </li>
            <li>I easily get a full week of shaves out of a single blade</li>
            <li>It is heavy in your hand, which is good because i don&#x27;t have to put much pressure when shaving.</li>
            <li>, I expect to update this later, but the first couple of shaves left me with a clean cut, no nicks, and a smooth face.  </li>
            <li>so I would recommend it to anyone who wants to try out a safety razor without investing too much into a razor.</li>
            <li>Even on the side of mine that the blade stuck out on more, the shave was not very aggressive.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, they are very close with the exception of the adjustable head.</li>
            <li>No steel is completely stainless so don&#x27;t expect this to be an heirloom.</li>
            <li>Ive purchased a few of these also as gifts and so far the recipients have loved them.  </li>
            <li>One of my first Gillettes was between seventy and eighty years old yet it shaved</li>
            <li>best part is, it is impossible to permanently clog this type of razor.  </li>
            <li>This inexpensive razor utilizes the twist-to-open mechanics of Gillette&#x27;s classic Super-Speed razors.</li>
            <li>That being said, the shave I get from this razor is very similar to that of my 60&#x27;s model Gillette Super Speed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anybody wanting a DE razor without breaking your wallet.</li>
            <li>It gives a close comfortable shave with the commonly used DE blades such as Derby, Personna or even the easily available Wilkinson sword from Walmart.</li>
            <li>Almost exactly two years later, I can&#x27;t find a reason to change.  </li>
            <li>First Shave Review, expect it to be updated later!  </li>
            <li>As such, my pinky finger doesn&#x27;t even touch this thing in use.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the mechanism is smooth and stays closed in use.  </li>
            <li>So far it shows no tendency to clog anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far as I can tell, this is the 9306-E without the box.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of my old Gillette Speed Razor.  </li>
            <li>the blade was closer to the bar on the right a further away on the left.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve checked out a few different brands, and none have the side pieces affixed to the cross bar by pressure fitting, like this seems to be.</li>
            <li>: Nearly three years later, I have not felt a need to upgrade.  </li>
            <li>After reading other people&#x27;s DER reviews, I decided to order the Weishi classic and a pack of Feather blades, reputed to be world&#x27;s sharpest.  </li>
            <li>it would be a decent product if it wasn&#x27;t designed to be a precision device holding a razor sharp blade next to your face!  </li>

            <li> handle is short, thats the main negative</li>
            <li> As I recall, someone complained it isn&#x27;t very aggressive.</li>
            <li> Until recently, I was using one of the mega-priced, multi-blade techno-toy wet shavers with the overzealous lubrication strips and pricey cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know yet how it will perform long term</li>
            <li> the caused the blade to bow in the middle, and the other side door didn&#x27;t close evenly so on that side</li>
            <li> The included blade was pretty worthless, and quickly replaced with the Lord brand ones that Amazon sells.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure how long the finish and mechanical parts will last yet, time will tell.....</li>
            <li> The other thing I want to comment on is the mildness of this razor.</li>
            <li> to double or triple pass the blade over those tough hairs under my chin with minimal re-lathering, so</li>
            <li> Slightly less aggressive.</li>
            <li> So, once you knock that down (may take a little patience)</li>
            <li> But this is not true.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a bit nervous for the day I cut myself, but that&#x27;s not unique to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely feels like something dangerous with which you could cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> I gave my son a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Buy a small sample pack and see which brand of those works for you.</li>
            <li> Accepting that it is an Asian brand, but it is small and a bit awkward till you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> It comes with 1 blade to mess around with, but I bought another brand to refill it since I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> While its not the adjustable like the Gillette it did not give any worse shave than the Gillette.  </li>
            <li> Using some Astra blades, which I basically selected at random.  </li>
            <li> It was always bad disposables or the occasion pack of expensive cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li> Are you still nervous that it&#x27;ll be uncomfortable or cause horrific injury?  </li>
            <li> Besides I already have a box from one of those insulting N**jie shavers</li>

            <li> First thing I need to get off my chest: ditch the blade that&#x27;s included with the razor. I nicked myself every time until I bought a pack of Derby razor blades.    Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and its getting easier to use so I would recommend it to anyone who wants to try out a safety razor without investing too much into a razor.</li>
            <li> Good affordable DE razor. Highly recommend to anybody wanting a DE razor without breaking your wallet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned plenty of safety razors, from single-edged Gems to Gillette techs and super-speeds. This inexpensive razor utilizes the twist-to-open mechanics of Gillette&#x27;s classic Super-Speed razors. Some may complain that it isn&#x27;t \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot;, but when dealing with something designed to cut your whiskers consider that a good thing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe: the twist-to-open knob on the bottom can loosen whilst shaving if you tend to rest the bulk of the razor on your pinky finger.</li>
            <li> This was a good value.  The included blade was pretty worthless, and quickly replaced with the Lord brand ones that Amazon sells.  My only gripe about the razor itself would be that it is really tiny.  Accepting that it is an Asian brand, but it is small and a bit awkward till you get used to it.  I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; and wear XL size gloves with a size 13 ring finger.  As such, my pinky finger doesn&#x27;t even touch this thing in use.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the mechanism is smooth and stays closed in use.  It is serviceable.</li>
            <li> Blade not centered in head. A manufacturing problem I imagine and someone else may never have this issue. The other thing I want to comment on is the mildness of this razor. Even on the side of mine that the blade stuck out on more, the shave was not very aggressive. This is a DE razor for those with a very light beard.</li>
            <li> Until recently, I was using one of the mega-priced, multi-blade techno-toy wet shavers with the overzealous lubrication strips and pricey cartridges.  After reading other people&#x27;s DER reviews, I decided to order the Weishi classic and a pack of Feather blades, reputed to be world&#x27;s sharpest.  I am having the best shaves of my life.  The Weishi is just beautiful to behold, nicely machined and weighted, and heavily chrome-plated.  It is a very forgiving shaver yet leaves my skin \\&quot;smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.\\&quot;  I have experienced no nicks, burns or skin irritation, and my first Feather blade is still sharp after daily use for a full week!  Where has this razor been all my life?  Weishi is a first-class ride.</li>
            <li> Absolutely an incredible device for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 30s and had I&#x27;d never touched one of these in my life.  It was always bad disposables or the occasion pack of expensive cartridge razors.  Soon the cartridges will be up to 5, 6 7, 8, 9 blades, oh goody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So they tell us on TV that the more blades the better.  But this is not true.  I&#x27;ve had this single-bladed ancient-design razor 3 days, and never had a better shave.  It absolutely feels like something dangerous with which you could cut yourself.  Maybe that&#x27;s part of the point.  As it happens, I have not cut myself with it yet.  Using some Astra blades, which I basically selected at random.  100 for $11.  Works great.  No trick to it, just use lots of lather or cream and be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is, it is impossible to permanently clog this type of razor.  If it were to get clogged, you&#x27;d just twist the handle and pop the blade out, rinse, put it back.  So far it shows no tendency to clog anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe those people on TV lied to me just to sell me $14 packs of 8 cartridges!</li>
            <li> I threw away the blades that come with this razor and bought good quality blades, but still doesn&#x27;t shave well.</li>
            <li> it would be a decent product if it wasn&#x27;t designed to be a precision device holding a razor sharp blade next to your face!  the unit i received had a defect on one of the doors the caused the blade to bow in the middle, and the other side door didn&#x27;t close evenly so on that side the blade was closer to the bar on the right a further away on the left.</li>
            <li> First safety razor I have owned. It is cheap and reliable. Blade holds straight and firm. Shaves nice. I used it with feather blades.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I didn&#x27;t even liked these razors, I just wanted to try but ended loving it. It&#x27;s a little heavy, which is perfect for a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would recommend :D</li>
            <li> it works well.. its the best shaver ive gotten so far .. great for the price .. good weight  for an inexpensive razor</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my legs. It opens up via a screw in the bottom, and the top automatically opens like a butterfly. It is heavy in your hand, which is good because i don&#x27;t have to put much pressure when shaving. I bought this to shave my legs and armpits and it works wonderfully! It comes with 1 blade to mess around with, but I bought another brand to refill it since I was not impressed. Do not let the price point scare you away, this is a good purchase. :)&lt;br /&gt;Where you should &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; and do your research should be in the blades. Buy a small sample pack and see which brand of those works for you.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has good heft to it (people find it lighter when compared to the vintage Gillette razors;however, by itself, Weishi has a enough weight). It gives a close comfortable shave with the commonly used DE blades such as Derby, Personna or even the easily available Wilkinson sword from Walmart. It does have a sweet spot.So, once you knock that down (may take a little patience), it&#x27;s a terrific razor!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great value for money along with great functionality!!</li>
            <li> So far as I can tell, this is the 9306-E without the box.  My shavers live in two of those ceramic dollar store toothbrush holders, so nothing against the box, but  if you try to travel with razor blades as a carry-on item, the friendly airport TSA people will confiscate them, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shine on this shaver is almost blinding.  Sometimes I just take a moment to transfix my gaze on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for shaving, it&#x27;s just another mild Weishi in chrome.  I&#x27;ve learned to double or triple pass the blade over those tough hairs under my chin with minimal re-lathering, so these Weishi shavers and me are becoming best pals.  Razor cuts always seem to be connected to a lapse in concentration, no matter what the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the lower cost rather than the case.  Besides I already have a box from one of those insulting N**jie shavers I made the error of procuring a while back.  I like Amazon&#x27;s detailed descriptions and reviews over the sketchy listings on the popular auction site, and that&#x27;s why.</li>
            <li> Being 77 years old, it was great to go back to the time I enjoyed shaving the most. Thanks for offering this &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34; shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li> Are DE razors cheap and environmentally responsible?  Yes.  And this one is particularly cheap up front.  Do they give a great shave?  Yes, if you believe the internet.  Are you still nervous that it&#x27;ll be uncomfortable or cause horrific injury?  Possibly.  Is under fifteen dollars sound good to gingerly try it out?  Yes.  So, done deal, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.  I bought a 30pk of Derby blades to go with it, used the Trader Joe&#x27;s shave lotion I&#x27;ve been using for years (I know, I&#x27;m supposed to get a brush and soap for the full effect, but like I said - tryout), and I&#x27;m getting a very close, easy and comfortable shave.  I&#x27;m still a bit nervous for the day I cut myself, but that&#x27;s not unique to DE shaving.  So I&#x27;m shaving with moderate care, and it&#x27;s easy and maybe even fun.  Someday, I&#x27;ll find a vintage safety razor at a flea market and replace this with a machined, tank-like classic, but this was a cheap and simple way to try it out, and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the product and results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Couple of months later and still very happy. I easily get a full week of shaves out of a single blade and it&#x27;s very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Almost exactly two years later, I can&#x27;t find a reason to change.  Close, comfortable shaves, and with the 100 pack of blades I bought, I think I still have another year to go before I&#x27;ll need to buy anything for shaving aside from shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Nearly three years later, I have not felt a need to upgrade.  Heck, I haven&#x27;t even had to buy blades, though I think I&#x27;m finally getting low.  I change blades every week (twice as often as I did with cartridge razors) and I&#x27;m still shaving for pennies/month.</li>
            <li> great beginner razor especially for the price</li>
            <li> handle is short, thats the main negative</li>
            <li> I paid four dollars for this razor, and am amazed at its quality! I have a few more models of this razor, although they cost a bit more. I love these Weishi razors!</li>
            <li> I love this razor! It reminds me of my old Gillette Speed Razor.  Im not sure how long the finish and mechanical parts will last yet, time will tell.....but so far this razor has been giving me great shaves and less nicks than some others i have in rotation.  Ive purchased a few of these also as gifts and so far the recipients have loved them.  For such an inexpensive price, give it a try!!!</li>
            <li> CONSTANTLY  JAMS WHEN OPENING OR CLOSING AFTER SITTING FOR A DAY... NEED PLIERS TO OPEN&lt;br /&gt;EVEN AFTER OILING.</li>
            <li> Really respectable looking, though I do believe the people who got defective ones, too. I&#x27;ve checked out a few different brands, and none have the side pieces affixed to the cross bar by pressure fitting, like this seems to be. I expect eventual self-destruction, aided by occasional dropping. Shaves like all the rest.</li>
            <li> Worked great for 2 weeks, then the twist function to open doors for blade quit working--almost like the internal gear was stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very disppointed.</li>
            <li> First Shave Review, expect it to be updated later!  I bought this to replace my grandfathers 1962 Gillete (shown in the photos below) which has been in continuous use since 1962 (received it after he passed).  While its not the adjustable like the Gillette it did not give any worse shave than the Gillette.  In fact with blades from Dollar General it did great!  If you want a great shave that compares to a standard Gillette this should be the razor for you.  Good price, and a great shave.  I don&#x27;t know yet how it will perform long term, I expect to update this later, but the first couple of shaves left me with a clean cut, no nicks, and a smooth face.  I have attached some photos for you to see the difference between the 1962 model Gillette &amp;#34;Slim&amp;#34; of my grandfathers and the Weishi 9306-H, they are very close with the exception of the adjustable head.</li>
            <li> excellent product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> First of all, before you buy one of these Gillette copycats make sure the manufacturer put their name on it. My last venture into this category got me a glorified paint scraper. That being said, the shave I get from this razor is very similar to that of my 60&#x27;s model Gillette Super Speed. As I recall, someone complained it isn&#x27;t very aggressive. I don&#x27;t know what it was being compared to, but it is very similar to my Gillette in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this shaves comparably with a Gillette, it isn&#x27;t one. No steel is completely stainless so don&#x27;t expect this to be an heirloom. Most vintage Gillettes are nickle plated brass, nothing to rust. Ever. I currently own one Super Speed and two adjustables, all of which are over forty years old, and all are almost like new. One of my first Gillettes was between seventy and eighty years old yet it shaved great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is a very good razor. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Even if you plan to buy a Gillette or Merkur I&#x27;d still recommend one of these to carry on trips, or for when your teenager spends a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with a Dorco blade. Dorco is generally my favorite but it seems like Astra does better in this particular razor. I&#x27;m thinking Personna would work in it equally well since they worked in the plastic Weishi I gave my son a few years ago.</li>
