            <li>I was very pleased when i received my order.</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>To fully stop the acid peel I like to use a warm solution of water and baking soda as a neutralizer.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results of the peel.</li>
            <li>I bought the product thinking it would at be effective in getting rid of excess oil.</li>
            <li>I kind of want to find something stronger, since I tolerate this so well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be a good outcome though.</li>
            <li>I also liked the gel consistency.</li>
            <li>Its cheap and very effective.</li>
            <li>i started out with huge blotches of redness on my cheeks, i tried fading creams and what not, but they didn&#x27;t seem to do anything, so i decided to give this peel a try since it states that its very effective against hyper-pigmentation, and it sure as well was.</li>
            <li>I look young anyway, but this really impressed me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it was working till my best friend saw me after I had began treatment and was like WOW your acne scars are gone.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had more than 1 pimple since using this.</li>

            <li>Can you say winning?</li>
            <li>Ended up with more acne instead.</li>
            <li>Also, DO NOT exfoliate before or after using this, as it can tear your skin and make it much more</li>
            <li>It did nothing more then create alittle brightness which I was getting from lower formula.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT MUST NOT BE USED MORE THAN ONCE</li>
            <li>If the problems are light - use this - it works!</li>
            <li>I love these peels.</li>
            <li>you are use to 35% GA, you should be okay</li>
            <li>50 stings way more on my face</li>
            <li>I like it better.</li>
            <li>This peel is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have given some good tips and I will be another voice in the chorus that says what a great product and results this has given me.</li>
            <li>The 3rd day after each peel I could see incredible results.</li>
            <li>You can easily do 10 applications with this 30 ml peel.</li>
            <li>Received it very quickly...</li>
            <li>but it was so easy.</li>
            <li>My skin tone evened out and the fine lines and wrinkles diminished some.</li>
            <li>Fine lines and some dryness.</li>
            <li>I have medium to light skin.</li>
            <li>26 Dollars is ridiculously cheap.</li>
            <li>My skin is much improved with the use of these peels but you have to wear sunscreen and eat well to maintain nice skin.</li>
            <li>face feels really smooth all week</li>
            <li>I have used 20% glyclic acid for years for my acne with good but modest results.</li>
            <li>just make SURE that you use a moisturizer right after the peel, because then your skin may start to peel, and get irritated</li>
            <li>Most of my face is fine with the 50%, but certain areas (nose, cheekbones, and under-eye/crowsfeet areas) are easily burned by it.</li>
            <li>originally bought this to use on a surgery scar on my body with hopes of lessening the scar&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li>to this product: it is a gel, and not watery as I expected, but this is actually good, as you can control it better.</li>
            <li>I plan to stop for a while to see how long this lasts, but for having my skin look great and youthful, this is worth each of the five stars.look</li>
            <li>I plan to stop for a while to see how long this lasts, but for having my skin look great and youthful, this is worth each of the five stars.</li>
            <li>I will update once I reach 6 weeks of treatment and the full 4minute application.</li>
            <li>It fades my fine lines and makes my skin and make up look much clearer and make up goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>but three times, its effects may be more obvious with more use over time.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly and have been using the product weekly for about 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>The coconut goes on oily, but absorbs quickly and does not clog my pores at all.</li>
            <li>The lines and spots come back quickly!!!</li>
            <li>My skin is very fair with freckles(red hair skin), and I had age spots, large pores, some old acne scars, general roughness, and some lines.</li>
            <li>but I am confident that it is just strong enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>its a well worth buy if you got redness issues,</li>
            <li>A bit of history about my skin situation: I&#x27;m a mountain biker, 34 years old, and the many hours in the sun has taken its toll.</li>
            <li>The product is right for my skin.</li>
            <li>BUT, this has really made my skin much smoother, helped clean out my pores and keep them clean, softened my skin...</li>
            <li>my package arrived this morning, and I did the first peel right away.</li>
            <li>I would really like my old acne scars with lighten more</li>
            <li>I would not leave it on long if you are very sensitive skin or fair skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear, smooth, less oily and just looks good.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly but didn&#x27;t experience any noticeable benefits.</li>
            <li>After the first reatment, no burning or redness, just smoother skin.</li>
            <li>used the lactic acid first and then followed with the 50% glycolic.</li>
            <li>I should have maybe purchased it in a higher acidic formula, as this one is just alright.</li>
            <li>TOO MUCH!</li>
            <li>You can really feel it working!</li>
            <li>I will have to use the product for some more time to say definitely, though.</li>
            <li>have only seen my skin get better, since using these products.  </li>
            <li>As it was my first at home peel, I did not leave it on longer than 5 minutes, as I wanted to first get a feeling for the product.</li>
            <li>Yes it tingles and burns but tolerable, but I following the instructions, using once a week and increasing my time each week up to 4 minutes as I build more tolerance to the feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only done two peels using this so far (also used a lactic peel before the glycolic), but my skin already looks a 100 times better!</li>
            <li>I abuse my skin all summer, so I was ready to reveal smooth, soft skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this about 4 times now and have noticed a smoother quality to my skin along with my pores becoming smaller.  </li>
            <li>You should really do an evaluation with a dermatologist first, and then decide what you want to do if you have real problems with the skin.</li>
            <li>I had used Ponds Rejuveness for 4 months prior with amazing results, so this was to further that experience as It had glycolic acid.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I am very acne prone, but using this in addition to Retin-A as per the advice of an aesthetician has really cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li>Really and can tell that my skin is not what it use to be.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see anything noticeable on the first time i did the peel, only that my cheeks were now smooth and real soft</li>
            <li>Plus, if you do have a breakout, it really helps speed along the healing process.  </li>
            <li>I use this once a week and really notice the results.</li>
            <li>So far for the price and the results, it is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Then you&#x27;ll know how your skin might react to it ( \\&quot;might\\&quot; because your face skin is more sensitive, so it may be different on your face).      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked up to about 7 minutes on and it definitely itches in the more sensitive areas like around the nose.  </li>
            <li>Start out slow and follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It burns (like a very strong tingle?)  just like the 35%, but it comes on faster and needs less time on my skin.</li>
            <li>The scars are much much much fainter, my skin is less oily and it is more even colored.</li>
            <li>i left the peel on for about 8mins before washing it off ( it will sting and make you wanna scratch your face off due to the itching, but its well worth it afterwords :) )</li>
            <li>I had ordered the 35% previously and was pleased with results</li>
            <li>The consistency was a little more liquidity than the 35% as well.  </li>
            <li>The cut burned and as the skin was broken, I should have waited for the cut to heal, but I&#x27;m not that bright.</li>
            <li>Wow...this took some getting used to as I am a redhead with sensitive skin, but I have really noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and the radiance...</li>
            <li>What I have discovered is that much depends on the amount of \\&quot;free acid\\&quot; in a product, and this product must have even less free acid than the other 20% that I was using.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the 50% because I have a high tolerance after having so many done in the past.  </li>
            <li>w/ my skin started to escalate, I searched for something new.  </li>
            <li>I live in Cape Town South Africa, and I am Coloured, which basically means I have a brownish complexion.</li>
            <li>I only switched to the higher concentration as I seemed to get used to the 35% and wanted to try the stronger product.  </li>
            <li>and I have no blemishes (I usually don&#x27;t get many blemishes anyway,</li>
            <li>as that&#x27;s the whole point and FOR ME, lets me know it works -- even though peeling is pretty gross overall.  </li>
            <li>i am so glad i turned to this product as my last resort, but if i only i knew about it sooner, i would&#x27;ve saved myself alot of money from those cheap uneffective facial creams on stores :/  </li>
            <li>Although nowhere near surgical results, for the price...a mini face re-surfacing.</li>
            <li>Glycolic Acid 35% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]]</li>
            <li>young anyway,</li>
            <li>I would say that the glycolic peel is much stronger than the lactic peel, so if you&#x27;ve never used glycolic before, I would suggest starting out with 20% or 30%.</li>
            <li>Which is not recommended for sensitive skin or a novice...</li>
            <li>I began with 50%, my skin tolerates it well so far.</li>
            <li>and I am 44 yrs old.</li>
            <li>Will deinitely buy more, but this little bottle lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are diminished, large pores have shrank, and I look at least a year younger.  </li>
            <li>I tried my second peel 6 days later and it didn&#x27;t hurt as much but was still itchy.</li>
            <li>Use common sense and follow the directions and everything should be fine.</li>
            <li>After the peel I use JoJoba oil and a little shea butter to calm the skin.</li>
            <li>after just a little over a week, they are fading and healing, and my skin feel so fresh.</li>
            <li>I have combo to oily skin, I&#x27;m 30 years old and still get the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had a chance to try this product once, but so far it seems to be helping my skin.  </li>
            <li>I did feel it sting, but really not even as much as the 20% peel I received from the derma.</li>
            <li>I am not still sure that the prescription medication I was using before trying this is worse.</li>
            <li>My recent face explosion and marks, formed before starting GA peels, are quickly fading, but of course not fast enough.</li>
            <li>After removing the peel and drying my face, it was tight again, just like the first peel.</li>
            <li>We are all different and have different skin, but I have a medium complexion and my skin tends to be on the sensitive side.</li>
            <li>We are all different and have different skin, but I have a medium complexion and my skin tends to be on the sensitive side.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth now, pores so much smaller, NO acne scars, and all the age spots are gone except one very small area that is going away.</li>
            <li>I feel like it really takes the sting out of the peel too and calms my skin down.</li>
            <li>There is a slight difference in my skin tone, but not as much as I would like, and got from the dermatologist</li>
            <li>Also, I would definitely not use more than once in a 7-10 day time frame, since peels can thin your skin and cause long term damage if abused.</li>

            <li> but I am confident that it is just strong enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> its a well worth buy if you got redness issues,</li>
            <li> A bit of history about my skin situation: I&#x27;m a mountain biker, 34 years old, and the many hours in the sun has taken its toll.</li>
            <li> The product is right for my skin.</li>
            <li> BUT, this has really made my skin much smoother, helped clean out my pores and keep them clean, softened my skin...</li>
            <li> my package arrived this morning, and I did the first peel right away.</li>
            <li> I would really like my old acne scars with lighten more</li>
            <li> I would not leave it on long if you are very sensitive skin or fair skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear, smooth, less oily and just looks good.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly but didn&#x27;t experience any noticeable benefits.</li>
            <li> After the first reatment, no burning or redness, just smoother skin.</li>
            <li> used the lactic acid first and then followed with the 50% glycolic.</li>
            <li> I should have maybe purchased it in a higher acidic formula, as this one is just alright.</li>
            <li> TOO MUCH!</li>
            <li> You can really feel it working!</li>
            <li> I will have to use the product for some more time to say definitely, though.</li>
            <li> have only seen my skin get better, since using these products.  </li>
            <li> As it was my first at home peel, I did not leave it on longer than 5 minutes, as I wanted to first get a feeling for the product.</li>
            <li> Yes it tingles and burns but tolerable, but I following the instructions, using once a week and increasing my time each week up to 4 minutes as I build more tolerance to the feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done two peels using this so far (also used a lactic peel before the glycolic), but my skin already looks a 100 times better!</li>
            <li> I abuse my skin all summer, so I was ready to reveal smooth, soft skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this about 4 times now and have noticed a smoother quality to my skin along with my pores becoming smaller.  </li>
            <li> You should really do an evaluation with a dermatologist first, and then decide what you want to do if you have real problems with the skin.</li>
            <li> I had used Ponds Rejuveness for 4 months prior with amazing results, so this was to further that experience as It had glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I am very acne prone, but using this in addition to Retin-A as per the advice of an aesthetician has really cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li> Really and can tell that my skin is not what it use to be.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see anything noticeable on the first time i did the peel, only that my cheeks were now smooth and real soft</li>
            <li> Plus, if you do have a breakout, it really helps speed along the healing process.  </li>
            <li> I use this once a week and really notice the results.</li>
            <li> So far for the price and the results, it is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Then you&#x27;ll know how your skin might react to it ( \\&quot;might\\&quot; because your face skin is more sensitive, so it may be different on your face).      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked up to about 7 minutes on and it definitely itches in the more sensitive areas like around the nose.  </li>
            <li> Start out slow and follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It burns (like a very strong tingle?)  just like the 35%, but it comes on faster and needs less time on my skin.</li>
            <li> The scars are much much much fainter, my skin is less oily and it is more even colored.</li>
            <li> i left the peel on for about 8mins before washing it off ( it will sting and make you wanna scratch your face off due to the itching, but its well worth it afterwords :) )</li>
            <li> I had ordered the 35% previously and was pleased with results</li>
            <li> The consistency was a little more liquidity than the 35% as well.  </li>
            <li> The cut burned and as the skin was broken, I should have waited for the cut to heal, but I&#x27;m not that bright.</li>
            <li> Wow...this took some getting used to as I am a redhead with sensitive skin, but I have really noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and the radiance...</li>
            <li> What I have discovered is that much depends on the amount of \\&quot;free acid\\&quot; in a product, and this product must have even less free acid than the other 20% that I was using.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the 50% because I have a high tolerance after having so many done in the past.  </li>
            <li> w/ my skin started to escalate, I searched for something new.  </li>
            <li> I live in Cape Town South Africa, and I am Coloured, which basically means I have a brownish complexion.</li>
            <li> I only switched to the higher concentration as I seemed to get used to the 35% and wanted to try the stronger product.  </li>
            <li> and I have no blemishes (I usually don&#x27;t get many blemishes anyway,</li>
            <li> as that&#x27;s the whole point and FOR ME, lets me know it works -- even though peeling is pretty gross overall.  </li>
            <li> i am so glad i turned to this product as my last resort, but if i only i knew about it sooner, i would&#x27;ve saved myself alot of money from those cheap uneffective facial creams on stores :/  </li>
            <li> Although nowhere near surgical results, for the price...a mini face re-surfacing.</li>
            <li> Glycolic Acid 35% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]]</li>
            <li> young anyway,</li>
            <li> I would say that the glycolic peel is much stronger than the lactic peel, so if you&#x27;ve never used glycolic before, I would suggest starting out with 20% or 30%.</li>
            <li> Which is not recommended for sensitive skin or a novice...</li>
            <li> I began with 50%, my skin tolerates it well so far.</li>
            <li> and I am 44 yrs old.</li>
            <li> Will deinitely buy more, but this little bottle lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are diminished, large pores have shrank, and I look at least a year younger.  </li>
            <li> I tried my second peel 6 days later and it didn&#x27;t hurt as much but was still itchy.</li>
            <li> Use common sense and follow the directions and everything should be fine.</li>
            <li> After the peel I use JoJoba oil and a little shea butter to calm the skin.</li>
            <li> after just a little over a week, they are fading and healing, and my skin feel so fresh.</li>
            <li> I have combo to oily skin, I&#x27;m 30 years old and still get the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a chance to try this product once, but so far it seems to be helping my skin.  </li>
            <li> I did feel it sting, but really not even as much as the 20% peel I received from the derma.</li>
            <li> I am not still sure that the prescription medication I was using before trying this is worse.</li>
            <li> My recent face explosion and marks, formed before starting GA peels, are quickly fading, but of course not fast enough.</li>
            <li> After removing the peel and drying my face, it was tight again, just like the first peel.</li>
            <li> We are all different and have different skin, but I have a medium complexion and my skin tends to be on the sensitive side.</li>
            <li> We are all different and have different skin, but I have a medium complexion and my skin tends to be on the sensitive side.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth now, pores so much smaller, NO acne scars, and all the age spots are gone except one very small area that is going away.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really takes the sting out of the peel too and calms my skin down.</li>
            <li> There is a slight difference in my skin tone, but not as much as I would like, and got from the dermatologist</li>
            <li> Also, I would definitely not use more than once in a 7-10 day time frame, since peels can thin your skin and cause long term damage if abused.</li>
            <li> dont have any unrealistic expectations, just be patient and careful, don&#x27;t overuse or put on for too long, follow the directions, I&#x27;m sure there will be some improvement.</li>
            <li> The first 3-min application hurt a little (it was itchy and a little stingy).</li>
            <li> The next day I continue my regular routine with washing with Black Soap, using Glycolic Toner and following with Glycolic moiserizing face cream.</li>
            <li> I know some might have a little concern that they are professional grade</li>
            <li> And for goodness sake, don&#x27;t leave it on longer than recommended because it&#x27;s hard to gauge how much it&#x27;s doing to your skin until you rinse--</li>
            <li> I have burned myself a couple of times--although not severely--, so be careful with this until you know how it affects your individual skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with hiper pigmentation for a long time now, and have received a couple of glycolic acid treatments from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> The treatments I received did help to some extend, but did not clear the marks up 100%.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also figured out to slather on a thick moisturizer afterwards which really soothes my face.  </li>
            <li> Some of the other reviews were talking about the skin actually peeling or being burned which hasn&#x27;t happened with this to me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely use this product again when I do my next round of peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are or have African American or Black descendants be very careful when using this or any acids/ chemical peels on your skin.</li>
            <li> Other peels have seared my skin and left it a puffy, red mess.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li> The deep creases in my forehead are way less visible.</li>
            <li> I actually felt less tingling w/ the 50% than the 35%.</li>
            <li> in all, I am just glad I did not have a bad reaction to the product, and since I have it now I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> really* burn and temporarily discolor the broken skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent well over $1,000 getting SkinMedica Vitalize Peels -- had 7 done</li>
            <li> no redness and my skin still feels rough.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, peeling was minimal.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of this at first, so I took it with me to get a facial!</li>
            <li> The 50% has done equally well for me as the 35%, I just use it for a little less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the severe burning that I have had with other GA&#x27;s, but still had the results.</li>
            <li> I have used the peel every other day, never exceeding 5 mins.  </li>
            <li> I wait for it to dry and apply a little sunscreen to my face before my make up...</li>
            <li> This one is effective without being brutal.</li>
            <li> the fine scars are seriously faded and are difficult to see.  </li>
            <li> and they worked REALLY WELL -- however too expensive to maintain and the MINUTE</li>
            <li> I am unsure how this affects my skin overall, but I have not had any negative results</li>
            <li> I have not yet had any down time, not redness or visable peeling.</li>
            <li> Even the dark circles under my eyes are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The product did not sting much less peel.</li>
            <li> My skin improved, and I get less breakouts and spots.</li>
            <li> I am black soap to wash my face and a glycolic Toner before appling the peel.</li>
            <li> i tried leaving it on longer and got a little tingling but</li>
            <li> My skin must have gotten a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I continue to use the Ponds everyday and the peel about every 5 to seven days.</li>
            <li> I have used the glycolic acid 50% gel peel quite a few times now.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I had some spots where I had the cut, but they disappeared in few days.</li>
            <li> I had a few spots/scars that just would not go away...</li>
            <li> I have use 35% and decided I needed to bump it up a notch for this round of treatments.</li>
            <li> After the trouble</li>
            <li> Also, be careful not to over exfoliate the forehead, since it already has the least amount of padding on the face.</li>
            <li> I have a few scars on my face that I didn&#x27;t even think of using it on, as they are small and have faded a bit.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t in bad shape before, but the change is enough that my male friends are noticing and asking what I did.</li>
            <li> However, I apply a small amount to a Q-tip to erase the creases under my eyes taking care not to get to close to the eye this stuff will burn,.</li>
            <li> Simply a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using 30% glycolic pads 2-3 times per week for the past two years, so my skin was accustomed to the stinging.</li>
            <li> I peeled on some small parts of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some peels done at a local Spa, but they got to expensive over time</li>
            <li> The treatments became too expensive, and that is why I&#x27;ve decided to buy this product online, to see if I can get the same results if I do it myself at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I may have really tough skin, and might need something a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I have to do two sessions: a longer one for the majority of my face and a shorter one for the delicate areas.</li>
            <li> But, I would still suggest you get it done at a Spa at least twice, just to see how it works</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any negative side effects at all</li>
            <li> I purchased this product approximately one week ago</li>
            <li> and I was feeling skeptical.</li>
            <li> The ill effects of sensitivity &amp; skin thinning will ensue if you misuse them.  </li>
            <li> I tried the 70% Lactic Acid Peel w/ horrible results, possibly due to my inexperience w/ that type of acid.  </li>
            <li> I found it rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> It burned a bit, but nothing bad.</li>
            <li> consider me very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this product approximately one week ago and I already see a vast diffence in the texture, quality, and clarity of my skin. Fine lines are diminished, large pores have shrank, and I look at least a year younger.  If you&#x27;re a mom and you want to look like you did prior to having children this product does the job! It&#x27;s amazing. I will continue to use this product for the next month or two and give you guys an update. This peel is not the strongest home peel but I am confident that it is just strong enough to get the job done. Other peels have seared my skin and left it a puffy, red mess. This one is effective without being brutal. Thumbs up!     Word of Caution: Use as directed. However, I apply a small amount to a Q-tip to erase the creases under my eyes taking care not to get to close to the eye this stuff will burn,. To fully stop the acid peel I like to use a warm solution of water and baking soda as a neutralizer. Its cheap and very effective.</li>
            <li> I obviously didn&#x27;t receive the same product as these ladies who are singing the praises of this peel.  I followed the directions exactly but didn&#x27;t experience any noticeable benefits. I found it rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> This peel is very effective and strong.  A warning, start with a lower percentage until you see how your skin adapts to the different concentrations. I had ordered the 35% previously and was pleased with results so I decided that my skin could handle a stronger dose. My skin is very fair with freckles(red hair skin), and I had age spots, large pores, some old acne scars, general roughness, and some lines. I had used Ponds Rejuveness for 4 months prior with amazing results, so this was to further that experience as It had glycolic acid. I am thrilled with the results of the peel. My skin is so smooth now, pores so much smaller, NO acne scars, and all the age spots are gone except one very small area that is going away. My face looks so much younger..like about ten years! I continue to use the Ponds everyday and the peel about every 5 to seven days. If this keeps up, I will not have to wear any foundation.</li>
            <li> I have used the glycolic acid 50% gel peel quite a few times now. It did not cause my skin to \\&quot;peel\\&quot; like it did when I had a peel done by my dermatologist and I was feeling skeptical. My skin does seem a bit clearer and tighter. I would really like my old acne scars with lighten more but I think I should go with a stronger peel next time.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of this at first, so I took it with me to get a facial! It burned a bit, but nothing bad. After 3 treatments, peope noticed! My skin tone evened out and the fine lines and wrinkles diminished some. Although nowhere near surgical results, for the price...a mini face re-surfacing. Start out slowand gradually increase the time you leave it on. Will deinitely buy more, but this little bottle lasts for a long time. Great product. After the first reatment, no burning or redness, just smoother skin.</li>
            <li> dont have any unrealistic expectations, just be patient and careful, don&#x27;t overuse or put on for too long, follow the directions, I&#x27;m sure there will be some improvement.</li>
            <li> I started off with the [[ASIN:B000PNXBVW Glycolic Acid 35% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]] and it did well.  I only switched to the higher concentration as I seemed to get used to the 35% and wanted to try the stronger product.  The 50% has done equally well for me as the 35%, I just use it for a little less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this to use on a surgery scar on my body with hopes of lessening the scar&#x27;s appearance. I have a few scars on my face that I didn&#x27;t even think of using it on, as they are small and have faded a bit. I&#x27;m just used to them. I have finished the 35% and now I am several uses in using the 50% the fine scars are seriously faded and are difficult to see.  I never thought this would be possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have applied the 50% 4 times in the last month. I left it on longer each time (as I did with the 35%) and I did follow up with lotion, which is necessary, no question. It burns (like a very strong tingle?)  just like the 35%, but it comes on faster and needs less time on my skin. The 35% made an enormous difference in my skin, the 50% is continuing the improvement. The scars are much much much fainter, my skin is less oily and it is more even colored. I wasn&#x27;t in bad shape before, but the change is enough that my male friends are noticing and asking what I did. I have shared this with them and one tried it with good result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the instructions!  Guys, do not use just after shaving or if you have cuts. Ow! Ow! Ow! One time I had a cut from shaving and I used this. The cut burned and as the skin was broken, I should have waited for the cut to heal, but I&#x27;m not that bright. Anyway, I had some spots where I had the cut, but they disappeared in few days. If anyone else has this happen, don&#x27;t freak out. If you have any open skin from a cut or scratch, this will *really* burn and temporarily discolor the broken skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I like to look my best and I can&#x27;t believe how well this works. My skin is clear, smooth, less oily and just looks good. I look young anyway, but this really impressed me. I am not a user of this type of product and never knew something like this even existed. We are all different and have different skin, but I have a medium complexion and my skin tends to be on the sensitive side. I haven&#x27;t had more than 1 pimple since using this. I don&#x27;t get a lot, but more than I had been getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have given some good tips and I will be another voice in the chorus that says what a great product and results this has given me. I plan to stop for a while to see how long this lasts, but for having my skin look great and youthful, this is worth each of the five stars.look young anyway, but this really impressed me.

            <li> At 51 my face was starting to show my age. Crows feet around my eyes, deep ridge wrinkles in my forehead and between my eyebrows. I started with the 35% solution for 6 weeks working my way up to 10 minutes. After my 2nd peel my ex-husband looked at my face and said I looked 10 years younger and wanted to know if I was injecting botox! That&#x27;s how great I looked. The 3rd day after each peel I could see incredible results. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles or lines around my eyes at all anymore. Even the dark circles under my eyes are less noticeable. The deep creases in my forehead are way less visible. This stuff is amazing. Now all my friends and the ladies I work with are doing it. I&#x27;m using the 50% solution now hoping to further reduce the creases in my forehead. There was no peeling or redness with the 35% solution but I do have redness with the 50% solution. It goes away overnight however.</li>
            <li> Love love love. Best of best. Fast delivery. I was very pleased when i received my order. i neutralise with baking soda and water</li>
            <li> Why pay for a chemical which can run $100+ when you can do it at home for cheaper? My sister and I swear by this.  This stuff is amazing. I am very acne prone, but using this in addition to Retin-A as per the advice of an aesthetician has really cleared up my skin. And bonus: it&#x27;s anti-aging as well. Can you say winning?</li>
            <li> Item not as described. Simply a waste of money! Ended up with more acne instead. I bought the product thinking it would at be effective in getting rid of excess oil. The product did not sting much less peel.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS NOT WORD WHAT YOU PAY FOR. THIS 50 PERCENT GLYCOLIC ACID IS LIKE WATER DOES NOTHING FOR YUOR SKIN. PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT,YOU GONE THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY.</li>
            <li> Wow...this took some getting used to as I am a redhead with sensitive skin, but I have really noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and the radiance...I know that since I have not used it but three times, its effects may be more obvious with more use over time. I will purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent well over $1,000 getting SkinMedica Vitalize Peels -- had 7 done and they worked REALLY WELL -- however too expensive to maintain and the MINUTE I went to the Caribbean and DESPITE having SPF 100 on -- the scars came back.  I was told that the sun there is stronger than in the Southeast USA, so that&#x27;s what happened.  REFUSING to start over and spend another $1,000, I&#x27;m trying this.      I ordered the 50% because I have a high tolerance after having so many done in the past.  It definitely burns like it&#x27;s supposed to, so gonna give it a couple of weeks to see what happens.  I HOPE to peel as I did with the salon peels -- as that&#x27;s the whole point and FOR ME, lets me know it works -- even though peeling is pretty gross overall.  LOL    To be continued . . .</li>
            <li> I received it quickly and have been using the product weekly for about 4 weeks. I can&#x27;t see any difference. Maybe I need a stronger one...</li>
            <li> iused this product every two weeks for the last couple months and perceive no change in my skin.  i tried leaving it on longer and got a little tingling but no redness and my skin still feels rough.  consider me very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done two peels using this so far (also used a lactic peel before the glycolic), but my skin already looks a 100 times better! I had a few spots/scars that just would not go away...after just a little over a week, they are fading and healing, and my skin feel so fresh. I would say that the glycolic peel is much stronger than the lactic peel, so if you&#x27;ve never used glycolic before, I would suggest starting out with 20% or 30%. Also, I would definitely not use more than once in a 7-10 day time frame, since peels can thin your skin and cause long term damage if abused. Also, DO NOT exfoliate before or after using this, as it can tear your skin and make it much more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the lactic acid first and then followed with the 50% glycolic. Which is not recommended for sensitive skin or a novice...I&#x27;ve been using 30% glycolic pads 2-3 times per week for the past two years, so my skin was accustomed to the stinging. Start out slow and follow with a good moisturizer. I&#x27;ve recently discovered coconut oil and have been using that after peels. I have combo to oily skin, I&#x27;m 30 years old and still get the occasional breakout. The coconut goes on oily, but absorbs quickly and does not clog my pores at all. I feel like it really takes the sting out of the peel too and calms my skin down. There is a lot of research that says it helps with acne too (google it). Just a suggestion...every person&#x27;s skin is different though. Use common sense and follow the directions and everything should be fine.</li>
            <li> The first 3-min application hurt a little (it was itchy and a little stingy). I noticed my skin felt tighter afterward. I peeled on some small parts of my face. Otherwise, peeling was minimal. Application of some moisturizer hid it. I tried my second peel 6 days later and it didn&#x27;t hurt as much but was still itchy. I left it on for 10 minutes. After removing the peel and drying my face, it was tight again, just like the first peel. This time, there was no peeling at all. My skin must have gotten a little thicker. Who knows. But, it just makes my skin feel tighter and I have no blemishes (I usually don&#x27;t get many blemishes anyway, but my skin tone is even now, no red spots, no irritation spots). I would definitely recommed this as an addition to anyone&#x27;s skin care regimen. I kind of want to find something stronger, since I tolerate this so well.</li>
            <li> Good. This stuff is no joke! I have use 35% and decided I needed to bump it up a notch for this round of treatments. Most of my face is fine with the 50%, but certain areas (nose, cheekbones, and under-eye/crowsfeet areas) are easily burned by it. I have to do two sessions: a longer one for the majority of my face and a shorter one for the delicate areas. I have burned myself a couple of times--although not severely--, so be careful with this until you know how it affects your individual skin. And for goodness sake, don&#x27;t leave it on longer than recommended because it&#x27;s hard to gauge how much it&#x27;s doing to your skin until you rinse--and then it&#x27;s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is prickly while on the skin, but fanning helps. I neutralize by rinsing with water, followed by a bakingsoda &amp; water rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use this product again when I do my next round of peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Remember, skin needs that time off between peel series to recover and rejuvenate.</li>
            <li> This product I have used before in the lower strength. It appears to have similar results as the lower stength. I should have maybe purchased it in a higher acidic formula, as this one is just alright. I would go with the lower acid formula given the option. It did nothing more then create alittle brightness which I was getting from lower formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting up in my age. LOL...Really and can tell that my skin is not what it use to be. Fine lines and some dryness. I have started using this once a week. I&#x27;m 39 and my skin looks much younger. It fades my fine lines and makes my skin and make up look much clearer and make up goes on smooth. I leave it on anywhere form 6 to 9 mins. I would not leave it on long if you are very sensitive skin or fair skin. I have medium to light skin. I feel a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some peels done at a local Spa, but they got to expensive over time and I decided to do it myself. One application with this acid at the Spa I went to costs 150 Dollars. You can easily do 10 applications with this 30 ml peel. That&#x27;s 1500 Dollars you&#x27;d have to pay at my Spa. TOO MUCH! Get this one here instead. 26 Dollars is ridiculously cheap. But, I would still suggest you get it done at a Spa at least twice, just to see how it works so you get a feel for it, and you will know what to expect. Always do a test spot behing your ear or anywhere else. Then you&#x27;ll know how your skin might react to it ( \\&quot;might\\&quot; because your face skin is more sensitive, so it may be different on your face).      ATTENTION: THIS PRODUCT MUST NOT BE USED MORE THAN ONCE (1) A WEEK!!!    I can&#x27;t believe people said on here they would use it every day! No! You will severely damage your skin! It&#x27;s an acid after all. Do not overdo it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this about 4 times now and have noticed a smoother quality to my skin along with my pores becoming smaller.  Some of the other reviews were talking about the skin actually peeling or being burned which hasn&#x27;t happened with this to me.  I&#x27;ve worked up to about 7 minutes on and it definitely itches in the more sensitive areas like around the nose.  I&#x27;ve also figured out to slather on a thick moisturizer afterwards which really soothes my face.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this.</li>
            <li> Received it very quickly... Works really well. Just be careful not to leave it on for too long. You can really feel it working!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a chance to try this product once, but so far it seems to be helping my skin.  I recently got a sunburn on my face... so I need to wait a couple of weeks before trying this peel again. I&#x27;m sure it will be a good outcome though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using this product once a week for four or so weeks. I didn&#x27;t realize it was working till my best friend saw me after I had began treatment and was like WOW your acne scars are gone. I am soooo happy. Now if someone can recommend a chemical peel for stretch marks that would be great!!!!     I wish these guys would also sell Glycolic Acid 75%. After my boyfriends praises, I placed an order for 75% (for some scars on my body) through Cellbone Technology.</li>
            <li> The product is right for my skin. I used it twice a week for 5 min each time. I works! My skin improved, and I get less breakouts and spots. I will have to use the product for some more time to say definitely, though. I am not still sure that the prescription medication I was using before trying this is worse. I guess it depends on one&#x27;s skin. You should really do an evaluation with a dermatologist first, and then decide what you want to do if you have real problems with the skin. If the problems are light - use this - it works!</li>
            <li> I have used 20% glyclic acid for years for my acne with good but modest results. I think my skin got used to it, so I wanted to try something stronger and purchased this 50% peel.  Not only was this not stronger, it did not even have any tingling or burning - even when I tested it on a virgin skin area. What I have discovered is that much depends on the amount of \\&quot;free acid\\&quot; in a product, and this product must have even less free acid than the other 20% that I was using.  This is deceitful and the manufacturer should not call it 50% glycolic acid.  A total wast of $28.00.</li>
            <li> i started out with huge blotches of redness on my cheeks, i tried fading creams and what not, but they didn&#x27;t seem to do anything, so i decided to give this peel a try since it states that its very effective against hyper-pigmentation, and it sure as well was. I didn&#x27;t see anything noticeable on the first time i did the peel, only that my cheeks were now smooth and real soft, I am now on my 6th peel, and i can say about 78% of my redness has dissapeared. i am so glad i turned to this product as my last resort, but if i only i knew about it sooner, i would&#x27;ve saved myself alot of money from those cheap uneffective facial creams on stores :/  its a well worth buy if you got redness issues, *****just make SURE that you use a moisturizer right after the peel, because then your skin may start to peel, and get irritated *****    i left the peel on for about 8mins before washing it off ( it will sting and make you wanna scratch your face off due to the itching, but its well worth it afterwords :) )</li>
            <li> I love these peels. I know some might have a little concern that they are professional grade but it was so easy. I didn&#x27;t have any negative side effects at all and I have to admit I left the peel on longer then they recommend.  BUT, this has really made my skin much smoother, helped clean out my pores and keep them clean, softened my skin... Plus, if you do have a breakout, it really helps speed along the healing process.  I use this once a week and really notice the results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the severe burning that I have had with other GA&#x27;s, but still had the results. I also liked the gel consistency.</li>
            <li> I started off using a 10% GA wash the last couple of years.  After the trouble w/ my skin started to escalate, I searched for something new.  I tried the 70% Lactic Acid Peel w/ horrible results, possibly due to my inexperience w/ that type of acid.  Then I tried 35% GA, and was very pleased.  Since I am accustom to GA I have used the peel every other day, never exceeding 5 mins.  My recent face explosion and marks, formed before starting GA peels, are quickly fading, but of course not fast enough. Since I saw this working I decided to add the 50% to my routine once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are use to 35% GA, you should be okay w/ the next step up.  I actually felt less tingling w/ the 50% than the 35%. The consistency was a little more liquidity than the 35% as well.  This definitely boosted skin turnover and healing for me.  I need to also note that this company produces their peels w/ a lower PH level than recommended.  I am unsure how this affects my skin overall, but I have not had any negative results w/ it in any case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only seen my skin get better, since using these products.  However, I suggest resisting the compulsion to overuse them.  The ill effects of sensitivity &amp; skin thinning will ensue if you misuse them.  Also, be careful not to over exfoliate the forehead, since it already has the least amount of padding on the face.</li>
            <li> I started with 35 and bumped up to 50. 50 stings way more on my face but it works. My skin is much improved with the use of these peels but you have to wear sunscreen and eat well to maintain nice skin. The lines and spots come back quickly!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this strength as a follow up to one of their weaker peels. I like it better. I have had no problems with any of this company&#x27;s products. I will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t see magical results in 30 seconds, but in 2 weeks I&#x27;ve seen great results. If you are or have African American or Black descendants be very careful when using this or any acids/ chemical peels on your skin.</li>
            <li> This peel is fabulous! I have used it for a couple months and my skin looks amazing! I abuse my skin all summer, so I was ready to reveal smooth, soft skin. This did the trick!</li>
            <li> hi there!&lt;br /&gt;So my package arrived this morning, and I did the first peel right away. A bit of history about my skin situation: I&#x27;m a mountain biker, 34 years old, and the many hours in the sun has taken its toll. I live in Cape Town South Africa, and I am Coloured, which basically means I have a brownish complexion. I&#x27;ve been struggling with hiper pigmentation for a long time now, and have received a couple of glycolic acid treatments from my dermatologist. The treatments I received did help to some extend, but did not clear the marks up 100%. It did leave my skin glowing and refreshed, and I did receive compliments about my skin. The treatments became too expensive, and that is why I&#x27;ve decided to buy this product online, to see if I can get the same results if I do it myself at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to this product: it is a gel, and not watery as I expected, but this is actually good, as you can control it better. I did feel it sting, but really not even as much as the 20% peel I received from the derma. As it was my first at home peel, I did not leave it on longer than 5 minutes, as I wanted to first get a feeling for the product. There is a slight difference in my skin tone, but not as much as I would like, and got from the dermatologist peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am just glad I did not have a bad reaction to the product, and since I have it now I will continue using it. I think I may have really tough skin, and might need something a little stronger. I will use it once a week, to get max benefit.</li>
            <li> I just finished my second application and left on two minutes. Yes it tingles and burns but tolerable, but I following the instructions, using once a week and increasing my time each week up to 4 minutes as I build more tolerance to the feeling. I have not yet had any down time, not redness or visable peeling. I am black soap to wash my face and a glycolic Toner before appling the peel. After the peel I use JoJoba oil and a little shea butter to calm the skin. The next day I continue my regular routine with washing with Black Soap, using Glycolic Toner and following with Glycolic moiserizing face cream. I wait for it to dry and apply a little sunscreen to my face before my make up...face feels really smooth all week and I look forward to my next peel. I did not start out with a lower acid... I began with 50%, my skin tolerates it well so far. I will update once I reach 6 weeks of treatment and the full 4minute application. So far for the price and the results, it is worth the purchase. I have fair skin and I am 44 yrs old. I bought the product to reduce wringles around eyes, frown line around mouth and between eyebrowes, I hope to reduce the size of pores and even out skin tone. I do not have a lot of sun damage... just age lines. I still apply sunless tanning to my face after 48 hrs and it last much longer because the dead skin cells are fewer.</li>
