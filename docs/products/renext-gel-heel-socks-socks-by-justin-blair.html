            <li>I love them so much!</li>

            <li>I finally got my heels looking good and could get a pedicure yesterday without being embarrassed about my heels.</li>
            <li>They fit comfortable and help with my dry heels during the summer months (and I am sure during the winter).</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>got these right away-thanks</li>
            <li>Did not expect the rubber heel, feels kind of strange.  </li>
            <li>I like these very much, and have now purchased them three times.  </li>
            <li>I have a sixe 8 1/2 womans foot and found with my higher instep</li>

            <li>regular socks would not work as well because they soak up the creams more than my feet do.  </li>
            <li>Also hot flashes and socks don&#x27;t mix.  </li>
            <li>my feet get too hot.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I bought two paids just in case the first one &amp;#34;wore out too quick&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I wear them every night and my pedicure technician says my heels are totally smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>they do exactly what they say they will do.</li>
            <li>Really is helping my cracked heels.</li>
            <li>after 3 uses gel was out of the socks and become very sticky</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much cooler.  </li>
            <li>It is very sticky.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>Work really well.</li>
            <li>I have the other sock type and love them but wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t cover my whole foot.  </li>
            <li>So I will only need to handwash these once in a while since I&#x27;m clean when I put them on.  </li>
            <li>and I really like them so far.</li>
            <li>Need to use a few more times but seems to do what it says</li>
            <li>This does not heal my heel but to maintain and live without pain every day.</li>
            <li>If I notice anything &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; later I&#x27;ll update, but overall these where cheap and</li>
            <li>It will not completely transform dry, cracked heels into smooth, soft heels, but it certainly does help.</li>
            <li>The threads at the top began to unwind after the first use and just got worse.</li>
            <li>the morning you are rewarded with soft, supple heels</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised no one else mentions this issue.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that after one night my heels were soft.</li>
            <li>These socks have helped considerably in healing the cracks while we sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so much bought a second pair for mom</li>
            <li>Also, my skin looked &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; and white, like after being in water too long, not soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Works very well to sooth dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, it can be a bit tight (across the top of my foot)</li>
            <li>The socks are comfortable, whether on my small feet or my husbands larger feet.  </li>
            <li>two weeks later they are baby soft</li>
            <li>Hand was and let air dry - they dry very fast.</li>
            <li>These do work, at least they do right now since they are new.  </li>

            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Delivery took rather long to receive.</li>
            <li> Not loose but not too tight either.  </li>
            <li> Definitely helping my dry heals but both of the ends of the sock are too tight and cut off circulation</li>
            <li> I saw that it works just days after using it but its so tight that by the middle of the night I have to be taking them off!</li>
            <li> Does as advertised, but being a male diabetic, with shoe size 9&amp;1/2 EEE, it fits, but a little snug.  </li>
            <li> I have a wide foot, size 9</li>
            <li> they do what I expected.</li>
            <li> They run very small and were blue and white nylon socks</li>
            <li> immediately due to fragrance that made me cough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They have to be hand-washed but they are small, so not a big deal in effort.</li>
            <li> These came with no paper tags and no packaging and weren&#x27;t listed on the customs sheet with the other item they were packaged with.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how long they will hold up?  </li>
            <li> The inside (gel) broke down and did not help heal his heels.</li>
            <li> but the inside broke down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like they are tight as stated by a few other reviewers</li>
            <li> They are so tight, I cant use them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> IF THEY KNOW THEY ARE TOO TIGHT, and they dont mention size,&lt;br</li>
            <li> these were tight.  </li>
            <li> Way too tight, and I have size 8 feet.</li>
            <li> I have size 9 feet womens but can still squeeze them on tightly.</li>
            <li> I put on a heavy application of heel cream and then the socks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these socks for a few nights now</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> To Tight if your feet swell!</li>
            <li> I tried these, hoping to maintain my post pedicure heels and slow down the regrowth of my hooves.  </li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m not sure who these are made for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry to give these only one star -- I would not have done so IF the manufacturer&#x27;s description had mentioned fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have small feet.</li>
            <li> I get pedicures to carve away the worst of the callouses, but never manage to get to smooth feet.  </li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d post this review for others who are sensitive to fragrances so they won&#x27;t be disappointed as I</li>
            <li> Sorry, I previously bought heel socks from Sally&#x27;s but they did not have them anymore</li>
            <li> Once you wash them they are no good.</li>
            <li> so I am thinking about cutting the elastic.</li>
            <li> The socks look like this: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I hate sleeping with socks on b/c</li>

            <li> These work so well... better than anything else to make heels sandal worthy</li>
            <li> love them - they were exactly as advertised. Helped protect my heal from wear and tear.</li>

            <li> Really is helping my cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hold up before the cuffs start to fray.</li>
            <li> after 3 uses gel was out of the socks and become very sticky</li>
            <li> I ordered the Justin Blair Nightcare Gel Heel Socks thinking I was getting socks (like the picture); however, it wasn&#x27;t.  The socks look like this: [[ASIN:B0009HN1MS Visco-GEL Heel-So-Smooth Heel Sleeves]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have preferred socks like the one pictured here, but I figured I would give it a try.  I tried it for a week.  All I can say is, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks and very satisfy with it. This does not heal my heel but to maintain and live without pain every day. It is a good product.</li>
            <li> I saw that it works just days after using it but its so tight that by the middle of the night I have to be taking them off!</li>
            <li> After two washes, and not drying them in the dryer, they feel apart.</li>
            <li> Had no issues with these socks.  I have a wide foot, size 9 and they fit fine.</li>
            <li> Definitely helping my dry heals but both of the ends of the sock are too tight and cut off circulation so I am thinking about cutting the elastic.</li>
            <li> Works but the tightness drove me nuts.  I have the other sock type and love them but wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t cover my whole foot.  I wore them one night and my toes looked swollen in the morning.  I have a sixe 8 1/2 womans foot and found with my higher instep these were tight.  I don&#x27;t know if I can continue wearing them.</li>
            <li> Fit good. Need to use a few more times but seems to do what it says</li>
            <li> Sorry to give these only one star -- I would not have done so IF the manufacturer&#x27;s description had mentioned fragrance. I had to discard these  heel socks and their packaging *outdoors* immediately due to fragrance that made me cough. Thought I&#x27;d post this review for others who are sensitive to fragrances so they won&#x27;t be disappointed as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If manufacturer adds &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;scented&amp;#34; in the description, I&#x27;ll happily delete this one star review.</li>
            <li> i dont know how it works but it does.&lt;br /&gt;socks are comfortable, you forget you are even wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;in the morning you are rewarded with soft, supple heels&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> Be aware, they smell like cleaning agent, very potent. It grossed me out so I tore them off in the middle of the night. I guess I didn&#x27;t leave them on long enough to see results. I&#x27;m surprised no one else mentions this issue. Also, my skin looked &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; and white, like after being in water too long, not soft and smooth. Uugh.</li>
            <li> I like these things.  I almost didn&#x27;t get these because if some of the reviews I read, but I&#x27;m glad I bought them anyway. First things first, no one gave me nothing for my review.  These work fine.  I wear size 9.5-10 medium width ladies shoes.  I am plus sized.  I&#x27;m also menopausal. (Aint life grand) These sock fit fine.  Not loose but not too tight either.  I am a fidgety sleeper so i like them snug. I&#x27;m not worried these will come off, but they aren&#x27;t leaving any marks on my ankles either. Secondly I didn&#x27;t expect these thing to cure my cracked heels. I put Vaseline on my heals,  I put these on, the Vaseline stays on my heels and not on my bed sheets.  regular socks would not work as well because they soak up the creams more than my feet do.  Also hot flashes and socks don&#x27;t mix.  So with my toes exposed in these gel socks I&#x27;m much cooler.  I don&#x27;t plan to use these walking around; only in bed.  So I will only need to handwash these once in a while since I&#x27;m clean when I put them on.  If I notice anything &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; later I&#x27;ll update, but overall these where cheap and they do what I expected. I just didn&#x27;t want people (like me) to second guess them like I was doing.</li>
            <li> I hate sleeping with socks on b/c my feet get too hot.  These are prefect.  I put on a heavy application of heel cream and then the socks.  I sleep all night with them on, and in the morning, it&#x27;s like I had just gotten a pedicure.  I wear 9 or 9.5 size shoes and these fit well.  My sister wears 8, I bought her one for a gift, and they fit her size wise as well.</li>
            <li> hard to get on cant seem to get the gel part on the right place.  It is very sticky.</li>
            <li> My feet turn into hooves regularly.  I get pedicures to carve away the worst of the callouses, but never manage to get to smooth feet.  I tried these, hoping to maintain my post pedicure heels and slow down the regrowth of my hooves.  I was amazed that after one night my heels were soft.</li>
            <li> So far so good - A nightly ritual to keep my heels from cracking.</li>
            <li> Works very well to sooth dry, cracked heels. Hand was and let air dry - they dry very fast. I wear them overnight or when I have tennis shoes on.</li>
            <li> Use it with &amp;#34;blue goo&amp;#34; heel gell. My feet were cracked and bleeding- two weeks later they are baby soft</li>
            <li> Love these!! Exactly what I needed. I finally got my heels looking good and could get a pedicure yesterday without being embarrassed about my heels. Just what I&#x27;d hoped. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these socks for a few nights now and I really like them so far. My heels are getting softer so they are working.  I love that my feet don&#x27;t get hot while I&#x27;m sleeping</li>
            <li> Did not expect the rubber heel, feels kind of strange.  As other reviewers have said, it can be a bit tight (across the top of my foot)</li>
            <li> My shoe size is 8w (woman).  I could not get the socks on at all.  I wish they offered them on different sizes.</li>
            <li> Love these socks.  They fit comfortable and help with my dry heels during the summer months (and I am sure during the winter). I bought two paids just in case the first one &amp;#34;wore out too quick&amp;#34;.  Still going great.</li>
            <li> Way too tight, and I have size 8 feet. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Nice item.  Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> Love these heel socks and suggest purchasing the &amp;#34;Blue Goo Foot Softener&amp;#34; to use with them.  I wear them every night and my pedicure technician says my heels are totally smooth and soft.  I ordered extra pairs I love them so much!</li>
            <li> Great product and comfortable to wear while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I have size 9 feet womens but can still squeeze them on tightly. worth the price. I&#x27;d buy again anytime.</li>
            <li> Does as advertised, but being a male diabetic, with shoe size 9&amp;1/2 EEE, it fits, but a little snug.  I have hopes it will loosen up some over time.</li>
            <li> These are no miracle socks but they do a good job.  The socks are comfortable, whether on my small feet or my husbands larger feet.  We both like to walk barefoot and our heels get cracked.  These socks have helped considerably in healing the cracks while we sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have to be hand-washed but they are small, so not a big deal in effort.</li>
            <li> great product. comfortable.</li>
            <li> There was no gel in these socks whatsoever.  They run very small and were blue and white nylon socks but they didn&#x27;t have anything to keep moisturizer on your heels like the spa viscose &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; socks do.  These came with no paper tags and no packaging and weren&#x27;t listed on the customs sheet with the other item they were packaged with.  The picture shows one turned inside out.</li>
            <li> This product started falling apart immediately. The threads at the top began to unwind after the first use and just got worse. It also didn&#x27;t help do anything for my feet.</li>
            <li> Once you wash them they are no good.</li>
            <li> so much bought a second pair for mom</li>
            <li> The heel socks were purchased for my husband. He has callouses on especially left heel. The inside (gel) broke down and did not help heal his heels. The socks fitted well but the inside broke down.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and I can sleep through the night with them on with zero problems. I don&#x27;t feel like they are tight as stated by a few other reviewers and I don&#x27;t have small feet.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time. Doubles to keep feet warm in the winter. Quick and easy way to mildly soften your heels.</li>
            <li> To Tight if your feet swell!</li>
            <li> they do exactly what they say they will do.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I previously bought heel socks from Sally&#x27;s but they did not have them anymore so I tried these.  They are OK but not anything like the others.</li>
            <li> These do work, at least they do right now since they are new.  Not sure how long they will hold up?  Delivery took rather long to receive.</li>
            <li> got these right away-thanks</li>
            <li> These are great!  Work really well.</li>
