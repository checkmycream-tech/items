    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>my face feels perfectly moisturized.  </li>
            <li>and I did and is works great!  </li>
            <li>This retinol cream is superb.</li>
            <li>This one is just perfect.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the best cream in the market.</li>
            <li>stuff is awesome!  </li>
            <li>and it was Wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist gave me a sample to try and I loved it!  </li>
            <li>My skin feels great in the morning after I have this on all night.</li>
            <li>This is a great anti aging cream.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and my skin looks great</li>
            <li>probably good as it gets</li>
            <li>My dermatologist told me about this product says its good for spots caused by acne,</li>
            <li>Now up to using 2 good pea size amounts.</li>
            <li>So now, I&#x27;ve found a good balance in that</li>
            <li>She looks great and has used it for many years.</li>
            <li>but this product feels wonderful the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>After many months went by, I decided to give the Avene Retrinal .05 cream a try and.... \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>Love this Product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I think it does a great job at smoothing the face and getting rid of fine lines.</li>
            <li>Works great to smooth out the wrinkles without all the redness of the stronger product.</li>
            <li>This creme works just as good or better</li>
            <li>I liked the cream.  </li>
            <li>the foaming and the gentle cleanser alternating although I like the foaming best . . .</li>
            <li>The retinol from my dr came out in a nice semi-firm consistency.  </li>
            <li>My best advice to anyone who wants to try this is to go to the doctor for it and, as a treatment for acne (whether you have it or not if you want to treat wrinkles just say its for acne) and insurance will COVER IT.</li>
            <li>I just started using this creme and it feels good on my skin and is not irritating, always a good sign!</li>
            <li>But the best thing that has worked for me so far has been tretinoin cream.</li>
            <li>wish you all good luck if you are stuggling with acne, or wrinkles alike, and I hope you enjoy using this product which I know will help</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with this regimen and plan to continue it.  </li>
            <li>I have not been using this product for more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li>and I love the saving.</li>
            <li>It makes my face look healthy and gives it a glow from within.  </li>
            <li>Love it  R:)))))))</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>You will love it too</li>
            <li>but I tested it on my face and it feels and ACTS like Nothing more than a moisturizing</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has not CURED my acne but it has made it much more bearable.</li>
            <li>but it most surely is always present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream is really a miracle cream with very effective ingredients.</li>
            <li>The price was good just like he had said and better if I have bought it from the pharmacy for a higher cost.</li>
            <li>Price was very good compared to local  availability.</li>
            <li>I was told by my doctor that its good and really remove spots so if this is the reason you want to use retinal, then just try it, its a lot cheaper here online @</li>
            <li>Goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>and I can see a difference in the size of my pores, in my breakouts and the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li>Product is the same great quality.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d save a few dollars and utilize my Wonderful amazon Prime membership</li>
            <li>This is a light peach color.  </li>
            <li>so I made good use of Action</li>
            <li>but there is nothing special about this cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had such good results.  </li>
            <li>The EltaMD alone was too drying and the Cerave&#x27; has helped that tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Luckily it doesn&#x27;t break me out</li>
            <li>This cream is just strong enough to be effective without being so strong as to cause irritation (even for my sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>So far with using this product I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>She recommended the retinol (0.05%) that is less potent BUT just as effective as the higher level creams.  </li>
            <li>(yay, right?)</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to fragrances--and I was a bit concerned that Avene does have fragrance in their products, but the scent is a light floral one and isn&#x27;t bothersome to me at all.  </li>
            <li>At night, I apply approximately a pea-sized amount of Avene&#x27;s Rich Compensating Cream all over my face (using the scoop provided with the product, which is great because you can avoid contaminating the contents of the jar by using this and washing it between uses).  </li>
            <li>Cerave&#x27; and EltaMD are completely fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>I think this really helps with the wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I did pry the top off, but I still can&#x27;t get the product that is left inside.  </li>
            <li>The last step is when I put a &#x27;line&#x27; of the blender on my pinkie and follow it up with a line on top of the retinol, blend them together and apply to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all I wanted to say that I currently work for a dermatologist and have tried many treatments and products for my oily skin and large pores, including laser.</li>
            <li>The next morning, I could tell that many of my enlarged pours around and on my nose had tightened up and more way less</li>
            <li>well I cant say too much about it because I haven&#x27;t really used it like I&#x27;m  supposed  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not irritating like some, never has reddened my skin, and as I said works really really well</li>
            <li>this cream really smooths out lines and makes skin glow.  </li>
            <li>Do not use too much.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a few weeks before I wrote any kind of review to ensure my skin was truly turning around.  </li>
            <li>and I have found that the .05 works better for me than the .10 due to the .10 making me peel The .05</li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li>It has fragrance listed and oddly a food-coloring that sort of stains your face a peachy-pink to make it appear more even toned and glowing.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a few years and love this product.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it keeps your screen radiant due to constant turnover of dead skin build up.</li>
            <li>really cause the face to dry out, if you use too much.</li>
            <li>Next time I will order the pure retrinal 0.05.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered this cream, along with Avene&#x27;s Rich Compensating Cream for Dry, Sensitive Skin to use at night.  </li>
            <li>Since I began this regimen 3 weeks ago, the redness on my cheeks is completely gone--my skin tone has evened out dramatically.  </li>
            <li>I have oily sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>the dr&#x27;s office somewhat discouraged the use of the Action moisturizer as \\&quot;you want it to peel\\&quot; but mine was bordering on cracking</li>
            <li>I use it to the point that I experience a decent peel but can still put on moisturizer, make up and look socially acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had been using Ole Henricksen&#x27;s products but found that I needed more moisturizing as my skin felt tight, irritated and dry.  </li>
            <li>This product immediately helped clear up all of the smaller breakouts and so far, has prevented any new ones.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my current regimen with these new</li>
            <li>Other expensive creams that I have tried have not given me great results</li>
            <li>I am 40 and have combination, sensitive skin with medium-sized pores &amp; occasional break-outs.  </li>
            <li>Having used this for a short time on an over 65 yr old&#x27;s face, I can already  see a difference.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin, no other skin reaction either.</li>
            <li>When I first started this regimen, I was a bit discouraged because my skin felt slightly irritated when I applied the night creams--</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so started out with the .05 concentration and will likely go up to the .1 cream on my next purchase.</li>

            <li> My break-outs have decreased significantly.  </li>
            <li> During the day time, I use Cerave&#x27;s Moisturizing lotion as a base (using a single pump), then I apply EltaMD&#x27;s UV Daily SPF 40 all over my face to protect my fair skin from the sun/UV rays.  </li>
            <li> at least I KNOW I&#x27;m getting the real deal.</li>
            <li> It gives me a radiant glow and the tube lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I could cut it open when empty to get every drop.</li>
            <li> The products were pricey--but you only have to use a small amount, so they will last several months.  </li>
            <li> Wish I would have started using it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> The old tube used to last me at least 3 months.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for two weeks only because i didnt want to waste my money, and my face keeps breaking out in red rashes,so I use it on my neck which works quite well.</li>
            <li> experience with tretinoin is that it thins the skin, causes peeling, your skin will look worse when you first start using it because, I like to think, that every pimple that was lurking below is coming</li>
            <li> This container only lasted a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> Obagi experience has been such that initially I went hard core and basically fried my face. . . .</li>
            <li> there really is science behind the claims about Retinal.</li>
            <li> This is a very *loose* lotion . . .</li>
            <li> The dry, tight feeling I had is also gone and</li>
            <li> I researched other products and clinical studies before purchasing Avene...</li>
            <li> I am sold on it and other Avene products.</li>
            <li> and I use this product in the morning and night without any other moisturizers</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy, but I really could see results after only one application!  </li>
            <li> We had started carrying this product quite sometime ago and was given a tube to try, however never really used it because I have tried Retinols in the past that have caused irritation to the point where my skin became irritated and extremely dry.</li>
            <li> cream has also made my skin EXTREMELY sensitive to sunlight, and don&#x27;t even think  of waxing your eyebrows or any other part of your face, because the skin is so thin it will rip off with the wax.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recently ordered this cream, along with Avene&#x27;s Rich Compensating Cream for Dry, Sensitive Skin to use at night.  I am 40 and have combination, sensitive skin with medium-sized pores &amp; occasional break-outs.  I tend to have redness on my cheeks and also am prone to eczema.  I had been using Ole Henricksen&#x27;s products but found that I needed more moisturizing as my skin felt tight, irritated and dry.  A couple of my friends use Avene and recommended their products to me. After reading a lot of reviews, I decided to try Avene&#x27;s products.  Here&#x27;s my current regimen with these new products--  I use Cerave&#x27; hydrating cleanser (I had been using cleansing facial soap bars--I was one of those who thought that a lather was necessary to properly clean--time to break that routine!).  At night, I apply approximately a pea-sized amount of Avene&#x27;s Rich Compensating Cream all over my face (using the scoop provided with the product, which is great because you can avoid contaminating the contents of the jar by using this and washing it between uses).  After applying the base cream, I then apply Avene&#x27;s Retrinal +0.05 Cream--just dabbing it along my forehead, cheeks and around my eyes then massaging it into those areas.  Since I began this regimen 3 weeks ago, the redness on my cheeks is completely gone--my skin tone has evened out dramatically.  The dry, tight feeling I had is also gone and my face feels perfectly moisturized.  My break-outs have decreased significantly.  My skin looks dewy and I&#x27;ve had several compliments on my complexion by my coworkers.  During the day time, I use Cerave&#x27;s Moisturizing lotion as a base (using a single pump), then I apply EltaMD&#x27;s UV Daily SPF 40 all over my face to protect my fair skin from the sun/UV rays.  The EltaMD alone was too drying and the Cerave&#x27; has helped that tremendously.  I know this is a ton of info and products, but I felt it was necessary to divulge my entire regimen so as not to appear that by using this specific cream alone I&#x27;ve had such good results.  I am very sensitive to fragrances--and I was a bit concerned that Avene does have fragrance in their products, but the scent is a light floral one and isn&#x27;t bothersome to me at all.  Cerave&#x27; and EltaMD are completely fragrance free.  All of these products work well and blend well together.  When I first started this regimen, I was a bit discouraged because my skin felt slightly irritated when I applied the night creams--but I think my skin was in such bad shape it needed time to heal.  After 3-4 nights of this regimen, the irritation was gone and I was noticing results.  I wanted to give it a few weeks before I wrote any kind of review to ensure my skin was truly turning around.  I am quite pleased with this regimen and plan to continue it.  The products were pricey--but you only have to use a small amount, so they will last several months.  I hope this information helps!</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product for more than 2 weeks but I do notice that my skin feels a lot softer and seems brighter. I researched other products and clinical studies before purchasing Avene...there really is science behind the claims about Retinal. Other expensive creams that I have tried have not given me great results but this product feels wonderful the first time you use it. I hope to continue to see improvements in my skin texture and tone. I have sensitive skin so started out with the .05 concentration and will likely go up to the .1 cream on my next purchase.</li>
            <li> Me dermatologist said to buy it online since my insurance didn&#x27;t cover the cost and I did and is works great!  The price was good just like he had said and better if I have bought it from the pharmacy for a higher cost.</li>
            <li> The smell  is bad, and there is no expiry date on the product. How I know if it is expired or not?</li>
            <li> didnt work. dont get it. get something else</li>
            <li> Having used this for a short time on an over 65 yr old&#x27;s face, I can already  see a difference.  I use it only at night.  Price was very good compared to local  availability.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t make a lot of difference and at that price, yeesh!</li>
            <li> First of all I wanted to say that I currently work for a dermatologist and have tried many treatments and products for my oily skin and large pores, including laser. We had started carrying this product quite sometime ago and was given a tube to try, however never really used it because I have tried Retinols in the past that have caused irritation to the point where my skin became irritated and extremely dry. After many months went by, I decided to give the Avene Retrinal .05 cream a try and.... \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;! What a difference it has made to my skin. After only a couple of days on the product I have noticed that my complexion looks and feels radiant. I also noticed increased firmness and the pores are beginning to appear smaller. Love this Product! Wish I would have started using it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> This product immediately helped clear up all of the smaller breakouts and so far, has prevented any new ones. Even though it&#x27;s January and I typically layer the moisturizer, it has not caused any increased dryness. More importantly, it keeps your screen radiant due to constant turnover of dead skin build up.</li>
            <li> Actually, this was requested by my Mother in law and she is 90. She looks great and has used it for many years.</li>
            <li> I was using another retrinal creme that I was paying double the price for. This creme works just as good or better and I love the saving. Just started using it and I see such a difference.</li>
            <li> This retinol cream is superb. It makes my face look healthy and gives it a glow from within.  It has no retinol irritation.  Avene products were introduced to me by an aesthetician when I had a recent facial.  She recommended the retinol (0.05%) that is less potent BUT just as effective as the higher level creams.  I have used other brand retinol products before but always ended up with unattractive and annoying peeling.  This one is just perfect.  I am sold on it and other Avene products.</li>
            <li> probably good as it gets</li>
            <li> So far with using this product I am pleased with the results. My eye wrinkles are slowly finishing and my skin has evened out. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this cream for years!!!! It is one of the best cream in the market. Love it  R:)))))))</li>
            <li> This cream is really a miracle cream with very effective ingredients. Got it from my dermatologist and will keep use it!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me about this product says its good for spots caused by acne, well I cant say too much about it because I haven&#x27;t really used it like I&#x27;m  supposed  to so it would be unfair. I was told by my doctor that its good and really remove spots so if this is the reason you want to use retinal, then just try it, its a lot cheaper here online @ amazon verses the $75.00 the pharmacist wanted to charge .</li>
            <li> This cream is just strong enough to be effective without being so strong as to cause irritation (even for my sensitive skin).  My skin feels great in the morning after I have this on all night.</li>
            <li> I think it does a great job at smoothing the face and getting rid of fine lines. I use it nightly or almost nightly and it&#x27;s not irritating like some, never has reddened my skin, and as I said works really really well</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample to try and I loved it!  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you don&#x27;t use that much daily. I use it at night and felt a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture after just a few days.  People also started noticing that I looked younger.</li>
            <li> I did not even try it. I refuse to put a cream on my face that has no tamper resistant seals. The box that the tube of cream came in (not the box that it was shipped in) was not sealed and it was bent in several places. The tube of cream inside had no seal either. I at the very least expected shrink wrap or a plastic seal around the tip. I am returning it. I am concerned that it might have been a return that had already been opened.</li>
            <li> Works great to smooth out the wrinkles without all the redness of the stronger product.</li>
            <li> This cream contains a bunch of ingredients that were not listed on the site..it has a retinoid but it is one of the last ingredients listed which means it contains only a trace amount of it. It has fragrance listed and oddly a food-coloring that sort of stains your face a peachy-pink to make it appear more even toned and glowing. What a joke. It even says on the package insert that it may stain your pillow. WTH?? Luckily it doesn&#x27;t break me out but there is nothing special about this cream.</li>
            <li> this cream really smooths out lines and makes skin glow.  I can tell the difference when I run out!</li>
            <li> I think this really helps with the wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 8 months now and I love it. It can be a bit pricey but knowing it lasts for about a month and half for me with every night use - it&#x27;s worth every penny. Does not dry out my skin, no other skin reaction either. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great anti aging cream. It gives me a radiant glow and the tube lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I liked the cream.  Goes on easily.  Do not use too much.  Just a pearl size.&lt;br /&gt;Can really cause the face to dry out, if you use too much.</li>
            <li> This product is fake, not real Avene</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot live without this product. it&#x27;s now been a little bit over 4 weeks and I can see a difference in the size of my pores, in my breakouts and the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and forehead. I actually have oily skin and I use this product in the morning and night without any other moisturizers are creams. I do highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Product is the same great quality.  It&#x27;s the container I have an issue with.  I always received a plastic tube.  I could cut it open when empty to get every drop. In this way, I at least felt I was getting all I paid for.  The last container I received was a hard pump tube that cannot be opened.  I did pry the top off, but I still can&#x27;t get the product that is left inside.  The old tube used to last me at least 3 months.  This container only lasted a little over a month.  Is it possible to still get the tubes?</li>
            <li> I just started using this creme and it feels good on my skin and is not irritating, always a good sign! I hope that it will prove an efficient wrinkle-fighter, but only time can tell.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It has helped my skin a lot and I recommend it for any age. You will love it too</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years and love this product. Fades age spots or freckles and I have found that the .05 works better for me than the .10 due to the .10 making me peel The .05 does not make me peel.</li>
            <li> This product contains mineral oil in it as the third ingredient.Mineral oil clogs pores. If I had known this I would not have ordered this product.Retinal and vitamin e is third at the bottom of the ingredient list.I have used this product for two weeks only because i didnt want to waste my money, and my face keeps breaking out in red rashes,so I use it on my neck which works quite well.I have oily sensitive acne prone skin and I dont think this product is for acne. Next time I will order the pure retrinal 0.05.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy, but I really could see results after only one application!  The next morning, I could tell that many of my enlarged pours around and on my nose had tightened up and more way less visible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awesome!  I bought it to use in conjuntion with the Obagi skincare line (Nu-derm).  Invest in Obagi and this stuff and you will be amazed at the results.  No need to keep buying store bought skincare lines that do not work!  Avene and Obagi...that is the way to go...may be kinda pricey, but the Obagi kit is enought to last for like 8 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Disappointing. No effect. Initially used sparingly in case of reaction or peeling. Now up to using 2 good pea size amounts. Still nothing! Considering the product is expensive, my suspicion is that the active ingredient is not as claimed or very weak. Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> This was half the cost of what my dermatologist charged me. Don&#x27;t put it on too heavy or it might burn.</li>
            <li> I have a plastic surgeon about 10 minutes up the road . . .he charges $50 for a little less than an ounce of 0.05 Retinol in a prescription tube.  I thought I&#x27;d save a few dollars and utilize my Wonderful amazon Prime membership so I bought this . . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Obagi Nu-Derm system on and off for over 2 years. . .  . the foaming and the gentle cleanser alternating although I like the foaming best . . . the toner, the exfoderm, and then the blender.  The last step is when I put a &#x27;line&#x27; of the blender on my pinkie and follow it up with a line on top of the retinol, blend them together and apply to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retinol from my dr was white.  This is a light peach color.  The retinol from my dr came out in a nice semi-firm consistency.  This is a very *loose* lotion . . . I&#x27;d call it drippy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Obagi experience has been such that initially I went hard core and basically fried my face. . . . the dr&#x27;s office somewhat discouraged the use of the Action moisturizer as \\&quot;you want it to peel\\&quot; but mine was bordering on cracking so I made good use of Action and it was Wonderful.  So now, I&#x27;ve found a good balance in that I use it to the point that I experience a decent peel but can still put on moisturizer, make up and look socially acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t sent out a sample of the Avene to an independent lab to have it tested but I tested it on my face and it feels and ACTS like Nothing more than a moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this again and I Definitely would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dr has a 20% off sale 2x a year.  . . I&#x27;ll stock up then . . . at least I KNOW I&#x27;m getting the real deal.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I use it every night and my skin looks great</li>
            <li> I did not suffer from acne too much as a teenager, it got bad when I hit adulthood (yay, right?) and I have tried everything you can think of which I won&#x27;t list because that&#x27;s boring. But the best thing that has worked for me so far has been tretinoin cream. My best advice to anyone who wants to try this is to go to the doctor for it and, as a treatment for acne (whether you have it or not if you want to treat wrinkles just say its for acne) and insurance will COVER IT. At least mine does. I went from paying 40-50 bucks to 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with tretinoin is that it thins the skin, causes peeling, your skin will look worse when you first start using it because, I like to think, that every pimple that was lurking below is coming up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has not CURED my acne but it has made it much more bearable. I do not have acne which constitutes harsher treatments which scared the crap out of me which their side effects anyways but it most surely is always present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has smoothed my skin, increased healing time and made it look younger (even though I&#x27;m only 25)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has also made my skin EXTREMELY sensitive to sunlight, and don&#x27;t even think  of waxing your eyebrows or any other part of your face, because the skin is so thin it will rip off with the wax. ask me know how I know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you all good luck if you are stuggling with acne, or wrinkles alike, and I hope you enjoy using this product which I know will help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FUN SIDE NOTE: mix in hydrocortisone cream with it to help with redness and irritation. If you are worried about dark scarring or dark marks look into hydroquinone cream. OR you can ask your dr for a compounded medication which includes: Tretinoin, hydrocortisone AND hydroquinone just be forewarned that compounding pharmacies do not cover insurance and it will be about $50-60 depending on the amount you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck everyone!</li>
