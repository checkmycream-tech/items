            <li>It&#x27;s great for my hair.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>but honestly I don&#x27;t remember my hair feeling or looking greasy at the roots after any wash with any brand of shampoo</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>LOVE this shampoo</li>
            <li>The smell is okay</li>
            <li>even my Prime orders are never delivered on time any more because of UPS screw ups.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I am done with my UPS rant.  </li>
            <li>Big Hair is awesome.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have always loved how much body this adds to my hair.</li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to order</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again once I&#x27;m finished with the (huge) bottle.</li>
            <li>These product is labeled as sulfate free and gluten free.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was bigger than I thought, at a great price.</li>
            <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t make you hair as soft as I would hope, but over all does a fairly good job...was shipped on time as well.</li>
            <li>Trust me when I say I&#x27;m pretty sure that it will wreck even the healthiest hair.</li>
            <li>I even rinse my hair thoroughly with cool water after using.  </li>
            <li>but that is a challenge for me because it just does not look good on me flat.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have just a ton of hair, it&#x27;s about shoulder-length and pretty fine.  </li>
            <li>I found Big Sexy Hair about 3 years ago and have tried many volumizing shampoos along with this and just end up throwing the others away.</li>
            <li>what is in my bottle right now.</li>
            <li>Works very well at volumizing my hair and helping keeping it clean.</li>
            <li>Ok when I got this yesterday the bottle was partially open so some had leaked out and then I go to use it this morning</li>
            <li>I started to think my hair was just thinning to a greater extent, but switching back to Evercreme made me think I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I have had problems with my deliveries and</li>
            <li>We gave it a fair shot for a few days, and we&#x27;ve decided we will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li>It not just voumizes my hair but leaves it feeling clean (something many of the other volumizers do not do) and it works!  </li>
            <li>what has happened to this company but over the past 6 months they have progressively taken a nose dive performance wise.  </li>
            <li>My hair became extremely flat, lost any volume it previously held, and didn&#x27;t even smell that great.</li>
            <li>I would recommend waiting for liter sales and buying the real product.  </li>
            <li>This is a glorified Pantene product, in my opinion, and if I wanted that, I wouldn&#x27;t be paying even this much for it.</li>
            <li>Strike two was that it doesn&#x27;t lather much at all.  </li>
            <li>But there are also so many other things I didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>It might be because I use two pumps to get more coverage due to lack of lather</li>
            <li>I have to use twice as much shampoo to get a decent lather with this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I have no other shampoo right now.</li>
            <li>it normally does not have.</li>
            <li>; (I live in a house).  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too silky soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this doesn&#x27;t mean that it doesn&#x27;t work, but I like a shampoo that will lather up to make me feel like my hair is being covered throughout with the product.  </li>
            <li>(my hair has also been a bit drier since using this as compared to my last bottle of BSH), but my local salon had their Big Sexy products on sale yesterday, so I bought a bottle and compared bottle to bottle and product to product, and it is same in name only.  </li>
            <li>I thought Big Sexy would be worth a shot, but oh boy, I was wrong.</li>
            <li>This has a lighter color, less lather, a slightly different smell and DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS than the Big Sexy Hair shampoo that you would buy in the salon.  </li>
            <li>It really does dry your hair out -- and I have oily hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not normally pink.</li>
            <li>PLUS, it really does seem to help keep my color (medium brown) where the other volumizing shampoos I have used seem to lighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, if your hair is beautiful, and you just want to look like a sad hobo for a few days, then I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>After being excited to find a gluten free volumizing shampoo, I was disappointed  to see it contains wheat in which I am allergic to.</li>

            <li> It gives me a little extra volume, but not really any of the shine I get from other products.  </li>
            <li> My address was very apparent on the package and not even close to the address of the apartment complex.</li>
            <li> This conditioner DOES NOT weigh your hair down.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a little drying and not healthy-looking fullness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few years now</li>
            <li> I have short, thin, and somewhat curly hair, and just before I bought this bottle, I was using L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme conditioner.</li>
            <li> so, not wanting to waste it, I tried it out.</li>
            <li> Gives lift and body without making it stiff and then needing a chisel to comb it.  </li>
            <li> but it was delivered to an apartment complex down the street.</li>
            <li> but that is usually on day two when I don&#x27;t wash.  </li>
            <li> She tried it out for two days and then complained it dried her hair out.</li>
            <li> What I received from CB Seller, however, is all wrong.</li>
            <li> I have lots of very very thin hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a satiny pink color, the smell is terrible and it&#x27;s obviously fake.</li>
            <li> and I got the wrong thing!</li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, regarding the delivery, can I just say that I think that UPS is TERRIBLE!!!  </li>

            <li> These product is labeled as sulfate free and gluten free.  Be careful if you have an allergy because it contains wheat protein.  After being excited to find a gluten free volumizing shampoo, I was disappointed  to see it contains wheat in which I am allergic to.</li>
            <li> The conditioner doesn&#x27;t make you hair as soft as I would hope, but over all does a fairly good job...was shipped on time as well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works very well at volumizing my hair and helping keeping it clean. Plus it is made for color treated hair as well.</li>
            <li> This conditioner DOES NOT weigh your hair down. I use it every day along with the shampoo. I have tried all of the salon brands. This is the very best!</li>
            <li> I have to use twice as much shampoo to get a decent lather with this stuff. I don&#x27;t have just a ton of hair, it&#x27;s about shoulder-length and pretty fine.  It gives me a little extra volume, but not really any of the shine I get from other products.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again once I&#x27;m finished with the (huge) bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, it makes my hair do what I want it to. The bottle was bigger than I thought, at a great price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  My hair is grateful for it.  Gives lift and body without making it stiff and then needing a chisel to comb it.  Great service as always.</li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed. I ordered 2 bottles of this shampoo for my mom for mothers day. (I ordered about a week and a half ago) received the product and I got the wrong thing! I have been trying to get my money back or get the correct ones sent out. I have been dealing with them since last Saturday so almost another week. Once this issue is resolved I will not be purchasing from salons best ever again.</li>
            <li> This has a lighter color, less lather, a slightly different smell and DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS than the Big Sexy Hair shampoo that you would buy in the salon.  However, it is similar, and I only had a suspicion that it was different (my hair has also been a bit drier since using this as compared to my last bottle of BSH), but my local salon had their Big Sexy products on sale yesterday, so I bought a bottle and compared bottle to bottle and product to product, and it is same in name only.  I would recommend waiting for liter sales and buying the real product.  This is a glorified Pantene product, in my opinion, and if I wanted that, I wouldn&#x27;t be paying even this much for it.</li>
            <li> I have always loved how much body this adds to my hair.</li>
            <li> Ok when I got this yesterday the bottle was partially open so some had leaked out and then I go to use it this morning and it was pink and it&#x27;s not normally pink. I&#x27;ve bought it from a retailer and a salon and it was almost a clearish yellow color, it has never been pink. So I have no idea what is in my bottle right now. I would return it but I have no other shampoo right now.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s my favorite shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too silky soft. I have very fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few years now and I don&#x27;t think I will be stopping my use of it. I like how easy it is to order and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from seller CB Select. As a regular user of BSH shampoo, I know what it&#x27;s like. I love it. It&#x27;s great for my hair. The scent is refreshing, the texture is somewhere between gel-like and creamy, and the product is perfectly translucent. What I received from CB Seller, however, is all wrong. It&#x27;s a satiny pink color, the smell is terrible and it&#x27;s obviously fake. So, buyer beware! You definitely don&#x27;t always know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICES QUALITY SAFE SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> OVE THIS SAHMPOO.  gIVES LOTS OF VOLUME TO MY HAIR.</li>
            <li> good shampoo.....good price</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo I will use nothing ever again but this!</li>
            <li> I have to say I didn&#x27;t notice any volume difference at all.  That&#x27;s strike one.  But there are also so many other things I didn&#x27;t like that I will never repurchase this shampoo again.  Strike two was that it doesn&#x27;t lather much at all.  I&#x27;m sure this doesn&#x27;t mean that it doesn&#x27;t work, but I like a shampoo that will lather up to make me feel like my hair is being covered throughout with the product.  Strike three is the fact that I felt like every time I blow dry my hair after using this product, the roots seem a bit greasy and look tad matted.  I even rinse my hair thoroughly with cool water after using.  It might be because I use two pumps to get more coverage due to lack of lather but honestly I don&#x27;t remember my hair feeling or looking greasy at the roots after any wash with any brand of shampoo let alone a volume shampoo.  I do tend to get oily hair but that is usually on day two when I don&#x27;t wash.  Basically this shampoo is not on my list of things to buy again.  EVER.  The smell is okay but I don&#x27;t shovel out money for the smell so I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.  Do yourself a favor and try a different brand.</li>
            <li> I have short, thin, and somewhat curly hair, and just before I bought this bottle, I was using L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme conditioner. I thought Big Sexy would be worth a shot, but oh boy, I was wrong. My hair became extremely flat, lost any volume it previously held, and didn&#x27;t even smell that great. I started to think my hair was just thinning to a greater extent, but switching back to Evercreme made me think I wasn&#x27;t. I regained the volume I was used to, and I&#x27;ll just never buy this conditioner again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if your hair is beautiful, and you just want to look like a sad hobo for a few days, then I definitely recommend this product. Trust me when I say I&#x27;m pretty sure that it will wreck even the healthiest hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little drying and not healthy-looking fullness. Have yet to find one that does what I want it to.</li>
            <li> I have lots of very very thin hair and I like to wear it long but that is a challenge for me because it just does not look good on me flat. I found Big Sexy Hair about 3 years ago and have tried many volumizing shampoos along with this and just end up throwing the others away. It not just voumizes my hair but leaves it feeling clean (something many of the other volumizers do not do) and it works!  PLUS, it really does seem to help keep my color (medium brown) where the other volumizing shampoos I have used seem to lighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, regarding the delivery, can I just say that I think that UPS is TERRIBLE!!!  I have no idea what has happened to this company but over the past 6 months they have progressively taken a nose dive performance wise.  My product was no only not delivered on time but it was delivered to an apartment complex down the street. The only way I knew this was because I looked on my account tracking and saw that it was signed for by &amp;#34;leasing office&amp;#34; (I live in a house).  My address was very apparent on the package and not even close to the address of the apartment complex. This is not the first time I have had problems with my deliveries and even my Prime orders are never delivered on time any more because of UPS screw ups.  Ok, I am done with my UPS rant.  Big Hair is awesome.</li>
            <li> gives my hair body it normally does not have. I love it.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this after watching one of her Chinese talk shows that raved about it. She tried it out for two days and then complained it dried her hair out. The ingredients looked the same as my shampoo (yeah, it has sulfates) so, not wanting to waste it, I tried it out. It really does dry your hair out -- and I have oily hair. We gave it a fair shot for a few days, and we&#x27;ve decided we will not be buying this again.</li>
