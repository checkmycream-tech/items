            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I had already used this product and needed more.  </li>
            <li>You would be better off using drug store products than this product.</li>
            <li>Love this lift spray</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and hope for better results.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t really say for sure if this product is doing my hair any good, but it&#x27;s not doing it any harm either.</li>

            <li>I liked this product very much.</li>

            <li>I like it live my hear nice and look like I have morehair</li>
            <li>Just as expected  Great</li>
            <li>but my wife&#x27;s hair has started re-growth, &amp; appears full again...</li>
            <li>I give this spray a good rating because I personally like it.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>She indicated it did make her hair feel courser but said it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$</li>
            <li>its amazing what the right haircare products can do..going to give the entire line a shot and will update in about 4weeks..</li>
            <li>I really like the soft spray that easily allows me to cover the roots lightly...</li>
            <li>then really does a good job of creating lift as I blow dry my hair...</li>
            <li>Not sure how I first started using it since I do not use anything else in that line, but since using it I have only had good hair days!!!  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first day - looks and feels fuller</li>
            <li>The first time she used it you could tell a noticabe difference in the appearance of her hair.  </li>
            <li>twice as much hair after using it!  </li>
            <li>First hair product that exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li>My method is to spritz product onto hair according to directions, spray with a little water to work the product through hair more easily</li>
            <li>No dramatic changes noticed.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every kind of hair product for my fine hair that was beginning to thin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little sticky but overall great</li>
            <li>Applies well, but that&#x27;s all I can really say.</li>
            <li>Worked very well with out making my hair sticky.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This amplifying spray really works.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my thinning hair by giving what there is body that seems to plump and give a fuller look.</li>
            <li>Really can see the difference.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t need to use</li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied with the deception.</li>
            <li>i dont get a itchy scalp with this at all,my hair has so much body and volume,especially after blow drying..</li>
            <li>I have lots of natural curl, and this is all I need to do....</li>
            <li>I cant really evaluate this product yet as it says it will take several months for me to notice the difference.</li>
            <li>Can use frequently.</li>
            <li>No messy sticky residue .</li>
            <li>This is not a heavy duty stay in place spray, but it gives my hair some staying power.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s sticky but once the hair is dry it holds my style pretty well.</li>
            <li>so far it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything except dry my hair out</li>
            <li>but it takes too long to really see any results.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but it takes too long to really see any results.</li>
            <li> then I bend over again and dry my hair with the dryer in one hand while &amp;#34;scrunching&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I like the volume this gives, but it tends to dry out my hair</li>
            <li> My thin hair looks so much fuller when we use it!</li>
            <li> I spray it on my wet hair before I blow dry and style, and it does make my hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> The products have made my hair very dry and are misleading .</li>
            <li> I always keep a spray bottle of water close by since hair needs to be wet when styling.  </li>
            <li> Work it through wet hair then begin to style ...</li>
            <li> only dried hair.out after about 2 weeks of usage....</li>
            <li> Am I the only one who ended up with hard, dry and extremely tangled and stuck together hair after using this product?</li>
            <li> I am having excessive breakage due to product use and was unaware that some on the weren&#x27;t returnable .</li>
            <li> it was leaking thru the seal and leaked thru in the box onto other items.</li>
            <li> Due to age and diabetic medications, she started loosing some of her her hair..  </li>
            <li> This hair spray also does not make my scalp itchy like other hair sprays do.  </li>
            <li> This product was NOT what I expected!</li>
            <li> Must be very careful using this; makes hair sticky and when trying to brush it through, the ends become damaged.  </li>
            <li> ( I do this upside down......</li>
            <li> Down side</li>
            <li> it with the other!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it a lot, because it makes your hair fairly stiff and rough.</li>
            <li> just until it is about half dried....</li>
            <li> but it is a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while.  </li>
            <li> A little too sticky.</li>
            <li> I have limp, thinning hair from lupus and all the medications I take.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, it&#x27;s already started making my hair grow.</li>
            <li> not real sure about this one!</li>
            <li> Not sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> It gives extra body to my thin hair !  </li>
            <li> When I use it, the hair start looking like either wet or dirty.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a product that finally works for thin hair!!!</li>
            <li> Not a great look.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any dramatic lifting effect either.</li>
            <li> Sent me wrong item.</li>
            <li> This product is useless - it does nothing to lift or amplify.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

My method is to spritz product onto hair according to directions, spray with a little water to work the product through hair more easily( I do this upside down......well you know.....bent over!).

I have lots of natural curl, and this is all I need to do....no extra styling.  This product gives me great volume and control....I love this product!</li>

            <li> This product definitely makes my hair appear thicker and helps with styling.</li>
            <li> Love this..... My thin hair looks so much fuller when we use it!</li>
            <li> I liked this product very much. I just ordered 2 more bottles on Amazon. It gives extra body to my thin hair !  Sspray on hair and use a hairdryer- you&#x27;ll like the results!&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasted me quite some time, maybe 4 months. Worth it. I&#x27;ll never be without again.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Not sticky or stiff. It is all the manufacturer claims it is.</li>
            <li> No dramatic changes noticed.  Applies well, but that&#x27;s all I can really say.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  I have tried every kind of hair product for my fine hair that was beginning to thin.  It makes my hair have volume that I have not seen in years.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worked very well with out making my hair sticky. It did give it volume with my blow dryer. Good product.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first day - looks and feels fuller, even my husband noticed - it even holds up the second day! Thank you for a product that finally works for thin hair!!!</li>
            <li> This helps my hair to be thicker and it feels good on my head!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say for sure if this product is doing my hair any good, but it&#x27;s not doing it any harm either.</li>
            <li> I works..all that it says it does it does! Trudy</li>
            <li> I did not like it.  Did not add volume.</li>
            <li> Sent me wrong item. I sent me repair treatment spray.</li>
            <li> Very good product. It made my hair thicker.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it a lot, because it makes your hair fairly stiff and rough.</li>
            <li> This is the best spray around.  Love it.</li>
            <li> The item had not met my expectations. When I use it, the hair start looking like either wet or dirty. I have not noticed any dramatic lifting effect either. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my product, it really is good for my hair!!!!  I will recommend it to my friends. :o)</li>
            <li> this is the best hair care product.</li>
            <li> Would never buy again even thou it was sealed it was leaking thru the seal and leaked thru in the box onto other items. Junky product</li>
            <li> I cant really evaluate this product yet as it says it will take several months for me to notice the difference.</li>
            <li> One use and I saw a definite difference in volume of my very fine hair - felt thicker and had more volume &amp; body - impressed!  Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Good product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a friend with thinning hair. The first time she used it you could tell a noticabe difference in the appearance of her hair.  It adds lots of volume.  She indicated it did make her hair feel courser but said it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just as expected  Great</li>
            <li> Amazing product ....twice as much hair after using it!  Worth the $$</li>
            <li> This amplifying spray really works.  I have limp, thinning hair from lupus and all the medications I take.  I cannot believe what a difference this spray makes after shampooing with the Keranique shampoo. I have tried several different brands of shampoos, mousse products, sprays, etc., and nothing has worked like this.  I am a permanent customer from now on.</li>
            <li> I had already used this product and needed more.  Convenient to go to Amazon for it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months and would not give it up.  It really helps my thinning hair by giving what there is body that seems to plump and give a fuller look.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, it&#x27;s sticky but once the hair is dry it holds my style pretty well.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it... Due to age and diabetic medications, she started loosing some of her her hair..  She immediately bought 2 wigs, &amp; figured she would give the Keranique products a try... I know there are a lot of mixed reviews out there, &amp; maybe they don&#x27;t work for everyone but my wife&#x27;s hair has started re-growth, &amp; appears full again... Even her hair dresser commented that hair seemed to be growing back in, and seemed thicker, asking what she was using... My wife swears by their products...&lt;br /&gt;To me, the products seem a bit too pricey, but you know what they say, A happy wife is a happy life.... So I guess I&#x27;ll just foot the bill &amp; keep her happy ... LOL</li>
            <li> I like the volume this gives, but it tends to dry out my hair so I can&#x27;t use it all the time.</li>
            <li> This product is useless - it does nothing to lift or amplify.  You would be better off using drug store products than this product.</li>
            <li> Really can see the difference. Can use frequently. No messy sticky residue . No perfume odor. Can be reapplied easily</li>
            <li> It gives great lift and volume.</li>
            <li> This is not a heavy duty stay in place spray, but it gives my hair some staying power.  This hair spray also does not make my scalp itchy like other hair sprays do.  I give this spray a good rating because I personally like it.</li>
            <li> Great prodact at a good price.</li>
            <li> Love this lift spray but it is a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while.  I spray it on my wet hair before I blow dry and style, and it does make my hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> Good product but it takes too long to really see any results. I will continue to use it and hope for better results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works but it does.  Down side it&#x27;s a little sticky but overall great</li>
            <li> so far it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything except dry my hair out</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product gives me the lift I need.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair feel and look fuller.</li>
            <li> The product is o.k..but it makes my hair oily and the ends are dry..it does have the lift for the day and then it is gone. Did not want to use any more because my scalp started to itch too..not real sure about this one!</li>
            <li> this stuff works great,  I will order it again in the future  I puts a fulness in my thinning hair.  very nice</li>
            <li> Must be very careful using this; makes hair sticky and when trying to brush it through, the ends become damaged.  A little too sticky.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t need to use</li>
            <li> Am I the only one who ended up with hard, dry and extremely tangled and stuck together hair after using this product? I had to rinse it off with water and trying to detangle caused hairs to fall out. It was like using hair spray and getting &amp;#34;helmet head&amp;#34;. Not a great look.</li>
            <li> This product was NOT what I expected!</li>
            <li> did NOTHING for me..only dried hair.out after about 2 weeks of usage....stopped immediately....</li>
            <li> Great!  First hair product that exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> This is a great product and notice if I don&#x27;t use it, my hair does not have that thickness.  I would be lost without it.</li>
            <li> This is advertised as Amplifying Lift Spray but they actually send you the lift &amp; repair treatment spray.  I know there is actually an Amplifying Lift spray because a friend of mine uses it.  I am very dissatisfied with the deception.</li>
            <li> I like it live my hear nice and look like I have morehair</li>
            <li> this is the best root lifter i have ever used...i dont get a itchy scalp with this at all,my hair has so much body and volume,especially after blow drying..i have longer hair and hormonal changes are causing my hair to break or&amp;#34;fall&amp;#34; and it seems to be dryer than it used to and not as dense..i know this is helping these issues,my scalp tingles when i use it which i like..its amazing what the right haircare products can do..going to give the entire line a shot and will update in about 4weeks..i also use a heat protector spray when blow drying and styling.</li>
            <li> I love this spray! After a few uses, it&#x27;s already started making my hair grow.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and the Keranique Lift Spray really adds fullness and body to my hair.  I think it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
