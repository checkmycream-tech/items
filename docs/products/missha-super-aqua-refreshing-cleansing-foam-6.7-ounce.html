            <li>Love this cleanser!</li>
            <li>Love this Foam Cleanser!</li>
            <li>Now my scars are going away and my face feels light, I am overly happy.</li>
            <li>It foams up really nicely</li>
            <li>It builds up into a nice froth and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li>I think I prefer The Face Shop&#x27;s Rice Bright Foam but will happily finish this tube first.</li>
            <li>: there is just so much foam in the tube, that you get a very good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Like so many others, I love the smell of this, it&#x27;s very clean and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of K-beauty and this product is a good example of why I love their stuff.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about it was that it smells so great.</li>
            <li>Has done nothing to prevent my acne, but it helps heal it better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face in the morning to give my skin a light cleansing without drying it, and I have to say it works really nicely.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the double cleansing method.</li>
            <li>I initially was using this cleanser as a part of my evening routine after an oil-based cleanser, and it was doing a wonderful job getting all the makeup off</li>
            <li>and I am sure I will re order.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Tried a lot but love this one the most</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought those two items.  </li>
            <li>This is the best addition I made into my daily face cleaning routine.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The product is okay...</li>
            <li>I really love this cleanser</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll probably buy more</li>
            <li>I also love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>So I am so glad I decided to try this out.  </li>
            <li>I suggest to check with vendor to make sure they send you foam if thats what you prefer.</li>
            <li>I am not changing stars count because I really love Refreshing cleansing foam, just not</li>
            <li>Its not too scented but does have a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>I have used higher end brands that have not given me results as good as this product.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and fresh.</li>
            <li>Over all great moisturizer definitely worth buying over drug store brands and even higher end brands.</li>
            <li>texture is creamy, though while washing it honestly feels very &#x27;soapy&#x27;, for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li>It gets all the oils off the skin with ease and is really easy to spread over the face--you don&#x27;t have to rub it in.</li>
            <li>Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>This cleanser or Innisfree olive cleansing foam are very good choices for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Moisturizer sinks in beautifully after and the size of the bottle is HUGE!</li>
            <li>The best part is that you only need a pea size amount to wash your whole face!</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing!</li>
            <li>The product has a nice floral/citrus fragrance and a gentle feeling.</li>
            <li>If I wear light makeup it is all I need, otherwise I use after cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much that I am going to buy two more.</li>
            <li>She told me verbatim that my skin was \\&quot;saved.\\&quot; Missha&#x27;s Super Aqua line gets my full recommendation!</li>
            <li>/&gt;He said it makes his face supper clean and oil free.</li>
            <li>After using it, my face felt fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and it makes your skin really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>felt really clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>make my skin feel as clean as this does.</li>
            <li>Your face is literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>(I wear full coverage foundation) without drying out the skin.</li>
            <li>I moved it to the morning because I love the smell so much, and use another cleanser at night.</li>
            <li>leaves skin squeaky clean and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>I also use this product along with [[ASIN:B001CTCUTM Missha Super Aqua Hydrating Emulsion 5oz/150ml]].  </li>
            <li>I also bought and used their Super Aqua water supply cream.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t like any American cleanser I have ever used in the best possible way....</li>
            <li>I recently underwent my first facial (thank you, Groupon!) and the technician loved, loved my skin.</li>
            <li>As soon as I rinse off, I can feel my skin fresh and clean, it almost feels like it weighs less LOL.</li>
            <li>very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Which means that this will last a long time and the price is Awesome !!</li>
            <li>If doing an Asian double-cleansing method of skin care, this is a nice product to use after a cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li>I really love the smell of this cleansing foam and my face feel cleaned and soft.</li>
            <li>Or leftover and greasy,  This product is light, has just the right amt of gentle foam bubbles, washes off cleanly and leaves my skin feeling clean but not tight.  </li>
            <li>It really makes you feel so clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Using it along with Missha&#x27;s Super Aqua Water Supply Cream, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels a lot softer and is more often neither oily nor dry.</li>
            <li>it only took about 4 days to get it , i LOVE this product</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>I think it cleared up my acne as well :) I will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>(I wash my face more than that of course, but use the Missha cleanser just the once, last thing before exiting the shower)</li>
            <li>They never completely go away, even right after washing, even after most mud masks.  </li>
            <li>I liked the original sample which is why I ordered such a big size.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the other reviews raved about the amazing quality +</li>
            <li>the foam is soft and rich.</li>
            <li>Leaves my aging skin squeaky clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>What I have noticed is that after rinsing off this foam, it leaves the skin feeling very refreshed and not dried out at all--kind of like the squeaky clean feeling but without the dryness.</li>
            <li>Before Missha&#x27;s Super Aqua line, I had been using Clinique&#x27;s mild facial soap, and even that was a tad drying.</li>
            <li>The foam is nice and thick so my face feels really clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>think this would be more useful for people with more oily faces, less for people with dry faces like me.</li>
            <li>It feels like a product that would be very drying, like bar hand soap or something.</li>
            <li>I apply seems to sit very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin, and this cleanser seemed to strip all of it away and made my skin dry/flaky.</li>
            <li>smell is really</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and acne prone skin</li>
            <li>My husband likes it and he&#x27;s really picky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good professional facial will get rid of them, but only for about a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this makes them go away!  </li>
            <li>I have used a similar foaming cleanser one other time by a Korean brand and loved it.  </li>
            <li>only needs pea-size to clean the whole face.  </li>
            <li>Even when I am washing the product off my face, my face feels super soft and moisturized and my face looks clear and my pores are invisible!</li>
            <li>But after rinsing and drying, it definitely leaves my skin feeling both clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s invigorating to use it first thing in the morning, and it makes getting up early that much easier and something to look forward to.</li>
            <li>so I expect my face would feel clean but cream does not offer the same feeling as foam.</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t need much to work up a nice, soft lather; I imagine this is going to last me a very long time given the large size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I still have a full bottle of my current wash</li>
            <li>Makes the skin feel sensational and not dry or tight.</li>
            <li>I quickly got back online and ordered another cleansing foam</li>
            <li>Its so strange, it just feels SO CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone looking to try, that&#x27;s looking for a new skin care product.</li>
            <li>Its so soft, smells fresh and clean,and definitely leaves a &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feel as another reviewer noted...</li>
            <li>and also, I&#x27;m very sensitive in addition to being so oily, and this product has caused me no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I just think in general, the face wash I get in US drug stores are too drying for me or have too much chemicals in them..</li>
            <li>My tip would be to moisturize immediately after washing this product off the face or else your skin will get dry if you have skin more on the dry side.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently switched from neutrogena-like products I typically buy at the grocery store to this cleanser, and I have to say that I am in love.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave this product a five stars is because not only it really does freshen up my face, but it also leaves it a tad brighter.</li>
            <li>A few stubborn whiteheads that have been there for ages just kinda rolled out on their own, too, a thing that has never happened to me before - they&#x27;ve always needed extraction previously.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not at the level of full-on blackheads - there&#x27;s no inflammation, they&#x27;re far too small to remove, the pore isn&#x27;t really clogged exactly -</li>
            <li>I noticed I felt super-clean after using it, but I never expected that!  </li>
            <li>If you have super-oily-oily-oily skin, like me, the kind that starts getting greasy again 20 minutes after a shower, you know those tiny little black pinpoints you get in your pores?  </li>
            <li>Although I tend to have occasional acne, this cleanser doesn&#x27;t flare it up at all, nor does it irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day as I fear with daily use it could be too stripping, but no complaints so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a month along with some other products and my face has cleared up so much.</li>
            <li>You just need a little to wash your whole face!  </li>
            <li>when used daily, my skin looks brighter, smoother, and in general, nicer.</li>
            <li>, mad my face less oily and after about a week of using it , I saw a slight difference in my face , some of my acne has gone away and is less noticeable , right after using it my face feels great and is much brighter .</li>
            <li>I have a very dry skin and this is one of the very few cleansers than can actually clean very well and not dry  out my skin to extremely tight.</li>
            <li>It really cleanses my skin and brightens it as well, although it&#x27;s a little drying.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> What I have noticed is that after rinsing off this foam, it leaves the skin feeling very refreshed and not dried out at all--kind of like the squeaky clean feeling but without the dryness.</li>
            <li> Before Missha&#x27;s Super Aqua line, I had been using Clinique&#x27;s mild facial soap, and even that was a tad drying.</li>
            <li> The foam is nice and thick so my face feels really clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> think this would be more useful for people with more oily faces, less for people with dry faces like me.</li>
            <li> It feels like a product that would be very drying, like bar hand soap or something.</li>
            <li> I apply seems to sit very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, and this cleanser seemed to strip all of it away and made my skin dry/flaky.</li>
            <li> smell is really</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and acne prone skin</li>
            <li> My husband likes it and he&#x27;s really picky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A good professional facial will get rid of them, but only for about a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this makes them go away!  </li>
            <li> I have used a similar foaming cleanser one other time by a Korean brand and loved it.  </li>
            <li> only needs pea-size to clean the whole face.  </li>
            <li> Even when I am washing the product off my face, my face feels super soft and moisturized and my face looks clear and my pores are invisible!</li>
            <li> But after rinsing and drying, it definitely leaves my skin feeling both clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s invigorating to use it first thing in the morning, and it makes getting up early that much easier and something to look forward to.</li>
            <li> so I expect my face would feel clean but cream does not offer the same feeling as foam.</li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t need much to work up a nice, soft lather; I imagine this is going to last me a very long time given the large size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I still have a full bottle of my current wash</li>
            <li> Makes the skin feel sensational and not dry or tight.</li>
            <li> I quickly got back online and ordered another cleansing foam</li>
            <li> Its so strange, it just feels SO CLEAN.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone looking to try, that&#x27;s looking for a new skin care product.</li>
            <li> Its so soft, smells fresh and clean,and definitely leaves a &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feel as another reviewer noted...</li>
            <li> and also, I&#x27;m very sensitive in addition to being so oily, and this product has caused me no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I just think in general, the face wash I get in US drug stores are too drying for me or have too much chemicals in them..</li>
            <li> My tip would be to moisturize immediately after washing this product off the face or else your skin will get dry if you have skin more on the dry side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched from neutrogena-like products I typically buy at the grocery store to this cleanser, and I have to say that I am in love.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this product a five stars is because not only it really does freshen up my face, but it also leaves it a tad brighter.</li>
            <li> A few stubborn whiteheads that have been there for ages just kinda rolled out on their own, too, a thing that has never happened to me before - they&#x27;ve always needed extraction previously.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not at the level of full-on blackheads - there&#x27;s no inflammation, they&#x27;re far too small to remove, the pore isn&#x27;t really clogged exactly -</li>
            <li> I noticed I felt super-clean after using it, but I never expected that!  </li>
            <li> If you have super-oily-oily-oily skin, like me, the kind that starts getting greasy again 20 minutes after a shower, you know those tiny little black pinpoints you get in your pores?  </li>
            <li> Although I tend to have occasional acne, this cleanser doesn&#x27;t flare it up at all, nor does it irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day as I fear with daily use it could be too stripping, but no complaints so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month along with some other products and my face has cleared up so much.</li>
            <li> You just need a little to wash your whole face!  </li>
            <li> when used daily, my skin looks brighter, smoother, and in general, nicer.</li>
            <li> , mad my face less oily and after about a week of using it , I saw a slight difference in my face , some of my acne has gone away and is less noticeable , right after using it my face feels great and is much brighter .</li>
            <li> I have a very dry skin and this is one of the very few cleansers than can actually clean very well and not dry  out my skin to extremely tight.</li>
            <li> It really cleanses my skin and brightens it as well, although it&#x27;s a little drying.</li>
            <li> Very little product goes a long way to a very luxurious lather.  </li>
            <li> I accidentally left Cleansing Foam at the gym the other day and of course, foam was not there the next when I came back.</li>
            <li> not good like first generation.</li>
            <li> 💟💟💓💓and the container/bottle that it comes in is a lot larger than I expected to be</li>
            <li> I am going to keep using the cleanser as long as they make it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used manymany American facial washing products from MaryKay to Ceravue to hi-end luxury brands and either my skin feels tight and dry.</li>
            <li> But I feel like it strips my face of a lot of oil and leaves my face really dry.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to those who like a faint fragrance in their cleanser, that washes clean.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be combination: sometimes oily, sometimes very dry.</li>
            <li> Yet later on it becomes kinda dry after i used it for few weeks.</li>
            <li> after a couple weeks, I always end up with tiny little bumps on my face..  </li>
            <li> I have been struggling with bad acne for about five months now, nothing was making it better.</li>
            <li> Only a little dime sized amount is needed for this wash to foam up your whole face, and it gets squeaky clean without drying out horribly!</li>
            <li> makes me want to purchase other k-beauty products.</li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;ll try some other Missha products as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> i am too lazy to send it back</li>
            <li> I originally disliked it but tried to stick with it because I felt that it was such a waste.</li>
            <li> A very little amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Considering a dime size is all I need,this will last me a year, at least.</li>
            <li> Once rinsed, my skin literally squeaks with a clean feeling, without the unpleasant tightness/itchiness of something that&#x27;s too harsh; it has a hydrated feeling.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount and it foams up quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> , those little black pinpoints were all gone and they are staying gone.  </li>
            <li> because then I get all these little pimples on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months, give or take a few weeks....)</li>
            <li> usually my face gets like five each day.</li>
            <li> I usually use cleanser every morning after I workout</li>
            <li> I was shocked and surprised.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, my skin does feel a little tight afterwards, but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about that</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re THERE, and they make your skin look DIRTY.  </li>
            <li> It got here in about 4 days which I didn&#x27;t think was bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month along with some other products and my face has cleared up so much. It got here in about 4 days which I didn&#x27;t think was bad and everything was just as it was describbed. I would recommend this for anyone looking to try, that&#x27;s looking for a new skin care product.</li>
            <li> Has done nothing to prevent my acne, but it helps heal it better. Smells amazing and fresh. Not drying at all.</li>
            <li> You just need a little to wash your whole face!  It really makes you feel so clean and refreshed.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Received it as a sample with another purchase and immediately came back to order it.  Leaves my aging skin squeaky clean and soft.  Like so many others, I love the smell of this, it&#x27;s very clean and pleasant.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be combination: sometimes oily, sometimes very dry. I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face in the morning to give my skin a light cleansing without drying it, and I have to say it works really nicely. Using it along with Missha&#x27;s Super Aqua Water Supply Cream, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels a lot softer and is more often neither oily nor dry. Although I tend to have occasional acne, this cleanser doesn&#x27;t flare it up at all, nor does it irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is creamy, though while washing it honestly feels very &#x27;soapy&#x27;, for lack of a better word. It feels like a product that would be very drying, like bar hand soap or something. But after rinsing and drying, it definitely leaves my skin feeling both clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Cool and refreshing. Perfect for the double cleansing method.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing! I was my face multiple times a day with this product and it feels like an instant face lift. Even when I am washing the product off my face, my face feels super soft and moisturized and my face looks clear and my pores are invisible! My tip would be to moisturize immediately after washing this product off the face or else your skin will get dry if you have skin more on the dry side. Over all great moisturizer definitely worth buying over drug store brands and even higher end brands. I have used higher end brands that have not given me results as good as this product.</li>
            <li> leaves skin squeaky clean and fresh looking. very fast shipping! makes me want to purchase other k-beauty products.</li>
            <li> I am of Asian descent, and my skin tends towards dryness rather than oiliness. I also use this product along with [[ASIN:B001CTCUTM Missha Super Aqua Hydrating Emulsion 5oz/150ml]].  Before Missha&#x27;s Super Aqua line, I had been using Clinique&#x27;s mild facial soap, and even that was a tad drying. Then I discovered this stuff on a chance trip to Seoul, and I was an immediate convert. The results: radiant skin, and kissably-soft cheeks. I recently underwent my first facial (thank you, Groupon!) and the technician loved, loved my skin. She told me verbatim that my skin was \\&quot;saved.\\&quot; Missha&#x27;s Super Aqua line gets my full recommendation!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleansing foam! I&#x27;ve recently switched from neutrogena-like products I typically buy at the grocery store to this cleanser, and I have to say that I am in love. I use this cleanser in the shower and wash it off with the running water. The first thing I noticed about it was that it smells so great. It&#x27;s invigorating to use it first thing in the morning, and it makes getting up early that much easier and something to look forward to. It gets all the oils off the skin with ease and is really easy to spread over the face--you don&#x27;t have to rub it in. I initially was using this cleanser as a part of my evening routine after an oil-based cleanser, and it was doing a wonderful job getting all the makeup off (I wear full coverage foundation) without drying out the skin. I moved it to the morning because I love the smell so much, and use another cleanser at night. What I have noticed is that after rinsing off this foam, it leaves the skin feeling very refreshed and not dried out at all--kind of like the squeaky clean feeling but without the dryness. So, afterward, all the lotions and foundation I apply seems to sit very well. I have to say that I will very likely buy this product again after this one runs out, but it probably won&#x27;t happen for awhile: there is just so much foam in the tube, that you get a very good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping. Great product.</li>
            <li> Very little product goes a long way to a very luxurious lather.  I have used this daily since I received it and I am sure I will re order.  Its not too scented but does have a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> I am having a combination skin and this product make me feel great at the beginng. Yet later on it becomes kinda dry after i used it for few weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the other reviews raved about the amazing quality + great price.&lt;br /&gt;I used it and it&#x27;s okay. The foam is nice and thick so my face feels really clean after I use it. But I feel like it strips my face of a lot of oil and leaves my face really dry. Not too crazy about that because then I get all these little pimples on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be more useful for people with more oily faces, less for people with dry faces like me.</li>
            <li> Tried a lot but love this one the most</li>
            <li> Perfect to clean your face...</li>
            <li> I really like this foaming cleanser. It foams up really nicely and you really don&#x27;t need much to work up a nice, soft lather; I imagine this is going to last me a very long time given the large size of the bottle. The product has a nice floral/citrus fragrance and a gentle feeling. Once rinsed, my skin literally squeaks with a clean feeling, without the unpleasant tightness/itchiness of something that&#x27;s too harsh; it has a hydrated feeling.</li>
            <li> not good like first generation.</li>
            <li> I liked the original sample which is why I ordered such a big size. It builds up into a nice froth and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. Some parts of the foam hardened towards the end life of the product but until then, I was very happy using this cleanser morning and night. I recommend it to those who like a faint fragrance in their cleanser, that washes clean.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of K-beauty and this product is a good example of why I love their stuff.  I&#x27;ve used manymany American facial washing products from MaryKay to Ceravue to hi-end luxury brands and either my skin feels tight and dry. Stripped so to speak. Or leftover and greasy,  This product is light, has just the right amt of gentle foam bubbles, washes off cleanly and leaves my skin feeling clean but not tight.  This is a product for life.xxoocf</li>
            <li> It is no longer available on Amazon, I think, but it is incredible stuff. Makes the skin feel sensational and not dry or tight. A very little amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, and this cleanser seemed to strip all of it away and made my skin dry/flaky.</li>
            <li> I never ever write reviews, but this product is like the best thing imaginable for your face. I have been struggling with bad acne for about five months now, nothing was making it better. I decided to ditch american products and go ahead and buy this face wash. Again. Best thing ever. In two days, my face has only acquired/gained, one pimple. I was shocked and surprised. usually my face gets like five each day. Now my scars are going away and my face feels light, I am overly happy. I also bought and used their Super Aqua water supply cream. Def. recommend that to. I am so glad I bought those two items.  Face loved them!</li>
            <li> smell is really good！and the foam is soft and rich.</li>
            <li> Love the product !!!  I have very oily skin and acne prone skin , mad my face less oily and after about a week of using it , I saw a slight difference in my face , some of my acne has gone away and is less noticeable , right after using it my face feels great and is much brighter . I use this about 1-3 times a day every day and has saw a great difference . I would totally recommend this product to anyone who has acne prone skin or oily skin , I would repurchase this product , and bonus it only took about 4 days to get it , i LOVE this product 💟💟💓💓and the container/bottle that it comes in is a lot larger than I expected to be</li>
            <li> Nice foaming cleanser! If I wear light makeup it is all I need, otherwise I use after cleansing oil. I have older slightly acne prone skin and have had no breakout issues. Not overly drying either. I think I prefer The Face Shop&#x27;s Rice Bright Foam but will happily finish this tube first.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! The smell is nice and it makes your skin really soft and smooth. I think it cleared up my acne as well :) I will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> This is the best addition I made into my daily face cleaning routine.</li>
            <li> works great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> For some reason I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be as big as it was! Only a little dime sized amount is needed for this wash to foam up your whole face, and it gets squeaky clean without drying out horribly! I really like it!</li>
            <li> All you need is the size of a dime and it magically lathers your face and neck!! Its so soft, smells fresh and clean,and definitely leaves a &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feel as another reviewer noted...but it&#x27;s not drying at all. Its so strange, it just feels SO CLEAN. Moisturizer sinks in beautifully after and the size of the bottle is HUGE! Considering a dime size is all I need,this will last me a year, at least. I love it.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this product a five stars is because not only it really does freshen up my face, but it also leaves it a tad brighter.</li>
            <li> If doing an Asian double-cleansing method of skin care, this is a nice product to use after a cleansing oil.  You only need a very small amount and it foams up quite a bit.  I don&#x27;t use it every day as I fear with daily use it could be too stripping, but no complaints so far.  My husband uses it daily and likes it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> The product is okay... It took some time to get used to it. I originally disliked it but tried to stick with it because I felt that it was such a waste. Would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> If you have super-oily-oily-oily skin, like me, the kind that starts getting greasy again 20 minutes after a shower, you know those tiny little black pinpoints you get in your pores?  They&#x27;re not at the level of full-on blackheads - there&#x27;s no inflammation, they&#x27;re far too small to remove, the pore isn&#x27;t really clogged exactly - but they&#x27;re THERE, and they make your skin look DIRTY.  All the time!  They never completely go away, even right after washing, even after most mud masks.  A good professional facial will get rid of them, but only for about a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this makes them go away!  I noticed I felt super-clean after using it, but I never expected that!  After about a week of using this cleanser once a day (I wash my face more than that of course, but use the Missha cleanser just the once, last thing before exiting the shower), those little black pinpoints were all gone and they are staying gone.  A few stubborn whiteheads that have been there for ages just kinda rolled out on their own, too, a thing that has never happened to me before - they&#x27;ve always needed extraction previously.  I am going to keep using the cleanser as long as they make it and I can get it, and I think I&#x27;ll try some other Missha products as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and also, I&#x27;m very sensitive in addition to being so oily, and this product has caused me no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> only needs pea-size to clean the whole face.  felt really clean afterwards. love it!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser! I have a very dry skin and this is one of the very few cleansers than can actually clean very well and not dry  out my skin to extremely tight. This cleanser or Innisfree olive cleansing foam are very good choices for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love this Foam Cleanser! After using it, my face felt fresh and clean! The best part is that you only need a pea size amount to wash your whole face! Which means that this will last a long time and the price is Awesome !!</li>
            <li> great product! feeling refreshed every time I use this</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t like any American cleanser I have ever used in the best possible way.... when used daily, my skin looks brighter, smoother, and in general, nicer. I have extremely oily skin and this totally helps keep that at bay without drying my skin out.  Admittedly, my skin does feel a little tight afterwards, but not in a bad way. I really love this cleanser and I&#x27;ll probably buy more when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months, give or take a few weeks....)</li>
            <li> You know how people use the phrase &amp;#34;squeaky clean?&amp;#34; Well this is what your face feels like after you use it. I have never had a face cleaner make my skin feel as clean as this does. Your face is literally squeaky clean. I bought this to test it out and I love it so much that I am going to buy two more. This is a must try and at a great price!</li>
            <li> It really cleanses my skin and brightens it as well, although it&#x27;s a little drying.</li>
            <li> i got the cleansing cream. does not foam. i am too lazy to send it back</li>
            <li> I have used a similar foaming cleanser one other time by a Korean brand and loved it.  I also love this cleanser.  I just think in general, the face wash I get in US drug stores are too drying for me or have too much chemicals in them.. after a couple weeks, I always end up with tiny little bumps on my face..  So I am so glad I decided to try this out.  As soon as I rinse off, I can feel my skin fresh and clean, it almost feels like it weighs less LOL. I still have a full bottle of my current wash (Neutrogena Naturals purifying facial cleanser) but I am already switched to my regimen with this Missha cleansing foam &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> I use Missha BB cream so I purchased cleanser to see how it would work with my skin. I really love the smell of this cleansing foam and my face feel cleaned and soft. With warmer weather coming up, I have to figure out how to keep BB cream on my face longer.  UPDATE: I accidentally left Cleansing Foam at the gym the other day and of course, foam was not there the next when I came back. I quickly got back online and ordered another cleansing foam BUT item arrived was Cleansing CREAM. I figured I&#x27;ll give it a try and hopefully have same results... not so. I usually use cleanser every morning after I workout so I expect my face would feel clean but cream does not offer the same feeling as foam. I have to say my face feel oily and pores definitely are not cleaned as compared to foam. I am returning product and will purchase foam from same vendor I did initially. I suggest to check with vendor to make sure they send you foam if thats what you prefer. I am not changing stars count because I really love Refreshing cleansing foam, just not the vendor I purchased last from.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it and he&#x27;s really picky.&lt;br /&gt;He said it makes his face supper clean and oil free.</li>
