    <ol>
            <li>And I&#x27;m impressed they sent a replacement.</li>
            <li>Because it is somewhat magnified, it is perfect for me to tweeze my eyebrows and apply my eye makeup!</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT MIRROR.</li>
            <li>Hardly a fair deal on a $19.99 product!  </li>
            <li>great for in the shower, I don&#x27;t use the suction cups but use the stand as a handle and adjustable magnification is great.</li>
            <li>Great improvement.    </li>
            <li>The mirror works great.  </li>
            <li>i bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and he says it works great.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower and it helps speed up my morning routine greatly.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>, However, the suctions work great for about 4 weeks or so.</li>
            <li>The suction cups work great too.</li>
            <li>as a fogless mirror it&#x27;s not so great</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not that great</li>
            <li>We will try to find good suction cups separately.</li>
            <li>However, for this price its a good mirror.</li>
            <li>well it&#x27;s a good size.</li>
            <li>The mirrors are designed nicely and work well.</li>
            <li>tiled shower, so since can&#x27;t stand on own, doesn&#x27;t work well for us.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, a nice product.</li>
            <li>The fogless feature is nice because when you are close up it won&#x27;t fog up by you breathing on it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own and works much better</li>
            <li>All I&#x27;ve ever had to do is get 1 hand full of water to splash on the mirror, and I&#x27;m good to shave.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still effective by just throwing some water on it, and it&#x27;s holding strong.</li>
            <li>On top of that, this wasn&#x27;t even that cheap!</li>
            <li>The Magnification was the selling point for me and it works as advertised but like most mirrors</li>
            <li>This is an OK mirror but doesn&#x27;t adhere to a marble wall for more than about an hour.  </li>
            <li>When you can clear the surface, and get a nice layer of water on the mirror, it works great.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is that it works better than nothing.</li>
            <li>To going, well what the hell was that sound?!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It has scarred my wife many times falling during a night.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work appropriately 3)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to magnify while shaving and at the highest magnification I can literally see every hair on my face. :)    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure their are safer and better ways to clean</li>
            <li>They have even made improvements to the suction cups so that they stick to smooth surfaces even better.  </li>
            <li>Great for men with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far this mirror has worked out great.</li>
            <li>Works as expected, perfect for shaving your face in the shower.  </li>
            <li>They fit perfectly onto a single 4 inch tile.  </li>
            <li>If you have the patience for it, and just want a basic cheap shower mirror, this could work, but if you want reliability and true fog-free mirror, you&#x27;re best to buy something else.</li>
            <li>We made sure the surface was clean, and cleaned the suction cups again, and tried again.  </li>
            <li>At first, we really liked it.  </li>
            <li>and it works fine.</li>
            <li>It does fog up in the mornings, but I just run my fingers over it and its fine.</li>
            <li>After waking up from some awesome dreams, to bidda bing bidda bang sound some where in the house, jumping out of bed looking to beat someone down.</li>
            <li>Overall though I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Fortunately it didn&#x27;t break, but it has chipped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using the cleaning cloths that came with it, it still doesn&#x27;t stay fog free.</li>
            <li>I thought it was blurry because it wasn&#x27;t clean.</li>
            <li>To clean my mirror</li>
            <li>This was the most reasonable shower mirror</li>
            <li>The reflection is good and I&#x27;m back to shaving in the shower!!</li>
            <li>but i dont think he really cares from what he says he is extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>This one, like the other two, worked great for about four months.</li>
            <li>It took me a few uses to get used to the 5X mirror magnify, but once I did it was great</li>
            <li>I like it better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Even then it rarely falls.</li>
            <li>so I expected good quality and chose it over another option.  </li>
            <li>I had it within days, which is excellent service, and shows they were standing behind their product.  </li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>Again, having tried many other brands in the past, I&#x27;ve found this one to be the best value for the money and most importantly it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>After using it a few more times, I think it is a drawback that you can&#x27;t adjust the angle of this mirror, but otherwise it seems ok.  </li>
            <li>Use fog free cleaning solution only to clean, otherwise, it will scratch mirror surface.</li>
            <li>The only time it falls is if I go away for a week or more</li>
            <li>It was actually for my husband who wanted to save time by shaving in the shower, and from what I hear, he&#x27;s quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what everyone fears...falls off the tiled shower walls about every month.</li>
            <li>, it fogs up within 2 minutes of the first shower of its first use and repeats every shower.</li>
            <li>First the mirror bubbled up, turn it detached and began falling out and now it&#x27;s peeling.  </li>
            <li>first time it lasted 6 months..</li>
            <li>at first.  </li>
            <li>so if you clean it use something very soft.</li>
            <li>Very cheep construction.</li>
            <li>The coating used to keep the mirror fog free just does not seem to last.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this mirror!  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t want to invest much in one and find out it didn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes this.  </li>
            <li>But on the 4th day after I purchased it -- while turning the mirror gently which is how you change the magnification --</li>
            <li>Throw some water on it, and still very clear.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 cups still holding.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband last year and he seemed to enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>It sticks very well to our surround wall.</li>
            <li>For $20 I don&#x27;t expect much....</li>
            <li>After my search was concluded and finding the mirror laying in the bathtub, I must say, this mirror is very well made.</li>
            <li>so I took it and placed it on my vanity mirror for getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>Mirror works very well in shower.</li>
            <li>It remains fog free and the vacuum cups hold well.</li>
            <li>I simply spray the mirror when I clean the shower, let sit for 10 seconds and then rinse off.</li>
            <li>But that requires using this special cleaning pad, and they only supply you with one pad.</li>
            <li>However, I am not buying a spray to use on this mirror, as it&#x27;s more money and not worth the hassle in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot even tell you how old the first one was.  </li>
            <li>The three suction cups have a double cup design and work better than most with only occasional adjustments needed to adhere it to the flat surface of the shower.  </li>
            <li>However, the magnification in the mirror is a bit high.</li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t mind wiping a wet hand across the surface of the mirror, it will stay fog free for a couple of minutes before fogging up again.  </li>
            <li>However, it would be nice to get at least a year out of these mirrors.</li>
            <li>The suction cup mount promptly fell right off the wall, but the two sided tape holds solid.</li>
            <li>No big deal right?  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted three years with minimal maintenance performed, quite a bargain for such a cheap mirror.  </li>
            <li>I would request my money back, but at this point I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the hassle, so I thought I would warn as many as I can instead.</li>
            <li>I have had the new mirror on glass block in our shower and cannot even get it to budge</li>
            <li>I just wanted to put a new one in the shower for him.</li>
            <li>After going through many different brands of mirors over the years I finally settled on this one about fifteen years ago and have always bought this same mirror ever since.</li>
            <li>After that time it became more and more difficult to keep clear and a month or so later was completly \\&quot;fogged\\&quot; even without the shower running.    </li>
            <li>I immediately lost the sticky things that you can use to hang it with, but we just have it on a little built in shelf in the shower and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>It clearly snapped in two, which is not what you expect of a bolt,</li>
            <li>(image is clear on that one, not distorted)</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t fog up and you can clearly see yourself in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>The old suction cups used to let go at about 0200 after about 4 months of holding.  </li>
            <li>A complete fog mirror.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this little mirror for my husband to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>Others have discussed the limited number of cleaning pads supplied by the manufacturer which is true, but again for the price only so much should be expected.  </li>
            <li>While still functional at the end of that time, it finally sucumbed to water spots/stains and my desire to get a new one.</li>
            <li>Not worth the money the mirror fogged right up</li>
            <li>Put all three cups on the back and so far, it sticks like it was glued to the shower wall.</li>
            <li>Image very clear if you run a little water over the mirror when ready to shave.</li>
            <li>Not exactly fogging, but large drops.      </li>
            <li>When I first received this product, I didn&#x27;t realize that the blurriness of the mirror was due to an actual defect in the mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does provide a magnified view, but really is distorted due to the fogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I occasionally have to spray with soap scum remover that I use to clean my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It does fog up a little, especially if you take really hot showers(like me), but with a swipe of your hand or a splash of water, it goes fogless again with no residue, so all in all</li>
            <li>My problem with previous mirrors is that they were cheaply made, wouldn&#x27;t stick or only last a few months.</li>
            <li>my other complaint is that it scratches really easy</li>

            <li> The suction cup mount promptly fell right off the wall, but the two sided tape holds solid.</li>
            <li> No big deal right?  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted three years with minimal maintenance performed, quite a bargain for such a cheap mirror.  </li>
            <li> I would request my money back, but at this point I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the hassle, so I thought I would warn as many as I can instead.</li>
            <li> I have had the new mirror on glass block in our shower and cannot even get it to budge</li>
            <li> I just wanted to put a new one in the shower for him.</li>
            <li> After going through many different brands of mirors over the years I finally settled on this one about fifteen years ago and have always bought this same mirror ever since.</li>
            <li> After that time it became more and more difficult to keep clear and a month or so later was completly \\&quot;fogged\\&quot; even without the shower running.    </li>
            <li> I immediately lost the sticky things that you can use to hang it with, but we just have it on a little built in shelf in the shower and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> It clearly snapped in two, which is not what you expect of a bolt,</li>
            <li> (image is clear on that one, not distorted)</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t fog up and you can clearly see yourself in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> The old suction cups used to let go at about 0200 after about 4 months of holding.  </li>
            <li> A complete fog mirror.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this little mirror for my husband to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> Others have discussed the limited number of cleaning pads supplied by the manufacturer which is true, but again for the price only so much should be expected.  </li>
            <li> While still functional at the end of that time, it finally sucumbed to water spots/stains and my desire to get a new one.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money the mirror fogged right up</li>
            <li> Put all three cups on the back and so far, it sticks like it was glued to the shower wall.</li>
            <li> Image very clear if you run a little water over the mirror when ready to shave.</li>
            <li> Not exactly fogging, but large drops.      </li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I didn&#x27;t realize that the blurriness of the mirror was due to an actual defect in the mirror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does provide a magnified view, but really is distorted due to the fogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I occasionally have to spray with soap scum remover that I use to clean my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It does fog up a little, especially if you take really hot showers(like me), but with a swipe of your hand or a splash of water, it goes fogless again with no residue, so all in all</li>
            <li> My problem with previous mirrors is that they were cheaply made, wouldn&#x27;t stick or only last a few months.</li>
            <li> my other complaint is that it scratches really easy</li>
            <li> it takes me to finally break down and get a new one.  </li>
            <li> By the time you are going to shower the next morning or evening, the shower is dry, suction cups do not hold, it falls.</li>
            <li> but once you got the protective coating off the &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; it was more like reflective fake mental, plus is</li>
            <li> but so far splash a little water on it</li>
            <li> well, one minor one, but not the product&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> I will say if I just wipe it with my wet hands while in the shower, it does in fact allow me to see clearly enough to shave.</li>
            <li> Also it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It fogs up briefly if its cold then it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I catch it in time, however there have been several nights that have woken me up to a crash and broken my razors because of the poor suction.</li>
            <li> did I realize that there were tiny little scratches causing the mirror to look deformed.</li>
            <li> Also the suction cups do not hold even when you wet them.</li>
            <li> which would allow the mirrow to last longer, but for the price I don&#x27;t mind replacing these every few years.</li>
            <li> If you wet the mirror, it works.</li>
            <li> You need to wet the mirror before you can use it or it fogs up.</li>
            <li> There were other mirrors more expensive, but some had negative reviews</li>
            <li> I had this mirror for 2 months, it had begun fogging, so I did what any average person with limited time would do...</li>
            <li> Not a great product, you get what you pay for and this is a classic example.</li>
            <li> It had this weird peeling stuff that came off the first time he used it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I change them out is that over time the reflective coating will chip away on the edges and at some point (usually between one and two years)</li>
            <li> My husband just asked for another one for our other bathroom</li>
            <li> It stays up so long as I push in the suction cups every few days.  </li>
            <li> First one I only put two of the suction cups on the back and after about 3 years, it fell off the way and broke the razor holding base.  </li>
            <li> You also need to periodically wet it after a few minutes or it gets little drops all over and nothing is visible.</li>
            <li> You should get about a year or less out of them.</li>
            <li> Fogs slightly.  </li>
            <li> My fogless mirror was anything less than fogless.</li>
            <li> Wrong, if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, this \\&quot;fog less\\&quot; mirror started to fog even more.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money and it is total crap item very overpriced as well.</li>
            <li> They all became unusable after a few months.  </li>
            <li> this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s missing the suction cups.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, the coating peeled off and it is not fog-free.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now 4th year as I was using it, and I&#x27;m finally getting tired of it.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> so far I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Mirror image is not great- slightly distorted.</li>
            <li> it is stuck so hard.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to see when you arer shaving.  </li>
            <li> Magnification poor- changing it does VERY little.  </li>
            <li> Seriously bummed.</li>
            <li> Not good mirror.  </li>
            <li> This is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> Not a good idea to buy a mirror that diverts the water from the shower head through the mirror.</li>
            <li> The twist zoom feature is total crap.</li>
            <li> Poor product..</li>
            <li> reflection is poor after a week of use... used the cleanser wipes that was included but did not make any improvements.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> You twist it and you look weird like in a circus mirror.</li>
            <li> useless</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not glamorous or expensive looking.  </li>
            <li> Horrible, it totally reduced the water pressure of my shower head.</li>
            <li> Everything is wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> When I bought my condo 6 years ago I could not get the shower head off my shower and was afraid I would twist it off.</li>
            <li> I guess this was a bad idea, because after doing so, the clock died immediately.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product, despite the fact that the magnifying feature worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Also, it fogs like crazy!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Every time I move I seem to break or lose a mirror and hate the weeks or months</li>
            <li> the bolt that holds the mirror to its suction-cup base broke.  </li>
            <li> You must have a filthy house if they don&#x27;t stick.  </li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  </li>
            <li> a horrible quality, and at that time I have paid for it twice as much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is one horrible mirror!</li>
            <li> Manufacture displayed horrible customer service, 2)</li>

            <li> great for in the shower, I don&#x27;t use the suction cups but use the stand as a handle and adjustable magnification is great.</li>
            <li> Very cheep construction. the mirror fogged up after a week or so. It had this weird peeling stuff that came off the first time he used it. Also the suction cups do not hold even when you wet them. The twist zoom feature is total crap. You twist it and you look weird like in a circus mirror. Waste of money and it is total crap item very overpriced as well.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and it didn&#x27;t even last 2 months.  The mirror part started fading to where he couldn&#x27;t see in it anymore.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have had several Zadro fogless mirrors so that I can shave while in the shower.  The key word here is \\&quot;several\\&quot;.  They all became unusable after a few months.  The coating used to keep the mirror fog free just does not seem to last.  The bottom line is that these things are alright if you know going in that they will need to be replaced in fairly short order.  For that reason, buy the cheapest style you can and skip the more expensive ones with radios, lights, etc. built in.</li>
            <li> This is now the third mirror that I have purchased.  Every time I move I seem to break or lose a mirror and hate the weeks or months it takes me to finally break down and get a new one.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this mirror!  They have even made improvements to the suction cups so that they stick to smooth surfaces even better.  The old suction cups used to let go at about 0200 after about 4 months of holding.  I have had the new mirror on glass block in our shower and cannot even get it to budge it is stuck so hard.  Great improvement.    Thanks.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I didn&#x27;t realize that the blurriness of the mirror was due to an actual defect in the mirror. I thought it was blurry because it wasn&#x27;t clean. Not until I applied the \\&quot;fog-free\\&quot; solution did I realize that there were tiny little scratches causing the mirror to look deformed. On top of that, this wasn&#x27;t even that cheap! I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was the most reasonable shower mirror and I thought I would try it for my husband so he could shave in the shower.  There were other mirrors more expensive, but some had negative reviews so I didn&#x27;t want to invest much in one and find out it didn&#x27;t work well.  My husband really likes this.  It does get fogged up, but you just wipe it away.  It magnifies also.  I immediately lost the sticky things that you can use to hang it with, but we just have it on a little built in shelf in the shower and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I like it better than my old one.  I would reccomend this item to my friends and son-in-laws.</li>
            <li> this was a waste of money. it doesn&#x27;t stick to the shower at all. useless</li>
            <li> The mirrors are designed nicely and work well. Over time, they degrade. The mirror material starts coming off and eventually the mirror becomes obscure.  You should get about a year or less out of them.</li>
            <li> The Magnification was the selling point for me and it works as advertised but like most mirrors it still fogs during your shower.  Overall though I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is an OK mirror but doesn&#x27;t adhere to a marble wall for more than about an hour.  I have resorted to attaching it to the wall when I start my shower and detaching it when I finish.  Otherwise it will fall to the floor.    I would not buy this item again!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get foggy in the shower. And that&#x27;s what I was looking for.  Great for men with sensitive skin so they can shave while showering.</li>
            <li> Poor product.. reflection is poor after a week of use... used the cleanser wipes that was included but did not make any improvements.</li>
            <li> It actually stays stuck to the wall of the shower!  Image very clear if you run a little water over the mirror when ready to shave.</li>
            <li> After going through many different brands of mirors over the years I finally settled on this one about fifteen years ago and have always bought this same mirror ever since. I&#x27;ve even ordered by mail when I couldn&#x27;t find in retail stores and before Amazon and internet shopping became the norm. The reason I keep buying this prodcut is simple; it works well, is easilly cleaned and lasts for two years. My problem with previous mirrors is that they were cheaply made, wouldn&#x27;t stick or only last a few months. Without spending a fortune I always keep two of these. One in the shower and one as a backup for when I finally give up on the one I&#x27;m currently using. I have no problems with the mirror ever not sticking. The only time it falls is if I go away for a week or more and havn&#x27;t used the shower. Even then it rarely falls. The only reason I change them out is that over time the reflective coating will chip away on the edges and at some point (usually between one and two years) I feel like replacing. To clean my mirror I occasionally have to spray with soap scum remover that I use to clean my bathroom. I simply spray the mirror when I clean the shower, let sit for 10 seconds and then rinse off. I&#x27;m sure their are safer and better ways to clean which would allow the mirrow to last longer, but for the price I don&#x27;t mind replacing these every few years. Again, having tried many other brands in the past, I&#x27;ve found this one to be the best value for the money and most importantly it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Watch out for the quality of this Z&#x27;fogless Ultra 5x Fog-free Shower Mirror, model Z500 by Zadro.  It&#x27;s made in the USA so I expected good quality and chose it over another option.  But on the 4th day after I purchased it -- while turning the mirror gently which is how you change the magnification -- the bolt that holds the mirror to its suction-cup base broke.  It clearly snapped in two, which is not what you expect of a bolt, right?  Something is amiss here in quality control, and if you go to Zadro and check their return policy, they expect you to pay a $10 processing fee to use their warranty and get a replacement.  Hardly a fair deal on a $19.99 product!  Perhaps it was just a defect in the one I bought - but buyer beware.    3/15/10 Update: After emailing Zadro about this issue, they responded immediately and sent me a replacement, no charge.  I had it within days, which is excellent service, and shows they were standing behind their product.  After using it a few more times, I think it is a drawback that you can&#x27;t adjust the angle of this mirror, but otherwise it seems ok.  And I&#x27;m impressed they sent a replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been holding off reviewing until I gave this a solid try. I&#x27;ve had it for 4 months now, and not one problem....well, one minor one, but not the product&#x27;s fault. The bottom suction cup won&#x27;t hold because I have a grout line between 2 tile. The upper 2 cups hold it securely enough, tho. All I&#x27;ve ever had to do is get 1 hand full of water to splash on the mirror, and I&#x27;m good to shave. How simple is that? Works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s 11-17-11 and this mirror still works like a charm. Just got done using it, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m back here. Throw some water on it, and still very clear.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 cups still holding. Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s 10-21-12 and it&#x27;s still effective by just throwing some water on it, and it&#x27;s holding strong.</li>
            <li> This is the second mirror that I have owned from this manufacturer.  The first one lasted three years with minimal maintenance performed, quite a bargain for such a cheap mirror.  While still functional at the end of that time, it finally sucumbed to water spots/stains and my desire to get a new one. The three suction cups have a double cup design and work better than most with only occasional adjustments needed to adhere it to the flat surface of the shower.  Others have discussed the limited number of cleaning pads supplied by the manufacturer which is true, but again for the price only so much should be expected.  As an alternative to the cleaning pads after each use I spray a generic daily shower cleaner on the surface of the mirror which keeps the water spots from forming as well as maintains it&#x27;s anti fog capabilities.</li>
            <li> Sheesh some of the reviews on here make your head spin.  This is a very simple thing with 3 plastic suction cups.  You must have a filthy house if they don&#x27;t stick.  They fit perfectly onto a single 4 inch tile.  The mirror works great.  It fogs up briefly if its cold then it&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s not glamorous or expensive looking.  Does the job.</li>
            <li> I had been shaving in the shower for years. When I bought my condo 6 years ago I could not get the shower head off my shower and was afraid I would twist it off. I therefore could not reattach my shower mirror that ran the water through it.  After not having a shower mirror for all those years I decided to give this one a try. I have only had it for a couple weeks.  The suction cup mount promptly fell right off the wall, but the two sided tape holds solid. The reflection is good and I&#x27;m back to shaving in the shower!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s missing the suction cups. I didn&#x27;t notice it until it was already unwrapped by my husband as a gift. We will try to find good suction cups separately.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband last year and he seemed to enjoy it.  We put it up over a year ago and the suction cups have held it in place with no issues.  My husband just asked for another one for our other bathroom so I figured I&#x27;d write a review while ordering a second one.</li>
            <li> 2 stars... Why?  I had this mirror for 2 months, it had begun fogging, so I did what any average person with limited time would do... I threw water at the mirror portion.  I guess this was a bad idea, because after doing so, the clock died immediately.  No big deal right?  Wrong, if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, this \\&quot;fog less\\&quot; mirror started to fog even more.  A year has gone by and the mirror fogs instantly.  I gave the mirror credit because the suction cups still seem to hold... Sort of.  I have a gillette fusion and a disposable razor hanging from it and it tilts to the fusion side.  Anyway, I would not by this mirror again and you shouldn&#x27;t either. .</li>
            <li> This product works well. It truly doesn&#x27;t fog up in the shower. However, the magnification in the mirror is a bit high.</li>
            <li> Not good mirror.  Mirror image is not great- slightly distorted. Fogs slightly.  Magnification poor- changing it does VERY little.  Suction cups don&#x27;t work on our &amp;#34;stone&amp;#34; tiled shower, so since can&#x27;t stand on own, doesn&#x27;t work well for us.  Husband found regular mirror at Walgreens that stands on it&#x27;s own and works much better (image is clear on that one, not distorted)</li>
            <li> This mirror is not what you expect it to be.  A complete fog mirror.  It is hard to see when you arer shaving.  This is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and he says it works great. the razor holder wont hold the type of razor he uses but i dont think he really cares from what he says he is extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Zadro \\&quot;fog-free\\&quot; mirror for two years.  I use it every day.  It stays up so long as I push in the suction cups every few days.  It holds my Gillette Fusion razor. Why one star?  After a few weeks, the coating peeled off and it is not fog-free.  I wipe off the fog and coat it with soap, just like any of the $7.99 mirrors I could have purchased. Ralph Nader said \\&quot;every consumer dollar is a vote.\\&quot; This is a fogless mirror that fogs up. Don&#x27;t vote for it.</li>
            <li> Horrible, it totally reduced the water pressure of my shower head. Not a good idea to buy a mirror that diverts the water from the shower head through the mirror.</li>
            <li> Positives:    Sticks well to the shower enclosure. It actually has three different ways to hang the mirror - stick it with suction cups, hang it on a nail, place it somewhere.     If you wet the mirror, it works. No fogging etc.    The magnification option works well. It&#x27;s easy to magnify while shaving and at the highest magnification I can literally see every hair on my face. :)    Negatives:    You need to wet the mirror before you can use it or it fogs up. You also need to periodically wet it after a few minutes or it gets little drops all over and nothing is visible. Not exactly fogging, but large drops.      However, for this price its a good mirror. If you don&#x27;t mind splashing it a bit every 5 minutes or so, which I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It sticks very well to our surround wall. It does fog up a little, especially if you take really hot showers(like me), but with a swipe of your hand or a splash of water, it goes fogless again with no residue, so all in all, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. It was actually for my husband who wanted to save time by shaving in the shower, and from what I hear, he&#x27;s quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> So far this mirror has worked out great. I use it in the shower and it helps speed up my morning routine greatly. It remains fog free and the vacuum cups hold well. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When you can clear the surface, and get a nice layer of water on the mirror, it works great. But that requires using this special cleaning pad, and they only supply you with one pad. Otherwise, a nice product.</li>
            <li> My fogless mirror was anything less than fogless. I was disappointed in this product, despite the fact that the magnifying feature worked like a charm. It has already fallen apart on me too. Not durable at all. I wouldn&#x27;t buy one again.</li>
            <li> This is the third differnt shower mirror I&#x27;ve purchased over the years. This one, like the other two, worked great for about four months. After that time it became more and more difficult to keep clear and a month or so later was completly \\&quot;fogged\\&quot; even without the shower running.    For $20 I don&#x27;t expect much.... However, it would be nice to get at least a year out of these mirrors.</li>
            <li> Have only had it for a couple months but so far splash a little water on it and it works fine. I like the magnification being I don&#x27;t have the eye sight that I once had. Great product for the price. It gets my recommendation if that means anything</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what everyone fears...falls off the tiled shower walls about every month. Most of the time I catch it in time, however there have been several nights that have woken me up to a crash and broken my razors because of the poor suction. The mirror has yet to break, but it&#x27;s only a matter of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it fogs up within 2 minutes of the first shower of its first use and repeats every shower. I will say if I just wipe it with my wet hands while in the shower, it does in fact allow me to see clearly enough to shave. However, I am not buying a spray to use on this mirror, as it&#x27;s more money and not worth the hassle in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does provide a magnified view, but really is distorted due to the fogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone. I would request my money back, but at this point I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the hassle, so I thought I would warn as many as I can instead.</li>
            <li> Didnt stick to our tile shower and had to return it. The mirror is too magnified for us as well.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t fog up and you can clearly see yourself in the mirror.  Works as expected, perfect for shaving your face in the shower.  I tried buying a &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror locally but once you got the protective coating off the &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; it was more like reflective fake mental, plus is did fog up.</li>
            <li> steams up and is spotted. I have had others of this type and they have worked well. this one does not</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  First the mirror bubbled up, turn it detached and began falling out and now it&#x27;s peeling.  For the price it was fully functional for about 2 months.  Not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Was fogless for about 5 minutes, so it does not perform as advertised.  However, if you don&#x27;t mind wiping a wet hand across the surface of the mirror, it will stay fog free for a couple of minutes before fogging up again.  Bottom line is that it works better than nothing.</li>
            <li> this is the second time i have ordered this product.. first time it lasted 6 months.. this time it lasted 6 weeks.. piece of junk.. doesn&#x27;t magnify anymore..  do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> Ha.. It took me a few uses to get used to the 5X mirror magnify, but once I did it was great, However, the suctions work great for about 4 weeks or so. It could be my shower surface tho. After waking up from some awesome dreams, to bidda bing bidda bang sound some where in the house, jumping out of bed looking to beat someone down. To going, well what the hell was that sound?! After my search was concluded and finding the mirror laying in the bathtub, I must say, this mirror is very well made.</li>
            <li> What can I say- it fogs up within a minute.  Not a great product, you get what you pay for and this is a classic example.</li>
            <li> My husband loves to shave in the shower and this &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; does not fog and can be adjusted to use without his glasses.  Also it lasts a long time.  This is our second one.  I cannot even tell you how old the first one was.  He was still using it.  I just wanted to put a new one in the shower for him.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this little mirror for my husband to shave in the shower. He didn&#x27;t use it so I took it and placed it on my vanity mirror for getting ready in the morning. Because it is somewhat magnified, it is perfect for me to tweeze my eyebrows and apply my eye makeup! Now I am buying one for my daughter to use. The fogless feature is nice because when you are close up it won&#x27;t fog up by you breathing on it. The suction cups work great too. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  First one I only put two of the suction cups on the back and after about 3 years, it fell off the way and broke the razor holding base.  Put all three cups on the back and so far, it sticks like it was glued to the shower wall.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT MIRROR. BEEN LOOKING FOR A REPLACEMENT THE ONE I&#x27;VE HAD FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this mirror in 2008. It started fading in the same year. It&#x27;s now 4th year as I was using it, and I&#x27;m finally getting tired of it.&lt;br /&gt;Just a horrible quality, and at that time I have paid for it twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;Suction cups do not hold the mirror! By the time you are going to shower the next morning or evening, the shower is dry, suction cups do not hold, it falls. It has scarred my wife many times falling during a night. Fortunately it didn&#x27;t break, but it has chipped.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is one horrible mirror! Also, it fogs like crazy! Spraying it did not work. The spray just adds a blurry film on it, so you cannot see anything!&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this! Save your money!</li>
            <li> This mirror didn&#x27;t work at all. Using the cleaning cloths that came with it, it still doesn&#x27;t stay fog free. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love this. It does fog up in the mornings, but I just run my fingers over it and its fine. No complaints.</li>
            <li> At first, we really liked it.  It comes with 3 suction cups, and didn&#x27;t fog up....at first.  However, we&#x27;ve had it up there just over 30 days and it has fallen twice, and now its starting to fog up already.  We made sure the surface was clean, and cleaned the suction cups again, and tried again.  Still fogging up but hasn&#x27;t fallen again yet... so far I am not impressed.  If you have the patience for it, and just want a basic cheap shower mirror, this could work, but if you want reliability and true fog-free mirror, you&#x27;re best to buy something else.</li>
            <li> Mirror works very well in shower. Does not fog up. Use fog free cleaning solution only to clean, otherwise, it will scratch mirror surface.</li>
            <li> I like the mirror, it sticks to the wall well it&#x27;s a good size. as a fogless mirror it&#x27;s not so great my other complaint is that it scratches really easy so if you clean it use something very soft. The magnification is so so it works but it&#x27;s not that great</li>
            <li> Not worth the money the mirror fogged right up and the mirror has a distorted appearance to it. I would not buy this ahain</li>
            <li> Everything is wrong with this product. 1) Manufacture displayed horrible customer service, 2) Didn&#x27;t work appropriately 3) horrible packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shout out to the customer service department who sent an e-mail asking me to contact them with any problems before posting a rating, but then didn&#x27;t care to handle my problem.</li>
            <li> I am dissapointed with this item. It is quoted as fogless and within minutes of my shower warming up it fogs over. I rinse it with water and seconds later it starts to fog yet again! Not as described. Seriously bummed.</li>
