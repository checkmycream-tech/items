            <li>Great transaction</li>
            <li>Good luck because I&#x27;ve probably already bought them all.</li>
            <li>Not that amazingly good.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d imagine waking up to gorgeous Victoria&#x27;s Secret-eque waves.</li>

            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair but a fair amount of it</li>
            <li>Like amazing.</li>
            <li>To be honest...</li>
            <li>To be honest...</li>
            <li>I sprayed it on my semi damp hair and just scrunched it and voila nice wavy non-frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice tropical scent.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative when you want a quick, no-bother change.  </li>
            <li>Very easy too do.</li>
            <li>This is the best beach spray I have found by far!</li>
            <li>Love this product - the smell alone is amazing.</li>
            <li>Almost like a very light hairspray feel to it but not at all crunchy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the scent of this.</li>
            <li>I go to sleep with it, even with my hair up in a top knot</li>
            <li>I feel glamorous and walk around, and in reality, I look more like a bird patch</li>
            <li>I go to sleep with it, even with my hair up in a top knot</li>
            <li>I feel glamorous and walk around, and in reality, I look more like a bird patch</li>
            <li>Not for me, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;ll give you curls if you scrunch, but the curls are tangled together</li>
            <li>This way was okay.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>That said, I absolutely love this beach spray.</li>
            <li>I call it my &amp;#34;lazy girl hair!&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li>Love all marcanthony producrs.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but the lid was missing.i love this product..</li>
            <li>Had gotten a free sample from Ipsy and love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Also a great get for putting my hair up at night in a pony tail with soft rollers.</li>
            <li>So yes it may feel a bit salty and it is most certainly not going to give you shiny smooth perfect waves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not used to a product that does what it says it will do, so I&#x27;m pretty thrilled.</li>
            <li>With Beach Spray, I just rub some of this into my ends, curl it with my fingers and my ends look fine</li>
            <li>So it increases the probability of tangles, but for a whole day (with wet application), my hair looks good, and I&#x27;m happy to pay for that.</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d actually find a hair product at Walgreens that I was truly happy with.</li>
            <li>my hair dried to beautiful beachy waves!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this picture has nothing to do with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this picture has nothing to do with the product.</li>
            <li>But this Marc Anthony stuff is unique.</li>
            <li>Up to now, I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Flax Seed Aloe gel, still amazing stuff; put it on wet hair and do some scrunching as it dries, and the effect of fullness and some wave is amazing.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain salt, but it really works well.</li>
            <li>Read my full review at beauty apocalypse dot com.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is the best hair sh*t ever.</li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff, but upset after finding out that I could have gotten it for half the price from Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Most of the cheaper sprays will give you the same or better beachy waves.</li>
            <li>If you live in the greater Los Angeles area...</li>
            <li>This spray really works to give your hair waves, the scent is ok at first but gets nauseating as they day</li>
            <li>Initial impression: This stuff smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This is great if you really enjoy tangled hair, the kind that a simple reach back to pull off your sunglasses results in tiny tugs of pain all over.  </li>
            <li>As a professional cosmetologist with pin straight hair, I&#x27;ve tried every professional beach spray made and wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I have bright, deeply saturated purple pieces in my bangs, I used this product once and it bleached so much of the purple out of my hair</li>
            <li>You get SORT of wavy hair (nothing like the face on the box), but is it worth it?  </li>
            <li>I love the way this spray makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>This one is more natural.</li>
            <li>Great holding power, but yet soft enough to not look crunchy.</li>
            <li>This product does not work any better than many other products.  </li>
            <li>It works amazingly well with a little braid, super fast with even a top knot, anything, really.</li>
            <li>Overall I am really happy with the product and will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li>I love using coconut oil and use it every day, and didn&#x27;t feel that this is similar, but..</li>
            <li>Moral of the story, if you love your color, do not buy this.</li>
            <li>As this stuff gets popular, may get harder to find.</li>
            <li>And when I say &amp;#34;super fast&amp;#34;, I mean — if you want to go out and have flowy beach waves but you&#x27;re short on time — tie a top knot, spray it on (or spray it on and tie a top knot, the possibilities are endless and stuff) and in about 5 minutes, you are all set – just release that gorgeous hair out of the knot and have fun.</li>
            <li>DO NOT, for the love of god, use this on dry hair.</li>
            <li>This is purely subjective, though.</li>
            <li>Once again, purely subjective.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations for this product.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>your hair is pin straight —</li>
            <li>your hair is pin straight —</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for waves or beach look in my hair</li>
            <li>I really like this beach spray.</li>
            <li>Works better on wet hair.</li>
            <li>I put my wet hair up on my head at night to give me volume at the roots which works great, but of course, that makes my ends ratty when I take my hair down in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Normal straight)</li>
            <li>I woke up with nice, defined curls and minimal frizz initially.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also super soft thanks to the Argan oil that I use daily on it.</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair with a slight wave that resists all attempts at styling, but when I sprayed this product in and scrunched it</li>
            <li>Unlike many other products, I found (from personal experience) that you don&#x27;t need to use it a certain way: say, on damp/wet/dry hair, specifically</li>
            <li>Okay,everyone&#x27;s right; get it at Walgreens for ten bucks.</li>
            <li>It is my new go to for leaving my hair curly.</li>
            <li>and apparently people are going gaga for the smell, saying it&#x27;s very beachy and coconuty.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s naturally wavy -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been spraying it into my hands instead of directly onto my hair and that seems to help.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly  surprised when this worked.</li>
            <li>My hair completely dries in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I actually have wave in my pin straight hair.</li>
            <li>so it surprised me that I could smell this product on my hair until I washed it out.  </li>
            <li>I had nice defined curls, but the frizz was out of control, and it made my hair look unhealthy like it just sucked up all of the moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sad because it does look good.</li>
            <li>I have purchased very expensive ones, and to be honest this is by far better than any other ones I have used.</li>
            <li>My hair is blonde, a bit dry sometimes, but straight (not &amp;#34;flat iron&amp;#34; straight.</li>
            <li>I have relatively straight and fine  hair that is very hard to curl</li>
            <li>, so it doesn&#x27;t tend to hold a curl, a wave, anything really, for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>It is very expensive and doesn&#x27;t provide great waves.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin somewhat curly hair and this stuff saves my life.</li>
            <li>The spray is easy to use: simply spray on wet hair and scrunch the heck out of it, then let your hair air dry.</li>
            <li>Do the same thing, scrunch it into wet hair, and you slowly start getting amazing soft corkscrew curls.</li>
            <li>It gives me body and texture that I desperately need and it is so quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>( I barely had to scrunch it at all)</li>
            <li>No hard stuff or gross residue is left on my hair- just awesomeness.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well on my long hair, but only if it starts thoroughly wet.  </li>
            <li>I finally broke down and decided to try the Marc Anthony beach spray after reading a bunch of positive reviews.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Seriously, this is the best hair sh*t ever. It makes my hair smell like a dream and instantly adds that UMPH to my waves. No hard stuff or gross residue is left on my hair- just awesomeness. This little gem is a steal at Walgreens if you can find it in the shelves. If you live in the greater Los Angeles area... Good luck because I&#x27;ve probably already bought them all. Muhuhahahaha.</li>
            <li> This spray really works to give your hair waves, the scent is ok at first but gets nauseating as they day goes on I wish this had no smell. You also have to wash your hair after using it as it gets really dirty feeling and crunchy afterwards but if you&#x27;re looking for wavy hair this does the job.</li>
            <li> Alright, I&#x27;m going to break my review down to bullet points, to make it clearer and not all over the place for you:&lt;br /&gt;• My hair is blonde, a bit dry sometimes, but straight (not &amp;#34;flat iron&amp;#34; straight. Normal straight), so it doesn&#x27;t tend to hold a curl, a wave, anything really, for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;• I was on the lookout for a wave spray that would actually work for me, not one of those things that you would look up online and find people saying that it only works when you use it after curling your hair with a curling iron or something&lt;br /&gt;• I bought this after finding that this one seems to be the only one that sort-of fits the bill&lt;br /&gt;• It really works. It doesn&#x27;t even matter if I&#x27;d spray it on and just leave my hair loose, not touching it — my hair would eventually get beach waves&lt;br /&gt;• It works amazingly well with a little braid, super fast with even a top knot, anything, really. And when I say &amp;#34;super fast&amp;#34;, I mean — if you want to go out and have flowy beach waves but you&#x27;re short on time — tie a top knot, spray it on (or spray it on and tie a top knot, the possibilities are endless and stuff) and in about 5 minutes, you are all set – just release that gorgeous hair out of the knot and have fun. That fast.&lt;br /&gt;• I don&#x27;t love the scent of this. It&#x27;s not very pleasant. I can&#x27;t even understand what it is in order to explain what it smells like, but it&#x27;s not very nice to me. This is purely subjective, though. I am not saying that the smell is foul and overpowering: it&#x27;s actually not too bad, just.. Not that amazingly good. I actually just looked it up online and apparently people are going gaga for the smell, saying it&#x27;s very beachy and coconuty. I love using coconut oil and use it every day, and didn&#x27;t feel that this is similar, but.. Once again, purely subjective.&lt;br /&gt;• Unlike many other products, I found (from personal experience) that you don&#x27;t need to use it a certain way: say, on damp/wet/dry hair, specifically; I use it whenever I feel the need for beach waves, and voila! Never fails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the big guns:&lt;br /&gt;Will I be purchasing this again once I run out?&lt;br /&gt;The answer is actually... No.&lt;br /&gt;The truth is that I didn&#x27;t like the type of waves this product gives me, but... To be honest...

            <li> Initial impression: This stuff smells AMAZING. Like amazing. I can&#x27;t stop sniffing my hair whenever I spritz this stuff in... but that&#x27;s about the only thing I like about this product. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and, each time, it makes my hair feel tangled, frizzy and ratty. I have very fine hair but a fair amount of it and it&#x27;s naturally wavy - it&#x27;s also super soft thanks to the Argan oil that I use daily on it. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out a way to use this product, but here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve tried so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Spritzing on dry hair. DO NOT, for the love of god, use this on dry hair. If you want painful tangles, then, by all means, use this on dry hair. Sure, it&#x27;ll give you curls if you scrunch, but the curls are tangled together and it&#x27;s impossible to run your fingers through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;2) Spritzing on wet hair and letting it air dry. This way was okay. It felt coarse as it was drying, but then it dried relatively soft. I had nice defined curls, but the frizz was out of control, and it made my hair look unhealthy like it just sucked up all of the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;3) Spritzing on wet hair and throwing hair up in a bun to sleep on. It didn&#x27;t work to maintain the curls and my hair was frizzy and dry feeling.&lt;br /&gt;4) Spritzing on wet hair and braiding my hair into five sections, letting it sit for an hour. This did NOTHING. Nothing. It took the curls out of my hair. Weird.&lt;br /&gt;5) Spritzing on wet hair and throwing it up in a wet ponytail, then sleeping on it. This was the best way. I woke up with nice, defined curls and minimal frizz initially. The frizz got out of control after about 10 minutes of wearing it down, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to have to experiment with this product and I&#x27;ll come back to this review when the bottle is empty...</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  Reminds me of the beach.  Doesn&#x27;t do much for waves or beach look in my hair but I&#x27;ll continue to use it for the scent.</li>
            <li> Oh dear lord do NOT buy this from here. It is $8.99 at bed, bath, and beyond and at least where I live it&#x27;s always in stock. That said, I absolutely love this beach spray. I think maybe people don&#x27;t understand what beach sprays are supposed to do. You know what your hair feelsnlike after you&#x27;ve been at the beach... well a beach spray that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to will give you that effect. So yes it may feel a bit salty and it is most certainly not going to give you shiny smooth perfect waves. That&#x27;s what curling irons are for. The whole point is to give it a bit of a messy look. I have very fine thin somewhat curly hair and this stuff saves my life. It gives me body and texture that I desperately need and it is so quick and easy to use. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This works pretty well on my long hair, but only if it starts thoroughly wet.  The dry hair application was a total fail for me.  I also wash it out before bed if I don&#x27;t want a rat&#x27;s nest in the morning.  So it increases the probability of tangles, but for a whole day (with wet application), my hair looks good, and I&#x27;m happy to pay for that.</li>
            <li> Great purchase.  Very happy with this transaction</li>
            <li> I really like this beach spray. I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain salt, but it really works well. I prefer to use it after a shower but I have used it on dry hair. I have thick 2a wavy hair so products can weigh down my hair but this one doesn&#x27;t. This defines my waves without looking like I have a lot of product on my hair. It smells great, like coconut or a piña colada. I will say that I do get a bit of build up on my scalp when I use this sometimes. I&#x27;ve been spraying it into my hands instead of directly onto my hair and that seems to help. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have relatively straight and fine  hair that is very hard to curl so I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations for this product. I was very pleasantly  surprised when this worked. I sprayed it on my semi damp hair and just scrunched it and voila nice wavy non-frizzy hair. It stayed all day too. It does have a nice tropical scent. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the texture of my hair was a little off. Almost like a very light hairspray feel to it but not at all crunchy. Overall I am really happy with the product and will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I might As well spray water on my hair. It smells good. That&#x27;s it, don&#x27;t bother with it</li>
            <li> But whatever you do, DON&#x27;T buy it from here. it&#x27;s WAY overpriced/too expensive. I just bought some tonight from Walgreens on sale for $6.49. Then I redeemed $5 in points from being a wellness member. Yep, I just paid $1.49 for it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff, but upset after finding out that I could have gotten it for half the price from Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is great if you really enjoy tangled hair, the kind that a simple reach back to pull off your sunglasses results in tiny tugs of pain all over.  Forget brushing your hair or even finger combing.  I don&#x27;t use heavy hairsprays because I hate frozen hair.  This is essentially the same.  You get SORT of wavy hair (nothing like the face on the box), but is it worth it?  Not for me.</li>
            <li> The spray is easy to use: simply spray on wet hair and scrunch the heck out of it, then let your hair air dry. My hair completely dries in about 30 minutes. The result? I love it!  Granted, my srunching technique needs some practice, but I got the summery casual, just got out of the water, fun look I wanted. It&#x27;s a great alternative when you want a quick, no-bother change.  Read my full review at beauty apocalypse dot com.</li>
            <li> Save your money. Most of the cheaper sprays will give you the same or better beachy waves. It is very expensive and doesn&#x27;t provide great waves.</li>
            <li> Had gotten a free sample from Ipsy and love this stuff.  I call it my &amp;#34;lazy girl hair!&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> As a professional cosmetologist with pin straight hair, I&#x27;ve tried every professional beach spray made and wasn&#x27;t happy with the results. I finally broke down and decided to try the Marc Anthony beach spray after reading a bunch of positive reviews. I am very satisfied with the results. I never thought I&#x27;d actually find a hair product at Walgreens that I was truly happy with. I actually have wave in my pin straight hair. The product smells great and my waves aren&#x27;t crunchy feeling. I used a diffuser along with scrunching my hair and finished it off with my Babyliss Pro Mira Curl Defining Spray. I bought this for $10 at a Walgreens in Michigan.</li>
            <li> Love all marcanthony producrs. The dream wave beach spray is awesome- it gives my hair  different texture- so if i&#x27;m in the mood for that type of hair for that day i use it!!!</li>
            <li> This spray actually works for my hair type. Long and straight and thin, and it makes really pretty waves. Very easy too do. Works better on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great body to curly hair!</li>
            <li> Not working at all and made my hair salty !!! And frizzy didnt like it and will never buy it again</li>
            <li> I love the way this spray makes your hair soft. Other brands felt really harsh and dry. This one is more natural.</li>
            <li> This product ruined my color! I have bright, deeply saturated purple pieces in my bangs, I used this product once and it bleached so much of the purple out of my hair the ends were completely WHITE. Moral of the story, if you love your color, do not buy this. Not only that, but, using only two pumps left a disgusting residue that weighed my hair down and made it look super greasy. Not worth the money, at all.</li>
            <li> Love this product - the smell alone is amazing.</li>
            <li> I find the smell offensive.  I am not a sensitive type so it surprised me that I could smell this product on my hair until I washed it out.  Sad because it does look good.</li>
            <li> Okay,everyone&#x27;s right; get it at Walgreens for ten bucks. Of course, I got the last one. And they didn&#x27;t carry it at my beauty supply store, to my shock. As this stuff gets popular, may get harder to find. Anyway, my hair is flat and growing ever thinner. (Also bought the kit for Keranique hair regrow system - I&#x27;ll post a review of that in 90 days.) I gave up curling irons and blow dryers years ago, to not stress my frail hair. Up to now, I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Flax Seed Aloe gel, still amazing stuff; put it on wet hair and do some scrunching as it dries, and the effect of fullness and some wave is amazing. Don&#x27;t blow dry; you&#x27;ll lose it. I&#x27;ll still use it. Also a great get for putting my hair up at night in a pony tail with soft rollers. Get curl without dryers. But this Marc Anthony stuff is unique. Do the same thing, scrunch it into wet hair, and you slowly start getting amazing soft corkscrew curls. But you have to scrunch a lot more to get the curls, which can get tedious and tiring. I&#x27;m going to order a wind tunnel dryer attachment to see if I can speed up the process a bit. But even my husband was amazed. He didn&#x27;t think it would work. I did take a couple inches off the length, and I think that helps the curling process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked how well this worked. I have straight, fine hair with a slight wave that resists all attempts at styling, but when I sprayed this product in and scrunched it( I barely had to scrunch it at all) my hair dried to beautiful beachy waves! I&#x27;m not used to a product that does what it says it will do, so I&#x27;m pretty thrilled.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome for giving my curly hair that great look. I spray it on my dry hair and I don&#x27;t have to straighten it. Love it. It is my new go to for leaving my hair curly.</li>
            <li> Great transaction but the lid was missing.i love this product..</li>
            <li> This is the best beach spray I have found by far! I have purchased very expensive ones, and to be honest this is by far better than any other ones I have used. I use with a diffuser, and it works great! You can also finger style it while damp. Great holding power, but yet soft enough to not look crunchy.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  But what in God&#x27;s name is this vendor doing charging $25.49 for 4.2 oz. when you can get it at Walgreens and elsewhere for $8.99?  That being said, I like it.  I put my wet hair up on my head at night to give me volume at the roots which works great, but of course, that makes my ends ratty when I take my hair down in the morning.  I was spending a lot of time curling my ends but that&#x27;s too time consuming.  With Beach Spray, I just rub some of this into my ends, curl it with my fingers and my ends look fine and I&#x27;m good to go.  But do yourself a favor and buy this at Walgreens or elsewhere but not from this vendor who is gouging people.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not worth the money. This product does not work any better than many other products.  I was very disappointed especially after paying so much for it.</li>
