            <li>My hair feels so healthy after using this product!  </li>
            <li>Works great on my fine over processed hair.</li>
            <li>so Nice  </li>
            <li>so Nice  </li>
            <li>so Nice</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and so far it has been a great product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have seen so many reviews on YouTube saying how amazing this product is.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I would have seen even more improvement if I followed their directions.</li>
            <li>Still had a problem with tangling and lost more hair than I wanted to.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>But if you have damaged hair or just want to have healthy looking locks, try this.</li>
            <li>it worked okay</li>
            <li>I love this product, makes my hair shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I use this after the shampoo and conditioner brand, and it makes my hair much more smoother than just using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>- it smells so much better.</li>
            <li>any more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>awesome product, great for damaged brittle hair (especially if you have a bunch of split ends), and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love them all.</li>
            <li>I am using the whole line now and love it all!</li>
            <li>I notice a huge difference after I blow out my hair when I use it.</li>
            <li>Although I also use aveda smooth infusion products</li>
            <li>and I like the results which help smooth, soften, add shine to my hair</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as amazing as I had hoped for, but still a decent product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Great product for dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li>Because of the grays, my hair texture has changed into more stubborn and I like straight, smooth styles.</li>
            <li>love the scent and of course love how it makes my hair soft and shiny without causing oiliness.</li>
            <li>I am always hesitant with any &amp;#34;protein&amp;#34; product as I fried my hair many years ago because I applied a product too much and too often.  </li>
            <li>and I think it really does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>The Agadir Argan oil line is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I have really thin hair and use my flatiron a lot, so this moisture masque is a wonderful addition to my shower routine.</li>
            <li>This deep conditioner is a nice compliment to the product line.</li>
            <li>I tried other argan oil products but none work as well or smell as good as Agadir.</li>
            <li>rating this product 4 stars (not 5)  because while this masque rescued my hair when it was very damaged, I don&#x27;t feel it makes a significant difference in the quality of my hair when used weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>I have it in my hair right now.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super shiney and straight.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling fresh, clean, and soft.</li>
            <li>and I saw improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li>Made my hair really soft and smooth after 1 use.</li>
            <li>I have used just about every expensive hair product on the market and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This moisture mask really does deliver!</li>
            <li>Love this product,really helps with deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first pot, and I thought for sure I&#x27;d be out by now, but it seems to last forever.</li>
            <li>Most likely won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My hair is SO much easier to style when I use this every shampoo!</li>
            <li>I was hooked the first time I used the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>From the first time you use it your hair will be shinier, softer, easier to brush and comb, and just feel on the whole about a million times healthier.</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel really silky.</li>
            <li>After 2 used my hair very smoothie and shine.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed much of a difference in hair.  </li>
            <li>but, hair don&#x27;t shine as much with this on your hair.</li>
            <li>This masque really completes the Agadir experience.</li>
            <li>but not really any better then the much cheaper product that I normally use.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine but very frizzy and dry because it&#x27;s colored</li>
            <li>As I get older my long hair needs more conditioning to keep it shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It does moisturize decently.  </li>
            <li>There are other great masques out there that are a little cheaper.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, but it can be a little overbearing in the beginning.</li>
            <li>Left my dry frizzy hair , soft and much more manageable</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>This works OK but not better than others that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a significant difference in even how my hair blowdrys better, significantly decreased split ends, and can even tell a difference in the speed which my hair is growing!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product about 3 weeks ago and use it daily because my hair NEEDS that much moisture.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair sooo soft and shiny</li>
            <li>needs to be used everyday or every other day when using it on an amazing beard like mine</li>
            <li>I prefer L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced Total Repair Extreme Emergency Recovery Mask</li>
            <li>Having major dryness and intense tangling when I wash my natural hair so tried this masque and left it on for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>I purchased this masque because my hair was very brittle and dry from using a new line of hair products: this masque worked well.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive for so-so results.</li>
            <li>However, I have super straight thin hair</li>
            <li>Just not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>

            <li> Just not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair naturally and get a brazilian blowout every 3 to 4  months as well as highlight my hair.</li>
            <li> - my shoulder-length hair tends to be coarse and dry and prone to breakage, and I dye it red</li>
            <li> but I recommend it only for dry or damaged hair, since the product is very moisturizing, use small amounts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll ask my daughter, who loves Keratin products for her long curly hair, to try it when she&#x27;s home for Winter break.</li>
            <li> For the price it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Masque has very strange texture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product that will help repair really dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Waited 5 minutes and rinsed and still felt like my hair was really dry.</li>
            <li> I moved in October from Texas to Missouri and have been fighting dry winter hair ever since -</li>
            <li> This is a very thick conditioner/ hair mask that really works!</li>
            <li> stylist and I have both noticed a marked difference in the health of my hair; less split ends, less breakage, and longer-lasting color.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was due to other products</li>
            <li> I towel dried, then thickly coated my hair with the masque, and left it in for 15mins: with one use it brought my hair back to a supple texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any softness or less frizz either.</li>
            <li> This product is a very thick foam-like white cream.</li>
            <li> apply it to towel dried hair and comb/massage through...</li>
            <li> I colored my hair and wanted something to help sleek out the dried out ends.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Agadir Moisture Masque a few times now</li>
            <li> I started with the oil to tame my Florida frizzy hair and then tried the rest of the products.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the way my hair was looking one I styled.</li>
            <li> Not sure how often I would buy it for the price.</li>
            <li> Extremely thick and not easy to spread.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen complaints that the benefit wears off when you stop using it, but duh - of course it will.</li>
            <li> Just remember this is a very thick product, take a small amount and rub it between your hands then</li>
            <li> Feels like a tough putty when you apply it to your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, has a weird perm type of smell to it and hard to apply to my hair.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> and my hair is getting greasy :(</li>
            <li> I was  disappointed in the packaging....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As I get older my long hair needs more conditioning to keep it shiny and soft. I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a week for the last 2 weeks and I saw improvement after the first use. I only leave it in for 2 minutes while in the shower because I just don&#x27;t want to take the extra time. The manufacturer suggests toweling drying the hair, adding the conditioner, combing it thru your hair and wait 5 minutes before rinsing. I&#x27;m sure I would have seen even more improvement if I followed their directions. Either way, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Eehhhh... Kind of expensive for so-so results. Having major dryness and intense tangling when I wash my natural hair so tried this masque and left it on for 2 hours. Still had a problem with tangling and lost more hair than I wanted to. Didn&#x27;t notice any softness or less frizz either. Maybe it was due to other products so I&#x27;ll try it again. I&#x27;ll ask my daughter, who loves Keratin products for her long curly hair, to try it when she&#x27;s home for Winter break. On a side note, I saw it advertised it CVS for $45! That makes it a steal on Amazon lol</li>
            <li> Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!  I will use it again, and again, and again!  Made my hair feel really silky.</li>
            <li> Great Conditioner! Made my hair really soft and smooth after 1 use. Although I also use aveda smooth infusion products</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as amazing as I had hoped for, but still a decent product. I prefer L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced Total Repair Extreme Emergency Recovery Mask</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Leaves my hair so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Not for all hair types.. kinky/course hair stay away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product that will help repair really dry, damaged hair. This is perfect. I&#x27;ve now used 4 times and can&#x27;t believe the compliments I&#x27;m getting on the improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products and this one is by far the best.  It is not at all greasy.  It is a great product to use as directed, twice per week until moisture level and repair is achieved.  This took my dyed hair about 4 treatments to accomplish.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Feels like a tough putty when you apply it to your hair. Waited 5 minutes and rinsed and still felt like my hair was really dry. Not satisfied with the way my hair was looking one I styled. A day later and my hair is getting greasy :(</li>
            <li> This works OK but not better than others that I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m not totally dissatisfied though. It does moisturize decently.  Just not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> This mask is a HAIR SAVIOR! I have extremely curly hair naturally and get a brazilian blowout every 3 to 4  months as well as highlight my hair. My hair goes through A LOT! I purchased this product about 3 weeks ago and use it daily because my hair NEEDS that much moisture. I have seen a significant difference in even how my hair blowdrys better, significantly decreased split ends, and can even tell a difference in the speed which my hair is growing! Through the years I have tried several deep conditioning products and none have given the me the moisture like Agadir! This will forever be a staple in my shower.</li>
            <li> I have been using Agadir hair products since I got a perm almost a year ago. I tried other argan oil products but none work as well or smell as good as Agadir.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick conditioner/ hair mask that really works! It makes my hair super shiney and straight. I have used just about every expensive hair product on the market and this one is the best. It would be best for curley or frizzy hair. However, I have super straight thin hair and I love it. The only problem with this product is that it does add a bit of weight to your hair so if you are looking for mega volume then keep looking. But if you have damaged hair or just want to have healthy looking locks, try this. Just remember this is a very thick product, take a small amount and rub it between your hands then apply it to towel dried hair and comb/massage through...leave on for atleast 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner!!! Makes my hair sooo soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I recommend this product is excellent!!</li>
            <li> so Nice  so Nice  so Nice</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, and super fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Smell good. Masque has very strange texture but I like it. After 2 used my hair very smoothie and shine.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great on my fine over processed hair. Leaves it shiny, detangled and moisturized  for days.  Takes forever to blowdry after using it. I was  disappointed in the packaging....it was an open, non sealed container wrapped in plastic. Had anyone  else had this happen?</li>
            <li> This mask leaves my hair silky and shiny. I notice a huge difference after I blow out my hair when I use it. For the price it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this product works well for hair repair may bleached hair is softer, stronger, and has a perfect shine.</li>
            <li> Same product in stores is $35. You can&#x27;t beat this price!!  Great product for dry brittle hair. Repaired my hair in a couple of weeks. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Loved how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, my hair looks healthy, shine andalso help me to fight against humidity. I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> it worked okay but not really any better then the much cheaper product that I normally use.  I would not buy it again at this price.</li>
            <li> This moisture mask really does deliver! THis is my second jar and I think it really does make a huge difference. My hair looks healthier and shinier and feels like silk. I am using the whole line now and love it all!</li>
            <li> A+A+A+A+A+  Great product</li>
            <li> I love this product, makes my hair shiny and healthy. but I recommend it only for dry or damaged hair, since the product is very moisturizing, use small amounts!</li>
            <li> Smells great, and so far it has been a great product.  I use this after the shampoo and conditioner brand, and it makes my hair much more smoother than just using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I colored my hair and wanted something to help sleek out the dried out ends.  I&#x27;ve used Agadir Moisture Masque a few times now and I like the results which help smooth, soften, add shine to my hair but I don&#x27;t care for the smell.  I use it about once a week and it works well.  I like to alternate this with Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Mask - it smells so much better.</li>
            <li> Great product!  My hair dresser charged me $25 for a deep conditioning treatment!  I now can do it at home for a lot cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> Received order as promise. It was package well. It was what I expected...will order again. I have used another product for a couple years but when I tried a sample of this product I loved it. I ordered this smaller bottles to try for longer period. I loved the way my hair felt. So since then I have ordered the larger bottles of the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product,really helps with deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> You are the best always</li>
            <li> I moved in October from Texas to Missouri and have been fighting dry winter hair ever since - it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never had to deal with before. I already use the Agadir Argan Oil Treatment whenever I wash my hair, so I thought I&#x27;d give this stuff a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s AHmazing. I only shampoo about once a week - my shoulder-length hair tends to be coarse and dry and prone to breakage, and I dye it red so it has color damage AND I have to deal with fading - so I&#x27;ve been using it every time I shampoo. This stuff works miracles. From the first time you use it your hair will be shinier, softer, easier to brush and comb, and just feel on the whole about a million times healthier. It does take a while to rinse all of it out, but it doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue or make me feel like I need to wash my hair any more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist and I have both noticed a marked difference in the health of my hair; less split ends, less breakage, and longer-lasting color. I&#x27;m still on the first pot, and I thought for sure I&#x27;d be out by now, but it seems to last forever. I&#x27;m convinced it helps my hair hold a style as well, both when I straighten it and when I curl it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen complaints that the benefit wears off when you stop using it, but duh - of course it will. I&#x27;ll never give it up!</li>
            <li> This product is a very thick foam-like white cream. I purchased this masque because my hair was very brittle and dry from using a new line of hair products: this masque worked well. I towel dried, then thickly coated my hair with the masque, and left it in for 15mins: with one use it brought my hair back to a supple texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rating this product 4 stars (not 5)  because while this masque rescued my hair when it was very damaged, I don&#x27;t feel it makes a significant difference in the quality of my hair when used weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize: awesome product, great for damaged brittle hair (especially if you have a bunch of split ends), and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Really great masque. Love the smell, but it can be a little overbearing in the beginning. Not sure how often I would buy it for the price. There are other great masques out there that are a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is great for processed hair.  My hair feels so healthy after using this product!  It&#x27;s a must have!  Aloha!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed much of a difference in hair.  I need something for moisture and just didn&#x27;t make an improvement.</li>
            <li> Extremely thick and not easy to spread. Im probably not gonna repurchase as I use it for my deep conditions and can find cheaper alternatives with argan oil.</li>
            <li> Great product.  The Agadir Argan oil line is worth the money.  My hair looks and feels great.  It has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> hair smells very good with this product but, hair don&#x27;t shine as much with this on your hair. I would probably order it again.</li>
            <li> I have it in my hair right now. Great product for any hair type.</li>
            <li> Works great . needs to be used everyday or every other day when using it on an amazing beard like mine other wise it goes back to being a bit wirey</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have seen so many reviews on YouTube saying how amazing this product is. And I have to say, I was not impressed. It&#x27;s very thick, has a weird perm type of smell to it and hard to apply to my hair. I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase this product. Most likely won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am always hesitant with any &amp;#34;protein&amp;#34; product as I fried my hair many years ago because I applied a product too much and too often.  I have noticed a difference in softness.  My suggestion is to apply once a week for the 3-5 minutes, rinse and then use your standard conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Left my dry frizzy hair , soft and much more manageable</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It leaves my hair feeling fresh, clean, and soft. I have really thin hair and use my flatiron a lot, so this moisture masque is a wonderful addition to my shower routine.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample from Sephora once and was instantly hooked. My hair is fine but very frizzy and dry because it&#x27;s colored and I&#x27;m graying. Because of the grays, my hair texture has changed into more stubborn and I like straight, smooth styles. The Agadir daily conditioner just wasn&#x27;t hardcore enough, so I went back to this. The smell is also HEAVENLY and everyone tells me how &amp;#34;yummy&amp;#34; my hair smells. My hair is SO much easier to style when I use this every shampoo!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about Agadir hair products.  I was hooked the first time I used the shampoo and conditioner.  This deep conditioner is a nice compliment to the product line.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> This masque really completes the Agadir experience. I started with the oil to tame my Florida frizzy hair and then tried the rest of the products. I love them all. Now, I just need a hair spray.</li>
            <li> love the scent and of course love how it makes my hair soft and shiny without causing oiliness. i would definitely recommend this product to be part of anyone&#x27;s haircare regime.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good one and good material</li>
    </ol>
