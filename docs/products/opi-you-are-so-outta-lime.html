            <li>Love the color, but it chips within hours of using it even with a primer and top coat.</li>
            <li>Very fun color!</li>
            <li>However, if you like lighter colors I&#x27;m sure this would be an easy 5 star review.</li>
            <li>Very good, especially coming all the way from California</li>
            <li>This is a fun blue color perfect for spring and summer.</li>
            <li>The smell of the polish was so strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful color, very pink.</li>
            <li>Cool color, too.</li>
            <li>all year round bright colors make you feel vibrant &amp; cheery .</li>
            <li>My new favorite color.</li>
            <li>This is a really pretty green a little lighter than the picture but still pretty it looks good on toes &amp; really good on brown or tanned skin a good color for sumner or winter</li>
            <li>this is 1 of the rare OPI polishes that I can say</li>
            <li>missed and they rarely have hit or miss</li>
            <li>but it just wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>Smooth, shiny, good coverage and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Shipped very fast, well packaged</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast, the minute I ordered it to the minute it came my doorstep was 5 days.</li>
            <li>You need about 4 coats but it&#x27;s a pretty color.</li>
            <li>Bright neon green color--</li>
            <li>exactly what she wanted.  </li>
            <li>I put white under it and it was okay.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was looking for a bright green.</li>
            <li>Love the color, but it starts chipping the next day.</li>
            <li>fast ship will buy again</li>
            <li>Really pops</li>
            <li>The bottle for this polish was very wobbly and would not sit on my counter without falling over.  </li>
            <li>I love OPI colors because they don&#x27;t seem to chip as easily as other brands.</li>
            <li>My new fav color!</li>
            <li>I purchase various colors for my wife whose favorite (and maybe the only acceptable) nail polish brand is OPI.  </li>
            <li>(I live on the East Coast).</li>
            <li>She looks hot wearing the colors and it&#x27;s such a turn on.</li>
            <li>WIld shade!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a neon, but it&#x27;s a pretty bright lime green with slight yellow undertones and dries matte.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a nail polish dry so fast!</li>
            <li>I usually stick to more traditional colors, but I like this one.</li>
            <li>The product looked retail new - and I am actually wearing this color now</li>
            <li>I like to mix with a glitter top coat to give a little extra sparkle and a little depth to the nail polish.</li>

            <li> Love this color. So spring-y!</li>
            <li> Item arrived promptly and was as described.</li>
            <li> Good seller but horrible formula in this nailpolish this is 1 of the rare OPI polishes that I can say missed and they rarely have hit or miss but this 1 definitely a miss</li>
            <li> I like Neons on my toes in the Summer this is really a wonderful bright Lime Green,i used two coats and a Top coat and this color stayed on a full week without any chips ,mybe would have lasted even longer but i like to change color like Neons this one is a must!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Bright and perfect for spring/summer.</li>
            <li> I bought the entire neon OPI collection for my girl friend and she loves them. She looks hot wearing the colors and it&#x27;s such a turn on. Definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This polish is all that and a bag of chips, luv the color. Very bright and bold and perfect for spring and summer. Shipped very fast, well packaged</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color, very pink.</li>
            <li> Nice price great color and fast shipping</li>
            <li> takes a lot of coats to be opaque and then it&#x27;s not too neon anymore. I put white under it and it was okay.</li>
            <li> Great color for the summer. Buy the white base from the same brand to enhance the color</li>
            <li> another green i love it thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a bright green. This is it. I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a neon, but it&#x27;s a pretty bright lime green with slight yellow undertones and dries matte. Also, this dries very very quickly! I&#x27;ve never had a nail polish dry so fast! This takes 2-3 coats to be opaque. Shipping was very fast, the minute I ordered it to the minute it came my doorstep was 5 days. Very good, especially coming all the way from California (I live on the East Coast). Overall I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> My new fav color! It looks so good&lt;br /&gt;on the toes! In love</li>
            <li> I think the seller did a great job of  packaging and mailing promptly and safely. The product looked retail new - and I am actually wearing this color now and I get tons of compliments when I wear it on my fingernails or toenails.  It is a great color for summer tanned skin.</li>
            <li> Perfection! Really pops and I get nonstop compliments when I wear it. Amazing on my mani/pedi! I&#x27;m in LOVE! My new favorite color.</li>
            <li> Love the color, but it starts chipping the next day.</li>
            <li> I love OPI colors because they don&#x27;t seem to chip as easily as other brands. This is a fun blue color perfect for spring and summer. I like to mix with a glitter top coat to give a little extra sparkle and a little depth to the nail polish. Overall I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty green a little lighter than the picture but still pretty it looks good on toes &amp; really good on brown or tanned skin a good color for sumner or winter i wear bright colors all year round bright colors make you feel vibrant &amp; cheery . Try this o.p.i. color you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> As with all OPI products, this one is great.  Smooth, shiny, good coverage and long lasting.  Cool color, too.</li>
            <li> Chips like crazy! I never had this problem with other OPI colors!</li>
            <li> The bottle for this polish was very wobbly and would not sit on my counter without falling over.  The writing on the bottle was rubbing off.  The smell of the polish was so strong I was unable to paint my nails.  I was very unhappy with this order.  I have never had this problem before ordering OPI from Amazon.  Not sure I would do it again after this experience.</li>
            <li> Perfect summer color. And you can never go wrong with OPI. :)</li>
            <li> OPI, OPI, OPI!!! WIld shade! It has a nice gloss to it, but looks even better in a matte. Very fun color!</li>
            <li> A little &amp;#34;risky&amp;#34; for me. I usually stick to more traditional colors, but I like this one. It&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li> Love the color, but it chips within hours of using it even with a primer and top coat. I will not be purchasing again..usually I don&#x27;t have a problem with this brand but it just wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
