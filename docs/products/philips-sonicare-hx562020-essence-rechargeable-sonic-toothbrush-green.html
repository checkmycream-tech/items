            <li>Loved the price of it.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good electronic toothbrush for the price...only has one setting or speed.</li>
            <li>and I feel good after I try it.^_^</li>
            <li>With the seal setup, the tooth brush is on the bulky side and doesn&#x27;t make for a good travel tooth brush despite coming with a travel bag.</li>
            <li>Best product for keeping teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Working great, my hygeinist was really impressed with how much my home care improved after getting this.</li>
            <li>The dentist was very pleased when they found out I was using Sonicare, and they told me that I was using the &amp;#34;best one out there.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He gave me one as a gift, then I bought one for my husband and daughter,  we all love them!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>This is a great product, it is compact, and easy to use with timed cleaning and a handy travel case.</li>
            <li>Its a nice design with the rubberized side grips.</li>
            <li>Now I have to dish out $100 for my two daughters (10 &amp; 11) to have their own Sonicare.</li>
            <li>REALY NICE ELECTRIC SONIC TOOTH BRUSH...</li>
            <li>Lasts over a week on one charge, travel bag is nice, 2 min timer is a plus.</li>
            <li>Great product, good price,  and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!  </li>
            <li>Great value, exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The old Phillips shaver I purchased 13 years ago(made in China, Zhuhai) works very good even today.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>or you want something with a touch of cute-ness :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite satisfied with my Sonicare Essence.</li>
            <li>My dentist checkk up went much better.</li>
            <li>I got it for my boys for Christmas they love it.  </li>
            <li>They now brush their better and</li>
            <li>Read the manual for more information.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used an electronic toothbrush before, and this one is even better than I imagined.</li>
            <li>I love it&lt;br /&gt;little</li>
            <li>For sure.</li>
            <li>My wife love this stuff and told me that her teeth feel smoother than before.</li>
            <li>Takes the effort out of brushing your teeth and makes sure you brush for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Of course, the more juice inside the battery the faster the motors, and hence, the cleaner your mouth.</li>
            <li>So this works really well; brushes well and the 2 minute timer is great.</li>
            <li>The two things that I love about this toothbrush are: 1)</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting brush.</li>
            <li>for on the go, there is no way I&#x27;d be able to use this brush without bringing the charger for longer than a week.</li>
            <li>If you can find a good deal on this brush, it&#x27;s totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better ones</li>
            <li>Definitely better than a manual.</li>
            <li>My suggestion: pony up a bit more money and get a better model.</li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>and now I love love love it.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy any more electronics gadgets from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these for my daughter, who needed something more than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I use the same toothpaste, and brush at the 45 degree angle that the toothbrush recommends, and the line between my gums and teeth is perfect.</li>
            <li>But overall best in the category for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this toothbrush because my mouth feels nice and clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>The quality of this particular product is great.</li>
            <li>I love my new toothbrush, it works great.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean though</li>
            <li>but it works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>keeps my teeth and gums healthy, easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is my second Sonicare to own- great product.</li>
            <li>(look for good deals - I found a package of 5 at Costco recently for a good</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had problems in a very long time! :D</li>
            <li>So far working great.</li>
            <li>I loved this so much</li>
            <li>Glad and excited that I got to use a coupon from amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands and the best electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Without exaggeration, I can confidently claim that my teeth have never been so clean.</li>
            <li>It is quite easy for them.</li>
            <li>I love how it gives you that just dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Works just as good as high dollar toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>but did find that holiday special pricing in the stores (Walmart and Costco) were more competitive with quad pacing featureâ€¦ but works well.</li>
            <li>Very pleased and highly reccommend if you h a ve braces</li>
            <li>Good battery life, a little wierd to get use too, but does a good job.</li>
            <li>Obviously Sonicare it works great</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great because they look completely different</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic and it leaves you feeling like you just had a cleaning at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s always a spot that doesn&#x27;t quite get smooth</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind to my extremely sensitive gums, and 2) the built-in timer to ensure that I&#x27;m brushing for the appropriate amount of time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good toothbrush, but honestly I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between the Philips Sonicare and other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>makes you jump at first because I wasn&#x27;t used to the power of this toothbrush!!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the clean feeling of my teeth after I use it and hope it helps keep plaque from causing detrimental effects on my gums.</li>
            <li>Love the Sonicare Essence very much.  </li>
            <li>This is my first sonic toothbrush and have used many types of electronic toothbrushes to date.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels amazingly clean after just one use AND it gets me excited to brush my teeth knowing that I can feel the difference after I get done.</li>
            <li>He wasn&#x27;t getting the gumline clean</li>
            <li>It does not beep when you should change locations, but I just count or wing it and my mouth still feels clean.</li>
            <li>Teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>Dentist clean feeling from brushing at home.</li>
            <li>something mildew-like grows inside the toothbrush, and I haven&#x27;t figured out a way to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>It works well and makes your teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my teeth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>Two minutes, morning and night, and my teeth and gums are beautifully clean.</li>
            <li>I went from a manual tooth brush to an several brands of electric tooth brushes to this Sonicare and this is by far the best tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Gets me teeth clean so</li>
            <li>Keeps my gums well stimulated and your mouth feels really clean afterward.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and removes more plaque than regular toothbrush and timing is 2 minutes</li>
            <li>I will update to 5 only if good customer service is provided on the replacement.  </li>
            <li>so your mouth becomes accustomed to the full intensity.</li>
            <li>short a good buy</li>
            <li>This is a good basic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is much more intense than those, and hopefully it will help my gums.</li>
            <li>My dentist has been telling me how clean my teeth are and how my plaque is super under control.</li>
            <li>Perhaps Phillips wants to make more profits on the replacements?</li>
            <li>Love this brush, the dentist told me this was the one to get because it does a better job than the newer but smaller versions.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush when it was on sale for ~$30, and it has quickly become one of the best-value purchases I&#x27;ve ever made from Amazon.</li>
            <li>after a normal use (twice a day) of two month, its battery won&#x27;t hold charge any more.</li>
            <li>It builds up in the heads as well, but that&#x27;s much harder to clean... and it can start to smell, well within the 3 months that a head should be good for.</li>
            <li>When my gf put toothpaste on this the first time she hit the ON button before putting it in her mouth and Ker-Sploosh!</li>
            <li>After the 12th brushing you will feel the full intensity which is pretty powerful in my opinion, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Coming from an electric toothbrush and regular floss to this has been amazing.</li>
            <li>Cleans my teeth better than anything i&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always been challenging for me to get my teeth perfectly smooth with a standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of cumbersome and gross.</li>
            <li>but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>On top of the many other glowing reviews I find it great that the entire unit is encapsulated in the body handle completely sealed off.</li>
            <li>My dentist suggested to use electronic toothbrush since it is much more efficient than manual brushing due to it cleaning the gums better.  </li>
            <li>We love this and bought more for other family members.  </li>
            <li>The pressure is just right on the gums and if you follow the YouTube videos Or instructional videos on the angle to be held at.</li>
            <li>It shot right onto the mirror.</li>
            <li>that helps my kids to spend the right amount of time on each quarter of their mouth.</li>
            <li>this really helped him get his teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is the cost of the replacement heads, which is true of most electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Only one of my kids was using one before, and he had the best report at the dentist a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Philips Sonicare now for a few months and my last checkup at the dentist was flawless.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one or two replacement brush heads that didn&#x27;t seem to fit right for some reason, and they made a loud noise when the toothbrush was turned on</li>
            <li>It is very convient and easy to use, I would like to buy a new one for my wife and dad.</li>
            <li>Sonicare&#x27;s are a solid toothbrush that make brushing your teeth significantly easier and more efficient than a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>but I really like it!</li>
            <li>Teeth feel much better than with regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It increases intensity for the first 12 times using it</li>
            <li>one first, kept bragging about it.  </li>
            <li>Loooooooooove it so much!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s my first electronic toothbrush, and whoa, does it every do a thorough job.</li>
            <li>This is my first Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>Gets between teeth and makes gums nice and pink</li>
            <li>My first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>better than having to buy two handles for my son who only needed one toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought it with discount and 10$ coupon, This is my first sonic toothbrush  </li>
            <li>Good for few months.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product the battery has lasted me 3 weeks + loving it so far.</li>
            <li>Neither one is close to perfect but this one&#x27;s problems are much more annoying day to day.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, the handle consist of a sealed battery and motor/magnet that uses induction for charging and moving the head.</li>
            <li>She liked it so much and my old electric toothbrush was on its last legs, so I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast-forward a week, he isn&#x27;t getting up early to brush his teeth, but he is still using it 2x day for the full 2 minute cycle.  </li>
            <li>but this one has the super cute mint green colors with the dots</li>
            <li>I like the choice of color for the brush and the smaller charger, and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>You can get a cheap deal from 3rd party org.</li>
            <li>very convenient, no place for mouth wash water</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You really cant beat it.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with cavities my whole life.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Overall I enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple of the cheaper electronic toothbrushes, but the difference is VERY</li>
            <li>and I ordered it online since it was so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Has worked really well</li>
            <li>I would think that the battery would hold good a couple of years at least.</li>
            <li>I also bought separately more brush heads since I&#x27;m sharing with other members in the household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for an electric toothbrush that didn&#x27;t irritate my gums, left my teeth feeling clean and that the toothbrush didn&#x27;t come apart while brushing</li>
            <li>My gums/teeth are not sensitive, so I found that the pressure/speed from this toothbrush is perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Holds a charge for about 2 weeks (as far as I&#x27;ve noticed while traveling - otherwise it&#x27;s on the charger pretty much</li>
            <li>I do notice the difference in power with this toothbrush compared to my old sonicate (my other Sonicare was 7 years old and was still more powerful than this one).</li>
            <li>In addition, it require the much more expensive brush heads, as the whole top of the brush must be replaced, not just the brush head.</li>
            <li>Not bad product overall.</li>
            <li>The up and down motion is much better than the semi-circle and side to side motion of Crest and Oral B Spin brush type tooth brush.</li>
            <li>The plus of this brush is that it does a great job and is much less costly than some other models.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really love the shrill sound it makes when I turn it on.</li>
            <li>I ordered this toothbrush to replace a much older model that worked about 15 years.  </li>
            <li>After finally stepping up into the 21st century with teeth cleaning, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I believe the other reviewers that without a sale, there may be better models that are worth spending a few more dollars to buy, but at the price point I bought it at, this toothbrush is simply</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>His dentist highly recommends him to get one to ensure his teeth are thoroughly cleaned.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I did just have a professional cleaning, but my teeth feel just as clean as they did when I left the dentist office.</li>
            <li>Great product - refill brushes are expensive however</li>
            <li>My husband has the normal one</li>
            <li>If it lasts as long as my old one, VERY worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>One simple remedy for this is to run the brush under hot water for a few seconds to soften the bristles, and the bristles do soften more over time.</li>
            <li>Of course you also have to get a new set of bristles every 3-4 months of wear.</li>
            <li>I decided to go cheaper getting my new Sonicare</li>
            <li>I plan to upgrade to a new one</li>
            <li>Also while your at it for a new brush, if you don&#x27;t have one, grab a Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for water flossing goodness.</li>
            <li>Replaced my finally worn out, 8 year old Sonicare w/ this economical model.</li>
            <li>but i really liked this one and using for the last few months without any issues.</li>
            <li>Not a big fan myself but the younger kids seem to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>This model feels much cheaper, but my biggest complaint is that while the brush runs for two minutes, it does not pulse at 30 second intervals like the HealthyWhite to inform you that it is time to switch sides of your teeth, making it very easy to brush one section for too long and not get a full mouth brush before the two minutes runs out.</li>
            <li>(My first one finally just died).</li>
            <li>My second Philips toothbrush and the first one held up for years.</li>
            <li>After the first use I could instantly tell that my teeth were cleaner.</li>
            <li>Other than that, i&#x27;m very pleased and wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything less.</li>
            <li>A full charge can last &amp;#62;2 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t seem to beep every 30 seconds like the other ones I have used, and it is one speed: FULL SPEED.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the HealthyWhite, though it did get a little gross, but I was looking for a slightly cheaper price point.</li>
            <li>I love the softness of the bristles (I was worried about them being too hard) and the automatic timer is a genius idea.</li>
            <li>This one has its own problems that I find much more annoying.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 9 yr old son after his trip to the dentist showed he wasn&#x27;t brushing as well as he should be.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and so far no problems, I travel with it and never had it die because it was not getting charged.</li>
            <li>A couple weeks ago, my 7-year old son freaked out one morning thinking he had a cavity.  </li>
            <li>He opened it, charged it overnight and woke up early to brush his teeth.  </li>
            <li>It really gets into all the spaces regular brushes cannot.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a Sonicare toothbrush that was over 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>Has dramatically reduced build up on my teeth, even my dentist was surprised.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist after I&#x27;ve brushed really well with this&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare in the early 90s and this is my 6th one.  </li>
            <li>big,  if it is small one, I will more like</li>
            <li>Have used now for several weeks and works just like my older Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s possible, because my old (very OLD) toothbrush had a warning system.</li>
            <li>The two minute time takes a little getting used to because I normally take a little more time to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>Long live SONICARE!</li>
            <li>teeth and gums are so clean, it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li>Gives a toothbrush a little personality which is always fun.</li>
            <li>From the first use, I notice the clean feeling it left without irritating my gums.</li>
            <li>the replacement heads are expensive, but the generic brands found on amazon work just as well for a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m imagining things, but he uses his regular old Crest of Kids or Colgate for Kids toothpaste, but his teeth look a lot whiter since he started using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;$50</li>
            <li>From what I can see, even if you don&#x27;t completely tighten the head, water will not get into the unit and short it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for over a week and a half and just now needed to charge it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much need for other features, such as beeping and whatnot.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed a dramatic difference in the appearance of my teeth and gums, being my teeth are whiter and my gums are a nice shade of pink and not red.</li>
            <li>The UltraSonic feeling is a little weird at first, but I love it now.</li>
            <li>The only reason i didn&#x27;t give this one 5 stars is because although it has an automatic 2 minute timer, it doesn&#x27;t give you a little beep at the end of each 30 seconds to remind you of how much time is left-</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are some good and bad to the design.</li>
            <li>Holy cow, I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush before, this thing vibrates like mad and tickles your lips, but it&#x27;s all worth it for the dentist clean feeling every day!</li>

            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Good electronic toothbrush for the price...only has one setting or speed.</li>
            <li> and I feel good after I try it.^_^</li>
            <li> With the seal setup, the tooth brush is on the bulky side and doesn&#x27;t make for a good travel tooth brush despite coming with a travel bag.</li>
            <li> Best product for keeping teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> Working great, my hygeinist was really impressed with how much my home care improved after getting this.</li>
            <li> The dentist was very pleased when they found out I was using Sonicare, and they told me that I was using the &amp;#34;best one out there.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He gave me one as a gift, then I bought one for my husband and daughter,  we all love them!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Love it !</li>

            <li> Its a nice design with the rubberized side grips.</li>
            <li> Now I have to dish out $100 for my two daughters (10 &amp; 11) to have their own Sonicare.</li>
            <li> REALY NICE ELECTRIC SONIC TOOTH BRUSH...</li>
            <li> Lasts over a week on one charge, travel bag is nice, 2 min timer is a plus.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price,  and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!  </li>
            <li> Great value, exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The old Phillips shaver I purchased 13 years ago(made in China, Zhuhai) works very good even today.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> or you want something with a touch of cute-ness :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied with my Sonicare Essence.</li>
            <li> My dentist checkk up went much better.</li>
            <li> I got it for my boys for Christmas they love it.  </li>
            <li> They now brush their better and</li>
            <li> Read the manual for more information.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electronic toothbrush before, and this one is even better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;little</li>
            <li> For sure.</li>
            <li> My wife love this stuff and told me that her teeth feel smoother than before.</li>
            <li> Takes the effort out of brushing your teeth and makes sure you brush for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Of course, the more juice inside the battery the faster the motors, and hence, the cleaner your mouth.</li>
            <li> So this works really well; brushes well and the 2 minute timer is great.</li>
            <li> The two things that I love about this toothbrush are: 1)</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting brush.</li>
            <li> for on the go, there is no way I&#x27;d be able to use this brush without bringing the charger for longer than a week.</li>
            <li> If you can find a good deal on this brush, it&#x27;s totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better ones</li>
            <li> Definitely better than a manual.</li>
            <li> My suggestion: pony up a bit more money and get a better model.</li>
            <li> They love it.</li>
            <li> and now I love love love it.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy any more electronics gadgets from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my daughter, who needed something more than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I use the same toothpaste, and brush at the 45 degree angle that the toothbrush recommends, and the line between my gums and teeth is perfect.</li>
            <li> But overall best in the category for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this toothbrush because my mouth feels nice and clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> The quality of this particular product is great.</li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush, it works great.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean though</li>
            <li> but it works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> keeps my teeth and gums healthy, easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare to own- great product.</li>
            <li> (look for good deals - I found a package of 5 at Costco recently for a good</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had problems in a very long time! :D</li>
            <li> So far working great.</li>
            <li> I loved this so much</li>
            <li> Glad and excited that I got to use a coupon from amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and the best electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Without exaggeration, I can confidently claim that my teeth have never been so clean.</li>
            <li> It is quite easy for them.</li>
            <li> I love how it gives you that just dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as high dollar toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> but did find that holiday special pricing in the stores (Walmart and Costco) were more competitive with quad pacing featureâ€¦ but works well.</li>
            <li> Very pleased and highly reccommend if you h a ve braces</li>
            <li> Good battery life, a little wierd to get use too, but does a good job.</li>
            <li> Obviously Sonicare it works great</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great because they look completely different</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic and it leaves you feeling like you just had a cleaning at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s always a spot that doesn&#x27;t quite get smooth</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind to my extremely sensitive gums, and 2) the built-in timer to ensure that I&#x27;m brushing for the appropriate amount of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush, but honestly I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between the Philips Sonicare and other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> makes you jump at first because I wasn&#x27;t used to the power of this toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the clean feeling of my teeth after I use it and hope it helps keep plaque from causing detrimental effects on my gums.</li>
            <li> Love the Sonicare Essence very much.  </li>
            <li> This is my first sonic toothbrush and have used many types of electronic toothbrushes to date.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels amazingly clean after just one use AND it gets me excited to brush my teeth knowing that I can feel the difference after I get done.</li>
            <li> He wasn&#x27;t getting the gumline clean</li>
            <li> It does not beep when you should change locations, but I just count or wing it and my mouth still feels clean.</li>
            <li> Teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> Dentist clean feeling from brushing at home.</li>
            <li> something mildew-like grows inside the toothbrush, and I haven&#x27;t figured out a way to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> It works well and makes your teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my teeth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> Two minutes, morning and night, and my teeth and gums are beautifully clean.</li>
            <li> I went from a manual tooth brush to an several brands of electric tooth brushes to this Sonicare and this is by far the best tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Gets me teeth clean so</li>
            <li> Keeps my gums well stimulated and your mouth feels really clean afterward.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and removes more plaque than regular toothbrush and timing is 2 minutes</li>
            <li> I will update to 5 only if good customer service is provided on the replacement.  </li>
            <li> so your mouth becomes accustomed to the full intensity.</li>
            <li> short a good buy</li>
            <li> This is a good basic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is much more intense than those, and hopefully it will help my gums.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been telling me how clean my teeth are and how my plaque is super under control.</li>
            <li> Perhaps Phillips wants to make more profits on the replacements?</li>
            <li> Love this brush, the dentist told me this was the one to get because it does a better job than the newer but smaller versions.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush when it was on sale for ~$30, and it has quickly become one of the best-value purchases I&#x27;ve ever made from Amazon.</li>
            <li> after a normal use (twice a day) of two month, its battery won&#x27;t hold charge any more.</li>
            <li> It builds up in the heads as well, but that&#x27;s much harder to clean... and it can start to smell, well within the 3 months that a head should be good for.</li>
            <li> When my gf put toothpaste on this the first time she hit the ON button before putting it in her mouth and Ker-Sploosh!</li>
            <li> After the 12th brushing you will feel the full intensity which is pretty powerful in my opinion, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Coming from an electric toothbrush and regular floss to this has been amazing.</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth better than anything i&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always been challenging for me to get my teeth perfectly smooth with a standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of cumbersome and gross.</li>
            <li> but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> On top of the many other glowing reviews I find it great that the entire unit is encapsulated in the body handle completely sealed off.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested to use electronic toothbrush since it is much more efficient than manual brushing due to it cleaning the gums better.  </li>
            <li> We love this and bought more for other family members.  </li>
            <li> The pressure is just right on the gums and if you follow the YouTube videos Or instructional videos on the angle to be held at.</li>
            <li> It shot right onto the mirror.</li>
            <li> that helps my kids to spend the right amount of time on each quarter of their mouth.</li>
            <li> this really helped him get his teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is the cost of the replacement heads, which is true of most electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Only one of my kids was using one before, and he had the best report at the dentist a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Philips Sonicare now for a few months and my last checkup at the dentist was flawless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one or two replacement brush heads that didn&#x27;t seem to fit right for some reason, and they made a loud noise when the toothbrush was turned on</li>
            <li> It is very convient and easy to use, I would like to buy a new one for my wife and dad.</li>
            <li> Sonicare&#x27;s are a solid toothbrush that make brushing your teeth significantly easier and more efficient than a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> but I really like it!</li>
            <li> Teeth feel much better than with regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It increases intensity for the first 12 times using it</li>
            <li> one first, kept bragging about it.  </li>
            <li> Loooooooooove it so much!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s my first electronic toothbrush, and whoa, does it every do a thorough job.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Gets between teeth and makes gums nice and pink</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> better than having to buy two handles for my son who only needed one toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought it with discount and 10$ coupon, This is my first sonic toothbrush  </li>
            <li> Good for few months.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product the battery has lasted me 3 weeks + loving it so far.</li>
            <li> Neither one is close to perfect but this one&#x27;s problems are much more annoying day to day.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, the handle consist of a sealed battery and motor/magnet that uses induction for charging and moving the head.</li>
            <li> She liked it so much and my old electric toothbrush was on its last legs, so I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast-forward a week, he isn&#x27;t getting up early to brush his teeth, but he is still using it 2x day for the full 2 minute cycle.  </li>
            <li> but this one has the super cute mint green colors with the dots</li>
            <li> I like the choice of color for the brush and the smaller charger, and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> You can get a cheap deal from 3rd party org.</li>
            <li> very convenient, no place for mouth wash water</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> You really cant beat it.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with cavities my whole life.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Overall I enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of the cheaper electronic toothbrushes, but the difference is VERY</li>
            <li> and I ordered it online since it was so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Has worked really well</li>
            <li> I would think that the battery would hold good a couple of years at least.</li>
            <li> I also bought separately more brush heads since I&#x27;m sharing with other members in the household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for an electric toothbrush that didn&#x27;t irritate my gums, left my teeth feeling clean and that the toothbrush didn&#x27;t come apart while brushing</li>
            <li> My gums/teeth are not sensitive, so I found that the pressure/speed from this toothbrush is perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Holds a charge for about 2 weeks (as far as I&#x27;ve noticed while traveling - otherwise it&#x27;s on the charger pretty much</li>
            <li> I do notice the difference in power with this toothbrush compared to my old sonicate (my other Sonicare was 7 years old and was still more powerful than this one).</li>
            <li> In addition, it require the much more expensive brush heads, as the whole top of the brush must be replaced, not just the brush head.</li>
            <li> Not bad product overall.</li>
            <li> The up and down motion is much better than the semi-circle and side to side motion of Crest and Oral B Spin brush type tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The plus of this brush is that it does a great job and is much less costly than some other models.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really love the shrill sound it makes when I turn it on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush to replace a much older model that worked about 15 years.  </li>
            <li> After finally stepping up into the 21st century with teeth cleaning, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I believe the other reviewers that without a sale, there may be better models that are worth spending a few more dollars to buy, but at the price point I bought it at, this toothbrush is simply</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> His dentist highly recommends him to get one to ensure his teeth are thoroughly cleaned.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I did just have a professional cleaning, but my teeth feel just as clean as they did when I left the dentist office.</li>
            <li> Great product - refill brushes are expensive however</li>
            <li> My husband has the normal one</li>
            <li> If it lasts as long as my old one, VERY worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> One simple remedy for this is to run the brush under hot water for a few seconds to soften the bristles, and the bristles do soften more over time.</li>
            <li> Of course you also have to get a new set of bristles every 3-4 months of wear.</li>
            <li> I decided to go cheaper getting my new Sonicare</li>
            <li> I plan to upgrade to a new one</li>
            <li> Also while your at it for a new brush, if you don&#x27;t have one, grab a Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for water flossing goodness.</li>
            <li> Replaced my finally worn out, 8 year old Sonicare w/ this economical model.</li>
            <li> but i really liked this one and using for the last few months without any issues.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan myself but the younger kids seem to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This model feels much cheaper, but my biggest complaint is that while the brush runs for two minutes, it does not pulse at 30 second intervals like the HealthyWhite to inform you that it is time to switch sides of your teeth, making it very easy to brush one section for too long and not get a full mouth brush before the two minutes runs out.</li>
            <li> (My first one finally just died).</li>
            <li> My second Philips toothbrush and the first one held up for years.</li>
            <li> After the first use I could instantly tell that my teeth were cleaner.</li>
            <li> Other than that, i&#x27;m very pleased and wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything less.</li>
            <li> A full charge can last &amp;#62;2 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t seem to beep every 30 seconds like the other ones I have used, and it is one speed: FULL SPEED.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the HealthyWhite, though it did get a little gross, but I was looking for a slightly cheaper price point.</li>
            <li> I love the softness of the bristles (I was worried about them being too hard) and the automatic timer is a genius idea.</li>
            <li> This one has its own problems that I find much more annoying.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 9 yr old son after his trip to the dentist showed he wasn&#x27;t brushing as well as he should be.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and so far no problems, I travel with it and never had it die because it was not getting charged.</li>
            <li> A couple weeks ago, my 7-year old son freaked out one morning thinking he had a cavity.  </li>
            <li> He opened it, charged it overnight and woke up early to brush his teeth.  </li>
            <li> It really gets into all the spaces regular brushes cannot.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Sonicare toothbrush that was over 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> Has dramatically reduced build up on my teeth, even my dentist was surprised.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist after I&#x27;ve brushed really well with this&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare in the early 90s and this is my 6th one.  </li>
            <li> big,  if it is small one, I will more like</li>
            <li> Have used now for several weeks and works just like my older Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s possible, because my old (very OLD) toothbrush had a warning system.</li>
            <li> The two minute time takes a little getting used to because I normally take a little more time to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> Long live SONICARE!</li>
            <li> teeth and gums are so clean, it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Gives a toothbrush a little personality which is always fun.</li>
            <li> From the first use, I notice the clean feeling it left without irritating my gums.</li>
            <li> the replacement heads are expensive, but the generic brands found on amazon work just as well for a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m imagining things, but he uses his regular old Crest of Kids or Colgate for Kids toothpaste, but his teeth look a lot whiter since he started using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;$50</li>
            <li> From what I can see, even if you don&#x27;t completely tighten the head, water will not get into the unit and short it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over a week and a half and just now needed to charge it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much need for other features, such as beeping and whatnot.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed a dramatic difference in the appearance of my teeth and gums, being my teeth are whiter and my gums are a nice shade of pink and not red.</li>
            <li> The UltraSonic feeling is a little weird at first, but I love it now.</li>
            <li> The only reason i didn&#x27;t give this one 5 stars is because although it has an automatic 2 minute timer, it doesn&#x27;t give you a little beep at the end of each 30 seconds to remind you of how much time is left-</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are some good and bad to the design.</li>
            <li> Holy cow, I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush before, this thing vibrates like mad and tickles your lips, but it&#x27;s all worth it for the dentist clean feeling every day!</li>
            <li> I normally only carry a small bag for short trips and this takes twice as much space as my spin brush.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get used to at first.</li>
            <li> so you know when you&#x27;ve brushed long enough&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Well made, works well and the charge last a long time even with two users.</li>
            <li> The battery cannot last too long</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the older model beeped every 30 seconds so that the brush could be applied to a different part of the mouth each time it beeped, and this brush doesn&#x27;t beep.  </li>
            <li> I mean, WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> Less hard plaque, which I tend to build up quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Holds battery charge also for a long time and gives warning signam for recharge well in advance.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> But you could go really long without charging it.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the charge holds a long time.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s help decrease the mold, but not completely gotten rid of it.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting one of these toothbrushes for a long time, but never wanted to spend the money.  </li>
            <li> I spent over $100 on a man shaver and the blades have to be replaced only after one year.</li>
            <li> Following the advice of the other reviewers, I&#x27;m removing the head and cleaning it after each use.</li>
            <li> Since it does come apart (and I take mine apart EVERY brushing, rinse and set to dry -</li>
            <li> I know that some people have complained about having to clean this unit, which it states in manual that you are supposed to do so at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I am not a &amp;#34;messy brusher&amp;#34; and I have not cleaned mine because the lower part that screws on does not get wet, and I dry mine after each use.</li>
            <li> Also, the replacement heads are way too expensive, but luckily my sister also has one of these toothbrushes, so we buy the 6 pack from Sam&#x27;s Club and split</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would have been a 5-star, the only reserve I have is that if you are sharing this toothbrush by switching brush heads, than it is very easy to accumulate mold/mildew inside the hollow area where the brush head connects to the base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Sonicare toothbrushes so the feel of using it over the past few weeks is still a bit strange.  </li>
            <li> So be careful with that.</li>
            <li> Different speed are not available</li>
            <li> Only lasted a few months by November</li>
            <li> The replacement head is a bit on the expensive side, but for how well it cleans, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> like the chord rap in the base unit, nice touch.</li>
            <li> But when i got home the shipping box is opened in front of my door and toothbrush is missing from the shipping box leaving only other products i bought.</li>
            <li> The small head ensures I can get the hard to reach places, and also prevents me from using too much toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I saw a improvement in his teeth in a week, ill never go back to a normal brush for him.</li>
            <li> I bought two of this which seemed arrived with other products i purchased from amazon prime.</li>
            <li> Usually whenever I got a teeth cleaning, the dentist would notice a cavity forming or some extra work needing to be done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a cheaper model than other Sonicare products since it doesn&#x27;t have any customization.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had just paid the extra and bought the model I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it can easily get gross inside the connection part where the base of brush screwed onto the handle.</li>
            <li> I find it a little messy as it kinda runs down your hand as you use it, so you need to wipe it off after using before you put it back on the charger.</li>
            <li> It feels weird, but it even says in the directions that it will feel odd at first and your gums get used to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> One thing to consider, is that if you have sensitive teeth/gums, or receding gum lines, the brush may be a bit tough on those spots.</li>
            <li> and it gets in the hard to reach spots in the back of my mouth as well.</li>
            <li> I have asked the co. for more details on replacement if this is a faulty base for some reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started laying my down with the brush hanging over the edge of the sink when it&#x27;s done</li>
            <li> Well - that&#x27;s less than what my pediatric dentist will charge to drill &amp; fill!&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I floss (every day), I get much less mung from between my teeth, and my gums don&#x27;t hurt at all from flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am an over-brusher and would spend upwards of 5-10 minutes just doing random tasks while brushing my teeth, but this limits me to usually 3-4 minutes max, thanks to the timer.</li>
            <li> The brush heads can be a little bit pricey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Sonicare brushes in the past but wanted to try this one as it was 1) cheaper and 2)</li>
            <li> It seems ridiculous to have to dry off your toothbrush after using it each time.</li>
            <li> Used it for a few months.</li>
            <li> Takes a few days to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> You just turn it on, and brush until it automatically shuts off--the apex of mindless convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> he loves the green handle on the grip.</li>
            <li> What a wasted of electricity.</li>
            <li> Which, by the way, was just a few months ago.</li>
            <li> a little annoying to clean, but can be cleaned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with the metal pin getting loose and rendering the brush useless (when out of the warranty period) on other models.</li>
            <li> Just wish the brush heads last longer and were not so expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> The charger has a small footprint, sits out of the way on the counter</li>
            <li> In addition, I found Phillips&#x27; other products quality also decreased.</li>
            <li> I have a habit of brushing too hard and receding my gums, but the vibrations take care of the pressure gauging</li>
            <li> Some people had not cleaned their unit at all, and complained about mold growing inside and stated that it was a &amp;#34;design defect&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> However, the size is quite big and at times I find it inconvenient to hold it and switch sides.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a toothbrush, not a smartphone.  </li>
            <li> It is a little on the annoying side to have the tooth brush stop when I&#x27;m half way done with the bottom teeth, but with a push of the button, off it goes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> brush does need a cleaning now and then, but not to an extent that I&#x27;m getting frustrating with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You may be saying it&#x27;s a waste of money if your kiddo has the re-occurring strep throat, flu, or other nasty winter time sickness.  </li>
            <li> I was buying cruddy Spiderman and Ironman disposable childrens&#x27; electric toothbrushes for a while, never going back!</li>
            <li> If not, this would be an expensive venture , no ?</li>
            <li> shortcoming is hesitated because Chitsolmo itself seems to be expensive sublimely</li>
            <li> The replacement head is quite expensive.</li>
            <li> You have to get down inside of it frequently or nasty toothpaste gunk builds up.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> We just ordered two replacement brush head :(</li>
            <li> It has been 9 months since I purchased this and the base will not charge anymore.</li>
            <li> (base &#x3D;</li>
            <li> the toothbrush base and not the docking station)</li>
            <li> It is quite annoying.</li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t unscrew the brush head from the base, it seems as though the water and toothpaste residue will collect under the pivot head, causing the brush head and the base to start smelling horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, good price,  and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 9 yr old son after his trip to the dentist showed he wasn&#x27;t brushing as well as he should be. He wasn&#x27;t getting the gumline clean and  his back teeth had a lot of build up. This toothbrush did the trick. Next time we went to the dentist it was obvious this really helped him get his teeth clean.  I have since bought another one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really love the shrill sound it makes when I turn it on.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The pressure is just right on the gums and if you follow the YouTube videos Or instructional videos on the angle to be held at. Of course you also have to get a new set of bristles every 3-4 months of wear. You can get a cheap deal from 3rd party org. or Costco etc.  It has been 9 months since I purchased this and the base will not charge anymore. I have asked the co. for more details on replacement if this is a faulty base for some reason. I will update to 5 only if good customer service is provided on the replacement.  I would think that the battery would hold good a couple of years at least. If not, this would be an expensive venture , no ? (base &#x3D; the toothbrush base and not the docking station)</li>
            <li> Obviously Sonicare it works great but this one has the super cute mint green colors with the dots, I didn&#x27;t know it would have those added touches but I really like it! Gives a toothbrush a little personality which is always fun. My husband has the normal one and it&#x27;s great because they look completely different so I&#x27;d recommend if someone else in the family has a Sonicare or you want something with a touch of cute-ness :)</li>
            <li> Used it for a few months. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied with my Sonicare Essence. I like the 2-minute timer. The dentist was very pleased when they found out I was using Sonicare, and they told me that I was using the &amp;#34;best one out there.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I don&#x27;t like is (maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m left-handed, so my hand and movement come from the opposite angle), but the head of the toothbrush sometimes unscrews while I use it, and I have to screw the thing back on. Also, the replacement heads are way too expensive, but luckily my sister also has one of these toothbrushes, so we buy the 6 pack from Sam&#x27;s Club and split it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you want a good electric toothbrush but don&#x27;t want to shell out tons of money, this model is a great way to go.</li>
            <li> All my life I had only used the cheapest toothbrush.  I had always heard how great the electric brushes were and thought I would give this a shot since the price was so great.  I will never go back to manual brushes.  This is a must have for everyone.  It does not beep when you should change locations, but I just count or wing it and my mouth still feels clean.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product the battery has lasted me 3 weeks + loving it so far. need to replace the heads tho.</li>
            <li> I decided to go cheaper getting my new Sonicare I do notice the difference in power with this toothbrush compared to my old sonicate (my other Sonicare was 7 years old and was still more powerful than this one).</li>
            <li> Teeth feel much better than with regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and so far no problems, I travel with it and never had it die because it was not getting charged. the replacement heads are expensive, but the generic brands found on amazon work just as well for a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great value, exactly as described. Gets your teeth extremely clean and the 2 minute timer is so helpful! ! !</li>
            <li> Its a nice design with the rubberized side grips. I like that it does NOT have the 30 second cycling beeps.</li>
            <li> Takes a few days to get used to it.  Great product - refill brushes are expensive however</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  My dentist checkk up went much better.</li>
            <li> I got it for my boys for Christmas they love it.  They now brush their better and the auto off timer is the best!!</li>
            <li> Good for few months. Not bad product overall.</li>
            <li> I have not used a Sonicare toothbrush before now. I have had mine for two weeks and I have noticed a dramatic difference in the appearance of my teeth and gums, being my teeth are whiter and my gums are a nice shade of pink and not red. I know that some people have complained about having to clean this unit, which it states in manual that you are supposed to do so at least once a week. Some people had not cleaned their unit at all, and complained about mold growing inside and stated that it was a &amp;#34;design defect&amp;#34;. I am not a &amp;#34;messy brusher&amp;#34; and I have not cleaned mine because the lower part that screws on does not get wet, and I dry mine after each use. Bottom line, this is a great product. It increases intensity for the first 12 times using it so your mouth becomes accustomed to the full intensity. After the 12th brushing you will feel the full intensity which is pretty powerful in my opinion, but not unpleasant. Read the manual for more information.</li>
            <li> Got this to replace my one from 2011..the battery just stppoed holding a charge. But I cant complain.  4 years awesome and I bought the same model. I like a bigger handle!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, the dentist told me this was the one to get because it does a better job than the newer but smaller versions. Holy cow, I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush before, this thing vibrates like mad and tickles your lips, but it&#x27;s all worth it for the dentist clean feeling every day!</li>
            <li> Working great, my hygeinist was really impressed with how much my home care improved after getting this. I have a habit of brushing too hard and receding my gums, but the vibrations take care of the pressure gauging</li>
            <li> Our son g&lt;br /&gt;ot one first, kept bragging about it.  He gave me one as a gift, then I bought one for my husband and daughter,  we all love them!</li>
            <li> I have this model toothbrush and I absolutely love it.  A couple weeks ago, my 7-year old son freaked out one morning thinking he had a cavity.  He didn&#x27;t, but the scare got him begging me to buy him this toothbrush.  So, I dished out $50 and got him the toothbrush - yes, a lot of money, and yes, he WILL use it.&lt;br /&gt;He waited for UPS to deliver it.  He opened it, charged it overnight and woke up early to brush his teeth.  Fast-forward a week, he isn&#x27;t getting up early to brush his teeth, but he is still using it 2x day for the full 2 minute cycle.  I haven&#x27;t told him the brush can be shut off before the 2 minutes are up and he hasn&#x27;t figured it out, so....let him brush!  Maybe I&#x27;m imagining things, but he uses his regular old Crest of Kids or Colgate for Kids toothpaste, but his teeth look a lot whiter since he started using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;$50 for a kid to have a toothbrush.  Well - that&#x27;s less than what my pediatric dentist will charge to drill &amp; fill!&lt;br /&gt;You may be saying it&#x27;s a waste of money if your kiddo has the re-occurring strep throat, flu, or other nasty winter time sickness.  Since it does come apart (and I take mine apart EVERY brushing, rinse and set to dry - and my son does, too), simply put the brush section in the silverware section of the dishwasher to sanitize it.  Viola!  No need to pitch the $50 brush in the garbage!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, please do replace the brush head when the blue indicator is gone.&lt;br /&gt;Overall - great toothbrush.  Now I have to dish out $100 for my two daughters (10 &amp; 11) to have their own Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this toothbrush because my mouth feels nice and clean after I use it. My teeth are noticeably cleaner too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electronic toothbrush before, and this one is even better than I imagined. Loooooooooove it so much!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t feel very good&lt;br /&gt;not very convenient, no place for mouth wash water&lt;br /&gt;the price is ok&lt;br /&gt;will change it soon</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;little big,  if it is small one, I will more like it.&lt;br /&gt;over all , it is fair</li>
            <li> Replaced my finally worn out, 8 year old Sonicare w/ this economical model. Have used now for several weeks and works just like my older Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t seem to beep every 30 seconds like the other ones I have used, and it is one speed: FULL SPEED. When my gf put toothpaste on this the first time she hit the ON button before putting it in her mouth and Ker-Sploosh! It shot right onto the mirror. Lesson learned Mr. Philips T. Sonicare...lesson learned!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Great price. I got one for all 6 of our family members. Only one of my kids was using one before, and he had the best report at the dentist a few weeks ago. I&#x27;m convinced the Sonicare is helping- so we are all switching!</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift and it is used and loved</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Sonicare toothbrushes so the feel of using it over the past few weeks is still a bit strange.  My teeth feel very clean though and I like that it turns off at two minutes.  My dentist recommended this one.</li>
            <li> It is very convient and easy to use, I would like to buy a new one for my wife and dad.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an electric toothbrush that didn&#x27;t irritate my gums, left my teeth feeling clean and that the toothbrush didn&#x27;t come apart while brushing and that&#x27;s what I found here. This toothbrush cleans my teeth and leaves them feeling like I have had them cleaned by the dentist.</li>
            <li> Love this! Works so awesome. Teeth have never felt so clean. Works just as good as high dollar toothbrushes. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the clean feeling of my teeth after I use it and hope it helps keep plaque from causing detrimental effects on my gums.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush. My electric brush but i really liked this one and using for the last few months without any issues. Holds battery charge also for a long time and gives warning signam for recharge well in advance.&lt;br /&gt;In short a good buy</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so good after using this toothbrush. It really gets into all the spaces regular brushes cannot. I highly recommend this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> This is a good basic electric toothbrush. A full charge can last &amp;#62;2 weeks of daily use. My only complaint is it can easily get gross inside the connection part where the base of brush screwed onto the handle.</li>
            <li> its works flawlessly after 3 months.  Just wish the brush heads last longer and were not so expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> Dentist clean feeling from brushing at home.</li>
            <li> My dentist tried to sell me the fancy version of this that tells you when to move the brush. I figured I could count to 30 and save $180. Following the advice of the other reviewers, I&#x27;m removing the head and cleaning it after each use. I was expecting this brush to be similar to the battery operated vibrating brushes that sell for $7 at the drug store. It is much more intense than those, and hopefully it will help my gums.</li>
            <li> So far working great.</li>
            <li> I loved this so much I bought another for my spouse.  It&#x27;s fantastic and it leaves you feeling like you just had a cleaning at the dentist.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Sonicare toothbrush that was over 10 years old.  It works perfectly  each and every time.  If it lasts as long as my old one, VERY worth every penny.  I don&#x27;t have much need for other features, such as beeping and whatnot.  I mean, it&#x27;s a toothbrush, not a smartphone.  I need it to brush my teeth, and it does that flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Philips Sonicare now for a few months and my last checkup at the dentist was flawless.</li>
            <li> I bought two of this which seemed arrived with other products i purchased from amazon prime. But when i got home the shipping box is opened in front of my door and toothbrush is missing from the shipping box leaving only other products i bought. I don&#x27;t even know who signed the package.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the money. You really cant beat it. Cleans my teeth better than anything i&#x27;ve used thus far. One thing to consider, is that if you have sensitive teeth/gums, or receding gum lines, the brush may be a bit tough on those spots. One simple remedy for this is to run the brush under hot water for a few seconds to soften the bristles, and the bristles do soften more over time. Other than that, i&#x27;m very pleased and wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything less. For sure.</li>
            <li> My wife love this stuff and told me that her teeth feel smoother than before.</li>
            <li> Change the identification to make it easier to find and use.  Instead of  Philips Sonicare HX5620/20 Essence...make it&lt;br /&gt;something like Phillips Sonicare Essence model 1,</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Takes the effort out of brushing your teeth and makes sure you brush for 2 minutes. Helps fight recessed gum lines.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been telling me how clean my teeth are and how my plaque is super under control. I have had problems with cavities my whole life. It&#x27;s genetics! Usually whenever I got a teeth cleaning, the dentist would notice a cavity forming or some extra work needing to be done. I haven&#x27;t had problems in a very long time! :D</li>
            <li> Been using this toothbrush a while now and I can&#x27;t imagine life without it. It cleans so well and the battery lasts FOREVER. In fact, I travelled for some 3 weeks and I did not have to charge it even once! Of course, the more juice inside the battery the faster the motors, and hence, the cleaner your mouth. But you could go really long without charging it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush, but honestly I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between the Philips Sonicare and other electric toothbrushes. Also, I don&#x27;t like that something mildew-like grows inside the toothbrush, and I haven&#x27;t figured out a way to keep it clean. On the plus side, the charge holds a long time.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job on my teeth and gums! I feel like I just got a cleaning from the dentist each time I use it. I purchased one for my wife as well.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a fathers gift. Great reviews from person that received it. Loved the price of it. Glad and excited that I got to use a coupon from amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush to replace a much older model that worked about 15 years.  I like the choice of color for the brush and the smaller charger, and it works fine.  The only negative is that the older model beeped every 30 seconds so that the brush could be applied to a different part of the mouth each time it beeped, and this brush doesn&#x27;t beep.  I never brushed my mouth one section at a time anyway, but for someone that does, that feature is lacking. The plus of this brush is that it does a great job and is much less costly than some other models.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare to own- great product. Sonicare toothbrushes give you the feeling of just having your teeth cleaned at the dentist office. The only reason i didn&#x27;t give this one 5 stars is because although it has an automatic 2 minute timer, it doesn&#x27;t give you a little beep at the end of each 30 seconds to remind you of how much time is left- that helps my kids to spend the right amount of time on each quarter of their mouth.</li>
            <li> Price range ratio efficiency seems to be very excellent as useand&lt;br /&gt;A shortcoming is hesitated because Chitsolmo itself seems to be expensive sublimely</li>
            <li> Sonicare&#x27;s are a solid toothbrush that make brushing your teeth significantly easier and more efficient than a normal toothbrush.  It&#x27;s always been challenging for me to get my teeth perfectly smooth with a standard toothbrush.  There&#x27;s always a spot that doesn&#x27;t quite get smooth and I would have to go back over it.  I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore with the Sonicare and it gets in the hard to reach spots in the back of my mouth as well.</li>
            <li> I never used an electronic toothbrush until this one.  My dentist suggested to use electronic toothbrush since it is much more efficient than manual brushing due to it cleaning the gums better.  She recommended this brand and I&#x27;ve been using it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a cheaper model than other Sonicare products since it doesn&#x27;t have any customization.  My gums/teeth are not sensitive, so I found that the pressure/speed from this toothbrush is perfectly fine.  I also bought separately more brush heads since I&#x27;m sharing with other members in the household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would have been a 5-star, the only reserve I have is that if you are sharing this toothbrush by switching brush heads, than it is very easy to accumulate mold/mildew inside the hollow area where the brush head connects to the base.  So be careful with that.</li>
            <li> There is no timer on this model.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> So this works really well; brushes well and the 2 minute timer is great. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. However, if you put it back in its stand after you are done the stand gets all moldy and gross. Likewise, the toothbrush has crevices in it that fill with mold as it dries. I&#x27;ve started laying my down with the brush hanging over the edge of the sink when it&#x27;s done and that&#x27;s help decrease the mold, but not completely gotten rid of it. It seems ridiculous to have to dry off your toothbrush after using it each time. It&#x27;s kind of cumbersome and gross. I would probably look into a more expensive one that does not have the same crevice to collect mold.</li>
            <li> after a normal use (twice a day) of two month, its battery won&#x27;t hold charge any more. We just ordered two replacement brush head :(</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush when it was on sale for ~$30, and it has quickly become one of the best-value purchases I&#x27;ve ever made from Amazon. I believe the other reviewers that without a sale, there may be better models that are worth spending a few more dollars to buy, but at the price point I bought it at, this toothbrush is simply incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my first electronic toothbrush, and whoa, does it every do a thorough job. Without exaggeration, I can confidently claim that my teeth have never been so clean. The two things that I love about this toothbrush are: 1) it&#x27;s kind to my extremely sensitive gums, and 2) the built-in timer to ensure that I&#x27;m brushing for the appropriate amount of time. You just turn it on, and brush until it automatically shuts off--the apex of mindless convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does need a cleaning now and then, but not to an extent that I&#x27;m getting frustrating with it. Consider me sold on the Sonicare brand; if/when this brush gives up the ghost, I&#x27;ll definitely be looking to get another!</li>
            <li> replaced a more expensive version of my sonicare that died. Preferred the one I had. Different speed are not available</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned in 5 years. (My first one finally just died). I&#x27;ve tried other brands and the best electric toothbrushes come from Philips IMHO.</li>
            <li> Son has braces and he jusr disent brush properly so i splurged a nd got this. I saw a improvement in his teeth in a week, ill never go back to a normal brush for him. Very pleased and highly reccommend if you h a ve braces</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare toothbrush and I really like it.  The only downside is the cost of the replacement heads, which is true of most electric toothbrushes.  Overall I enjoy using it.  Next time I may upgrade to the one that times you in 30 second increments.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH. My mouth feels amazingly clean after just one use AND it gets me excited to brush my teeth knowing that I can feel the difference after I get done. I use this with whitening toothpaste and it gets my teeth very white. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Good battery life, a little wierd to get use too, but does a good job. a little annoying to clean, but can be cleaned. No complaints</li>
            <li> Love the Sonicare Essence very much.  My second Philips toothbrush and the first one held up for years.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a Dentist. It works well and makes your teeth feel really clean.I find it a little messy as it kinda runs down your hand as you use it, so you need to wipe it off after using before you put it back on the charger.</li>
            <li> The best rechargeable toothbrush made. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I got two of this.  I plan to upgrade to a new one</li>
            <li> Best product for keeping teeth clean.  After the first use I could instantly tell that my teeth were cleaner. A++ great seller.</li>
            <li> Owned battery powered Sonicare and appreciate the unit being rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;Do like the chord rap in the base unit, nice touch.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!  keeps my teeth and gums healthy, easy to use.</li>
            <li> We love this and bought more for other family members.  Great value but did find that holiday special pricing in the stores (Walmart and Costco) were more competitive with quad pacing featureâ€¦ but works well.</li>
            <li> Cleanest feeling from any toothbrush, ever. For $40, best product for your teeth.</li>
            <li> Gift for the wife. Been using them for years. Great product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Has dramatically reduced build up on my teeth, even my dentist was surprised.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting brush. I like that its reduced my brush time. I am an over-brusher and would spend upwards of 5-10 minutes just doing random tasks while brushing my teeth, but this limits me to usually 3-4 minutes max, thanks to the timer. However, if you don&#x27;t unscrew the brush head from the base, it seems as though the water and toothpaste residue will collect under the pivot head, causing the brush head and the base to start smelling horrible. I don&#x27;t know if different brush types will prevent this, but it definitely has it&#x27;s pluses and minuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for on the go, there is no way I&#x27;d be able to use this brush without bringing the charger for longer than a week.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting one of these toothbrushes for a long time, but never wanted to spend the money.  I&#x27;ve always had problems with my teeth and gums, and decided to finally give this toothbrush a shot.  I definitely think it has helped me, and my teeth feel a lot cleaner than they do with a regular toothbrush.  If you can find a good deal on this brush, it&#x27;s totally worth it.  I&#x27;ve used a couple of the cheaper electronic toothbrushes, but the difference is VERY noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Helps with hard-to-reach places&lt;br /&gt;- Teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist after I&#x27;ve brushed really well with this&lt;br /&gt;- 2-minute timer so you know when you&#x27;ve brushed long enough&lt;br /&gt;- Bristle indicator shows when you need to replace the brush head (and you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;s not cleaning as well once it needs to be replaced)&lt;br /&gt;- Great for massaging gums&lt;br /&gt;- The charger has a small footprint, sits out of the way on the counter&lt;br /&gt;- Holds a charge for about 2 weeks (as far as I&#x27;ve noticed while traveling - otherwise it&#x27;s on the charger pretty much all the time)&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a travel case that&#x27;s perfect for putting in your toiletry bag&lt;br /&gt;- My mouth definitely feels healthier (my gums especially) since using this brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The brush heads can be a little bit pricey (look for good deals - I found a package of 5 at Costco recently for a good price)&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve had one or two replacement brush heads that didn&#x27;t seem to fit right for some reason, and they made a loud noise when the toothbrush was turned on&lt;br /&gt;- I haven&#x27;t necessarily felt like my teeth have gotten whiter since using this brush, like a lot of the ads try to emphasize (I&#x27;ve been using the brush for about 8 months)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I would definitely recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Gets between teeth and makes gums nice and pink</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush.  I&#x27;m sure there are better ones but it works pretty good.  Didn&#x27;t check before buying but replacement brushes are more expensive than I would have imagined.  Brushes claim to last 3 months but I changed the one that came with it after 1.5.</li>
            <li> Now my parents are using it.It is quite easy for them.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it is compact, and easy to use with timed cleaning and a handy travel case.</li>
            <li> better than having to buy two handles for my son who only needed one toothbrush. he loves the green handle on the grip.</li>
            <li> Good electronic toothbrush for the price...only has one setting or speed. Directions indicate there may be others but they are also for multiple models. Definitely better than a manual. Had for 2 month now, beginning to notice I should replace head &amp; will do so.</li>
            <li> Great brush - great value</li>
            <li> REALY NICE ELECTRIC SONIC TOOTH BRUSH...</li>
            <li> The connection between the handle and the brush head is not water resistant. You have to take off the brush head every time after you brush teeth. Otherwise, mold will be growing everywhere. It is quite annoying. I don&#x27;t understand why Phillips missed this problem when they designed it. In addition, I found Phillips&#x27; other products quality also decreased. I spent over $100 on a man shaver and the blades have to be replaced only after one year. The old Phillips shaver I purchased 13 years ago(made in China, Zhuhai) works very good even today. No blades replacement required at all. Perhaps Phillips wants to make more profits on the replacements? Guess what, the blades costs $59.99 now!</li>
            <li> Well made, works well and the charge last a long time even with two users.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Sonicare after my last one, the HealthyWhite, died. I was happy with the HealthyWhite, though it did get a little gross, but I was looking for a slightly cheaper price point. I suppose you get what you pay for. This model feels much cheaper, but my biggest complaint is that while the brush runs for two minutes, it does not pulse at 30 second intervals like the HealthyWhite to inform you that it is time to switch sides of your teeth, making it very easy to brush one section for too long and not get a full mouth brush before the two minutes runs out. For this reason alone I would not purchase this model again. In addition, it require the much more expensive brush heads, as the whole top of the brush must be replaced, not just the brush head. My suggestion: pony up a bit more money and get a better model.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for son and daughter in law. They love it. Not a big fan myself but the younger kids seem to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush, it works great. I&#x27;ve had it for over a week and a half and just now needed to charge it for the first time.  It also leaves my teeth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this and I ordered it online since it was so much cheaper. I got it and started using it about 3 months before my next check up. My dentist told me he could tell the difference before I even told him I had gotten it. Less hard plaque, which I tend to build up quite quickly. It was hard to get used to at first. It feels weird, but it even says in the directions that it will feel odd at first and your gums get used to it. Mine did and now I love love love it.</li>
            <li> I have used several electronic toothbrushes and they seemed to be totally inadequate until I tried this one. I can feel and see the difference. Two thumbs up to Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This is my first sonic toothbrush and have used many types of electronic toothbrushes to date. So perspective compares to a completely different category of toothbrushes. Get a sonic toothbrush. The quality of this particular product is great. On top of the many other glowing reviews I find it great that the entire unit is encapsulated in the body handle completely sealed off. My wife and I take these into the shower and have no worries about them getting damaged. Also while your at it for a new brush, if you don&#x27;t have one, grab a Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for water flossing goodness. Coming from an electric toothbrush and regular floss to this has been amazing.</li>
            <li> Sucked. Only lasted a few months by November it wouldn&#x27;t charge at all. So I&#x27;m using it as a manual toothbrush. Won&#x27;t buy any more electronics gadgets from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! I&#x27;ve never had an electric brush before this one. It even tells you how long to brush, and the intensity gradually increases over the first few times you use it until it is at max strength.</li>
            <li> I had been using an electric toothbrush forever, although not a sonic one. I bought one of these for my daughter, who needed something more than a manual toothbrush. She liked it so much and my old electric toothbrush was on its last legs, so I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful, terrific decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth and gums are so clean, it&#x27;s unbelievable. I use the same toothpaste, and brush at the 45 degree angle that the toothbrush recommends, and the line between my gums and teeth is perfect. Two minutes, morning and night, and my teeth and gums are beautifully clean. When I floss (every day), I get much less mung from between my teeth, and my gums don&#x27;t hurt at all from flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only nit, at all, is that when the two minute time period is up, the toothbrush shuts off without warning. I&#x27;d prefer a beep or some signal ahead of time, so that I could plan accordingly. I know it&#x27;s possible, because my old (very OLD) toothbrush had a warning system. Ideally, I&#x27;d like a way of measuring the four thirty-second quarters of the two minute time period, so I could do my mouth in sections. For now, I&#x27;ll use the clock in my bathroom to time my toothbrushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market for a toothbrush, I&#x27;d give this one a try. It&#x27;s almost perfect, and if you don&#x27;t mind timing one&#x27;s own brushing.</li>
            <li> I have had my toothbrush for two days now, and I bought it after my dental hygienist recommended I start using one to prevent tooth decay at the gum lines. Granted, I did just have a professional cleaning, but my teeth feel just as clean as they did when I left the dentist office. I love the softness of the bristles (I was worried about them being too hard) and the automatic timer is a genius idea. The small head ensures I can get the hard to reach places, and also prevents me from using too much toothpaste.  Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> It is great toothbrush. Cleans the teeth well. I can feel the difference with the vibrations. However, the size is quite big and at times I find it inconvenient to hold it and switch sides. The replacement head is quite expensive. But overall best in the category for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. What a wasted of electricity. I charge it only when needed, but for whatever reason, it holds the charge for only 1 week now when it held for over a month when I purchased it. Which, by the way, was just a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I bought it with discount and 10$ coupon, This is my first sonic toothbrush  and I feel good after I try it.^_^</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now. I&#x27;ve used other Sonicare brushes in the past but wanted to try this one as it was 1) cheaper and 2) the heads looked sturdier. I&#x27;ve had problems with the metal pin getting loose and rendering the brush useless (when out of the warranty period) on other models. This one has its own problems that I find much more annoying. It&#x27;s very difficult to clean. You have to get down inside of it frequently or nasty toothpaste gunk builds up. It builds up in the heads as well, but that&#x27;s much harder to clean... and it can start to smell, well within the 3 months that a head should be good for. I wish I had just paid the extra and bought the model I&#x27;ve used in the past. Neither one is close to perfect but this one&#x27;s problems are much more annoying day to day.</li>
            <li> I just started using this toothbrush, it tickles/makes you jump at first because I wasn&#x27;t used to the power of this toothbrush!! I mean, WOW!!!! I used to use a sonic electric toothbrush, but switched to this toothbrush. I can already see/feel the results. AMAZING!!! I love how it gives you that just dentist clean feeling. It feels like my teeth have been cleaned by a dentist!!! :D Would definitely recommend buying!</li>
            <li> I went from a manual tooth brush to an several brands of electric tooth brushes to this Sonicare and this is by far the best tooth brush. The up and down motion is much better than the semi-circle and side to side motion of Crest and Oral B Spin brush type tooth brush. From the first use, I notice the clean feeling it left without irritating my gums. The two minute time takes a little getting used to because I normally take a little more time to brush my teeth. It is a little on the annoying side to have the tooth brush stop when I&#x27;m half way done with the bottom teeth, but with a push of the button, off it goes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some good and bad to the design. On the positive side, the handle consist of a sealed battery and motor/magnet that uses induction for charging and moving the head. From what I can see, even if you don&#x27;t completely tighten the head, water will not get into the unit and short it out. It might rust out the head, but the handle should still work properly. With the seal setup, the tooth brush is on the bulky side and doesn&#x27;t make for a good travel tooth brush despite coming with a travel bag. I normally only carry a small bag for short trips and this takes twice as much space as my spin brush. For longer trip with a larger bag, I&#x27;m definitely taking this tooth brush. The replacement head is a bit on the expensive side, but for how well it cleans, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare in the early 90s and this is my 6th one.  I am very impressed by their quality and am happy with my dentist bill.  This one is for my teenager nephew and he just has my brace done.  His dentist highly recommends him to get one to ensure his teeth are thoroughly cleaned.  Long live SONICARE! (especially when they are on sale for $29.90!)</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell the difference between a manual toothbrush and this one. Gets me teeth clean so both I and my dentist are happy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and removes more plaque than regular toothbrush and timing is 2 minutes so you know you are brushing for the tecommended time.</li>
            <li> Lasts over a week on one charge, travel bag is nice, 2 min timer is a plus. I was buying cruddy Spiderman and Ironman disposable childrens&#x27; electric toothbrushes for a while, never going back!</li>
            <li> Has worked really well and it is almost a joy to go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> The UltraSonic feeling is a little weird at first, but I love it now. Great buy and great product.&lt;br /&gt;Get It!</li>
            <li> Took several uses to get used to the sensation of the vibration but well worth the effort. Keeps my gums well stimulated and your mouth feels really clean afterward. After finally stepping up into the 21st century with teeth cleaning, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Cleans to the T !! Love it !</li>
            <li> The battery cannot last too long</li>
