            <li>VERY QUICK N COURTEOUS SERVICE</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason it is not 5*s is because it did not stay on all day, so would need a top up.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I truly love this bronzer.</li>
            <li>I will definitley purchase again!:-)</li>
            <li>I love this powder and the liquid makeup.  </li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t like shimmery bronzers because they make my face look even more shiny.</li>
            <li>How I love thee...</li>
            <li>Love this alone or over my matte mousse</li>
            <li>I love this powder specifically for contouring.</li>
            <li>Come check it out :)</li>
            <li>I love using this powder for contouring.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Oh, True Match!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t smear easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to blend</li>
            <li>I love it, exactly the tint on the photo!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light skinned</li>
            <li>It leaves a smooth matte finish &amp; fantastic for the price.</li>
            <li>Very blendable and nice color.</li>
            <li>make up both are good quality and cover uneven areas good.</li>
            <li>True match indeed</li>
            <li>They have replaced CVS, the price was right the delivery was quick and the shade was right.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>My only tip would be to know your skin tone before purchase as some may not be able to blend this as well</li>
            <li>MY PRODUCT WAS EXACT WHAT</li>
            <li>Works great on light skinned women as a bronzer, since most products marketed as bronzers have that annoying glitter; this does not.</li>
            <li>but I use it as a contour shade and it works very well as a contour shade</li>
            <li>I really like this powder as a bronzer, it doesnt make me shiny</li>
            <li>With loreal, you have to open the bottom to get to the pad, then open the top to get to the powder.  </li>
            <li>It blends beautifully and it is not too heavy in color, too dark or too orange.</li>
            <li>I would recommend you get the shade that&#x27;s darker than your complexion because it&#x27;s lighter than the foundation and your normal shade/ tent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also came much quicker than estimated, overall I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no where near this color</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m no where near this color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad just the color was wrong for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> but this product does the same thing for less then half the price.</li>
            <li> A little product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> have pale skin and was worried it would be too dark, but it is actually lighter than the image shows and was therefore perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s too dark and fale-looking.</li>
            <li> It looks dark but blends seemlessly into my skin &amp; has buildable color.</li>
            <li> but, I might have ordered in a shade too dark for my pale skin tone.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I usually use Mac to define my cheeckbones and dust some on the sides of my nose which will elongate and thin out the face...as well as along the jawline....</li>
            <li> But arrived broken, had to put in another container.</li>
            <li> I find it irritating dealing with the package.</li>
            <li> so I made a bad purchase I thought it will be a bit darker than what it was.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as an all-over face powder but I use it as a contour shade and it works very well as a contour shade</li>
            <li> Great product. well defiantly order again. gives nice coat. doesnt look cakey at all. great for sistas!!!!!nim a darker shade and it goes on soooo even</li>
            <li> I brought this powder to use for contouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pale skin and was worried it would be too dark, but it is actually lighter than the image shows and was therefore perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also came much quicker than estimated, overall I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason it is not 5*s is because it did not stay on all day, so would need a top up.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m light skinned but I use this is a bronzer... Loe the color and blendability.</li>
            <li> This is beautiful and not oily or cake-y at. all. I use it as a contour color to accent my cheekbones so I would definitely recommend it. My only tip would be to know your skin tone before purchase as some may not be able to blend this as well if it&#x27;s too dark and fale-looking.</li>
            <li> They have replaced CVS, the price was right the delivery was quick and the shade was right.  What more can I say?  Love it.</li>

            <li> I love this powder and the liquid makeup.  I just don&#x27;t like the packaging. If they mimicked the revlon colorstay powder packaging, this would be perfect!  It&#x27;s a hassle trying to rotate between the powder and the pad.  Revlon&#x27;s packaging has one open/close place, and the plastic disk in between the powder and the pad with mirror can just move back and forth.  With loreal, you have to open the bottom to get to the pad, then open the top to get to the powder.  Not a big deal, but I find it irritating dealing with the package.</li>
            <li> I love it, exactly the tint on the photo! And I received it very fast and in perfect form, i&#x27;m very happy :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I use it for countering. Very blendable and nice color.</li>

            <li> Oh, True Match! How I love thee... let me count the ways. This powder has a superb finish that leaves my face flawless and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love this alone or over my matte mousse make up both are good quality and cover uneven areas good. True match indeed</li>
            <li> I love this powder specifically for contouring. The cool shade is perfect for it. I have a tutorial on YouTube showing how I contour my face with this powder! Come check it out :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;bOJjR6kvc6A</li>
            <li> I love using this powder for contouring. It blends beautifully and it is not too heavy in color, too dark or too orange. I love it. A little product goes a long way. Would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I would recommend you get the shade that&#x27;s darker than your complexion because it&#x27;s lighter than the foundation and your normal shade/ tent.</li>
            <li> VERY QUICK N COURTEOUS SERVICE I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THEM TO A FRIEND/FAMILY AND MY PRODUCT WAS EXACT WHAT I ORDER</li>
            <li> Great coverage.  Don&#x27;t smear easily.  I will purchase more...</li>
            <li> I really like this powder as a bronzer, it doesnt make me shiny it has a matte finish and last all day. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad just the color was wrong for my skin tone.  It says coco so I made a bad purchase I thought it will be a bit darker than what it was.</li>
            <li> My go to makeup it blends so well</li>
            <li> I love it. It is just what I ordered but, I might have ordered in a shade too dark for my pale skin tone. I use this as a contour for me and it works great. Easy to blend just wish I got it in a shade darker but, summer is coming so it will be perfect for that time</li>
