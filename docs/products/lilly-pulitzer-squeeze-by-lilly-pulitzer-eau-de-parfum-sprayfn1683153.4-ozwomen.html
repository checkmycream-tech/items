            <li>This would make a great gift.</li>
            <li>This scent is that great spring to fall day scent.  </li>
            <li>Very nice Summery fragrance</li>

            <li>Love this scent!</li>
            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>when the compliments started pouring in and strangers asked me what was I wearing, I liked it even more!</li>
            <li>In the summer this fragrance is oranges and grapefruits in the warm sun -</li>
            <li>I ordered this one because I read in the reviews that it had a nice citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is nice, generous in size, if that&#x27;s what you like.  </li>
            <li>But I received it fairly quickly and was SO HAPPY ....</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I tried amazon and discovered they had my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this fragrance!</li>
            <li>, it smells great and is freshly squeezed :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s just as lovely in the winter months as it is in the summer months.</li>
            <li>When I wear it, many people ask me what perfume am I wearing.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>This is a lovely scent and the bottle is a keeper too.</li>
            <li>but oh my, this is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many compliments or people</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely scent for spring or summer daytime.  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase more for myself.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume for the summer.</li>
            <li>I receive so many compliments when i wear it.</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent .  </li>
            <li>something I don&#x27;t normally do with fragrance, and so happy I did.  </li>
            <li>a fairly light scent  that I receive so many compliments when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>but I loved it soo much</li>
            <li>It is not overbearing or strongly citrus.  </li>
            <li>Large bottle and very cute packaging.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy it</li>
            <li>This is not the most sophisticated perfume out there, but it is fresh and fun.</li>
            <li>Light, citrusy, and never overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Its so light and citrusy.</li>
            <li>It is light, very summery and refreshing, but has staying power.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a clean smell</li>
            <li>I originally won this in a contest and was surprised how much I liked it but</li>
            <li>I love the gentle scent.</li>
            <li>This is true to its claims.</li>
            <li>just telling me I smell so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a fresh, citrussy scent, heady with orange and grapefruit.  </li>
            <li>I have worn it nearly every day since I bought it and am ordering some more for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I have the blue Lily Pulitzer bottle and that one is a nice summer scent as well.  </li>
            <li>This is a great bargain at Amazon because at a perfume outlet I priced a bottle at half the ounce size for twice the cost!</li>
            <li>Arrived right before Christmas as promised.</li>
            <li>Really pretty, fresh scent for the summer.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what we used to buy in the store...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d shopped for such a scent in the stores and most of them are floral based with citrus</li>
            <li>I first received this as a gift</li>
            <li>Very grapefruit based (and although I&#x27;m not a big fan of grapefruit, I love it)but not at all floral.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this as long as amazon continues to sell it-stores sell it for so much more...</li>
            <li>in winter, Squeeze is wooden crate filled with ripe Clementines.   </li>
            <li>The first spritz I applied brought on an unexpected flurry of sneezes.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this perfume for a ridiculously low price yesterday and figured from the packaging that the scent would be distinctly citrus - not my experience.  </li>
            <li>You probably have to spray more than normal to keep it long lasting, even tho others say they can smell it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something brand new to try,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m guessing the bottle I purchased was probably very old.  </li>
            <li>It is a very soft and feminine orange blossom scent.</li>
            <li>This citrus fragrance has a really lovely harmony of florals to keep it from being too juvenile.</li>
            <li>The large size bottle can last for about 1 1/2 to 2 years without any change in the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Its subtle and sexy</li>
            <li>It is heavy, and chemical, super cloying.  </li>
            <li>and I would smell our mother&#x27;s perfumes - not a young scent to me, not light or fresh.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Arrived right before Christmas as promised. Delightfil!</li>
            <li> I prefer to wear this after taking a shower. It&#x27;s not sweet nor is it floral. It&#x27;s citrus like, of course because of it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful smell.  I&#x27;ve never smelled it before, but based on the description and reviews, I chanced it.  It is light, very summery and refreshing, but has staying power.  Gorgeous packaging.  I was looking for something brand new to try, something I don&#x27;t normally do with fragrance, and so happy I did.  Love this scent!</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever, it smells great and is freshly squeezed :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume for a ridiculously low price yesterday and figured from the packaging that the scent would be distinctly citrus - not my experience.  I had never smelled this fragrance before, but I figured at the price it was selling for, I&#x27;d try it.  I detect barely a citrus scent at all - it reminds me of when I was little and a friend and I would smell our mother&#x27;s perfumes - not a young scent to me, not light or fresh.  I don&#x27;t enjoy it and I&#x27;m guessing the bottle I purchased was probably very old.  I will probably throw it out - I&#x27;m very disappointed, but glad I didn&#x27;t spend much money on this.</li>
            <li> This citrus fragrance has a really lovely harmony of florals to keep it from being too juvenile.

            <li> It seems every time I find something I like, it&#x27;s discontinued or I can&#x27;t find it.  I was thrilled when I tried amazon and discovered they had my favorite perfume.  I was concerned it might be &amp;#34;stale&amp;#34;, so I was a little hesitant to order it......But I received it fairly quickly and was SO HAPPY ....a fairly light scent  that I receive so many compliments when I wear it.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent .  Perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> Very nice Summery fragrance but will wear it whenever I want to! ! The very best price at Amazon and all that excellent Amazon customer service too. Large bottle and very cute packaging. I am keeping this in mind for an impressive gift for a girly girl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big perfume or scent gal but oh my, this is lovely.  I&#x27;ve had so many compliments or people just telling me I smell so fresh and clean.  It is not overbearing or strongly citrus.  It&#x27;s just a clean smell and I&#x27;ve become addicted.  I originally won this in a contest and was surprised how much I liked it but when the compliments started pouring in and strangers asked me what was I wearing, I liked it even more!</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> I love the gentle scent. I can even wear it without offending in an elevator, theater, or cocktail party</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly! The price was the best I could find. This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume and I could not find it locally so I was thrilled to find it online!</li>
            <li> Product was great! I love it and have been very happy with it. I will be ordering from here again.</li>
            <li> This is a fresh, citrussy scent, heady with orange and grapefruit.  It has some basenotes that I can&#x27;t identify that help give the citrus some staying power.  It&#x27;s a lovely scent for spring or summer daytime.  This is not the most sophisticated perfume out there, but it is fresh and fun.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one because I read in the reviews that it had a nice citrus scent.  Lies.  It is heavy, and chemical, super cloying.  There is nothing feminine about it.  The first spritz I applied brought on an unexpected flurry of sneezes.  The bottle is nice, generous in size, if that&#x27;s what you like.  However, that will be all.  Save your money.  No. just no.</li>
            <li> This scent is that great spring to fall day scent.  Light, citrusy, and never overpowering.  Very grapefruit based (and although I&#x27;m not a big fan of grapefruit, I love it)but not at all floral.  I&#x27;d shopped for such a scent in the stores and most of them are floral based with citrus added. This is true to its claims. This is a great bargain at Amazon because at a perfume outlet I priced a bottle at half the ounce size for twice the cost!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this fragrance! I have worn it nearly every day since I bought it and am ordering some more for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Really pretty, fresh scent for the summer.  I have the blue Lily Pulitzer bottle and that one is a nice summer scent as well.  The pink bottle I use in colder weather.</li>
