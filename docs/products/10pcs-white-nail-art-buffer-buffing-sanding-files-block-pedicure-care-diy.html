            <li>they are pretty good.</li>
            <li>i love the fact that i get so many of them, they work fabulously.</li>
            <li>Im sure they will work just fine thoe.</li>
            <li>I have found the perfect buffer getting harder to find.</li>
            <li>I did not get my package as expected as I think it was lost in the mail, but the customer service was excellent and they did not hesitate to get me out a replacement which I did receive fairly quickly!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to carry and it can be used A LOT before it&#x27;s no longer useable.</li>
            <li>basically free if you consider the cost to ship. A+++</li>
            <li>Since she&#x27;s living across the country from me, it&#x27;s nice that she can let me know what she wants</li>
            <li>Great product for the low price.</li>
            <li>Great product, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last all that long, so it&#x27;s nice to pull out a fresh one after a while -- the best part is the price</li>
            <li>Rough grit would work great for filing your nails,</li>
            <li>They have an appropriate amount of grit which is better than some of the ones I&#x27;ve found locally.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the seller who responded quickly that the rest would be shipped out, and that it must have been a packaging error.  </li>
            <li>They came quickly, and there is a lot of them.</li>
            <li>Mild nail buffer.</li>
            <li>Had to come from China but that occurred relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>Got here super quick.</li>
            <li>Break easy but really work well</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not as good as polar blocks.</li>
            <li>These are cheap imitations of the real ones!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Took a while to get them, but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>BUT IT WAS WORTH</li>
            <li>and they are as useful as they looked.</li>
            <li>They took quite a while to get, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth finish, easy to use, grit on 2 sides only so not a big choice on grit size.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of grit.</li>
            <li>but these went right to the trash.</li>
            <li>Yes these took forever to get here, but I didn&#x27;t need them right away.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>3 stars are for Amazon Prime which was great as usual.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Came very fast can&#x27;t wait to use them and I will edit my review</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, but took ages to arrive from Asia.</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll really ruin your nails!</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Much better than what I have bought in the local stores.</li>
            <li>but they work pretty well for the price.</li>
            <li>These nail blocks are exactly the texture I like to file my nails with.</li>
            <li>The only use I can think of is smoothing off the ridges off the top of your nails or toenails</li>
            <li>I will stick to a better buffing block with all different sides from now on.</li>
            <li>Usually, they are too coarse and do more harm than good.</li>
            <li>ESPECIALLY FOR TIPS AND ACRYLICS WHEN YOU NEED TO REMOVE THEM WITHOUT HURTING YOUR OWN NATURAL NAILS.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well and received my order very fast.</li>
            <li>The texture is similar to a nail file or emery board, and they work fine for that application.</li>
            <li>They are much easier to grip there for making it easier to use.</li>
            <li>Worked really well on gel nails</li>
            <li>I got these really fast now</li>
            <li>They take way longer than the real ones to file and shape and they leave a ton of dust in their wake.</li>
            <li>I have used them for years and really appreciate the chance to buy them \\&quot;in bulk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Does the job, just can&#x27;t really be sanitized and used again they start to fall apart</li>
            <li>so they aren&#x27;t good for buffing, each side is the same grit, ROUGH.</li>
            <li>nice buff just doesnt last long</li>
            <li>Not bad just dont get white,</li>
            <li>10 white blocks are firm, good quality foam w/fine grain paper.. .</li>
            <li>They work great on natural nails for buffing and shaping but will crumble when used to shape false nails.</li>
            <li>Can not recommend this seller too highly.</li>
            <li>These buffer blocks are cheaper in price, but if you think about it, you&#x27;ll have to end up buying more sooner, because the quality of these blocks prevents them from lasting a long time.</li>
            <li>These work fine with the other items I purchased with the all my nail care.</li>
            <li>I like how soft these are, yet are grainy enough to buff quickly.</li>
            <li>- I pull out a new one every ~ 10 to 15 days</li>
            <li>I got a large pack of them that should last me like all year, if not longer.</li>
            <li>I only use these buffers for personal use when i do my nails, it is just the right grit not to mess up your nails and make them smooth and soft..</li>
            <li>I will definately be ordering from them again and do recommend this product to anyone who has paid way too much money for this in a regular store!</li>
            <li>I use them on my natural nails.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t even work on natural nails!&lt;br</li>
            <li>use them to file my natural nails.  </li>
            <li>My nails are natural and these help me a lot in keep up the maintanence</li>
            <li>and I can ship it directly to her.</li>
            <li>Too soft.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34;  is just on the surface of the soft foam.</li>
            <li>these aren&#x27;t special buffers, they are just plain buffers, same on all sides, however they work really well!</li>
            <li>Low rating for slow shipping, OK quality, and inconvenience of getting just one.</li>
            <li>They do just the job to buff your nails up but be careful not to do it too much</li>
            <li>It comes off quickly leaving slick foam.</li>
            <li>I used these constantly while doing my own artificial nails, or when removing old product from my natural nails.  </li>
            <li>I hate it when they are soft and tend to start to peel off or crack, and a great deal</li>
            <li>then the large black buffers.</li>
            <li>The buffers are a bit flimsy and they don&#x27;t last very long unless they are used on natural nails..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Can not recommend this seller too highly.</li>
            <li> These buffer blocks are cheaper in price, but if you think about it, you&#x27;ll have to end up buying more sooner, because the quality of these blocks prevents them from lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> These work fine with the other items I purchased with the all my nail care.</li>
            <li> I like how soft these are, yet are grainy enough to buff quickly.</li>
            <li> - I pull out a new one every ~ 10 to 15 days</li>
            <li> I got a large pack of them that should last me like all year, if not longer.</li>
            <li> I only use these buffers for personal use when i do my nails, it is just the right grit not to mess up your nails and make them smooth and soft..</li>
            <li> I will definately be ordering from them again and do recommend this product to anyone who has paid way too much money for this in a regular store!</li>
            <li> I use them on my natural nails.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t even work on natural nails!&lt;br</li>
            <li> use them to file my natural nails.  </li>
            <li> My nails are natural and these help me a lot in keep up the maintanence</li>
            <li> and I can ship it directly to her.</li>
            <li> Too soft.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34;  is just on the surface of the soft foam.</li>
            <li> these aren&#x27;t special buffers, they are just plain buffers, same on all sides, however they work really well!</li>
            <li> Low rating for slow shipping, OK quality, and inconvenience of getting just one.</li>
            <li> They do just the job to buff your nails up but be careful not to do it too much</li>
            <li> It comes off quickly leaving slick foam.</li>
            <li> I used these constantly while doing my own artificial nails, or when removing old product from my natural nails.  </li>
            <li> I hate it when they are soft and tend to start to peel off or crack, and a great deal</li>
            <li> then the large black buffers.</li>
            <li> The buffers are a bit flimsy and they don&#x27;t last very long unless they are used on natural nails..</li>
            <li> Ten of these are gonna last me a long time, and I do my nails all the time!</li>
            <li> I thought you might be able to use it as a file, too, but unless you&#x27;re just doing a little fix up to a broken nail, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to actually file.</li>
            <li> and they will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> they last so long..</li>
            <li> i have noticed that they do not last very long only a few uses before having to toss it and get a new one which is perfetcly</li>
            <li> The ends don&#x27;t have any grit but all four long sides do, and they worked really well for sanding down the ridges on my nails, and the rough edges of finger and toenails after trimming.</li>
            <li> The soft foam starts to break down and your nail cuts into the foam, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I have very soft nails, and this is the only buffer (other than green boards for finishing) that I can use that doesn&#x27;t leave deep scratches in the nail surface.</li>
            <li> It took these so long to come that I had forgotten I ordered them.</li>
            <li> &quot; long with 1\\&quot; sides . .</li>
            <li> They are not as coarse as the similar black and orange nail blocks.</li>
            <li> Can only imagine the carbon footprint on these tiny little things.</li>
            <li> Received only ONE of the 10 advertised ..need my other 9 please..</li>
            <li> Only received one block buffer where r the other 9 ???</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had to use 1 for the last few months.</li>
            <li> By the way, the beauty kiosk in my local mall wanted to sell me ONE of this along with creams and other tchotchkes for THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS!</li>
            <li> I got the shipment within the time frame (even though it was a long time due to China Post).</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;ve been buying these little buffer blocks on Amazon, it has made that frequency much smaller as I can now maintain my nails at home</li>
            <li> Not sure if they will last as long as the blocks I&#x27;ve purchased in the beauty store.  </li>
            <li> Soft, not much effective.</li>
            <li> Quite rough and dust falls off with every use.  </li>
            <li> Product was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product, it is a very low quality product, flimsy, heavy chemical smell won&#x27;t go away</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still perfectly rough.</li>
            <li> Not very durable, falls apart at every use.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> total waste of money!</li>
            <li> and you throw buffers away after one use due to hygiene purposes, this would work</li>
            <li> Pretty useless.</li>
            <li> I thought they were real Polar Block nail buffers.</li>
            <li> The grit is very rough</li>
            <li> Took FOREVER to get these, and then I found them to be of poor quality - very very gritty and hard on natural nails, leaving a rough surface.</li>
            <li> I only use it on hard toe nails.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is hardly any grit and the sponge squeezes down almost flat when trying to use them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a mess.  </li>
            <li> Thought theyd be a little rougher</li>
            <li> I use them a lot, so therefore, I go through quite a few, and found that by ordering the 10 pack it was cheaper than just getting one, however the seller does sell singles of these, so you can order just one</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> They are firm</li>
            <li> These are not fine grit, as i would expect for a buffer.</li>
            <li> These do not hold up past one use.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t need a 10 pack for that small use.</li>
            <li> This buffer was very hard and sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> Not very good quality.</li>
            <li> They get in those hard to get at corners.  </li>
            <li> Will make nails dull and scuffed  rather than shiny.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t purchase these for artificial nails especially if you are a manicurist.</li>
            <li> Not happy with these at all, really thin and had to use one per person other ones I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Each sanding block is very small.</li>
            <li> and they were poorly packaged from the distributor as well.</li>
            <li> and she was not happy.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal but a bit disappointing since I use false nails often.</li>
            <li> Took almost a month to arrive (ships from an international seller) and the quality is awful.</li>
            <li> Not happy!</li>
            <li> Not impressed..</li>
            <li> Wrong again.</li>
            <li> So needless to say , I don&#x27;t like em either.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it as a buffer because I didn&#x27;t want to damage my clients&#x27; nail bed.  </li>
            <li> You can not go wrong!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are fine-standard buffers. Took a million years to arrive.</li>
            <li> Quite rough and dust falls off with every use.  Bought to avoid more expensive Jamberry ones but were not close to same quality.</li>
            <li> Good buffers.  They have an appropriate amount of grit which is better than some of the ones I&#x27;ve found locally.  Took a while to get them, but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t file anything.</li>
            <li> nice buff just doesnt last long</li>
            <li> Not the best quality but worth the price.</li>
            <li> REALLY GREAT FILES!! ESPECIALLY FOR TIPS AND ACRYLICS WHEN YOU NEED TO REMOVE THEM WITHOUT HURTING YOUR OWN NATURAL NAILS.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase these for artificial nails especially if you are a manicurist. The buffers are a bit flimsy and they don&#x27;t last very long unless they are used on natural nails..</li>
            <li> I did not get what was pictured. Each sanding block is very small. Compared to regular sizes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, but took ages to arrive from Asia. Had I known, I probably would have found another product. Can only imagine the carbon footprint on these tiny little things.</li>
            <li> It is as described in the ad, for the price and quantity you get. You can not go wrong! I will definately be ordering from them again and do recommend this product to anyone who has paid way too much money for this in a regular store! You can&#x27;t beat the price on this!</li>
            <li> These buffers are an excellent value and quality for the money. The shipping was very fast and packaged well. I&#x27;ve only had to use 1 for the last few months.</li>
            <li> Love that you get so many of these! They do just the job to buff your nails up but be careful not to do it too much or you&#x27;ll really ruin your nails! I thought you might be able to use it as a file, too, but unless you&#x27;re just doing a little fix up to a broken nail, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to actually file.</li>
            <li> Very fine buffers are ideal for  use in sanding dollhouse miniatures.  They get in those hard to get at corners.  As a plus, I also use them for  my nails!</li>
            <li> these are very good quality and the price was right. I will reorder in the future.</li>
            <li> Product was what I expected. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> customer service was great.  I did not get my package as expected as I think it was lost in the mail, but the customer service was excellent and they did not hesitate to get me out a replacement which I did receive fairly quickly!  I am very satisfied!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This buffer was very hard and sharp edges.  I was afraid to use it as a buffer because I didn&#x27;t want to damage my clients&#x27; nail bed.  I only use it on hard toe nails.  Not a buffer!!</li>
            <li> Took FOREVER to get these, and then I found them to be of poor quality - very very gritty and hard on natural nails, leaving a rough surface.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price. I bought them for at home use with my gel nail kit. I use them on my natural nails.</li>
            <li> These buffer sanding file blocks are great to use because of their size. They are much easier to grip there for making it easier to use. The buffer does a wonderful job too. I like them much better then the large black buffers.</li>
            <li> These do not hold up past one use. Very disappointing. I will not re-order. 3 stars are for Amazon Prime which was great as usual.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a birthday party. It did not come in time. I had no idea it was being shipped from Hong Kong. I am very happy with product. Great for my daughters spa birthday party favor.</li>
            <li> Thought theyd be a little rougher</li>
            <li> I do go and get my nails done prefessionally but since I&#x27;ve been buying these little buffer blocks on Amazon, it has made that frequency much smaller as I can now maintain my nails at home</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I wanted. Just the right amount of grit. Much better than what I have bought in the local stores.</li>
            <li> I needed them for my home business. I sell Jamberry Nails and buying them this way is a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> When you open this buffers, they stink like paint. most of them where glued together. Not a big fan of this.</li>
            <li> Took almost a month to arrive (ships from an international seller) and the quality is awful. I thought nail buffers were a standard thing but these went right to the trash.</li>
            <li> I WAS SPENDING $2.00 FOR 1 BRICK AT MY LOCAL DRUG STORE AND I BOUGHT THESE FOR $3.00 FOR 10 PIECES THEY TOOK ABOUT A WEEK TO GET HERE FROM HONG KONG BUT IT WAS WORTH IT..SAME PRODUCT THAT THEY SELL IN THE DRUG STORE</li>
            <li> I bought this but havent used them yet but when I do I will write a comment about the product. Im sure they will work just fine thoe.</li>
            <li> I order 10 and got only one in the mail ?</li>
            <li> Received only ONE of the 10 advertised ..need my other 9 please..</li>
            <li> I ordered this product 1- for the price, fits my budget just starting off.2- these are the kind we used in college so I know they work and you get quit abit of use out of each one. I&#x27;ll be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> I only use these buffers for personal use when i do my nails, it is just the right grit not to mess up your nails and make them smooth and soft.. i have noticed that they do not last very long only a few uses before having to toss it and get a new one which is perfetcly okay considering you get 10 of them!&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend this product for any nail lover in need of a good buffer!(:</li>
            <li> I have very soft nails, and this is the only buffer (other than green boards for finishing) that I can use that doesn&#x27;t leave deep scratches in the nail surface.</li>
            <li> These are cheap imitations of the real ones!&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t even work on natural nails!&lt;br /&gt;There is hardly any grit and the sponge squeezes down almost flat when trying to use them.&lt;br /&gt;A total waste of money!</li>
            <li> Packaged very well and received my order very fast.</li>
            <li> Only received one block buffer where r the other 9 ??? Not happy!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product, it is a very low quality product, flimsy, heavy chemical smell won&#x27;t go away and they were poorly packaged from the distributor as well.</li>
            <li> Thinner than most Emory blocks you see, works great though. Nice smooth finish, easy to use, grit on 2 sides only so not a big choice on grit size. Worked really well on gel nails</li>
            <li> I got the shipment within the time frame (even though it was a long time due to China Post). Received all 10 buffers in good shape. The only gripe I have is that they&#x27;re cheaper in quality than the ones you get at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. They&#x27;re not as good as polar blocks. These buffer blocks are cheaper in price, but if you think about it, you&#x27;ll have to end up buying more sooner, because the quality of these blocks prevents them from lasting a long time. I guess if you&#x27;re a salon and you throw buffers away after one use due to hygiene purposes, this would work okay. However, I use them at home, and I think I should have just invested in something from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do without this one! It&#x27;s easy to carry and it can be used A LOT before it&#x27;s no longer useable.</li>
            <li> I looked for them everywhere,!!! Finally I have them now  and they are as useful as they looked. My nail and finger tips  are software.</li>
            <li> It took these so long to come that I had forgotten I ordered them. I like the and they will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected but they work pretty well for the price.</li>
            <li> awesome price for what you get!</li>
            <li> Files are pretty small well what can you spect for the price !</li>
            <li> Great for gentle filing, post shaping. These nail blocks are exactly the texture I like to file my nails with. They are not as coarse as the similar black and orange nail blocks.</li>
            <li> these will last me a while, thank you! shipping was fast and these were packaged nicely!</li>
            <li> 10 white blocks are firm, good quality foam w/fine grain paper.. . was worried they would be too course.  . use them to file my natural nails.  block is 3-3/4\\&quot; long with 1\\&quot; sides . . . Received 33 days earlier than estimate.  . . basically free if you consider the cost to ship. A+++</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than I had anticipated...  And it was described correcty</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re alright they arent the highest quality but based on what I paid for them they are pretty good. It was a good buy.</li>
            <li> These work fine with the other items I purchased with the all my nail care.</li>
            <li> The grit falls off after about the 3rd nail. Not very good quality. Ill just go to sallys to get more of these buffing blocks.</li>
            <li> Ordered 10pcs.. received 1pc... Not impressed..</li>
            <li> Yes these took forever to get here, but I didn&#x27;t need them right away. I think there was a review where someone said these only lasted one use. We&#x27;ll I just used one to buff the top layer of my gel polish off so I can remove it and it&#x27;s still perfectly rough. Ten of these are gonna last me a long time, and I do my nails all the time!</li>
            <li> These are not fine grit, as i would expect for a buffer. The texture is similar to a nail file or emery board, and they work fine for that application.</li>
            <li> Does the job of buffing and smoothing. I haven&#x27;t had issues with &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;. Although, I bought the white ones, so unsure if it&#x27;s just the colored ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought From : E-Market1122-Ships From HongKong</li>
            <li> i bought these thinking they were for ombre THEY ARE NOT my phone cut of the buffer part so now i have 20 nail buffers for nothing i guess the family is getting nail buffers for christmas</li>
            <li> I thought these would be more like nail files or stronger buffer pads. They are in between and don&#x27;t work well as either. They scratch your nails if you use on surface, but don&#x27;t file your nails if you use on edge. Pretty useless.</li>
            <li> I used these constantly while doing my own artificial nails, or when removing old product from my natural nails.  A must for those who are doing nails.</li>
            <li> these are my favorite sanding bars.  I go thru them a lot and now my daughter is also using them to do her nails.  My nails are natural and these help me a lot in keep up the maintanence</li>
            <li> I have found the perfect buffer getting harder to find. Usually, they are too coarse and do more harm than good. These are the perfect amount of buff. I am glad I got the 10 pack too so I don&#x27;t have to worry about stocking up.</li>
            <li> Came very fast can&#x27;t wait to use them and I will edit my review</li>
            <li> Exactly as described! My daughter was happy. Since she&#x27;s living across the country from me, it&#x27;s nice that she can let me know what she wants and I can ship it directly to her.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Not bad just dont get white, get some with color.</li>
            <li> Break easy but really work well</li>
            <li> Perfect size very durable and came before shipping</li>
            <li> I got one at home and then after 2 weeks they got another 10.....why?</li>
            <li> i love the fact that i get so many of them, they work fabulously. everyone in my house asked me for one and they also liked how they worked.. they last so long.. great great price for them as well</li>
            <li> I finally received my delivery three weeks after I place the order, and only one block was in the envelope.  I contacted the seller who responded quickly that the rest would be shipped out, and that it must have been a packaging error.  That was almost 3 weeks ago, so we&#x27;ll see if the rest do finally arrive.  As for the quality, it does the job.  Not sure if they will last as long as the blocks I&#x27;ve purchased in the beauty store.  Low rating for slow shipping, OK quality, and inconvenience of getting just one.</li>
            <li> These are great and the value is certainly there. You get plenty for the price and saving money for items you need is obviously always a plus.</li>
            <li> these aren&#x27;t special buffers, they are just plain buffers, same on all sides, however they work really well! I use them a lot, so therefore, I go through quite a few, and found that by ordering the 10 pack it was cheaper than just getting one, however the seller does sell singles of these, so you can order just one if that&#x27;s all that you need, or if you want to try it out before getting 10. however, for basic buffing, (and I even use these instead of a file a lot of the times!) I would deffintly recommend these!</li>
            <li> These do not work like I thought they would. The grit is very rough so they aren&#x27;t good for buffing, each side is the same grit, ROUGH. Rough grit would work great for filing your nails, right? Wrong again. These do not work well for filing your nails. The soft foam starts to break down and your nail cuts into the foam, if that makes sense. For the price I thought it was an incredible deal but I just can&#x27;t find a solid use for these. The only use I can think of is smoothing off the ridges off the top of your nails or toenails but I don&#x27;t need a 10 pack for that small use. I will stick to a better buffing block with all different sides from now on.</li>
            <li> Not happy with these at all, really thin and had to use one per person other ones I&#x27;ve used go through like 3 or 4 people .....so not buying them again. .sorry</li>
            <li> I got these really fast now it&#x27;s on I got everything to do my own nails these will last me for a HOTT minute</li>
            <li> this product is good. I can suggested for those who like two tones in their design. Shipment came on time and in good condition as well.</li>
            <li> these are on the softer side. Its o k. Like I said, I will buy another kind to buff my toe nails.</li>
            <li> Works great and good price!</li>
            <li> Great product for the low price.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for the price! I got a large pack of them that should last me like all year, if not longer. The ends don&#x27;t have any grit but all four long sides do, and they worked really well for sanding down the ridges on my nails, and the rough edges of finger and toenails after trimming.</li>
            <li> Too soft. Flakes a lot.</li>
            <li> Not very durable, falls apart at every use.  Definitely will not buy these again.  What a mess.  They do work though, they buff.  They came quickly, and there is a lot of them.</li>
            <li> These are perfect!  They don&#x27;t last all that long, so it&#x27;s nice to pull out a fresh one after a while -- the best part is the price - I pull out a new one every ~ 10 to 15 days ( I do my own finger nails and use these on my toe nails too ).</li>
            <li> Guess I didn&#x27;t pay enough attention when buying these. I thought they were real Polar Block nail buffers. They are not. They take way longer than the real ones to file and shape and they leave a ton of dust in their wake. Will not be buying these again and don&#x27;t recommend you buy them either.</li>
            <li> waste of money. You get what you pay for. Soft, not much effective. Mild nail buffer. I threw them away.</li>
            <li> I really love these nail blocks. I have used them for years and really appreciate the chance to buy them \\&quot;in bulk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Truly a great purchase. The low price may fool you but these are the same product sold for foot or hand nail buffing but you get 10 so for me that is practically a lifetime supply. Had to come from China but that occurred relatively quickly. It was well packed too.Can not recommend this seller too highly. By the way, the beauty kiosk in my local mall wanted to sell me ONE of this along with creams and other tchotchkes for THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS! Thats when I came home and bought this.</li>
            <li> Will make nails dull and scuffed  rather than shiny.</li>
            <li> was what I need for my class. Got here super quick. the grit is coarser than I thought but buffs good so no complaints.</li>
            <li> I do nails &amp; am always looking for a deal, these are awesome &amp; don&#x27;t fall apart like I thought they would.</li>
            <li> They are really only designed for one time use. Does the job, just can&#x27;t really be sanitized and used again they start to fall apart</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34;  is just on the surface of the soft foam. It comes off quickly leaving slick foam. My wife used them once and she was not happy. If she ain&#x27;t happy, ain&#x27;t nobody happy. So needless to say , I don&#x27;t like em either.</li>
            <li> Just what I was seeking. Buffer for the nails with the same grit on all four sides. Great buy and shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Would like longer life span.</li>
            <li> awesome....does what its suppose to do</li>
            <li> They took quite a while to get, but well worth the wait. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  Use one buffer for multiple applications.</li>
            <li> They are not as durable as some I have used but for the price and amount of buffers you get, it&#x27;s a great deal. They work great on natural nails for buffing and shaping but will crumble when used to shape false nails. Not a huge deal but a bit disappointing since I use false nails often.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and functional</li>
            <li> Came on time. No issues. Satisfied</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive, but these are great and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Works just like the salon ones!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t hurt like others! I like how soft these are, yet are grainy enough to buff quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought these so I would be able to buff out my acrylics and they did a perfect job! Great product and you get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li> They are firm I hate it when they are soft and tend to start to peel off or crack, and a great deal</li>
