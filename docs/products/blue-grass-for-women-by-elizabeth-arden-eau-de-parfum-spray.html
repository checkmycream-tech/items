            <li>My Mom had her own fragrances</li>

            <li>And it arrived perfectly packaged and a week early!!  </li>
            <li>Those things sound amazing!</li>
            <li>it smelled so clean!!  </li>
            <li>Something has been added to it to make it very strong smelling.  </li>
            <li>It smells like something more suitable for my grandmother.</li>
            <li>Very light perfume.</li>
            <li>and I use it as a back-up when I run out of my favorite Elizabeth Arden.  </li>
            <li>So nice and light.  </li>
            <li>I have tried perfumes that are wonderful sprayed on a tissue, but on my skin it&#x27;s as if I bathed in a totally different fragrance!!!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>Its still the same wonderful smell I remember.</li>
            <li>it was my mother-in-laws favorite.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>you smell.\\&quot; Most unexpected: going through a receiving line of family members at a funeral, two of the family members mentioned that I smelled so good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance for as long as I can remember, because my mother used to wear it, &amp; it&#x27;s nice to know that I can still get it from Amazon!</li>
            <li>This supplier offers this product at a great price.</li>
            <li>Light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery and fair priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to wear it and get so many compliments, even the waitress in the Italian restaurant [which is laden with all sorts of smells!]</li>
            <li>The fragrance is inspired by the beautiful flower fields and blue skies of Grasse, France.</li>
            <li>, it was such a beautiful perfume.  </li>
            <li>I loved Blue Grass as a young woman and was happy to see it available through Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have strangers stop me to ask what I am wearing that smells so fabulous.</li>
            <li>Enjoy  it for what it is.</li>
            <li>I loved this scent as a young girl.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be the right fragrance for me because I still love it</li>
            <li>AND IT DOES NOT SMELL LIKE THE ORIGINAL.  </li>
            <li>, she was a wonderful woman and has since past on.  </li>
            <li>The price was right, I will buy it again!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;A fresh, light floral bouquet with spicy woody undertones.</li>
            <li>I remembered I loved Blue Grass, and, after 27 years without, I ordered a bottle today.</li>
            <li>I would have been thrilled to buy this again and frequently</li>
            <li>Light and fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>Its clean crisp aroma is indispensable.  </li>
            <li>It smells clean and fresh and on me I find it lingers for quite a while, which I like.</li>
            <li>I love it and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I use it to lightly spritz bed linen and bath towels, too, and never fail to get compliments.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the first time I wore it, my beloved mother asked what familiar perfume I was wearing, when I told her it was Blue Grass, she laughed and said that it was what she wore in her late teens and 20&#x27;s, when she met my dad in 1944 (they married in 1947; a true lifetime love story).  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought - Aw, gee!  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this fragrance as a young girl.</li>
            <li>Old fashion fragrance, a favorite of my Mothers.</li>
            <li>When first sprayed it is quite powerful, but then becomes a lingering frangrance and even if you don&#x27;t notice it yourself, other people always comment how pleasant it is.</li>
            <li>It is slightly different than most perfumes and not quite as sweet.</li>
            <li>So my motivation to come back again has many meanings to me, but the scent itself is just pure heavenly!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the best scent I&#x27;ve found for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Which is really what you want from a scent, like the taste of a good wine!!!!&lt;br /&gt;P. S. I&#x27;ve used it for so long, my daughter calls it &amp;#34;Mommy Smell&amp;#34; - I really like that!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;9/3/2017</li>
            <li>It is feminine, floral but tailored like a crisp cotton shirtwaist.</li>
            <li>I love this Parfum and am now a bit of a hero as we couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Like it as much as I did 50 years ago!</li>
            <li>This smell brings back many memories.</li>
            <li>, I got my package today, promptly opened it and sprayed it on my wrists, without so much as a first whiff.</li>
            <li>Blue Grass is a strong fragrance as you put it on at first, but then dissipates.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad per se, but just not the kind of scent for me…for another 40 years at least.</li>
            <li>REALLY pungent.</li>
            <li>When you least expect it, someone will comment on \\&quot;how good</li>
            <li>It is not too sweet, not too powerful, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>IT IS FRAGRANT BUT NOT LIKE THE ORIGINAL BLUE GRASS.</li>
            <li>I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT (5 BOTTLES), WITHOUT ORIGINALLY KNOWING THAT THIS PARTICULAR PERFUME BLUE GRASS HAS BEEN OUT OF THE MARKETPLACE SINCE 2004.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes the new scent.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>IF YOU PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT, YOU ARE BUYING PERFUME THAT IS OLD</li>
            <li>This was old.  </li>
            <li>we used to wear this in the early 70&#x27;s and it was popular.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>Wife bought on Amazon and one of her old favorites.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Buying directly from Elizabeth Arden would have been about $10.00 more for less than half the amount.</li>
            <li>But after I showered and sprayed it on, it was a completely different scent and much, much closer to what I recall from my teen years.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find but still available in some places.</li>
            <li>I was 27, not an old lady back then, but I didn&#x27;t care WHO wore it:  </li>
            <li>This is NOT the Blue Grass of old.  </li>
            <li>I had great hopes but was disappointed.</li>

            <li> This is NOT the Blue Grass of old.  </li>
            <li> I had great hopes but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> They had a bottle of this at the Vermont Country Store, I whiffed it, hated the top notes, had a laugh with a friend about my girlhood in Bluegrass, and then as the day wore on and the middle notes revealed themselves: chypre, sunlight,</li>
            <li> As with previous reviews published, this Blue Grass does not have the same scent as the one I remember</li>
            <li> I always keep a bottle of Blue Grass - no matter what other fragrances I get from time to time.  </li>
            <li> (my other is \\&quot;Red Door\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> When I asked what she was wearing,  she giggled and said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s usually worn by old ladies</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s calmed down after about an hour, but the smell is just.</li>
            <li> And slightly powdery.</li>
            <li> I dont see it in the stores I usually go to.</li>
            <li> I was quick to apply the fragrance and quickly disgusted by the odor it had.  </li>
            <li> What does that even mean?!</li>
            <li> Weirdly.</li>
            <li> And what a disappointment it was when my shipment arrived.  </li>
            <li> It is a very difficult scent to describe... floral and powdery, with a woody/spicy undertone.</li>
            <li> is very unfortunate.  </li>
            <li> My bad.  </li>
            <li> order arrived today and I am hugely disappointed in the product.  </li>
            <li> I wore this perfume quite a bit in the Eighties and was disappointed when it disappeared from the perfume counters.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It had a terrible odor and was not wearable.  </li>
            <li> It is horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A friend introduced me to Blue Grass over 20 years ago and I use it as a back-up when I run out of my favorite Elizabeth Arden.  It is not too sweet, not too powerful, and it lasts a long time. I recommend it for picky ladies like me.</li>
            <li> I bought this in memory of my godmother who wore Blue Grass. It is feminine, floral but tailored like a crisp cotton shirtwaist.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT (5 BOTTLES), WITHOUT ORIGINALLY KNOWING THAT THIS PARTICULAR PERFUME BLUE GRASS HAS BEEN OUT OF THE MARKETPLACE SINCE 2004.  I FOUND OUT THROUGH MY FRIEND WHO DISTRIBUTED THE LINE THAT THEY STOPPED MAKING THE FRAGRANCE ALL TOGETHER SINCE 2004.  IF YOU PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT, YOU ARE BUYING PERFUME THAT IS OLD AND IT DOES NOT SMELL LIKE THE ORIGINAL.  IT IS FRAGRANT BUT NOT LIKE THE ORIGINAL BLUE GRASS.</li>
            <li> This price was the best available. Buying directly from Elizabeth Arden would have been about $10.00 more for less than half the amount.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for years in the warmer weather.  So nice and light.  I love it and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this scent since 1965, the year I emigrated to this country and have never found anything that worked as well for me! When first sprayed it is quite powerful, but then becomes a lingering frangrance and even if you don&#x27;t notice it yourself, other people always comment how pleasant it is. Which is really what you want from a scent, like the taste of a good wine!!!!&lt;br /&gt;P. S. I&#x27;ve used it for so long, my daughter calls it &amp;#34;Mommy Smell&amp;#34; - I really like that!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;9/3/2017&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read the reviews about being changed, I disagree!! Blue Grass is a strong fragrance as you put it on at first, but then dissipates. You have to remember perfumes react to your chemistry, your body! I have tried perfumes that are wonderful sprayed on a tissue, but on my skin it&#x27;s as if I bathed in a totally different fragrance!!! I know it&#x27;s the same, have used it for 52 years now!</li>
            <li> This was old.  It had a terrible odor and was not wearable.  I was very disappointed.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s signature eau de parfum is a premium product. This supplier offers this product at a great price. Plus the service is terrific.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this fragrance as a young girl. I had my mother ask the woman who wore it what it was so that she could buy it and wear it, too. My Mom had her own fragrances so she let it pass but I always remembered the name...fast forward a few decades and I continue to purchase and wear Blue Grass. It seems to be the right fragrance for me because I still love it and I get many compliments-year after year! When you least expect it, someone will comment on \\&quot;how good you smell.\\&quot; Most unexpected: going through a receiving line of family members at a funeral, two of the family members mentioned that I smelled so good! I purchased a bottle and sent it to the woman...but not the man who also commented!  Please, NEVER stop making this fresh, delightful fragrance! I love it.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected. I bought it &#x27;cause we used to wear this in the early 70&#x27;s and it was popular.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I loved Blue Grass as a young woman and was happy to see it available through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived today and I am hugely disappointed in the product.  I was quick to apply the fragrance and quickly disgusted by the odor it had.  Nothing like the fragrance I remembered.  Nothing I would ever elect to wear....ever.  In addition, I now realize I cannot return this bottle of offensive odor for a refund.  My bad.  I did not read the \\&quot;not returnable, not refundable\\&quot; warning when I ordered.  So, I now will be tossing $16.34 into the trash.  A lesson for me to pay closer attention in hte future.</li>
            <li> Wife bought on Amazon and one of her old favorites.  Great price and service Amazon!</li>
            <li> Smells great. I never had this before but just read the reviews and decided to go for it. It smells clean and fresh and on me I find it lingers for quite a while, which I like.</li>
            <li> My Wife has always been a fan and user of Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s  \\&quot;Blue Grass\\&quot;.  Once again Amazon has come through for me.  I love this Parfum and am now a bit of a hero as we couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  Thank you amazon.com</li>
            <li> I always keep a bottle of Blue Grass - no matter what other fragrances I get from time to time.  Its clean crisp aroma is indispensable.  I use it to lightly spritz bed linen and bath towels, too, and never fail to get compliments.  It&#x27;s simply the best scent I&#x27;ve found for everyday use. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the official information for Blue Grass as described by the Arden site... \\&quot;A fresh, light floral bouquet with spicy woody undertones. The fragrance is inspired by the beautiful flower fields and blue skies of Grasse, France. Opening a bottle of Blue Grass is like an instant trip to the countryside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key Notes&lt;br /&gt;Top Notes: Rose, Jasmine, Lily, Lavender, Geranium, Orange Blossom&lt;br /&gt;Middle Notes: Vetiver, Clove, Laurel&lt;br /&gt;Base Notes: Virginia Cedar, Sandalwood, Musk\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I have to add is that this is one of my two signature scents! (my other is \\&quot;Red Door\\&quot;) I have strangers stop me to ask what I am wearing that smells so fabulous. It is a very difficult scent to describe... floral and powdery, with a woody/spicy undertone. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the scent of my callow youth; me presiding over guinea pig funerals, or wriggling my toes by the wood stove, neck to toe a blue jean genie. They had a bottle of this at the Vermont Country Store, I whiffed it, hated the top notes, had a laugh with a friend about my girlhood in Bluegrass, and then as the day wore on and the middle notes revealed themselves: chypre, sunlight, afternoon, Rte 7 south thru Pownall to Williamstown...I remembered I loved Blue Grass, and, after 27 years without, I ordered a bottle today.</li>
            <li> I wore this perfume quite a bit in the Eighties and was disappointed when it disappeared from the perfume counters.  What a wonderful surprise it was to find it here!  And what a disappointment it was when my shipment arrived.  This is NOT the same perfume I used to wear.&lt;br /&gt;This has been changed - emboldened one might say.  It is horrible.  Something has been added to it to make it very strong smelling.  I&#x27;s not just the staying power of the fragrance - the fragrance itself has changed and for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;This is very unfortunate.  I would have been thrilled to buy this again and frequently, it was such a beautiful perfume.  Sigh.</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance of days gone by that bring happy memories of care-free times. Light and refreshing.Enjoy  it for what it is.</li>
            <li> Blue Grass Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3 Ounces Exactly as advertised. My favorite scent.  Fast Delivery and fair priced.Thank you</li>
            <li> Like it as much as I did 50 years ago!</li>
            <li> Old fashion fragrance, a favorite of my Mothers. Light and fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> reminds me of my mother</li>
            <li> I had this perfume when I was in my 20&#x27;s I am now 53. I didnt know they still made it cause I dont see it in the stores I usually go to. Its still the same wonderful smell I remember. Takes me back....</li>
            <li> Fragrance from my youth...love being reacquainted!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this perfume it was my mother-in-laws favorite.  I use to wear it years ago and didn&#x27;t know they were still making it.  When I saw it I had to get it to remind me of my mother-in-law, she was a wonderful woman and has since past on.  This smell brings back many memories.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance with staying power.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought - Aw, gee!  this is not it!  But after I showered and sprayed it on, it was a completely different scent and much, much closer to what I recall from my teen years.  I loved this scent as a young girl.  It&#x27;s great to wear it and get so many compliments, even the waitress in the Italian restaurant [which is laden with all sorts of smells!] remarked that it was simply beautiful.  The price was right, I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> So, I ordered this perfume even though I&#x27;d read the reviews about it smelling like a grandma. What does that even mean?! I&#x27;m no ageist, so I thought grass and powder? Those things sound amazing! This will be awesome for summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I got my package today, promptly opened it and sprayed it on my wrists, without so much as a first whiff. As the aroma hit my nose, I thought “Ohhhhhhhhh. *That&#x27;s* what a grandma smells like.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it is somewhat grassy I suppose. And slightly powdery. But there&#x27;s also a pungent smell that I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on. REALLY pungent. It&#x27;s calmed down after about an hour, but the smell is just. So. Weirdly. Grandma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story: when a bunch of people say it smells like their grandma, they&#x27;re not lying. It&#x27;s not bad per se, but just not the kind of scent for me…for another 40 years at least.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the scent of this perfume. It smells like something more suitable for my grandmother. Not for someone in their 20s &amp; 30s at all.</li>
            <li> Word from my wife \\&quot;I used to wear this perfume as a teenager and bought it to wear something different. I am glad I did. It is slightly different than most perfumes and not quite as sweet. My husband likes the new scent.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Well-packaged item which arrived promptly as promoted.  As with previous reviews published, this Blue Grass does not have the same scent as the one I remember and I do not care for it.  I had great hopes but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> A coworker had this fragrance on at work one day about 30 years ago.  When I asked what she was wearing,  she giggled and said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s usually worn by old ladies but I love it.  It&#x27;s called Blue Grass&amp;#34;.  I was 27, not an old lady back then, but I didn&#x27;t care WHO wore it:  it smelled so clean!!  I bought it, and even though I&#x27;ve vascillated between newer scents from time to time, I always come back to this.  In fact, the first time I wore it, my beloved mother asked what familiar perfume I was wearing, when I told her it was Blue Grass, she laughed and said that it was what she wore in her late teens and 20&#x27;s, when she met my dad in 1944 (they married in 1947; a true lifetime love story).  So my motivation to come back again has many meanings to me, but the scent itself is just pure heavenly!!  And it arrived perfectly packaged and a week early!!  THANK YOU AMAZON!!</li>
            <li> Very light perfume. It is hard to find but still available in some places.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance for as long as I can remember, because my mother used to wear it, &amp; it&#x27;s nice to know that I can still get it from Amazon!</li>
            <li> If I could give zero stars I would.  This is NOT the Blue Grass of old.  Do not waste your money.</li>
