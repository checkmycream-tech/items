            <li>Was thrilled I found it online...</li>
            <li>I was happy to receive these so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly and works great.</li>
            <li>efficient, smells really good &amp; feels clean, not cakey.     </li>
            <li>My husband went right to Amazon and we were able to order the product for my Mom, who was SO happy.</li>
            <li>This purchase went very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Please be sure the ad states specifically what you are looking for before you purchase it.</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite deodorant and she uses it sparingly in case she ever runs out.</li>
            <li>It was much more expendsive than i was used to spending..</li>
            <li>Great service, fast and dependable.    </li>
            <li>Reliable product I have used for many years, as did my grandmother before me.</li>
            <li>I have tried many deodorants and none of the work.</li>
            <li>(Many brands block moisture but not the odor.)  </li>
            <li>Powder Fresh scent is just as good.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Use to be able to buy in the drug store but glad I can still get it.  </li>
            <li>I came upon this product because it had a nice spice smell and it was cheap....</li>
            <li>I love the all day protection it provides but the baby poweder scent has it beat.</li>
            <li>This is still the best deoderant going - and I was thrilled to be able to purchase it - I have turned other gals onto it and they all love it -</li>
            <li>It works better than all the others, doesn&#x27;t have a strong offending perfume smell.</li>
            <li>It is a great product that works well and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>A favorite, not always available In stores.</li>
            <li>I have looked and looked in retail stores with no luck and was just  really delighted to find my old favorite, love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It may be silly to be this happy over finding a deodorant, but I am thrilled to the maximum!!  </li>
            <li>but if you only need a deodorant the cream version in the jar is a great option as well.</li>
            <li>but it had the same great smell.  </li>
            <li>I have always used it as an adult and found it to be superior to anything on the market today.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>Our local stores have stopped carrying this old-fashioned but effective (and inexpensive) product.  !</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find Tussy&#x27;s deoderant on your website.  </li>
            <li>and I remembered Tussy from long ago and was happy to see it and buy it again.</li>
            <li>It has a clean smell when applied</li>
            <li>Now my adult children are able to use it too!</li>
            <li>I have many allergies to most deoderants and this is the only one that I don&#x27;t react to.  </li>
            <li>New is not always better.  </li>
            <li>Smells fresh and spicy--not medicinal.</li>
            <li>got for a friend who wanted this product and could not find it in any stores so it was worth the price</li>
            <li>I used it as a teenager and young adult and loved it.  </li>
            <li>but it is well worth it not to have to worry all day.  </li>
            <li>Rolls on smooth as silk and scent is like a mild old spice smell.</li>
            <li>An old time favorite that has not gone through the constant marketing gimmicks  and product changes, this and that  making them soooo much better.  </li>
            <li>Once I get a response from them, I can give an updated review [more than likely a higher star rating]!  </li>
            <li>I can count it on to keep me all day long, and I love the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I sure hope they put it back in production</li>
            <li>This was the first deodorant my mom bought for me</li>
            <li>I have pretty much tried every deodorant on the market and nothing keeps me as fresh as Tussy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant that I am able to use.</li>
            <li>Super Product with mild ingredients and a low price.  </li>
            <li>love the smell of Tussy and it keeps me dry.  </li>
            <li>I really dont sweat under my arms</li>
            <li>- I really do swear by it.</li>
            <li>Since they no longer carry this in stores, I was much relieved to discover it here.  </li>
            <li>My order was filled with only 1 bottle.</li>
            <li>and it got here really really fast.</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite deodorant and getting harder to find around home.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>To much money for one bottle.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy Tussy for him until he decides he wants something else.</li>
            <li>like I normally do when I&#x27;m wearing this!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s obviously something unique about it, I don&#x27;t know what.</li>
            <li>Scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t interfere with other fragrances that you might wear.</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and odor free.  </li>
            <li>about $1.50 a bottle but better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>This is a classic.</li>
            <li>Shipping charges attached to the purchase of this product were so high, around 70th of Tussy purchase price, that I will not order it again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  this product.</li>
            <li>Only thing that works for me to keep me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>If Tussy stopped making the baby powder scent, I&#x27;d be right back to spice.</li>
            <li>Produced in New Jersey.</li>
            <li>I was running out of my last 5 bottle purchase, tried other products, but nothing works better than Tussy.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay, at least I can still get it and buy it by the dozen.</li>
            <li>Tussy is the only one that I have found that really works for me.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve had a tough time finding a deodorant that works for you give Tussy&#x27;s Original Fresh Spice a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten tired of most of the new products.  </li>
            <li>I normally find it locally but the stores that used to carry it stopped.</li>
            <li>No longer available in my local stores, forced me to try all the others.</li>
            <li>I use to use it when I was a young woman and that was a long time ago.  </li>
            <li>No long wait for product to arrive.</li>

            <li> No long wait for product to arrive.</li>
            <li> especially if you have reactions to other anti-persperants.</li>
            <li> The brand changed hands a couple years ago and production was disrupted so during that time I tried a couple dozen other deodorants and Dry Idea roll-on was the only one that even came close to Tussy&#x27;s effectiveness.     </li>
            <li> A lot of antiperspirants do not keep me dry as promised.  </li>
            <li> and they last a long long time!!!!!</li>
            <li> Because of allergies this is the only thing I can use and it is hard to find locally</li>
            <li> The merchandise was received promptly and as expected.</li>
            <li> My husband gets a rash with any other deodorant.</li>
            <li> I began using other products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty sad</li>
            <li> Other products were advertised in this way.  </li>
            <li> Due to my wife&#x27;s allergies to the anti-perspirant ingredients we were stuck with this and could not use.  </li>
            <li> They also make the same product in a cream, which looked a little messy</li>
            <li> I also find I use less than other brands.</li>
            <li> the price was less than what i use to pay</li>
            <li> but i order a few on line</li>
            <li> I usually order it in bulk.</li>
            <li> so I looked to Amazon as usual.</li>
            <li> for some reason this brand is getting hard to find in the stores so ordered it from here when i was desparate.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the store but can no order online.  </li>
            <li> A hard to find deodorant that I have used since the Seventies.</li>
            <li> ...at least for me.  </li>
            <li> Like the stick, the roll-on is also none irritating and works!</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with what we consider to have been poor or false advertising.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with my stick deodorant</li>

            <li> This is the only deodorant my Mom can use without getting a rash. She told me that she couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere and after I searched nearby stores, I was told it was discontinued. My husband went right to Amazon and we were able to order the product for my Mom, who was SO happy.</li>
            <li> I have looked and looked in retail stores with no luck and was just  really delighted to find my old favorite, love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Over 40 years ago, I remember my parents using Tussy. I have always used it as an adult and found it to be superior to anything on the market today. Now my adult children are able to use it too! I received it quickly (in time for stocking stuffers) and was very happy to find it with ease on Amazon.</li>
            <li> i am very happy to find a site where i may purchase this product,,,thanks</li>
            <li> I really dont sweat under my arms like I normally do when I&#x27;m wearing this!  I&#x27;ve tried lots of deodorants &amp; this was the best... efficient, smells really good &amp; feels clean, not cakey.     the local Family Dollar sells this.</li>
            <li> I was happy to receive these so quickly.  Our local stores have stopped carrying this old-fashioned but effective (and inexpensive) product.  !</li>
            <li> This is still the best deoderant going - and I was thrilled to be able to purchase it - I have turned other gals onto it and they all love it - I sure hope they put it back in production - I really do swear by it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find Tussy&#x27;s deoderant on your website.  I have many allergies to most deoderants and this is the only one that I don&#x27;t react to.  Since they no longer carry this in stores, I was much relieved to discover it here.  It is a great product that works well and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This was the first deodorant my mom bought for me and I&#x27;ve used it ever since. Smells fresh and spicy--not medicinal. I love it and hope it stays around another 40 years!</li>
            <li> Shipping charges attached to the purchase of this product were so high, around 70th of Tussy purchase price, that I will not order it again.</li>
            <li> Love it. Keeps me dry and odor free.  Plus packaged properly with tamper proof seal.</li>
            <li> My husband gets a rash with any other deodorant. This is the best place to place a bulk order.  However, the ad said 1 for $33.  I was expecting a case. My order was filled with only 1 bottle. I immediately contacted the distributer and told them what happened.  They then distributed another 18 bottles.  Please be sure the ad states specifically what you are looking for before you purchase it.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite deodorant and she uses it sparingly in case she ever runs out. Whenever we can find it online, we always get a bunch.</li>
            <li> I must admit I&#x27;ve come back to this product for the smell.  I like the scent of carnations.  I use to use it when I was a young woman and that was a long time ago.  I&#x27;ve gotten tired of most of the new products.  This one works for me.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for it for months in South Carolina and was told it was not going to be sold here anymore so i was so greatfull to find it on line. the price was less than what i use to pay and it got here really really fast. thank you very much. I am very satisfied with everything.</li>
            <li> got for a friend who wanted this product and could not find it in any stores so it was worth the price</li>
            <li> The product is one that I have used for awhile, however I e-mailed the company that sent me the Tussy, regarding the price [I think that they may have overcharged me for the six 1.7 oz containers] up to this date they have not responded !!!. Once I get a response from them, I can give an updated review [more than likely a higher star rating]!  Manuel Garcia Jr.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had a tough time finding a deodorant that works for you give Tussy&#x27;s Original Fresh Spice a try. There&#x27;s obviously something unique about it, I don&#x27;t know what. The brand changed hands a couple years ago and production was disrupted so during that time I tried a couple dozen other deodorants and Dry Idea roll-on was the only one that even came close to Tussy&#x27;s effectiveness.     Note that if you want an antiperspirant as well as a deodorant you&#x27;ll need to get the Tussy roll-on but if you only need a deodorant the cream version in the jar is a great option as well.</li>
            <li> This purchase went very smoothly.  What was being purchased was well-explained.  The merchandise was received promptly and as expected.</li>
            <li> for some reason this brand is getting hard to find in the stores so ordered it from here when i was desparate. It was much more expendsive than i was used to spending.. later i found the same product at Walmart for 99 cent.. check walmart.  Good product especially if you have reactions to other anti-persperants.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite deodorant and getting harder to find around home.  Good to be able to purchase online.  Great service, fast and dependable.    Coach</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this deodorant forever.  I used it as a teenager and young adult and loved it.  At that time however, I was buying the creme and it would get on my clothing when I dressed after putting the product on, so I began using other products.  Just recently the deodorant I have been using for years has caused my skin to itch.  I began my search in earnest once again for Tussy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of Tussy and it keeps me dry.  It is not an over powering smell and I could use perfume if I wanted to with no conflict with Tussy.  A lot of antiperspirants do not keep me dry as promised.  Tussy does.  And I was very happy to see that it now comes in roll-on which I purchased.  I am thrilled at finding this product and will continue to purchase it.  It may be silly to be this happy over finding a deodorant, but I am thrilled to the maximum!!  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant &amp;  Deodorant are the best.  It&#x27;s pretty sad I have to now buy it online as I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in the store anymore.  That&#x27;s okay, at least I can still get it and buy it by the dozen.</li>
            <li> Reliable product I have used for many years, as did my grandmother before me.</li>
            <li> I have tried many deodorants and none of the work. Tussy is the only one that I have found that really works for me. Thank you Tussy!!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything and deodorant and/or antiperspirant just does not work on me.  I don&#x27;t sweat a lot - but all brands and types just don&#x27;t seem to do thier job. (Many brands block moisture but not the odor.)  One day I tried Tussy and it worked GREAT!!!  I don&#x27;t like roll on but it is well worth it not to have to worry all day.  I highly recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> This product was advertised as a deodorant, but it is an anti-perspirant/deodorant.  Other products were advertised in this way.  Due to my wife&#x27;s allergies to the anti-perspirant ingredients we were stuck with this and could not use.  The cost of shipping that would have been subtracted and the cost to mail them back exceeded the cost of the three roll-ons we ordered. Very unhappy with what we consider to have been poor or false advertising.</li>
            <li> To much money for one bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for over 50 years......and am happy  that I was able to get it again</li>
            <li> I have used Tussy antiperspirant for over 50 years. I normally find it locally but the stores that used to carry it stopped. So I was very glad to locate it on line. It is the best antiperspirant on the market. It has a clean smell when applied but there is no smell at all when it dries.</li>
            <li> A favorite, not always available In stores.</li>
            <li> ...at least for me.  I have pretty much tried every deodorant on the market and nothing keeps me as fresh as Tussy.  This deodorant was used by my grandparents.  New is not always better.  Hard to find in the store but can no order online.  I usually order it in bulk.</li>
            <li> Thrilled to have access to Tussy Roll-On Deodorant again.  I was running out of my last 5 bottle purchase, tried other products, but nothing works better than Tussy.  An effective and non-irritating deodorant.</li>
            <li> Because of allergies this is the only thing I can use and it is hard to find locally so I was happy to see it available here.</li>
            <li> This is the absoulte best deodorant I have used. I can count it on to keep me all day long, and I love the quick shipping. No long wait for product to arrive.</li>
            <li> Like the stick, the roll-on is also none irritating and works! Scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t interfere with other fragrances that you might wear.</li>
            <li> An old time favorite that has not gone through the constant marketing gimmicks  and product changes, this and that  making them soooo much better.  Ha! Tussy is what it is. It works better than all the others, doesn&#x27;t have a strong offending perfume smell. It is the best antiperspirant I have ever used.I also find I use less than other brands. No longer available in my local stores, forced me to try all the others.None worked as well as Tussy. The price is also great!  Thankfully I can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Cost effective and it shipped faster than I thought.</li>
            <li> My dad will forever use this product! I will continue to buy Tussy for him until he decides he wants something else. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using tussy for 30 years. My mom used it and I always loved the spicy scent.. My husband used it 20 + yrs till his daughter told him it was a womans deodorant... lol I would recommend to to all men because of the scent and it is the best... Wish they still sold it in the drug stores but i order a few on line and they last a long long time!!!!!</li>
            <li> Paid $1.89 for this in my local Piggly Wiggly store.  Produced in New Jersey. Rolls on smooth as silk and scent is like a mild old spice smell. Dries quickly and works great. I was unhappy with my stick deodorant and I remembered Tussy from long ago and was happy to see it and buy it again. They also make the same product in a cream, which looked a little messy but it had the same great smell.  Super Product with mild ingredients and a low price.  Powder Fresh scent is just as good.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product smells! Fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> Love this. Couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores so I looked to Amazon as usual. I put it on in the morning and don&#x27;t have to worry about it the rest of the day. No sweating, no smell, no re-apps.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I can use and cannot find in the stores.  I would recommnd it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> A staple in the closet and can only get online now.  Use to be able to buy in the drug store but glad I can still get it.  Only thing that works for me to keep me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> A hard to find deodorant that I have used since the Seventies. I really dislike having to write x number of words because sometimes only a few suffice.</li>
            <li> I came upon this product because it had a nice spice smell and it was cheap....$1 a bottle.  Several dollar stores carried it and now they have all discontinued.  Was thrilled I found it online...about $1.50 a bottle but better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I love the all day protection it provides but the baby poweder scent has it beat. This is a classic. If Tussy stopped making the baby powder scent, I&#x27;d be right back to spice. Best deodorant Ive ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that I am able to use. Every thing else causes me to break out or just constantly itch. Tussy is mild and is an excellent product.</li>
