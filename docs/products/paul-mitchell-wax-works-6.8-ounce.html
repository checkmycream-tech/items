            <li>I love this stuff,  </li>

            <li>My favorite hair product for sure</li>
            <li>, I am sure you will love it too.</li>
            <li>stuff gets most jobs done: from short spike hair to mohawks.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what is says it does on the label.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll look like it did after the first application.</li>
            <li>Wax works, with the right techniques, can hold for hours - and whenever it does lose its hold you can always pat your hair down and add some more wax; should hold you over a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I would definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The old stuff lasted all day.  </li>
            <li>I liked it this way because all other gels (cheap and expensive) flake up or wear off within hours.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff but its hard to find locally anymore.  </li>
            <li>New stuff doesn&#x27;t have same hold or texture.  </li>
            <li>You can have a messy or gelled up look, depending on how much you use and how much you touch it after drying.</li>
            <li>and you may actually be able to save a few bucks if you buy this product from a local salon or store, but it can be hard to find sometimes.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a male in my 20&#x27;s and I have used and tried a lot of different products on my hair. Most gels have a shiny look and do not provide flexibility.  A lot of dry wax products  are hard to wash out and greasy. Wax Works gives me the best of both worlds.  I know it&#x27;s a little pricy and you may actually be able to save a few bucks if you buy this product from a local salon or store, but it can be hard to find sometimes. I would definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Gel tends to cause flakes and irritate the scalp; not Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Wax Works. Most gels don&#x27;t even have the holding strength to last longer than a hour; especially in warmer weather. Wax works, with the right techniques, can hold for hours - and whenever it does lose its hold you can always pat your hair down and add some more wax; should hold you over a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff gets most jobs done: from short spike hair to mohawks. It helps if you have a blow dryer at times to help sculpt some of the more complicated styles out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only downfall for Wax Works is that it can be hard to find - and it&#x27;s kinda pricey.. but the quality of this stuff totally justifies it&#x27;s price tag.</li>
            <li> It is a very good and reliable products for fixing hair in a quick way.  We used this product for years, and love it.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my wife. She loves this stuff, and it is getting hard to find. I will buy it again, as she has not found anything to replace it yet.</li>
            <li> Great styling product that helps with hair style and gives a great shine to hair.</li>
            <li> Just what I need for my type of hairdo.  It adds the body I need to make it do what I want it to.</li>
            <li> something has changed with this product.  I have used for 5+ years but last year of use it doesn&#x27;t have same hold or texture.&lt;br /&gt;it used to be very waxy and almost  Vaseline type in texture.  I liked it this way because all other gels (cheap and expensive) flake up or wear off within hours.  The old stuff lasted all day.  New stuff doesn&#x27;t have same hold or texture.  I have to use nearly double the product to get same hold and texture.  Still better than all other gels I have tried, but disappointed that it is noticeably different</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t make it in a smaller size any more.  But works well in hold my hair.</li>
            <li> Just what we were looking for! Thank you</li>
            <li> The wax works is a great product. Does exactly what is says it does on the label.  Easy to use for great hair styling.</li>
            <li> Love it !!!  all pros no cons</li>
            <li> I love this stuff,  it makes my hair look Fuller and Sexy !</li>
            <li> This product is cool for holding coarse hair down.&lt;br /&gt;Price on this from amazon is high. I cam get a better price from a retail outlet.&lt;br /&gt;In addition the tube was split when received.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a couple of years. You can have a messy or gelled up look, depending on how much you use and how much you touch it after drying. Then just wet it again and it&#x27;ll look like it did after the first application.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but its hard to find locally anymore.  My favorite hair product for sure, I am sure you will love it too.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating of 5 stars because this product is exceptional for spiked hair. I recently changed my hair style and it is spiked with bangs. I just love Paul Mitchell Wax Works Extreme Texture. It does the job of keeping my hair in place when I use it. This is an excellent product and certainly deserves 5 stars.</li>
