            <li>Like the Seller, it is a Winner!  :-)</li>
            <li>I despaired of bering able to buy it in the US.</li>
            <li>I grew up on Colgate Powder and I still love the feel of brushing with this powder.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought it would be better then a tube of tooth paste with TSA.  </li>
            <li>We used this product in our house when I was a child (many, many years ago :).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Keep this product available!  </li>
            <li>I lik this better than paste.</li>

            <li>Great to find this old product.</li>
            <li>Glad I found the Colgate product available again on-line.</li>
            <li>Easy for travel.</li>
            <li>While being too abrasive to use exclusively, when sprinkled occasionally onto a toothpaste treated brush, this tooth powder does a great job of removing coffee and tea stains .  </li>
            <li>OKAY - was funny gift for my Dentist</li>
            <li>Great for polishing glass surfaces and getting rid of minor scratches.</li>
            <li>I like it, makes my mouth feel clean and has a pleasant flavor, pretty natural.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth and gums feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Smaller than I remember but great shipping package and thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Really makes your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I always used</li>
            <li>No big deal, there are flouride rinses, but it would be more convenient.</li>
            <li>That speaks highly of them and is also very much appreciated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel it leaves the teeth so much cleaner than toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>High quality!</li>
            <li>It also freshens the breath better than any other teeth-cleaning  </li>
            <li>(Thanks for bringing it back home Amazon) , but no matter, I&#x27;m back to using my favorite tooth cleanser..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember when any other toothpaste made my teeth feel just after the dentist clean!</li>
            <li>It was very old item that was smelling and it arrived after lot of delay.</li>
            <li>Wish there were a powder with flouride, but so far, have not found one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised, too.</li>
            <li>Since it came from India, I am not too surprised it does not taste like the Colgate tooth powder I used several years ago.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry my mouth out the way some products will.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> One side of the metal can was crimped, and quite a bit of tooth powder escaped.</li>
            <li> My mother always used Colgate powder.  I found it again and like it.</li>
            <li> OKAY - was funny gift for my Dentist</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this products was coming from another country. I just threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I purchased it as it was not suppose to have products to whitening the teeth..  However, it must have or some ingredients that cause burning on my tongue or in my mouth.  I had to throw it away as it was not useable. I need a tooth powder or tooth paste that does not burn ones mouth.</li>
            <li> Looked everywhere and could only find it at Amazon. Great for polishing glass surfaces and getting rid of minor scratches. Totally satisfied with my experience.</li>
            <li> I was elated to find this product on Amazon.com.  I give my highest compliments and appreciation to the Seller.  It arrived 75% earlier than expected!  I must acknowledge the extra steps the Seller took to package this item to prevent damage.  That speaks highly of them and is also very much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this is a product that is no longer sold in the U.S.A. (?)  I remember seeing it in my household when I was a child.  I was moved by the glowing reviews here.  I was happy to find it and place my order.  This product is excellent.  It leaves my teeth and gums feeling clean and fresh.  It does not dry my mouth out the way some products will.  Perhaps it is just me, but my teeth sparkle after using this product.  Also, the taste is pleasant and rinses clean.  I will be re-ordering this item.  Like the Seller, it is a Winner!  :-)</li>
            <li> It was very old item that was smelling and it arrived after lot of delay. I would not recommend anyone else to purchase.</li>
            <li> Great to find this old product. Really makes your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> I did not care for the taste of this product.  Since it came from India, I am not too surprised it does not taste like the Colgate tooth powder I used several years ago.  This is no reflection on the service or the sellers - just personal preference.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom. She loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I always used and I didn&#x27;t have to order it from India!  I despaired of bering able to buy it in the US.</li>
            <li> Finally!  I haven&#x27;t seen this in years. I grew up on Colgate Powder and I still love the feel of brushing with this powder.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why it is only sold in India (Thanks for bringing it back home Amazon) , but no matter, I&#x27;m back to using my favorite tooth cleanser..</li>
            <li> Seemed as if delivery was slow, size of toothpowder was much smaller than expected--probably won&#x27;t order this particular brand again. Also, expensive.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s all good polish almost as good as the dentist</li>
            <li> I used this product as a child and was delighted to discover it on Amazon. After you brush your teeth with Colgate Tooth Powder you will be rewarded with slick-feeling, gleaming teeth that look like you just left your dentist&#x27;s office. It also freshens the breath better than any other teeth-cleaning  product  I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Moma&#x27;s happy she has the toothpowder she wanted, and was very easy to order in bulk.  I know where to go next time.</li>
            <li> While being too abrasive to use exclusively, when sprinkled occasionally onto a toothpaste treated brush, this tooth powder does a great job of removing coffee and tea stains .  It&#x27;s impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Nostalgic! I used tooth-powder in late 70s and this dates me back to those era! Easy for travel. Package arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to all of the traveling I do.  I thought it would be better then a tube of tooth paste with TSA.  Boy was I wrong.  TSA couldn&#x27;t figure out what the image was, pulled my bag and removed everything out of it.  It also doesn&#x27;t help when they flip it over there is Aribic writting on the back.  It caused about a 20 min delay.  I have since donated it to the trash can.....</li>
            <li> We used this product in our house when I was a child (many, many years ago :).  I feel it leaves the teeth so much cleaner than toothpaste.  Have tried another tooth powder when I couldn&#x27;t find Colgate and didn&#x27;t like the taste.  Glad I found the Colgate product available again on-line.</li>
            <li> I like it, makes my mouth feel clean and has a pleasant flavor, pretty natural.  Very Pleased, will order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Does the job if you want to switch from paste, which we did.  Wish there were a powder with flouride, but so far, have not found one.  No big deal, there are flouride rinses, but it would be more convenient. Have searched for the product I grew up using, but it is nowhere to be found.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I had found a Colgate Tooth Powder made in U.S.A. Unfortunately it&#x27;s made in India by Colgate.  The Ingredients and directions for use are too small and I can&#x27;t read them.  It gives us weight in Metric - any items sold in U.S.A. should be sold in Net Weight ounces. Since it&#x27;s made by Colgate in India, I may use it - but my Dentist recommended against it.  I am going back to Amazon to see if I can find a tooth powder Made in U.S..A.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I remember but great shipping package and thank you so much.</li>
            <li> TOOTH POWDER IS TOOTH POWDER ..SHIPPING AND CONTAINER ARE UNSATISFACTORY...</li>
            <li> High quality! excellent</li>
            <li> Meh.  I prefer Ora MD, believe it or not.  I&#x27;m surprised, too.</li>
            <li> Keep this product available!  My dad used to mix a little baking soda and salt to this powder.  He had great teeth and healthy gums.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I can&#x27;t remember when any other toothpaste made my teeth feel just after the dentist clean!</li>
            <li> Cap doesn&#x27;t open properly.  Colgate brand, but made in India; deceptive.  I threw it out.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!! All is fine!</li>
            <li> Very good product as advertised.</li>
            <li> I lik this better than paste. Seems to work better.</li>
