            <li>PERFECT!</li>
            <li>GREAT QUALITY!</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I like to have one at home, one in my travel bag, so these are perfect.</li>
            <li>It is still in perfect condition</li>
            <li>Will be buying more, just in case I can&#x27;t find it again!!</li>
            <li>Very nice</li>
            <li>Really really nice!</li>
            <li>Good Quality.</li>
            <li>This one is good quality.</li>
            <li>Well constructed, allows product of your choice to be applied smoothly and a great length.  </li>
            <li>Since I am not fully used to using brushes yet, I was hoping to find some nice sponge</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a nice tool.</li>
            <li>Nice brush.</li>
            <li>I love makeup but, for most of my life, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on good brushes</li>
            <li>so you can control it better in your hands for better application!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really loving this applicator (#740 - Sponge Applicator Eye) and prefer it to the SHANY one because it is more pointed and allows more for applying shadow to the crease of the eye and not just on the eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I found these they work fabulous and good quality</li>
            <li>The ferrule is silver and very securely attached to both the handle and the brush</li>
            <li>so I mostly used the sponge-tip applicators that came with eye shadows.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>Love to put my eyeshadow on with these sponges.  </li>
            <li>I love using the longer handled brushes for putting on eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>It makes it easy to apply eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>You will really enjoy this instrument.  </li>
            <li>Just wish it came with a cover to keep it clean &amp; dust-free.</li>
            <li>handle is bright yellow laquer and notes that the brush is Made in China.</li>
            <li>Great buy, the only thing that REALLY bothered me was the shipping price.</li>
            <li>Nice firm but gentle foam, good for using the tip on an angle to apply shadow as liner.  </li>
            <li>Love these sponge brushes for putting on eyeshadows, they blend colors nicely &amp; I prefer them to a typical eyeshadow brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having used this applicator, I would definitely be interested in looking more into the Bdellium Tools line the next time I need a makeup applicator or tool.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I came to Amazon to find other applicators like it and discovered Bdellium</li>
            <li>Love the long handle</li>
            <li>I ordered that came from China which broke after the first use, so this brush is very well made.</li>
            <li>I certainly do.&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
            <li>It is far easier to handle and more convenient than the short sponge makeup applicator brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>These days, I&#x27;m branching out and trying new products, both in the makeup itself and in makeup brushes/tools.</li>
            <li>Sponge brush is just OK - head is quite small</li>
            <li>The long grip lets you apply makeup with more precision and the sponge hasn&#x27;t come loose so far.  </li>
            <li>first purchase was the SHANY Professional brush kit and in there was a long-handled, sponge-tip applicator similar to this one.</li>
            <li>Still using the first one, because even after washing over again, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Some of my new eye shadow kits, such as TheBalm&#x27;s BalmJovi eye shadow palette, do not come with applicators.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order more of these because there is really nothing else like it on the market, but they are a little expensive to have to replace monthly.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not a very heavy makeup user and I have two of these applicators, but after a few months the sponges started pilling and I had to stop using them because small pieces of foam were landing in my eyes.</li>

            <li> I love makeup but, for most of my life, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on good brushes so I mostly used the sponge-tip applicators that came with eye shadows. These days, I&#x27;m branching out and trying new products, both in the makeup itself and in makeup brushes/tools. Some of my new eye shadow kits, such as TheBalm&#x27;s BalmJovi eye shadow palette, do not come with applicators.

            <li> I also bought this to replace a brush from Sephora that is no longer made! I&#x27;m not a very heavy makeup user and I have two of these applicators, but after a few months the sponges started pilling and I had to stop using them because small pieces of foam were landing in my eyes. I&#x27;m going to order more of these because there is really nothing else like it on the market, but they are a little expensive to have to replace monthly.</li>
            <li> Nice firm but gentle foam, good for using the tip on an angle to apply shadow as liner.  Just wish it came with a cover to keep it clean &amp; dust-free.</li>
            <li> Love these sponge brushes for putting on eyeshadows, they blend colors nicely &amp; I prefer them to a typical eyeshadow brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an applicator like this ever since I bought one at Sephora ages ago and lost it. They don&#x27;t sell them anymore and I can&#x27;t find them at drugstores or other places either. The long grip lets you apply makeup with more precision and the sponge hasn&#x27;t come loose so far.  Great buy, the only thing that REALLY bothered me was the shipping price. It was outrageous. Seller should reconsider that.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup brush. It makes it easy to apply eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Have been using one of these for about a year &amp; it needed to be replaced (I snagged it &amp; the sponge ripped!). Same brand. Lasts a long time (if you don&#x27;t rip it!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred sponge applicator for my eyeshadow. Glad I found these they work fabulous and good quality I&#x27;ve ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> Seam that runs along the the tip is scratchy.  I used to have one that the foam folded over the tip and was less irritating and smoother--it was a better design.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a nice tool.</li>
            <li> Good Quality. Love the long handle so you can control it better in your hands for better application!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for one of these, for 2 years!! Bought ALL THE WROONG one&#x27;s...then I found this!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT! PERFECT! GREAT QUALITY! Will be buying more, just in case I can&#x27;t find it again!!</li>
            <li> Nice brush. Like long handle.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Thank you. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Love to put my eyeshadow on with these sponges.  Bought three of them because I couldn&#x27;t find them anymore.  Still using the first one, because even after washing over again, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Sponge brush is just OK - head is quite small and I thought it was pricey for what it is.</li>
            <li> Still holding up well after daily use for a few months.  I can&#x27;t stand using tiny short applicators for my eye shadow.  This one is good quality.</li>
            <li> I love using the longer handled brushes for putting on eye shadow.  I like to have one at home, one in my travel bag, so these are perfect.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as other brands on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Really really nice! It is far easier to handle and more convenient than the short sponge makeup applicator brushes. Very nice and it hasn&#x27;t broken like the one&#x27;s I ordered that came from China which broke after the first use, so this brush is very well made. It is still in perfect condition and I have been using it for at least 2 weeks now. Highly recommended.</li>
