            <li> It is so concentrated that it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I make my mix by adding black saop and organic CO since it softens my skin although I apply the same organic CO+AO+VCO all over my body as lotion especially after shaving on my face and before pumping iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients of the Black African Soap are; African Mint (Ocimum canum) Extract (Aqueous), African Black Soap [Saponified Shea Butter</li>

            <li> We like the way the soap makes you feel but it leaves a little film on the tub</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this beauty since I wanted some peppermint in my mix. I make my mix by adding black saop and organic CO since it softens my skin although I apply the same organic CO+AO+VCO all over my body as lotion especially after shaving on my face and before pumping iron. I make the mix in smaller bottles with enough air in the bottles since the bottle needs to be shaken before use in the shower otherwise CO will rise to the top. CO helps my shaving as well. There are no chemicals, no foaming agents, no additives, no plastic beads in the mix like you find even in expensive brands which clog up lines, pollute oceans and kill marine life. Only few ingredients Water, Saponfied Organic Coconut Oil, Saponified Organic Olive Oil, Organic Glycerin, Organic Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Tocopherol (Vitamin. E). Dr. Bronner adds the additional ingredient that the soap is identified as, in this case peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients of the Black African Soap are; African Mint (Ocimum canum) Extract (Aqueous), African Black Soap [Saponified Shea Butter* (Butyrospermum Parkii) and Palm Kernel Oil (Elaeis guineensis)], Lauryl Glucoside (coconut).</li>
            <li> Fast shipping for a great product! This soap is always a favorite in my shower around fall and winter time. So cool and refreshing, with a nice peppermint tingle. Also works well in a soap dispenser.</li>
            <li> Great soap suds up a lot, and get ya clean.  But, a word to the wise, when using the peppermint rinse off well in the shower.  When your out the menthol can cruelly wait to evaporate at an inopportune time, and you yell things like, &#x27;GREAT GOOGLY MOOGLY,&#x27; or &#x27;ACH MY NARDS.&#x27;</li>
            <li> wonderful stuff,def.5 stars!</li>
            <li> One of my favorites of all time. Shampoo, household cleaner, insect repellent, laundry detergent and more.&lt;br /&gt;I have found I can&#x27;t use it on bedding. Peppermint can be a stimulant. Be never fear - Use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Lavender Soap for sweet dreams.</li>
            <li> This is great soap and a bargain. A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint in this is more intense than any other brand I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Like peppermint soap? You&#x27;ll LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> It leaves a film on my skin.</li>
            <li> great and quick service</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get this for any reason other than a reduction in antibacterial usage in the home. Use it to bathe, wash dogs, floors, dishwasher, laundry. Tons of recipes found with just a google of Castile soap.</li>
            <li> Great for makeup  brushes☺</li>
            <li> I immediately took a shower after opening my package! I love this stuff, leaves your body feeling minty fresh! :)</li>
            <li> This is wonderful gentle soap that can be used for many purposes.  It is so concentrated that it lasts a long time.  I have the peppermint right now and enjoy the frangrance and tingle very much.</li>

            <li> Love this soap. Keeps things fresh and rejuvenating</li>
            <li> Love it.  Planning to buy other scents!</li>
            <li> Been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for 30+ years</li>
            <li> This soap works wonders and leaves no doubt that your hands are clean and they smell good too.</li>
            <li> Our family uses afew of the Dr. Bronner soaps, including the Castile. These soaps are quite economical (you dilute them to use) and clean very well.  I like the fact that they use only natural ingredients as I have some artificial fragrance allergies and can use these without hesitation.  I have found that using them with a separate bottle to mix in works best for us, though I know some people use them straight from the bottle.  Excellent soap that works without all the bad stuff that many soaps have!</li>
            <li> We like the way the soap makes you feel but it leaves a little film on the tub</li>
            <li> Our favorite shower soap.  It leaves you minty fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! I can use it for my hair, as a hand wash, or just around the home.  We take this camping and it serves as an all in one product; we can wash dishes, hands, shower soap/shampoo, and not have to worry about taking several different products, and it can just be dumped at our site without worrying about harming the environment! I put this in a spray bottle with water, and it works to keep Japanese beetles off my roses, too!</li>
            <li> Always works as expected. Good cleaner and good for the earth.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap. I&#x27;ve been using it for years!</li>
