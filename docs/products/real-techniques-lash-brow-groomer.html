            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>it was in perfect condition; then I looked at the clear packaging which the comb/brush came in and it was also in perfect condition; which leads me to believe the comb/brush was bent when it came from the factory; and they (the seller) knew it was like that; then sold it anyway.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better, great price, great product.</li>
            <li>Good product, good price</li>

            <li>it was a gift and the receiver loved it.</li>
            <li>Excellent and useful product!</li>
            <li>love the metal part too, works great in removing excess mascara</li>
            <li>While on most of these groomers the eyelash part is made out of plastic, I was happy to see that this one is made out of metal.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m quite pleased!</li>
            <li>The metal comb is fabulous!!</li>

            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>The bristles brush my lashes smoothly, and the metal teeth on the comb side combs through clumping mascara ans separates my lashes beautifully.</li>

            <li>Best Real Techniques brush</li>
            <li>brush, on the brow grooming side has nice sturdy bristles.</li>
            <li>Also bought a real Techniques Starter Set and very happy with it!</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>Real Techniques are the best brushes for your buck!  </li>
            <li>The brush side is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I think everyone should own this.</li>
            <li>This is a handy brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles on this are really nice quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Really liked these brushes</li>
            <li>Love this brand! :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care about the eyebrow brush on this one, because I have my own favorite eyebrow brush already.  </li>
            <li>Good and cheap product.</li>
            <li>I love all of Sam Chapmans brushes I own them all and believe they won&#x27;t disappoint you.  </li>
            <li>Love Love Love this!</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>Nice! Seems durable and I love that it&#x27;s full size.</li>
            <li>Very sleek and makes my eyelashes beautiful</li>
            <li>I then add another very light coat of mascara</li>
            <li>The angle of the brow groomer side of the tool, along with the texture of the bristles, makes this tool as easy to use as it is effective.  </li>
            <li>Love it!! ;)))</li>
            <li>I had cheap brow groomers before that were better looking than that one!</li>
            <li>I love the metal comb</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Simplicity &#x3D; better,</li>
            <li>This brush works better than a baby toothbrush for blending brow color.</li>
            <li>Works and love the cost.</li>
            <li>It worked ok but is time consuming.</li>
            <li>So for that I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to have found this brush because its bristles are not encased between plastic pieces that would get in the way if I needed to un-clump my eyelashes, etc.</li>
            <li>I love that the comb is metal and that there is a snap on cover to protect it.  </li>
            <li>Combs out any clumps so much better</li>
            <li>I love the lash brow groomer.</li>
            <li>I use this lash brow groomer every morning and love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad this groomer comes with metal teeth.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic!</li>
            <li>All of these real techniques brushes are great.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s a metal instead of plastic comb.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love this lash/brow groomer.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a cute touch.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it ..</li>
            <li>It is so much better than the plastic ones.  </li>
            <li>I love the length of the brush.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better quality ones I have used...</li>
            <li>Much better than the plastic ones.</li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t break off so that&#x27;s what she likes the most</li>
            <li>Even at drug stores you will pay way more and at stores like sephora</li>
            <li>The handles are stylish and sleek and it comes with a cover for the lash comb teeth.  </li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>Works great and is very durable.</li>
            <li>I intend to purchase more as gifts for my Younique customers to use with their 3D mascara.</li>
            <li>Love this lash brow groomer.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>eyebrow brush is just OK, but I see it more as a bonus feature to the eyelash comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it every now and then to brush through my eyebrows, but the metal lash separating really gets in the lashes and does great.</li>
            <li>Love this lash brow groomer.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re worth it!!</li>
            <li>the metal side is easy to use and the color is stylish.</li>
            <li>No need in paying for high end brushes when this is just as good or better.</li>
            <li>It works, haven&#x27;t use it a ton yet, but great so far</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li>(I have bought higher-end mascaras in the past, but I hear great things about Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash, also available at drugstores everywhere.)</li>
            <li>The comb part of this brush is medal and is a unique design than most brow groomer brushes</li>
            <li>so this comb makes it extremely easy for me to get them the way I want.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t see them breaking off as easily (or ever).</li>
            <li>The metal lash comb side is covered by a plastic cap which is really easy to misplace.</li>
            <li>Separated lashes easily.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve abused mine a lot and all of the metal teeth are still strong and intact.</li>
            <li>First time using a metal eye lash brush and it makes a huge difference, love it!</li>
            <li>It worked fine for about the month that I had it.  </li>
            <li>The brow groomer part is fine;</li>
            <li>But the brushes work fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine, well made.</li>
            <li>This is the best little lash comb I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>, the metal tiny part of the other side of the brush is great to separate your sticky lashes!! :P</li>
            <li>it does smooth out any clumps in mascara.</li>
            <li>Please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and get this instead of the plastic cheap ones.</li>
            <li>This is such a great tool for any makeup kit and at such a great price.</li>
            <li>great lash/brow groomer, the metal comb is definitely preferred over plastic ones.</li>
            <li>feels really cheap and the hairs are all over the place.</li>
            <li>Another important rule:  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and well protected in its own case, then bubble wrap in a medium size box.</li>
            <li>For price and quality this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>Real Techniques makes the best makeup brushes and are the only ones I purchase now!</li>
            <li>For a person who would only apply two coats or so, that person would be better off just buying a good mascara, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The lash groomer has slightly flexible, easy to clean teeth to help separate lashes perfectly or make artful special effects.  </li>
            <li>Very useful after applying mascara.</li>
            <li>I use a really cheap one to clean the metal comb.  </li>
            <li>The brush on the other end of this is really full as well, which is great for making sure it grabs every brow hair.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>The brush part is very firm, which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy, well made, no shedding and clean</li>
            <li>The handles are brights and colorful in my makeup bag which makes them easy to find on trips.</li>
            <li>Most last combs are plastic, this one is metal with nicely rounded tips.</li>
            <li>Very useful after I apply my mascara, gives a bold finish, no clumps .</li>
            <li>Their large face brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The metal teeth are thinner (but not sharp) and very able to separate mascara-coated lashes to help give the full-lash look</li>
            <li>specially when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the brow groomer for my full eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, Real Techniques brushes are pretty amazing as well.</li>
            <li>Love the feel though, very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I only purchased this product for the lash groomer side, I was always looking for a good quality, metal lash groomer.</li>
            <li>Metal comb is way better for combing lashes, separate them very well.</li>
            <li>It is the same great quality as all of my Real Techniques brushes, and is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Along with their other brushes, the sets are great.</li>
            <li>The quality is great, just like all the other RealTechniques brushes...</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great makeup gadget.</li>
            <li>I use the metal side to comb out my lashes to keep them from clumping together and the other side is great for grooming my brows.</li>
            <li>They are hard to find in stores, but this was totally worth it, and the angle is perfect too.</li>
            <li>you really need to keep on, but it would be nice, if it would really stay put until you remove it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was quick and it arrived with no complications, and came with a plastic case covering the metal side.</li>
            <li>I guess someone who applies many, many coats of various mascara could use a tool like that.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations when I purchased it, but I was surprised how good it worked.  </li>
            <li>Easily washable, makes my lashes and brows very neat.</li>
            <li>i love how soft the bristles and densely packedm works well in brushing out with my brows even with gel cremes!</li>
            <li>Though a little spendy, it is superior to the cheap plastic eyelash combs.</li>
            <li>handle is some kind of light metal, and the black part has a unique texture.</li>
            <li>It also fit perfectly in my Real Techniques brush holder.</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing deal too.</li>
            <li>I am collecting the whole Real Techniques set, and am always pleased with the quality of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She has made and entire brush collection that is affordable, well made, great colors, and soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to separate eyelashes with the high quality comb.</li>
            <li>They are easier to clean and separate the lashes really well.</li>
            <li>This is a great little brush!</li>
            <li>The handle is a nice long one, and the brow groomer does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice and long, and has a cap on the end.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my old one, which has the plastic comb,  </li>
            <li>Very well made and adequately priced.</li>
            <li>I mainly use the last comb &amp; love it!</li>
            <li>metal seems pretty good quality and it is a decent product, but be careful not to poke your eyes.</li>
            <li>This comb really separates my lashes without tugging on them or pulling them out!</li>
            <li>is the first time I am buying a groomer that I do not know how to keep in my hand</li>
            <li>Soft bristle brush and the lash comb is precise.</li>
            <li>You can get something better than this for a similar price.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, not many brands make a metal comb, most of them are plastics.</li>
            <li>,it&#x27;s a pretty color purple/black design,this is a well made groomer,i would buy this again,and i recommend this groomer to anyone who groomers their eye brows.</li>
            <li>for my daughter who is very into makeup right now.  </li>
            <li>the eyebrow brush is nice and softer than other ones i have.</li>
            <li>These eyebrow groomers are really all the same at the top.  </li>
            <li>I also like the little guard that keeps the lash comb clean and safe for storage or transport.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend as part of your daily beauty routine!</li>
            <li>The separater side is little tiny metal teeth, it separates my lashes great.</li>
            <li>it really gets those clumps out.</li>
            <li>It really helps to define your lashes without pulling all of your mascara off.</li>
            <li>Separates really well</li>
            <li>The Real Techniques lash comb does not do  that.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product,I really like it.</li>
            <li>Everything real techniques is gold.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t use the brush side really, I prefer a spooley to groom my eyebrows</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference when I&#x27;m brushing my lashes after applying mascara and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sooo much easier to brush.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this brush and Real Techniques to my friends all the time.</li>
            <li>Very durable product and so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I believe this product does what it&#x27;s supposed to and is a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I have very bushy eyebrows</li>
            <li>I really like this Lash/Brow Groomer.  </li>
            <li>Really separates lashes well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lash groomer.</li>
            <li>you will pay 8x as much for one.</li>
            <li>Real Techniques has yet to disappoint.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>really like using these brushes and the lash brow groomer</li>
            <li>I also did not purchase this brush yet with having so much success with the ones I bought early</li>
            <li>Fast delivery,Nice things,Works well.</li>
            <li>barely use it, but the few times i have it&#x27;s pretty good. &#x60;</li>
            <li>Sonia Kashuk used to sell a white lash comb at Target that I purchased in multiples and it was FAR better than this.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described only issue is that the little plastic cover doesn&#x27;t fit well and falls off every once in a while but other than that it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>when this product arrived at my house, I was excited to finally have a &amp;#34;Real Techniques&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>only clean then using an eyebrow brush…never pull on the teeth with a tissue</li>
            <li>Except for the length (it is too long to fit into my the make up bag</li>
            <li>It helps me get my lashes extra full and plush.</li>
            <li>This brow groomer is very nice,it&#x27;s not cheaply made, one side is stainless steal and the other is dense nylon bristles,it&#x27;s great for the eye brows</li>
            <li>It works just like more expensive brands and the metal is much better than the plastic ones.</li>
            <li>The eyelash needles  are hard and I mostly wanted something that would be super soft so that I could brush some of the dandruff-like stuff that I&#x27;ve been getting on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>High quality brow brush.</li>
            <li>High Quality lash comb</li>
            <li>Highly reccomeded.</li>
            <li>I purchased a high end one</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this one</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lash comb.</li>
            <li>I am thinking about buying a few more and providing as gifts/stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li>a few of the bristles on the brow part weren&#x27;t even but I easily fixed it, love the lash part.</li>
            <li>I prefer this over other brushes of its kind because the comb side is metal and helps declump my lashes after applying mascara (be careful, nobody needs to lose an eye)</li>
            <li>I love the metal comb compared to the combs I&#x27;ve purchased in the past with plastic teeth.</li>
            <li>Brush handle is way longer than it needs to be, and that makes it too large to fit in a small makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I love this lash brush; It&#x27;s hard to find one with metal teeth.</li>
            <li>This was so hard to find, but I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li>It will last much longer.</li>
            <li>The only issue is the protective cover doesn&#x27;t stay on well, but for the price it&#x27;s not a game changer.</li>
            <li>The only con is that the cap for the metal side doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the functionality of the product.</li>
            <li>this works really well and would definitely recommend for anyone wanting an eyebrow brush and eyelash comb.  </li>
            <li>this is definitely in a whole different league of cosmetic tools.</li>
            <li>then my old plastic lash comb.</li>
            <li>I do not like soft brushes for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I finally ordered this online when the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve purchased from retail stores would keep breaking - those damn cheap plastic teeth...</li>
            <li>I also really like the deep purple color.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised by the quality of this eyebrow brush.  </li>
            <li>I tend to misplace things all the time so at this price point it doesn&#x27;t hurt quite as much as losing my $30+ one that was of lesser quality that I purchased from Ulta.</li>
            <li>Big like on the real techniques brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The quality of this metal lash brush far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Was surprised they worked.</li>
            <li>I am kind of surprised at the negative  and mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>IS NOT SO GOOD SORRY...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a necessity for anyone who wears mascara and or false lashes or even for someone with coarse eyebrows that need a good grooming.</li>
            <li>Brush is stiff and doesn&#x27;t work as well to smooth my eyebrows as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>This, however, is my second one (thankfully they are not priced to high).  </li>
            <li>The lash groomer is made of metal and the teeth don&#x27;t feel like they will break like the cheap plastic ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several of similar product because I have long, full, and curly eyelashes</li>
            <li>The metal side is what really does it for me; I use it after I apply my mascara (and allow it to dry) for a fuller lash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really big, not fit for precise application.</li>
            <li>There is no other like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brow bristle side is super stiff.</li>
            <li>I have used other groomers, but the lash combs never really separate and are made of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Not much to say really.</li>
            <li>As for the lash comb, I thought I would use it a lot, but I barely do.</li>
            <li>The mental spikes are sharp so be sure not to loose that plastic covering.</li>
            <li>Mine is not loose and has not fallen apart</li>
            <li>It seems a little bulky too like I could get a little more precision if it was a bit smaller.</li>
            <li>for the first few months.</li>
            <li>I Highly Recommend everyone try at least 1 Real Techniques Brush .&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The trick is to put on mascara, let it dry COMPLETELY</li>
            <li>And they all worked fine for a few months until the little teeth broke off.</li>
            <li>We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
            <li>Not happy about the little holes in my purse now, so I guess I will need to find some kind of plastic sleeve (like ones for makeup brushes) to put this is from now on.</li>

            <li> It is amazing!</li>
            <li> it was in perfect condition; then I looked at the clear packaging which the comb/brush came in and it was also in perfect condition; which leads me to believe the comb/brush was bent when it came from the factory; and they (the seller) knew it was like that; then sold it anyway.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better, great price, great product.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price</li>

            <li> love the metal part too, works great in removing excess mascara</li>
            <li> While on most of these groomers the eyelash part is made out of plastic, I was happy to see that this one is made out of metal.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m quite pleased!</li>
            <li> The metal comb is fabulous!!</li>

            <li> Another excellent performer from Real Techniques!  </li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> The bristles brush my lashes smoothly, and the metal teeth on the comb side combs through clumping mascara ans separates my lashes beautifully.</li>
            <li> I love this lash comb!</li>
            <li> Works so great and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> For the price this is amazing.</li>

            <li> Good quality, metal eyelash combs work better than anything else</li>
            <li> brush of any kind since they are supposed to be a premium brand name.</li>
            <li> Nice eyebrow/mascara brush</li>

            <li> Also bought a real Techniques Starter Set and very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> Real Techniques are the best brushes for your buck!  </li>
            <li> The brush side is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I think everyone should own this.</li>
            <li> This is a handy brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this are really nice quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Really liked these brushes</li>
            <li> Love this brand! :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the eyebrow brush on this one, because I have my own favorite eyebrow brush already.  </li>
            <li> Good and cheap product.</li>
            <li> I love all of Sam Chapmans brushes I own them all and believe they won&#x27;t disappoint you.  </li>
            <li> Love Love Love this!</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> Nice! Seems durable and I love that it&#x27;s full size.</li>
            <li> Very sleek and makes my eyelashes beautiful</li>
            <li> I then add another very light coat of mascara</li>
            <li> The angle of the brow groomer side of the tool, along with the texture of the bristles, makes this tool as easy to use as it is effective.  </li>
            <li> Love it!! ;)))</li>
            <li> I had cheap brow groomers before that were better looking than that one!</li>
            <li> I love the metal comb</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Simplicity &#x3D; better,</li>
            <li> This brush works better than a baby toothbrush for blending brow color.</li>
            <li> Works and love the cost.</li>
            <li> It worked ok but is time consuming.</li>
            <li> So for that I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to have found this brush because its bristles are not encased between plastic pieces that would get in the way if I needed to un-clump my eyelashes, etc.</li>
            <li> I love that the comb is metal and that there is a snap on cover to protect it.  </li>
            <li> Combs out any clumps so much better</li>
            <li> I love the lash brow groomer.</li>
            <li> I use this lash brow groomer every morning and love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad this groomer comes with metal teeth.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic!</li>
            <li> All of these real techniques brushes are great.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s a metal instead of plastic comb.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> I love this lash/brow groomer.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a cute touch.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it ..</li>
            <li> It is so much better than the plastic ones.  </li>
            <li> I love the length of the brush.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better quality ones I have used...</li>
            <li> Much better than the plastic ones.</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t break off so that&#x27;s what she likes the most</li>
            <li> Even at drug stores you will pay way more and at stores like sephora</li>
            <li> The handles are stylish and sleek and it comes with a cover for the lash comb teeth.  </li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> Works great and is very durable.</li>
            <li> I intend to purchase more as gifts for my Younique customers to use with their 3D mascara.</li>
            <li> Love this lash brow groomer.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> eyebrow brush is just OK, but I see it more as a bonus feature to the eyelash comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it every now and then to brush through my eyebrows, but the metal lash separating really gets in the lashes and does great.</li>
            <li> Love this lash brow groomer.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re worth it!!</li>
            <li> the metal side is easy to use and the color is stylish.</li>
            <li> No need in paying for high end brushes when this is just as good or better.</li>
            <li> It works, haven&#x27;t use it a ton yet, but great so far</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li> (I have bought higher-end mascaras in the past, but I hear great things about Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash, also available at drugstores everywhere.)</li>
            <li> The comb part of this brush is medal and is a unique design than most brow groomer brushes</li>
            <li> so this comb makes it extremely easy for me to get them the way I want.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t see them breaking off as easily (or ever).</li>
            <li> The metal lash comb side is covered by a plastic cap which is really easy to misplace.</li>
            <li> Separated lashes easily.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve abused mine a lot and all of the metal teeth are still strong and intact.</li>
            <li> First time using a metal eye lash brush and it makes a huge difference, love it!</li>
            <li> It worked fine for about the month that I had it.  </li>
            <li> The brow groomer part is fine;</li>
            <li> But the brushes work fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine, well made.</li>
            <li> This is the best little lash comb I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> , the metal tiny part of the other side of the brush is great to separate your sticky lashes!! :P</li>
            <li> it does smooth out any clumps in mascara.</li>
            <li> Please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and get this instead of the plastic cheap ones.</li>
            <li> This is such a great tool for any makeup kit and at such a great price.</li>
            <li> great lash/brow groomer, the metal comb is definitely preferred over plastic ones.</li>
            <li> feels really cheap and the hairs are all over the place.</li>
            <li> Another important rule:  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and well protected in its own case, then bubble wrap in a medium size box.</li>
            <li> For price and quality this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> Real Techniques makes the best makeup brushes and are the only ones I purchase now!</li>
            <li> For a person who would only apply two coats or so, that person would be better off just buying a good mascara, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The lash groomer has slightly flexible, easy to clean teeth to help separate lashes perfectly or make artful special effects.  </li>
            <li> Very useful after applying mascara.</li>
            <li> I use a really cheap one to clean the metal comb.  </li>
            <li> The brush on the other end of this is really full as well, which is great for making sure it grabs every brow hair.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> The brush part is very firm, which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy, well made, no shedding and clean</li>
            <li> The handles are brights and colorful in my makeup bag which makes them easy to find on trips.</li>
            <li> Most last combs are plastic, this one is metal with nicely rounded tips.</li>
            <li> Very useful after I apply my mascara, gives a bold finish, no clumps .</li>
            <li> Their large face brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The metal teeth are thinner (but not sharp) and very able to separate mascara-coated lashes to help give the full-lash look</li>
            <li> specially when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the brow groomer for my full eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, Real Techniques brushes are pretty amazing as well.</li>
            <li> Love the feel though, very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I only purchased this product for the lash groomer side, I was always looking for a good quality, metal lash groomer.</li>
            <li> Metal comb is way better for combing lashes, separate them very well.</li>
            <li> It is the same great quality as all of my Real Techniques brushes, and is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Along with their other brushes, the sets are great.</li>
            <li> The quality is great, just like all the other RealTechniques brushes...</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a great makeup gadget.</li>
            <li> I use the metal side to comb out my lashes to keep them from clumping together and the other side is great for grooming my brows.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find in stores, but this was totally worth it, and the angle is perfect too.</li>
            <li> you really need to keep on, but it would be nice, if it would really stay put until you remove it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was quick and it arrived with no complications, and came with a plastic case covering the metal side.</li>
            <li> I guess someone who applies many, many coats of various mascara could use a tool like that.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations when I purchased it, but I was surprised how good it worked.  </li>
            <li> Easily washable, makes my lashes and brows very neat.</li>
            <li> i love how soft the bristles and densely packedm works well in brushing out with my brows even with gel cremes!</li>
            <li> Though a little spendy, it is superior to the cheap plastic eyelash combs.</li>
            <li> handle is some kind of light metal, and the black part has a unique texture.</li>
            <li> It also fit perfectly in my Real Techniques brush holder.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing deal too.</li>
            <li> I am collecting the whole Real Techniques set, and am always pleased with the quality of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has made and entire brush collection that is affordable, well made, great colors, and soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to separate eyelashes with the high quality comb.</li>
            <li> They are easier to clean and separate the lashes really well.</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush!</li>
            <li> The handle is a nice long one, and the brow groomer does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice and long, and has a cap on the end.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my old one, which has the plastic comb,  </li>
            <li> Very well made and adequately priced.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the last comb &amp; love it!</li>
            <li> metal seems pretty good quality and it is a decent product, but be careful not to poke your eyes.</li>
            <li> This comb really separates my lashes without tugging on them or pulling them out!</li>
            <li> is the first time I am buying a groomer that I do not know how to keep in my hand</li>
            <li> Soft bristle brush and the lash comb is precise.</li>
            <li> You can get something better than this for a similar price.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, not many brands make a metal comb, most of them are plastics.</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s a pretty color purple/black design,this is a well made groomer,i would buy this again,and i recommend this groomer to anyone who groomers their eye brows.</li>
            <li> for my daughter who is very into makeup right now.  </li>
            <li> the eyebrow brush is nice and softer than other ones i have.</li>
            <li> These eyebrow groomers are really all the same at the top.  </li>
            <li> I also like the little guard that keeps the lash comb clean and safe for storage or transport.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend as part of your daily beauty routine!</li>
            <li> The separater side is little tiny metal teeth, it separates my lashes great.</li>
            <li> it really gets those clumps out.</li>
            <li> It really helps to define your lashes without pulling all of your mascara off.</li>
            <li> Separates really well</li>
            <li> The Real Techniques lash comb does not do  that.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product,I really like it.</li>
            <li> Everything real techniques is gold.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t use the brush side really, I prefer a spooley to groom my eyebrows</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference when I&#x27;m brushing my lashes after applying mascara and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sooo much easier to brush.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this brush and Real Techniques to my friends all the time.</li>
            <li> Very durable product and so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I believe this product does what it&#x27;s supposed to and is a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have very bushy eyebrows</li>
            <li> I really like this Lash/Brow Groomer.  </li>
            <li> Really separates lashes well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this lash groomer.</li>
            <li> you will pay 8x as much for one.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques has yet to disappoint.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> really like using these brushes and the lash brow groomer</li>
            <li> I also did not purchase this brush yet with having so much success with the ones I bought early</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,Nice things,Works well.</li>
            <li> barely use it, but the few times i have it&#x27;s pretty good. &#x60;</li>
            <li> Sonia Kashuk used to sell a white lash comb at Target that I purchased in multiples and it was FAR better than this.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described only issue is that the little plastic cover doesn&#x27;t fit well and falls off every once in a while but other than that it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> when this product arrived at my house, I was excited to finally have a &amp;#34;Real Techniques&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> only clean then using an eyebrow brush…never pull on the teeth with a tissue</li>
            <li> Except for the length (it is too long to fit into my the make up bag</li>
            <li> It helps me get my lashes extra full and plush.</li>
            <li> This brow groomer is very nice,it&#x27;s not cheaply made, one side is stainless steal and the other is dense nylon bristles,it&#x27;s great for the eye brows</li>
            <li> It works just like more expensive brands and the metal is much better than the plastic ones.</li>
            <li> The eyelash needles  are hard and I mostly wanted something that would be super soft so that I could brush some of the dandruff-like stuff that I&#x27;ve been getting on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> High quality brow brush.</li>
            <li> High Quality lash comb</li>
            <li> Highly reccomeded.</li>
            <li> I purchased a high end one</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this one</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lash comb.</li>
            <li> I am thinking about buying a few more and providing as gifts/stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> a few of the bristles on the brow part weren&#x27;t even but I easily fixed it, love the lash part.</li>
            <li> I prefer this over other brushes of its kind because the comb side is metal and helps declump my lashes after applying mascara (be careful, nobody needs to lose an eye)</li>
            <li> I love the metal comb compared to the combs I&#x27;ve purchased in the past with plastic teeth.</li>
            <li> Brush handle is way longer than it needs to be, and that makes it too large to fit in a small makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I love this lash brush; It&#x27;s hard to find one with metal teeth.</li>
            <li> This was so hard to find, but I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li> It will last much longer.</li>
            <li> The only issue is the protective cover doesn&#x27;t stay on well, but for the price it&#x27;s not a game changer.</li>
            <li> The only con is that the cap for the metal side doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the functionality of the product.</li>
            <li> this works really well and would definitely recommend for anyone wanting an eyebrow brush and eyelash comb.  </li>
            <li> this is definitely in a whole different league of cosmetic tools.</li>
            <li> then my old plastic lash comb.</li>
            <li> I do not like soft brushes for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I finally ordered this online when the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve purchased from retail stores would keep breaking - those damn cheap plastic teeth...</li>
            <li> I also really like the deep purple color.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised by the quality of this eyebrow brush.  </li>
            <li> I tend to misplace things all the time so at this price point it doesn&#x27;t hurt quite as much as losing my $30+ one that was of lesser quality that I purchased from Ulta.</li>
            <li> Big like on the real techniques brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The quality of this metal lash brush far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Was surprised they worked.</li>
            <li> I am kind of surprised at the negative  and mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> IS NOT SO GOOD SORRY...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a necessity for anyone who wears mascara and or false lashes or even for someone with coarse eyebrows that need a good grooming.</li>
            <li> Brush is stiff and doesn&#x27;t work as well to smooth my eyebrows as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> This, however, is my second one (thankfully they are not priced to high).  </li>
            <li> The lash groomer is made of metal and the teeth don&#x27;t feel like they will break like the cheap plastic ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several of similar product because I have long, full, and curly eyelashes</li>
            <li> The metal side is what really does it for me; I use it after I apply my mascara (and allow it to dry) for a fuller lash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really big, not fit for precise application.</li>
            <li> There is no other like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brow bristle side is super stiff.</li>
            <li> I have used other groomers, but the lash combs never really separate and are made of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Not much to say really.</li>
            <li> As for the lash comb, I thought I would use it a lot, but I barely do.</li>
            <li> The mental spikes are sharp so be sure not to loose that plastic covering.</li>
            <li> Mine is not loose and has not fallen apart</li>
            <li> It seems a little bulky too like I could get a little more precision if it was a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> for the first few months.</li>
            <li> I Highly Recommend everyone try at least 1 Real Techniques Brush .&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The trick is to put on mascara, let it dry COMPLETELY</li>
            <li> And they all worked fine for a few months until the little teeth broke off.</li>
            <li> We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
            <li> Not happy about the little holes in my purse now, so I guess I will need to find some kind of plastic sleeve (like ones for makeup brushes) to put this is from now on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that expensive &amp; it far exceeded my expectations - the metal teeth on the comb don&#x27;t come anywhere close to comparing with the typical plastic ones I&#x27;ve always had (and paid more for).</li>
            <li> It brushes the eyebrows and helps set the hairs on a certain direction, but its not a magic fix at all.</li>
            <li> Had a plastic one previously and the comb completely fell off after several uses.  </li>
            <li> The handle is long enough to give you control.</li>
            <li> The first one lost several teeth while I was trying to clean it. :(</li>
            <li> Most plastic lash combs have teeth that are too thick to separate delicate lashes.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles are not too stiff and overall it has met all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sturdy bristles for your brows as well, my only complaint (very minor) is the plastic case that protects the metal side</li>
            <li> My only dislike is the color, I would have preferred plain silver or black instead of the pink/purple colors that the real techniques colors come in.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find a metal lash brush, let alone one at a reasonable price that will not break the bank.  </li>
            <li> I poked my eyes a couple of times and still don&#x27;t feel comfortable using it without doing some weird acrobatic things.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this groomer because of the long handle and the sturdy lash comb.</li>
            <li> brush too long and sparse&lt;</li>
            <li> It has a metal comb on it instead of the plain old plastic comb.</li>
            <li> Puts all other tools of a similar type to shame.</li>
            <li> Unlike every other eyelash comb I&#x27;ve used, this one actually gets through the lashes with ease.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, the only issue is, the metal comb teeth are SHARP.</li>
            <li> It was nothing major, but it did break the skin and drew a little blood.</li>
            <li> I purchased this solely for the lash comb, but the pins are too tight together, making the brush very hard to clean as it gets &amp;#34;clogged&amp;#34; with mascara after a couple uses and won&#x27;t let my lashes slip through the pins.</li>
            <li> It really helps to get rid of clumps left behind from mascara</li>
            <li> is so narrow that it is very hard to clean out</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with loose hairs on this brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was bent/cracked about one inch above the black rubber tipped end.</li>
            <li> The bristles are black, and have some purple colored bristles mixed in.</li>
            <li> I would have to constantly replace the plastic ones I got in the drug stores because the little comb tines were always breaking.  </li>
            <li> Then, comb them out with this little gem, and you will look like you&#x27;re in a mascara commercial!</li>
            <li> The weird angle and the relatively bulkiness of the brow groomer side and the plastic in between these two sides really block your way to see your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They just collect the wet mascara, and glob up on the comb.</li>
            <li> It is very loose and doesn&#x27;t syay on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as expected.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow brush part is not quite stiff enough.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, so you always have to use a mirror when using them.  </li>
            <li> On one side is the brow groomer and on the other side is a lash groomer to get rid of clumps of mascara and even your lashes out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;metal comb does not work well compared to other ones I have had&lt;br /&gt;not one I would recommend</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lash side, is metal, the prongs aren&#x27;t too sharp, and they are sturdy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know there was anything other than plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t scratch you like some other plastic ones.</li>
            <li> A little rough of a brush, but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Remember the plastic ones with the thick teeth that just seemed to scrap the mascara off and never actually got between eyelashes to separate them?  </li>
            <li> It has completely changed my lash game...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sharp at the end</li>
            <li> Be careful, if you accidentally poke your eye with the metal lash groomer, ouch!!</li>
            <li> I use the other side for my eyebrows to soften any harsh lines after I fill them in.</li>
            <li> You can buy a brow groomer for a lot less money at a drugstore or even a 99-cent store, I think, and it would work just as well.</li>
            <li> At $3 or less you will NEVER find a metal eyelash comb.</li>
            <li> A little cover for this side is included.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes me a little nervous to have the metal &amp;#34;spikes&amp;#34; that close to my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, It&#x27;s a sturdy little thing</li>
            <li> The bristly side could be a little stiffer for my tastes (to comb through brows), but I prefer a spoolie for that job anyhow.</li>
            <li> Plastic combs have thick teeth at the ends making it hard to get even spacing, this one has all the same size teeth, giving you even spaced combing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear mascara anymore as it is not visible behind my glasses, but I like my brows to be groomed properly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few combs like these, all with a plastic teeth.</li>
            <li> This thing works well for the eyebrows, although a little too rough, but not great for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Makes my lower lashes look fab, even if my mascara is drying out and getting a little clumpy!</li>
            <li> Not a nice thing to do.</li>
            <li> (5-10 minutes at least), then put on another coat.</li>
            <li> The brow brush is big and kinda awkward.</li>
            <li> Wanted a metal comb for my eyelashes as the plastic teeth on some are too thick and don&#x27;t separate my lashes.</li>
            <li> Seriously it is</li>
            <li> No more broken comb tines!  </li>
            <li> These metal tipped lash separators are very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> so there is no reason that it should have randomly broken.</li>
            <li> Quite frustrating.</li>
            <li> Get it - seriously - just get it!</li>
            <li> Plastic combs are totally useless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the metal comb it really gets those clumps out.</li>
            <li> a few of the bristles on the brow part weren&#x27;t even but I easily fixed it, love the lash part.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  Perfect match to the rest of the Real Techniques brush set.  It also fit perfectly in my Real Techniques brush holder.</li>
            <li> i love how soft the bristles and densely packedm works well in brushing out with my brows even with gel cremes! love the metal part too, works great in removing excess mascara</li>
            <li> It works, haven&#x27;t use it a ton yet, but great so far</li>
            <li> Good quality, metal eyelash combs work better than anything else</li>
            <li> High quality brow brush. I love it. And the metal end is perfect for combing out mascara clumps.</li>
            <li> High Quality lash comb</li>
            <li> Love this product. It really helps to get rid of clumps left behind from mascara</li>
            <li> It worked fine for about the month that I had it.  Then yesterday I picked it up to use it and a piece just fell off of it.  I kept it stored upright in a jar so there is no reason that it should have randomly broken. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best little lash comb I&#x27;ve ever used. It really helps to define your lashes without pulling all of your mascara off.</li>
            <li> After I saw a review of this brush on youtube I knew I had to have it, the metal tiny part of the other side of the brush is great to separate your sticky lashes!! :P</li>
            <li> when this product arrived at my house, I was excited to finally have a &amp;#34;Real Techniques&amp;#34; brush of any kind since they are supposed to be a premium brand name. When I opened the envelope, I was very disappointed, as the tool it&#x27;s self was bent/cracked about one inch above the black rubber tipped end. I looked a the shipping envelope...it was in perfect condition; then I looked at the clear packaging which the comb/brush came in and it was also in perfect condition; which leads me to believe the comb/brush was bent when it came from the factory; and they (the seller) knew it was like that; then sold it anyway. Not a nice thing to do. I am not at all happy about it either.</li>
            <li> I love this lash brush; It&#x27;s hard to find one with metal teeth. It separated/removed mascara clumps from my lashes perfectly. It also comes with a cap to cover the metal teeth, but mine doesn&#x27;t stay on too well. (I don&#x27;t mind this since I don&#x27;t take it traveling.) I haven&#x27;t used the brow side because I prefer spoolie brush for my brows.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> I never  thought this applicator would become such an integral part of my makeup application! Seriously it is &amp; I&#x27;m quite pleased!</li>
            <li> I like it... it does smooth out any clumps in mascara. It does require cleaning with makeup remover on the metal teeth of the eyelash comb. I find the brush especially effective on my eyebrows. Though a little spendy, it is superior to the cheap plastic eyelash combs.</li>
            <li> The metal comb is fabulous!!</li>
            <li> I HATE the plastic versions. I use this to separate my eyelashes between coats of mascara and it works STUPENDOUSLY, in addition, I use it to groom my brows as well. Please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and get this instead of the plastic cheap ones. It will last much longer. My only dislike is the color, I would have preferred plain silver or black instead of the pink/purple colors that the real techniques colors come in. Yes, Im a woman, but not all of us adore these outrageous colors. Simplicity &#x3D; better,</li>
            <li> Good product, good price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear mascara anymore as it is not visible behind my glasses, but I like my brows to be groomed properly.  This brush works better than a baby toothbrush for blending brow color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my old one, which has the plastic comb,  Love the feel though, very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Nice eyebrow/mascara brush</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush! It&#x27;s easy to separate eyelashes with the high quality comb. Plastic combs are totally useless. I won&#x27;t use anything else from now on. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Works great! This comb really separates my lashes without tugging on them or pulling them out! The only issue is the protective cover doesn&#x27;t stay on well, but for the price it&#x27;s not a game changer.</li>
            <li> Sturdy product!. I like it! I wish the the brush side had cover</li>
            <li> This is such a great tool for any makeup kit and at such a great price. The metal side is what really does it for me; I use it after I apply my mascara (and allow it to dry) for a fuller lash. I then add another very light coat of mascara and I&#x27;m good to go. I use the other side for my eyebrows to soften any harsh lines after I fill them in. The only con is that the cap for the metal side doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the functionality of the product.</li>
            <li> this works really well and would definitely recommend for anyone wanting an eyebrow brush and eyelash comb.  Along with their other brushes, the sets are great.</li>
            <li> I do lash extensions and find these combs to be excellent.  Highly reccomeded.</li>
            <li> Works and love the cost. I tried the method of putting mascara on the metal part and using that to apply mascara. It worked ok but is time consuming.</li>
            <li> Separates really well so i can coat every lash with mascara. It helps me get my lashes extra full and plush.</li>
            <li> I used to have the same lash/brow groomer that I purchased from Sephora, but lost it awhile ago. I was about to purchase one from Sephora, but felt that $14 was a bit steep and decided to check on here. While on most of these groomers the eyelash part is made out of plastic, I was happy to see that this one is made out of metal. This is such an amazing deal too. I&#x27;m happy I found it.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this groomer was for the metal lash separator....The plastic ones are truly worthless.  If you want to sweep put clumps and separate your lashes, this baby does a beautiful job....must have.  The brow groomer is useless though.</li>
            <li> Finally!  A metal lash comb!</li>
            <li> This lash and brow comb is really great this is my second one I purchased from amazon.</li>
            <li> The brow groomer part is fine; nice bristles, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is brush your brows into place. But the metal teeth on the lash comb are terrific! Most plastic lash combs have teeth that are too thick to separate delicate lashes. The metal teeth are thinner (but not sharp) and very able to separate mascara-coated lashes to help give the full-lash look I want. I&#x27;ll never go back to plastic!</li>
            <li> Nice! Seems durable and I love that it&#x27;s full size.</li>
            <li> great lash/brow groomer, the metal comb is definitely preferred over plastic ones. the eyebrow brush is nice and softer than other ones i have. i&#x27;ve abused mine a lot and all of the metal teeth are still strong and intact. love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for lashes and brows and superb pricing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that expensive &amp; it far exceeded my expectations - the metal teeth on the comb don&#x27;t come anywhere close to comparing with the typical plastic ones I&#x27;ve always had (and paid more for). this is definitely in a whole different league of cosmetic tools. Get it - seriously - just get it! You&#x27;re worth it!!</li>
            <li> I prefer this over other brushes of its kind because the comb side is metal and helps declump my lashes after applying mascara (be careful, nobody needs to lose an eye) The brush side I just use to help brush in my brow powder and to keep them orderly.</li>
            <li> Not much to say really. The quality is great, just like all the other RealTechniques brushes...</li>
            <li> I like the length of this groomer. It makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> Love it!! ;))) the metal side is easy to use and the color is stylish. Very sleek and makes my eyelashes beautiful</li>
            <li> perfect, and a wonderful value</li>
            <li> I only purchased this product for the lash groomer side, I was always looking for a good quality, metal lash groomer. So for that I LOVE IT. But I took a star away because of the brow groomer side, it is really AWFUL! feels really cheap and the hairs are all over the place. I had cheap brow groomers before that were better looking than that one! It&#x27;s also really big, not fit for precise application.</li>
            <li> I like this product except  It&#x27;s a little sharp at the end and I cut my finger when cleaning it. Other than that it&#x27;s a great makeup gadget.</li>
            <li> I purchased this groomer because of the long handle and the sturdy lash comb. I have used other groomers, but the lash combs never really separate and are made of cheap plastic.They just collect the wet mascara, and glob up on the comb. The Real Techniques lash comb does not do  that. It separates and combs out my lashes after applying mascara. The handle is a nice long one, and the brow groomer does what it is supposed to do. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the groomer is the plastic cover for the lash comb. It is very loose and doesn&#x27;t syay on. It&#x27;s not something  you really need to keep on, but it would be nice, if it would really stay put until you remove it. I do recommend this product,I really like it.</li>
            <li> Everything real techniques is gold. But especially this because a metal comb is the only way to go. Mascara clumps always break plastic combs! or maybe thats just me.....</li>
            <li> I was so glad to have found this brush because its bristles are not encased between plastic pieces that would get in the way if I needed to un-clump my eyelashes, etc. The soft bristles are not too stiff and overall it has met all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick and it arrived with no complications, and came with a plastic case covering the metal side.</li>
            <li> Great product! The mental spikes are sharp so be sure not to loose that plastic covering.</li>
            <li> Except for the length (it is too long to fit into my the make up bag I carry in my purse) this is great.  I snapped off some of the end and wrapped a bit of electrical tape on the end and it fits great!  I love that the comb is metal and that there is a snap on cover to protect it.  No more broken comb tines!  I would have to constantly replace the plastic ones I got in the drug stores because the little comb tines were always breaking.  This is perfect!</li>
            <li> First time using a metal eye lash brush and it makes a huge difference, love it!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this! It has a metal comb on it instead of the plain old plastic comb. It is durable and will definitely last a while.</li>
            <li> I like this lash groomer sadly this is a tool that never works in the way I wish it would, I don&#x27;t use the brush side really, I prefer a spooley to groom my eyebrows but I like the fact that it has a metal comb and that it has a cap.  Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Works so great and shipped very quickly. Combs out any clumps so much better then my old plastic lash comb.</li>
            <li> I LOVE eyelash combs with metal teeth!  Remember the plastic ones with the thick teeth that just seemed to scrap the mascara off and never actually got between eyelashes to separate them?  These are SO MUCH BETTER!  They are sharp, so you always have to use a mirror when using them.  Another important rule:  only clean then using an eyebrow brush…never pull on the teeth with a tissue or you they will eventually come out!  OH, and this is the best price I&#x27;ve seen for a metal comb ($2.97 at the time of this review!).  I don&#x27;t care about the eyebrow brush on this one, because I have my own favorite eyebrow brush already.  I use a really cheap one to clean the metal comb.  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Real Technique brushes are great!  I&#x27;ve bought others to experiment and I always go back to my RT brushes.  They are sturdy, well made, no shedding and clean well.  The lash groomer a is perfect edition!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FOR MY BROWS!  The metal brush is amazing! It really makes a difference when I&#x27;m brushing my lashes after applying mascara and since it&#x27;s metal it&#x27;s sooo much easier to brush.  I recommend this brush and Real Techniques to my friends all the time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations when I purchased it, but I was surprised how good it worked.  I purchased a high end one a couple of years ago and thought that was the best you could buy.  I decided to try this one and loved it!  My eyelashes actually goes thrust the comb and separates the lashes.</li>
            <li> Great price. Impressed with longevity of product, given how much I use/clean it. Best Real Techniques brush I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> IS NOT SO GOOD SORRY...</li>
            <li> I love the lash brow groomer. It works brilliantly. No need in paying for high end brushes when this is just as good or better.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow brush part is not quite stiff enough.</li>
            <li> Good and cheap product. I bought it for the wire lash and use another brush for my brows. This brow brush is too flimsy for my personal preference.</li>
            <li> Brush handle is way longer than it needs to be, and that makes it too large to fit in a small makeup bag. But the brushes work fine.</li>
            <li> I use this lash brow groomer every morning and love it. On one side is the brow groomer and on the other side is a lash groomer to get rid of clumps of mascara and even your lashes out. I have two of these, one in my home makeup bag, and one in my travel bag. Real Techniques makes the best makeup brushes and are the only ones I purchase now!</li>
            <li> You can buy a brow groomer for a lot less money at a drugstore or even a 99-cent store, I think, and it would work just as well. As for the lash comb, I thought I would use it a lot, but I barely do. I guess someone who applies many, many coats of various mascara could use a tool like that. For a person who would only apply two coats or so, that person would be better off just buying a good mascara, in my opinion. (I have bought higher-end mascaras in the past, but I hear great things about Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash, also available at drugstores everywhere.)</li>
            <li> brush too long and sparse&lt;br /&gt;metal comb does not work well compared to other ones I have had&lt;br /&gt;not one I would recommend</li>
            <li> I Highly Recommend everyone try at least 1 Real Techniques Brush .&lt;br /&gt;This Groomer Is the Best 1 out there ..&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars..</li>
            <li> The brush part is very firm, which is perfect for me. I do not like soft brushes for my eyebrows. The metal eyelash comb is great! Very durable product and so inexpensive. Would purchase again. Shipping was fast and well protected in its own case, then bubble wrap in a medium size box. My only recommendation would be to consider not overpacking.</li>
            <li> Love it! I finally ordered this online when the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve purchased from retail stores would keep breaking - those damn cheap plastic teeth...I digress...I am so glad this groomer comes with metal teeth. It is fantastic! Easily washable, makes my lashes and brows very neat. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better, great price, great product. I am thinking about buying a few more and providing as gifts/stocking stuffers. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> barely use it, but the few times i have it&#x27;s pretty good. &#x60;</li>
            <li> The metal comb is great- the brush fell apart a month after purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several of similar product because I have long, full, and curly eyelashes and they tend to twist and weave! specially when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the brow groomer for my full eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I am buying a groomer that I do not know how to keep in my hand so I could see both the lash metal groomers and my eyelashes. The weird angle and the relatively bulkiness of the brow groomer side and the plastic in between these two sides really block your way to see your eyelashes. I poked my eyes a couple of times and still don&#x27;t feel comfortable using it without doing some weird acrobatic things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal seems pretty good quality and it is a decent product, but be careful not to poke your eyes.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely great!....for the first few months. Then it begins to fall apart, either the comb pieces fall out or the bristles fall off.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and very effective. I also really like the deep purple color. I believe this product does what it&#x27;s supposed to and is a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. I like to use the metal side of the comb to brush my eyebrows and prep them before I put on my mascara. I have very bushy eyebrows so this comb makes it extremely easy for me to get them the way I want. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money! Very useful after I apply my mascara, gives a bold finish, no clumps . Highly recommend this one</li>
            <li> Best eyelash separator after mascara!</li>
            <li> For price and quality this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This the PERFECT eyelash comb. Couldn&#x27;t ask for better!</li>
            <li> for my daughter who is very into makeup right now.  She commented 3 times on how good it is - this has never happened before!</li>
            <li> I really like this Lash/Brow Groomer.  Really separates lashes well.  This, however, is my second one (thankfully they are not priced to high).  The first one lost several teeth while I was trying to clean it. :(</li>
            <li> Excellent and useful product!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great quality.  Use it every day with my fiberlash mascara.  Love love love!</li>
            <li> Good value and good quality. Easy to use. Love it!</li>
            <li> All of these real techniques brushes are great. Love that it&#x27;s a metal instead of plastic comb.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. The separater side is little tiny metal teeth, it separates my lashes great.</li>
            <li> I really like this lash groomer. They are hard to find in stores, but this was totally worth it, and the angle is perfect too.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality lash/brow groomer. The lash groomer is made of metal and the teeth don&#x27;t feel like they will break like the cheap plastic ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> Works fine, well made.</li>
            <li> I love this lash/brow groomer. I am collecting the whole Real Techniques set, and am always pleased with the quality of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush, on the brow grooming side has nice sturdy bristles. The bristles are black, and have some purple colored bristles mixed in. I thought this was a cute touch. I have had no problems with loose hairs on this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lash side, is metal, the prongs aren&#x27;t too sharp, and they are sturdy. A little cover for this side is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is some kind of light metal, and the black part has a unique texture. It reminds me of the NYX matte lip creme case texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. And would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very nice!  Pleasantly surprised by the quality of this eyebrow brush.  Glad I bought it ..the guard on the comb part is a bonus!</li>
            <li> I am crazy about the metal comb.  It is so much better than the plastic ones.  Metal is the only way to go.  I have used metal combs for years and wouldn&#x27;t change for anything.  I love the length of the brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush with the realTechniques Starter Set and the Core Collection and I love them all! The handles are brights and colorful in my makeup bag which makes them easy to find on trips. I travel a lot for work and these are great!</li>
            <li> Very nice groomer! Easy to use and clean! And the quality seems to be really good. Also bought a real Techniques Starter Set and very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Great product! Great price! I even bought extra to give and share with my sister and coworker. Best way to have the best lashes! If you have never used a metal tooth comb to separate clumped lashes...what are you waiting for??  This is one of the better quality ones I have used...I tend to misplace things all the time so at this price point it doesn&#x27;t hurt quite as much as losing my $30+ one that was of lesser quality that I purchased from Ulta.</li>
            <li> These eyebrow groomers are really all the same at the top.  This product stands out because of the handle!  It&#x27;s aluminum so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking or snapping.  It&#x27;s also nice and long, and has a cap on the end.</li>
            <li> Works great! Much better than the plastic ones.</li>
            <li> MY wife loves it.  The bristles don&#x27;t break off so that&#x27;s what she likes the most</li>
            <li> I bought this for the eyelash side and love it! I love the metal comb compared to the combs I&#x27;ve purchased in the past with plastic teeth. This one actually combs through my mascara and helps separate my eyelashes. Works best to comb before putting mascara on and then again once the mascara dries. Plus the price is great too!</li>
            <li> Works well. although I haven&#x27;t used the eyelash comb part. It makes me a little nervous to have the metal &amp;#34;spikes&amp;#34; that close to my eyes.</li>
            <li> A must have. Puts all other tools of a similar type to shame. Unlike every other eyelash comb I&#x27;ve used, this one actually gets through the lashes with ease. It is amazing!</li>
            <li> Soft bristle brush and the lash comb is precise.</li>
            <li> I am kind of surprised at the negative  and mixed reviews. At $3 or less you will NEVER find a metal eyelash comb. Even at drug stores you will pay way more and at stores like sephora you will pay 8x as much for one. The metal is sturdy and the brow groomer is synthetic but I haven&#x27;t had issues with it. Mine is not loose and has not fallen apart but at it&#x27;s price you have nothing to lose. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  It&#x27;s as expected.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find a metal lash brush, let alone one at a reasonable price that will not break the bank.  You will NOT be disappointed with this groomer.  The handles are stylish and sleek and it comes with a cover for the lash comb teeth.  LOVE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few combs like these, all with a plastic teeth. And they all worked fine for a few months until the little teeth broke off. SO irritating.&lt;br /&gt;Because this thing has metal teeth, I don&#x27;t see them breaking off as easily (or ever). My prayers have been answered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for brushing eyebrows with the bristle side and getting rid of mascara clumps with the comb side. Real Techniques has yet to disappoint.</li>
            <li> Nice eyebrow brush for the price works  great.</li>
            <li> Good quality and sturdy metal comb.  Had a plastic one previously and the comb completely fell off after several uses.  Strongly recommend as part of your daily beauty routine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and I really like it. The metal lash comb side is covered by a plastic cap which is really easy to misplace. The comb works great though! It helps my lashes look great every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brow bristle side is super stiff. It seems a little bulky too like I could get a little more precision if it was a bit smaller. I still use it though. It gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, It&#x27;s a sturdy little thing and I think I&#x27;ll get lots of use out of it. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
            <li> OMG! You should buy this! It has completely changed my lash game... No clumps, I am going to repeat that, NO CLUMPS at all when I use it! Very sturdy bristles for your brows as well, my only complaint (very minor) is the plastic case that protects the metal side is so narrow that it is very hard to clean out so mine constantly has bits of mascara in it. Now if you don&#x27;t keep it on there then there is no problems at all.</li>
            <li> There is no other like it. Makes my lower lashes look fab, even if my mascara is drying out and getting a little clumpy! The bristly side could be a little stiffer for my tastes (to comb through brows), but I prefer a spoolie for that job anyhow.</li>
            <li> For the price this is amazing. Great quality</li>
            <li> Wanted a metal comb for my eyelashes as the plastic teeth on some are too thick and don&#x27;t separate my lashes. This one is very nice without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li> Big like on the real techniques brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I really like using these brushes and the lash brow groomer is a great addition to my collection.</li>
            <li> Brush is stiff and doesn&#x27;t work as well to smooth my eyebrows as I&#x27;d like. You can get something better than this for a similar price.</li>
            <li> Samantha Chapman is a makeup genus. She has made and entire brush collection that is affordable, well made, great colors, and soft bristles.  I also did not purchase this brush yet with having so much success with the ones I bought early I had to.  The comb part of this brush is medal and is a unique design than most brow groomer brushes</li>
            <li> Nice eyebrow brush and the eyelash comb is perfect</li>
            <li> Another excellent performer from Real Techniques!  The lash groomer has slightly flexible, easy to clean teeth to help separate lashes perfectly or make artful special effects.  The angle of the brow groomer side of the tool, along with the texture of the bristles, makes this tool as easy to use as it is effective.  I also like the little guard that keeps the lash comb clean and safe for storage or transport.</li>
            <li> Great value! The quality of this metal lash brush far exceeded my expectations. Works great and is very durable. I intend to purchase more as gifts for my Younique customers to use with their 3D mascara.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques are the best brushes for your buck!  Love this lash brow groomer.</li>
            <li> I love this! I didn&#x27;t even know there was anything other than plastic bristles. These metal bristles are awesome! They are easier to clean and separate the lashes really well.</li>
            <li> These metal tipped lash separators are very hard to find.  There is no comparison to the plastic products.  I work in theater makeup and know my products.  I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this solely for the lash comb, but the pins are too tight together, making the brush very hard to clean as it gets &amp;#34;clogged&amp;#34; with mascara after a couple uses and won&#x27;t let my lashes slip through the pins. Quite frustrating. Sonia Kashuk used to sell a white lash comb at Target that I purchased in multiples and it was FAR better than this.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Very useful after applying mascara. I use it to separate my lashes. The brush is good for brows too. Good quality construction.</li>
            <li> Awesome tool to have in your makeup collection. It helps with eyelashes and eyebrows. Very well made and adequately priced.</li>
            <li> A little rough of a brush, but it does the trick. It brushes the eyebrows and helps set the hairs on a certain direction, but its not a magic fix at all. The eyelash needles  are hard and I mostly wanted something that would be super soft so that I could brush some of the dandruff-like stuff that I&#x27;ve been getting on my eyelashes. I wash my eyes every morning when I shower but an hour later or so, I always noticed these white flakes all around my eyelashes. So I wanted something that would brush it all out without me pulling my eyelashes out. This thing works well for the eyebrows, although a little too rough, but not great for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This tool works great for separating eyelashes. The trick is to put on mascara, let it dry COMPLETELY (5-10 minutes at least), then put on another coat. Repeat this if desired. Then, comb them out with this little gem, and you will look like you&#x27;re in a mascara commercial! I have people asking me if I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes all night when I go out now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow brush is just OK, but I see it more as a bonus feature to the eyelash comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the only issue is, the metal comb teeth are SHARP. It does come with a plastic cover but I&#x27;ve already lost that thing about 3 times. It&#x27;s just not convenient. Anyway, I had this tool in the zipper pocket of a leather purse. The teeth actually POKED THROUGH the leather bag and then through the dress I was wearing and stabbed me in the side! It was nothing major, but it did break the skin and drew a little blood. It basically felt and looked like a pin prick from a safety pin. Not happy about the little holes in my purse now, so I guess I will need to find some kind of plastic sleeve (like ones for makeup brushes) to put this is from now on.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a metal lash comb and this always got rave reviews, did not disappoint!</li>
            <li> Best lash brow groomer I&#x27;ve ever had. Be careful, if you accidentally poke your eye with the metal lash groomer, ouch!! It&#x27;s no joke. It is wonderful for separating lashes and removing clumps of mascara. The brow brush is big and kinda awkward. I use it every now and then to brush through my eyebrows, but the metal lash separating really gets in the lashes and does great. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, then buy this.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, not many brands make a metal comb, most of them are plastics. Metal comb is way better for combing lashes, separate them very well.</li>
            <li> Love this lash brow groomer. The brush side is nice and sturdy. The comb side is perfect for brows and even eyelashes! I think everyone should own this.</li>
            <li> What makes this lash comb different than others, is that it is metal. This means that it actually works. I looked everywhere for one of these in the store, and they were not to be found under $20. The brush on the other end of this is really full as well, which is great for making sure it grabs every brow hair. I could not be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> The BEST eyelash comb I&#x27;ve ever used. Separated lashes easily. The handle is long enough to give you control. You can disinfect the metal comb with alcohol, and the comb cover prevents accidental finger sticks.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush/comb. I mainly use the last comb &amp; love it! Most last combs are plastic, this one is metal with nicely rounded tips. Plastic combs have thick teeth at the ends making it hard to get even spacing, this one has all the same size teeth, giving you even spaced combing.</li>
            <li> This brow groomer is very nice,it&#x27;s not cheaply made, one side is stainless steal and the other is dense nylon bristles,it&#x27;s great for the eye brows,it&#x27;s a pretty color purple/black design,this is a well made groomer,i would buy this again,and i recommend this groomer to anyone who groomers their eye brows.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. Love this brand! :)</li>
            <li> I like that the comb is metal but I still don&#x27;t feel like it does a great job at separating my lashes. I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect solution...</li>
            <li> This is a handy brush. The bristles brush my lashes smoothly, and the metal teeth on the comb side combs through clumping mascara ans separates my lashes beautifully. It is the same great quality as all of my Real Techniques brushes, and is cruelty free. I liked it so much I ordered a second one for my dressing table, and am going to order a third for my purse.</li>
            <li> Works great, and protector case is handy for travel.  This doesn&#x27;t scratch you like some other plastic ones.</li>
            <li> This was so hard to find, but I am glad I found it. It&#x27;s a necessity for anyone who wears mascara and or false lashes or even for someone with coarse eyebrows that need a good grooming. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this lash comb! It works just like more expensive brands and the metal is much better than the plastic ones. I highly recommend this lash comb. Also, Real Techniques brushes are pretty amazing as well. Their large face brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Exactly as described only issue is that the little plastic cover doesn&#x27;t fit well and falls off every once in a while but other than that it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,Nice things,Works well.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this are really nice quality for the price. The spokes on the opposite end aren&#x27;t plastic they&#x27;re stronger. It&#x27;s really ideal for combing eyebrows. But good for eyelashes as well.</li>
            <li> it was a gift and the receiver loved it.</li>
            <li> Was surprised they worked. Helps me with clumps of mascara on eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush for brows and lashes. I use the metal side to comb out my lashes to keep them from clumping together and the other side is great for grooming my brows.</li>
            <li> I love all of Sam Chapmans brushes I own them all and believe they won&#x27;t disappoint you.  You can watch her on pixiwoo on youtube her and her sister are very talented.</li>
            <li> Really liked these brushes</li>
