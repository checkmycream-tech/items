            <li>Better products on the market</li>
            <li>Love this setting jel.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, my wife is satisfied with the results it gives.</li>
            <li>I love this gel because it never &amp;#34;gums up&amp;#34; on your hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thinning hair, so perfect product for me!&lt;br /&gt;Container, 8.5oz last frover!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>I have wavy, curly, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Light weight,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li>My husband likes this glaze and uses it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I could not find it anywhere locally and was glad to be able to purchase it on line through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am pleased Amazon makes such fine products available nationally.</li>
            <li>It was worth ordering and waiting for.</li>
            <li>but, provides good lift, that lasts pretty long into the day.</li>
            <li>Great hold without feeling overly stiff.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and does not make my hair sticky or heavy, just clean, nice shine,and bouncy.</li>
            <li>shipping was right on time</li>
            <li>Works great with very short hair, and as my hair gets longer, keeps it manageable until the next cut.</li>
            <li>It easily brushes out and leaves your hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly and pretty much invisibly, leaving no residue or flakiness.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was very fast too...</li>
            <li>I love the gel and have used it for several years.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find this locally for many years, and cannot recommend it highly enough.    </li>
            <li>Luckily I had saved my old bottle</li>
            <li>so I have a tendency to not like certain smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product got thin hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Contrary to some reviews - I really really like this glaze.</li>
            <li>but then most of the wet look it gone...</li>
            <li>and it gives my hair body for the whole day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product works great but the dispenser is broken and it appears that the bottle may have been opened before shipping.  </li>
            <li>Most waxes have lots of lanolin and petroleum, and so end up defeating the purpose of trying to get your hair to go in a different direction than it might naturally like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light but strong liquid which, once applied, will either leave your hair exactly where you want it, or, if brushed out after drying, will hold it more or less in the direction you intended without being stiff.</li>
            <li>Gels are similarly heavy and goopy, and really do not have the strength and lightness needed to accomplish the job most elegantly.    </li>
            <li>I have tried the Paul Mitchell product in the past and liked that as well, but that product seems so runny now, seems the ingredients have changed.</li>
            <li>For fine hair, you need something strong but not greasy, because oil and grease will only weigh your hair down and make it fall.</li>
            <li>product is fine but the top was broken when received and company did not offer to replace it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would prefer a little more firmness/hold.</li>
            <li>This new bottle is defective in that it won&#x27;t pump.</li>
            <li>Was using a different product but when back to Scruples when I was running out of a different product and found the Scruples Sculpting Glaze to work better for me.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly and frizzy hair in humid weather.</li>
            <li>Long live Enforce!</li>
            <li>In 3 weeks my hair became alive, rich, thick and shiny.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered this on line, and I ordered 2 (one for me and one for another person) and we both felt that this product had been watered down.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my hair soft and manageable as I like to let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li>Just mess with it gently until it releases..  </li>
            <li>It does a fine job with my thin hair.</li>

            <li> My hair is very fine and thin but with the Scruples Sculpting Glaze, I look like I have lots of thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long curly hair &amp; this product made my hair dry &amp; looked greasy.</li>
            <li> My fine, thin hair grows forward, but my face looks better without a hunk of hair coming down and cutting it in half.</li>
            <li> I apply to damp hair, let air dry a little, then blow dry, and style.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it leaves your hair stiff if you do not use a dryer.</li>

            <li> my hair down.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold like a heavy gel, but it does make my hair look a little wet...</li>
            <li> just a dime size amount or less.</li>
            <li> I had found this product a few years ago but changed hair styles and didn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is short and thin.</li>
            <li> It was not as thick as what I get other places.  </li>
            <li> Very little needed...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a very firm gel this is it,</li>
            <li> and I did have a bit of a problem with the pump, but I think we are trying to make it too hard.</li>
            <li> If you know what Look I mean.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the pump on my bottle is broken.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair body and style without making my hair feel dirty.  </li>
            <li> Have been on chemo for 18 months-luckily did not lose hair but very badly affected.  </li>

            <li> It was worth ordering and waiting for. It&#x27;s the best hair product for the unruly hair i have.  It also reached me during the time alotted. I was pleased.</li>
            <li> I had found this product a few years ago but changed hair styles and didn&#x27;t use it.  Was using a different product but when back to Scruples when I was running out of a different product and found the Scruples Sculpting Glaze to work better for me.  Unforutnately I could not find it anywhere locally and was glad to be able to purchase it on line through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product got thin hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!  Very little needed...just a dime size amount or less. Doesn&#x27;t weigh&lt;br /&gt; my hair down. My hair is short and thin. I don&#x27;t even need&lt;br /&gt;to use hair spray most of the time. If I do use spray...it&#x27;s just a spritz here and there!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Received in timely manner.  Thanks</li>
            <li> product is fine but the top was broken when received and company did not offer to replace it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for curly hair. The only downside is that it leaves your hair stiff if you do not use a dryer.</li>
            <li> I love the gel and have used it for several years.  This new bottle is defective in that it won&#x27;t pump. Luckily I had saved my old bottle</li>
            <li> Product applied after washing hair hair and holds hair in place for quite some time. I have fine, thinning hair, so perfect product for me!&lt;br /&gt;Container, 8.5oz last frover!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this glaze and uses it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Ordered this one by mistake.  It makes my head itch.  Will order another type later.</li>
            <li> This product is good. I would prefer a little more firmness/hold. Does help with frizz. Unfortunately the pump on my bottle is broken.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly and frizzy hair in humid weather. The Scruples enforce sculpting glaze does wonders for my hair. It is light weight and does not make my hair sticky or heavy, just clean, nice shine,and bouncy. I apply to damp hair, let air dry a little, then blow dry, and style.</li>
            <li> Great hold without feeling overly stiff. Used this for years. Still the best!  Item arrived quickly and at an excellent price. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Scruples Enforce Sculpting Glaze works well.  It holds up in humid weather and does not get sticky.</li>
            <li> Contrary to some reviews - I really really like this glaze. I have wavy, curly, fine hair.  It doesn&#x27;t hold like a heavy gel, but it does make my hair look a little wet... If you know what Look I mean.  I can use a pick to pick it out but then most of the wet look it gone... Which I don&#x27;t want because I need it to stay put.  I would buy it again. I wasn&#x27;t real thrilled about the smell but it is growing on me now.  It is not a deal breaker, as some ,might like it. I have allergies so I have a tendency to not like certain smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was right on time and I did have a bit of a problem with the pump, but I think we are trying to make it too hard. Just mess with it gently until it releases..  If you force it I would imagine it would break.  It took me a bit but finally got it and it works just fine.  Yep I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> I have been using Enforce sculpting glaze since the 1980s. For fine hair, you need something strong but not greasy, because oil and grease will only weigh your hair down and make it fall. Most waxes have lots of lanolin and petroleum, and so end up defeating the purpose of trying to get your hair to go in a different direction than it might naturally like. Gels are similarly heavy and goopy, and really do not have the strength and lightness needed to accomplish the job most elegantly.    Enforce is a hair glaze with seems to have no grease or weight. It&#x27;s a very light but strong liquid which, once applied, will either leave your hair exactly where you want it, or, if brushed out after drying, will hold it more or less in the direction you intended without being stiff. My fine, thin hair grows forward, but my face looks better without a hunk of hair coming down and cutting it in half. Even if cut very short, it will only go in the other direction with the help of Enforce.    Works great with very short hair, and as my hair gets longer, keeps it manageable until the next cut. I have not been able to find this locally for many years, and cannot recommend it highly enough.    When traveling, you only need to carry a small amount as a little goes a very long way. Dries quickly and pretty much invisibly, leaving no residue or flakiness.    I am pleased Amazon makes such fine products available nationally. Long live Enforce!</li>
            <li> Have been on chemo for 18 months-luckily did not lose hair but very badly affected.  Hairdresser said use Scruples everytime I wash hair.  In 3 weeks my hair became alive, rich, thick and shiny. Many people thought I had started using a wig! Scruples saved my hair and dignity-Amazon search came through again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.I put it on my hair while it is damp and it gives my hair body for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was very fast too...</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for a couple of years now.  This is the first time I ordered this on line, and I ordered 2 (one for me and one for another person) and we both felt that this product had been watered down.  It was not as thick as what I get other places.  Will not order this on line again.</li>
            <li> Top notch all around!!!</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair &amp; this product made my hair dry &amp; looked greasy. Better products on the market</li>
            <li> I have used the product before and like it a great deal.  It does a fine job with my thin hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a very firm gel this is it,</li>
            <li> Light weight, but, provides good lift, that lasts pretty long into the day. Happy with the product. Plenty of product for the money.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time.</li>
            <li> Love this setting jel.  My hair is very fine and thin but with the Scruples Sculpting Glaze, I look like I have lots of thick hair.  Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to replace a similar one for my wife.  The product works great but the dispenser is broken and it appears that the bottle may have been opened before shipping.  Regardless, my wife is satisfied with the results it gives.</li>
            <li> I love this gel because it never &amp;#34;gums up&amp;#34; on your hair.  It easily brushes out and leaves your hair feeling soft.  I won&#x27;t use any other gel on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have tried the Paul Mitchell product in the past and liked that as well, but that product seems so runny now, seems the ingredients have changed. This product makes my hair soft and manageable as I like to let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one my husband will use!</li>
            <li> pump on bottles ordered do not work.....</li>
            <li> I have been using Scruples for years because my hair stylist recommended it.  It gives my hair body and style without making my hair feel dirty.  In fact, I have stocked up on it just in case it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
