            <li>The smell is so amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look nice but does not do what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>It sneaks nice too.</li>
            <li>I liked Aussie&#x27;s Smoothing Syrup better</li>
            <li>It also has a nice smell, not too strong.  </li>
            <li>It was ok.  </li>
            <li>I love how it smelled</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Dryed out my hair and felt very sticky going on, has a great smell, wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Well it does help with frizzy and smells lovely.</li>
            <li>It works better than salon products that cost over $20.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product</li>
            <li>Wanted to try to find a product without paying a fortune at a salon, but trying all these $5-$9 products I&#x27;m spending just as much-actually more anyways...</li>
            <li>This works great on my little fly away hairs.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely curly too and the curl scrunching gel by &amp;#34;Not Your Mothers&amp;#34; is also an excellent product.</li>
            <li>but it probably should be marketed toward the fine hair folks.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get my hair cut and my biggest fear was that it would be HUGE, so</li>
            <li>I was rating Smooth Moves based on the frizz control factor, it would get 1 star from me.</li>
            <li>which is fantastic</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth trying!</li>
            <li>and I have a shelf full of products I used a couple times and don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I try to spread it out pretty evenly and not use a lot, because it&#x27;s easy to get too much product in parts of your hair</li>
            <li>My hair looks better on the 2nd day than the first!</li>
            <li>-it makes my hair super sticky and I didn&#x27;t use much</li>
            <li>Unlike many products out there this product simply does what it says!</li>
            <li>But because I still think my hair looks pretty when I use it, I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>My hair felt and looked better in terms they shine was back, but the frizz also stayed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily I don&#x27;t mind whether my hair is wavy or straight, and it did get very shiny and soft with lots of volume, so I&#x27;m not disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth it, especially considering how cheap it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give this product a low rating because I am sure it works really well for others, but it just didn&#x27;t serve *</li>
            <li>of my favorite things about this is that you don&#x27;t have to blow dry your hair to make it work.</li>
            <li>It does a good job with keeping hair staright, but it can make hair stiff and gets embarrassing flakes in your hair!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>I use it for both straight and curly (scrunched) styles.  </li>
            <li>It controls frizz, adds texture and get&#x27;s my hair straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will seem greasy.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It will make your hair oily if you use to much.</li>
            <li>have very frizzy and wavy hair.</li>
            <li>but my hair is really prone to split ends</li>
            <li>It came fast, smells</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t do too much for my hair.</li>
            <li>Really tames my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair had a really matte look too it, sticky feel, but still frizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really help me with my frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for a miracle product,</li>
            <li>so I use it along with other products to smooth out the frizz.</li>
            <li>The first product i&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t make my head itch, get oily, and actually did what it was advertised for!</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised by how poofy this made my fine, limp hair after blow drying.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never had a hair product make my hair feel as soft as this stuff</li>
            <li>Wow is all I can say...   </li>
            <li>Smooths out the frizz and helps keep my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair which because brittle very easily</li>
            <li>Not only that, but my hair seems to be even wavier than it normally is.</li>
            <li>This product helps calm down the frizz.</li>
            <li>Way better than the more expensive products I have tried in the past...</li>
            <li>This product acts more like a gel, if you like to brush out your hair the following day, this product is not good for that.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks like I flat ironed it and so soft and silky-</li>
            <li>I actually bought this at my local store, not on Amazon, and it surprised</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead and my hair is naturally only slightly wavy and very frizzy.</li>

            <li> Strange when something works how you cannot find it without going the extra mile yourself!</li>
            <li> This product works well as long as you figure out the proper amount for your hair type</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a long lasting smell too.</li>
            <li> After brushing it out the next day, my hair was extremely dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> If you put it on curly hair, scrunch with hands again when dry.</li>
            <li> I put this on damp hair before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> You can blow dry it too</li>
            <li> I have really dry, frizzy, poofy hair and bought this at a store (not on Amazon) since nothing seems to work</li>
            <li> Only use on wet hair!!</li>
            <li> But it makes my hair feel so dry!</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem where the undersides of my hair dry extremely poofy unless I blow dry them, but I don&#x27;t have time to do that every day.</li>
            <li> terrible combination lol).</li>
            <li> I also have to estimate, so when I didn&#x27;t get the results expected I increased the amount of product I was using.  </li>
            <li> I did blow dry it out after I put the cream on but only just a little!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of other products and none of them  measure up to this one.</li>
            <li> I have long been looking for something to help control the frizz associated with my curls that wouldn&#x27;t make me feel like and oil slick.  </li>
            <li> I have hair down to my waist, so using the recommended amounts of products never works for me.  </li>
            <li> I just have to put a little in</li>
            <li> I have to wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> I actually felt it made the frizz worse.</li>
            <li> Pale skin, frizzy hair (</li>
            <li> I wonder if I will ever find a product that will tame my frizz without ruining my curls or my pocket book?</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work - but it did nothing wahtsoever for getting my hair less frizzy :(</li>
            <li> but it was a little to thick.  </li>
            <li> considering I have thick wavy hair that tends to get frizzy if blow dried.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with hard to control hair like mine.</li>
            <li> This works on my ridiculously curly hair and is so inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed that this product did the opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to, not to mention that it didn&#x27;t help the frizz at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course, curly hair and nothing has ever worked on it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mean the product is a bad product.  </li>
            <li> The days I don&#x27;t wear it my hair is an awful frizzy mess.</li>

            <li> Unlike many products out there this product simply does what it says! I just wish I could purchase this in the box stores. Nobody is carrying it anymore. Strange when something works how you cannot find it without going the extra mile yourself! Thank you Mothers! lol</li>
            <li> It was ok.  I love how it smelled but it was a little to thick.  I liked Aussie&#x27;s Smoothing Syrup better</li>
            <li> This product acts more like a gel, if you like to brush out your hair the following day, this product is not good for that.  After brushing it out the next day, my hair was extremely dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> This product works well as long as you figure out the proper amount for your hair type</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  I use it for both straight and curly (scrunched) styles.  It leaves a nice shine.  If you put it on curly hair, scrunch with hands again when dry.</li>
            <li> I put this on damp hair before I blow dry. It controls frizz, adds texture and get&#x27;s my hair straight and shiny. LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart instead of online, and I have used it for over a month. I absolutely love it! I have thin hair which because brittle very easily but I&#x27;ve never had a hair product make my hair feel as soft as this stuff and I&#x27;ve literally tried everything! This product works wonders plus it smells amazing! If you don&#x27;t have it it&#x27;s worth trying! Just don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will seem greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course, curly hair and nothing has ever worked on it but I bought this today in a local Wal-Mart.    Wow is all I can say...   I didn&#x27;t even have to use my flat iron....  Miracle product.  Oh and it smelled like the beach.  ;o)</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have to wear it everyday. The days I don&#x27;t wear it my hair is an awful frizzy mess. With this hair product I don&#x27;t have to be a slave to the heat iron. You have to buy this stuff. It really works. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work - but it did nothing wahtsoever for getting my hair less frizzy :( I actually felt it made the frizz worse. I tried it three times and will now throw it in the bin.</li>
            <li> This product helps calm down the frizz. But the reason I only gave it four stars is because it always leave the sticky texture to my hair. I personally don&#x27;t like that! But besides that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome price and great shipping. Not Your Mothers&#x27;s Products are the best hair products you can buy.</li>
            <li> It will make your hair oily if you use to much. Fallow the directions. Only use on wet hair!! Smells amazing though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead and my hair is naturally only slightly wavy and very frizzy. When I get out of the shower, I towel-dry my hair and then use about a nickel-sized amount of this product, starting at the tips and working my way up (just like it says to do in the video that the company made for this product). Then I let my hair air-dry. I try to spread it out pretty evenly and not use a lot, because it&#x27;s easy to get too much product in parts of your hair and then it gets crusty and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m not using enough product, or maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer, but this doesn&#x27;t help the frizziness at all. Not only that, but my hair seems to be even wavier than it normally is. Luckily I don&#x27;t mind whether my hair is wavy or straight, and it did get very shiny and soft with lots of volume, so I&#x27;m not disappointed with the results. I&#x27;m just disappointed that this product did the opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to, not to mention that it didn&#x27;t help the frizz at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was rating Smooth Moves based on the frizz control factor, it would get 1 star from me. But because I still think my hair looks pretty when I use it, I gave it 3 stars. It makes my hair look nice but does not do what it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ll probably use up the bottle and then look for something else.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this at my local store, not on Amazon, and it surprised me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very frizzy and wavy hair. Pale skin, frizzy hair (terrible combination lol). I wanted to get my hair cut and my biggest fear was that it would be HUGE, so I bought this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great! Not only does it reduce frizz, but it seems to make it quite a bit straighter too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several things before (salon-quality products) and none has worked as well as this cream does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite things about this is that you don&#x27;t have to blow dry your hair to make it work. Simply apply it to damp hair, comb (I brush) it through, and then you can be done. You can blow dry it too but my hair is really prone to split ends so I try to avoid heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth it, especially considering how cheap it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> This works great on my little fly away hairs. It came fast, smells Amazing! I will be buying again and again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with hard to control hair like mine. I have tried a lot of other products and none of them  measure up to this one. My hair is extremely curly too and the curl scrunching gel by &amp;#34;Not Your Mothers&amp;#34; is also an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Dryed out my hair and felt very sticky going on, has a great smell, wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love it! The first product i&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t make my head itch, get oily, and actually did what it was advertised for! Whoop! My hair looks like I flat ironed it and so soft and silky- which is fantastic considering I have thick wavy hair that tends to get frizzy if blow dried. I did blow dry it out after I put the cream on but only just a little! My hair looks better on the 2nd day than the first! Although I still have some frizzes its like eighty percent better! Way better than the more expensive products I have tried in the past...do not pass this one up!  And how could you, for that price! Just love it!</li>
            <li> Well it does help with frizzy and smells lovely. It&#x27;s a long lasting smell too. But it makes my hair feel so dry! It&#x27;s a feeling that doesnt go away until I let conditioner sit in my hair during my shower routine. Probably would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This product smells great but it really didn&#x27;t do too much for my hair. But it smells awesome so I use it along with other products to smooth out the frizz.</li>
            <li> Gives a good texture to your hair</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem where the undersides of my hair dry extremely poofy unless I blow dry them, but I don&#x27;t have time to do that every day. This works GREAT in my hair! I just have to put a little in after I shower and my hair drys flat, and even a little straighter than it normally does. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I would never have purchased this product but my mom made me try it and I was pleasantly surprised by how poofy this made my fine, limp hair after blow drying. Smooth Moves is a really great product but it probably should be marketed toward the fine hair folks.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Really tames my hair. It sneaks nice too.</li>
            <li> I have long been looking for something to help control the frizz associated with my curls that wouldn&#x27;t make me feel like and oil slick.  This did not help with the frizz, but did take the shine out of my hair.  My hair had a really matte look too it, sticky feel, but still frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have hair down to my waist, so using the recommended amounts of products never works for me.  I also have to estimate, so when I didn&#x27;t get the results expected I increased the amount of product I was using.  My hair became even more stiff, sticky, and dull looking.  So I lessened the amount of product I was using, thinking maybe I was over estimating my needs.  My hair felt and looked better in terms they shine was back, but the frizz also stayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...I am on to try yet another product.  I didn&#x27;t give this product a low rating because I am sure it works really well for others, but it just didn&#x27;t serve *my* needs.  It doesn&#x27;t mean the product is a bad product.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with curly hair.  I wonder if I will ever find a product that will tame my frizz without ruining my curls or my pocket book?</li>
            <li> This works on my ridiculously curly hair and is so inexpensive.  It works better than salon products that cost over $20.  I was amazed.</li>
            <li> The smell is so amazing and I love the packaging! It does a good job with keeping hair staright, but it can make hair stiff and gets embarrassing flakes in your hair!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  However, this is twice the price you pay anywhere else.  Highway robbery anyone?</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product! Smooths out the frizz and helps keep my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product but it didn&#x27;t really help me with my frizzy curly hair. So it&#x27;s just eh</li>
            <li> I have really dry, frizzy, poofy hair and bought this at a store (not on Amazon) since nothing seems to work figured I would give it a try since it smelled good. I was really hoping for a miracle product, no such luck-it makes my hair super sticky and I didn&#x27;t use much so that&#x27;s not the problem. Wanted to try to find a product without paying a fortune at a salon, but trying all these $5-$9 products I&#x27;m spending just as much-actually more anyways...and I have a shelf full of products I used a couple times and don&#x27;t work. Boo</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair look great!  It also has a nice smell, not too strong.  I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
