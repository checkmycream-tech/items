            <li>Great lotion if you are looking for a lot of tingle.</li>
            <li>I love this tingler!!</li>
            <li>I have used slot of lotions with this brand and they always seemed to work good except for this one.</li>
            <li>Very light and smells great.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this lotion!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is a great tingle lotion that is very mild.  </li>
            <li>:) good stuff</li>
            <li>but I liked it.</li>
            <li>This lotion had a pleasant smell and texture as well as a light bronzer.  </li>
            <li>This is a great tingle lotion, definitely has some &amp;#34; HEAT &amp;#34; to it and as well as a bronzer, which I love!!</li>
            <li>very light which from the T4 level I already knew.</li>
            <li>Very light tingle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my favorite bronzer</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wipe your hands off well after applying and rub it in well.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this</li>
            <li>I have gotten some pretty good results with this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Good for a first time tingle lotion</li>
            <li>This mild heat is nice.</li>
            <li>I applied to to all areas of my body EXCEPT my face and before I had applied it to my entire body, the lotion was working, giving me a warm pleasant sensation.  </li>
            <li>was excited when was able to get on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong one</li>
            <li>but I think this would work great for people who are trying to climb the tingle later</li>
            <li>Pretty good tanning lotion, I like the tingle but to me this wasnt as hot as others I have had.</li>
            <li>About an hour passed and the warm tingling sensation faded completely and I noticed I was about 3 shades darker and more golden then ever.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I used this immediately before I got into the Super bed and went the full 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and works amazing, gives wonderful bronze color once the red goes down.</li>
            <li>Less trips and time in the salon means more time out enjoying summer!</li>
            <li>Product was sealed and I received it really fast, thank you!!</li>
            <li>I guess some haven&#x27;t had it explained to them that the point of a tingler is to increase circulation to your skin so when you are in the bed your skin can tan more easily with pores open.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how much darker i was the very first time i used this lotion!</li>
            <li>EVERYBODY tells me how dark I am and such a rich beautiful color thanks to this.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it said its tinglr and u brown</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Love Australian gold products and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>and I was such a rich golden brown color it lasted all week!</li>
            <li>and I have tried MANY different lotions as I am an avid tanner.</li>
            <li>Used this 2 times, i love tingle lotion, but this one made me feel like fire ants were all over me, even after a shower i was still itchy and had red blotches on me.</li>
            <li>Great stuff this Web site sucks making me submit a certain amount of letters</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend that you rotate lotions so your body doesn&#x27;t adjust to this mild tingle lotion as fast.</li>
            <li>However, this one isn&#x27;t quite that intense, until after the tan.  </li>
            <li>It arrived with no spills, and very time;y.</li>
            <li>The lady that owns the tanning salon raves about how dark I am and that my lotions smell better than anyone else;s</li>
            <li>An also gets you dark :)</li>
            <li>I love how this lotion cuts down on my tanning time and trips to the salon.  </li>
            <li>I have used this twice in a row and only tanned twice that week in a super bed for 20 minutes each time</li>
            <li>I am the one in the stores that actually looks at the fine print on the back.</li>
            <li>Other reviews were accurate that I read before purchasing</li>
            <li>If you want to see a difference I recommend Australian Gold Classic Sydney T4 Tingle Bronzer Tanning Lotion!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lotion- light brown color, is averagely moisturizing, and spreads well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cost was EXTREMELY cheap compared to salons who mark their products up at least three times as much, delivery time was fast (received it in 2 days with Prime shipping), was sealed in a package, and was a brand I trust.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>When I got this lotion, I was just as excited as any other Australian Gold product I had used and was dying to find out how well this worked.  </li>
            <li>When I was done tanning the initial tingle redness lasted about 30 minutes then fades to my normal color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gave me quick tan results with a little tingle but not a lot would buy again</li>
            <li>I normally do not use tingle lotions but decided to use it again the next day in a different super bed with a high facial unit for 20 minutes and guess what?  </li>
            <li>My only gripe is the lotion wasn&#x27;t as hot as expected</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but instead, when I got out of the super bed after one application I was noticeably dark and my skin was a little flushed.  </li>
            <li> Even though I was disappointed with the tingle, I&#x27;m very pleased with the result in color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no more intense than Pink Diamond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However...  </li>
            <li> And it has a strange smell to it..</li>
            <li> BUT it did a FANTASTIC job turning me at least half a dozen shades darker in TWO uses!!</li>
            <li> but for being a tingle I expected a little bit more.this product uses natural Bronzers that don&#x27;t streak but wash off in</li>
            <li> Alright, but not hot enough for me.</li>
            <li> and I wish the product got a little hotter since I have gotten use to the tingle shortly after I started using this lotion.  </li>
            <li> This is not a very hot tingle at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s blown the Pink Diamond out of the water with color.  </li>
            <li> Not much tingle</li>
            <li> naturally I thought that my base tan was pretty solid.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the initial application</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an apple type scent but not fresh like how AG Risqué Ritual is.</li>
            <li> He couldn&#x27;t quit telling me how dark I was</li>
            <li> And still cheaper on amazon for this bottle than in any other tanning place you can find!</li>
            <li> If you want a more expensive tingle that will set you on fire that would be Mood or Bombshell or the worse tingle of them all Goddess!</li>
            <li> but I like it a little bit stronger of a tingle</li>
            <li> Very dark after about a week&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> The other day I was helping her stretch after she had exercised and tanned and the areas that touched her soon began to turn blood red and itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning since March at least twice a week for my wedding in October, so</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, because I&#x27;ve used tingles in the past.  </li>
            <li> but there is a waiting game involved depending on your skin type.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use tingle, but this one is not as bad as some of the others.</li>
            <li> Gives you that extra color boost you crave after getting a base tan!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy over the smell and my results weren&#x27;t what I was expecting</li>
            <li> Stupid</li>
            <li> and I hate it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with it</li>
            <li> YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED BY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product does exactly what it said its tinglr and u brown easily I&#x27;ve only laid three times and I&#x27;m already tan and I received the product in 2 days</li>
            <li> I have been tanning since March at least twice a week for my wedding in October, so naturally I thought that my base tan was pretty solid. Judging from my results, that was not the case. I am extremely red and quite possibly burned from this product. It is misrepresented and should be taken off the shelves if this is what it does to someones skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this four stars!  This is not a very hot tingle at all. If you want a more expensive tingle that will set you on fire that would be Mood or Bombshell or the worse tingle of them all Goddess! Hottest tingle ever made! This mild heat is nice. It heats up but does not set you on fire! And for the price you can&#x27;t beat This at all! Under twenty for this! And still cheaper on amazon for this bottle than in any other tanning place you can find!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and works amazing, gives wonderful bronze color once the red goes down.</li>
            <li> Really happy with the results. Tingle on a scale from 1 to 10 is a 2.</li>
            <li> Great stuff this Web site sucks making me submit a certain amount of letters why can&#x27;t I say what u want to say or say nothing at all. Stupid</li>
            <li> Do not apply on face or neck. Moderate tingle, like it. Don&#x27;t plan going somewhere in 3-4 hours after tan: pomodoro color makes you extra-visible)))</li>
            <li> Scent- it&#x27;s an apple type scent but not fresh like how AG Risqué Ritual is. It almost smells like a car freshener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion- light brown color, is averagely moisturizing, and spreads well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tingle- very light which from the T4 level I already knew. I felt it on the back of my neck and on the backs of my arm but that was it. When I was done tanning the initial tingle redness lasted about 30 minutes then fades to my normal color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color boost- it was there but for being a tingle I expected a little bit more.this product uses natural Bronzers that don&#x27;t streak but wash off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all- 3/5. I wasn&#x27;t crazy over the smell and my results weren&#x27;t what I was expecting but I think this would work great for people who are trying to climb the tingle later</li>
            <li> It gave me quick tan results with a little tingle but not a lot would buy again</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product!!! Defiantly feel the tingle!!! Other reviews were accurate that I read before purchasing&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite bronzer</li>
            <li> I guess some haven&#x27;t had it explained to them that the point of a tingler is to increase circulation to your skin so when you are in the bed your skin can tan more easily with pores open. This is not recommended for the face however (no tingler is recommended for face) because think of it this way it would be like spraying yourself in the face mace... But it does say on the package not recommended for the face. That being said this is for body only. It will get you to the color you want to be but there is a waiting game involved depending on your skin type. (Tingling didn&#x27;t wear off until 2 hours later for me) so likely your skin will be red &amp; goosebumpy for a while you won&#x27;t see the brown color until the tingling has subsided.  I love the ingredients. I don&#x27;t just buy lotions for smell I am the one in the stores that actually looks at the fine print on the back. :) good stuff</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Very light tingle. I alternated he Cheeky Brown because I wanted the benefit of them both. I have the best tan after just 13 sessions over the course of a month. The lady that owns the tanning salon raves about how dark I am and that my lotions smell better than anyone else;s</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use tingle, but this one is not as bad as some of the others.</li>
            <li> Love Australian gold products and this one is no exception. Couldn&#x27;t find at local tanning places so was excited when was able to get on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff for my wife and she likes it but I have been itching sporadically for weeks and couldn&#x27;t figure out why. The other day I was helping her stretch after she had exercised and tanned and the areas that touched her soon began to turn blood red and itch like crazy. This stuff is the devil and I hate it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion!  This is a great tingle lotion that is very mild.  I do not like tingle lotions but I had hit my tanning plateau and wanted to reach the next level.  When I got this lotion, I was just as excited as any other Australian Gold product I had used and was dying to find out how well this worked.  The cost was EXTREMELY cheap compared to salons who mark their products up at least three times as much, delivery time was fast (received it in 2 days with Prime shipping), was sealed in a package, and was a brand I trust.  I used this immediately before I got into the Super bed and went the full 20 minutes.  This lotion had a pleasant smell and texture as well as a light bronzer.  I applied to to all areas of my body EXCEPT my face and before I had applied it to my entire body, the lotion was working, giving me a warm pleasant sensation.  This lotion has a Tingle Factor of 4 which is basically for people who are starting out with tingles.  I did not burn but instead, when I got out of the super bed after one application I was noticeably dark and my skin was a little flushed.  About an hour passed and the warm tingling sensation faded completely and I noticed I was about 3 shades darker and more golden then ever.  It did not leave me orange nor did it streak.  Make sure you wipe your hands off well after applying and rub it in well.  I normally do not use tingle lotions but decided to use it again the next day in a different super bed with a high facial unit for 20 minutes and guess what?  I came out even darker then before!! I have used this twice in a row and only tanned twice that week in a super bed for 20 minutes each time and I was such a rich golden brown color it lasted all week! I love how this lotion cuts down on my tanning time and trips to the salon.  EVERYBODY tells me how dark I am and such a rich beautiful color thanks to this.  My fiancee came home later after using this product for the second time in a row and his mouth feel open! He couldn&#x27;t quit telling me how dark I was and he too has started using this product and is experiencing beautiful color.  Less trips and time in the salon means more time out enjoying summer! This product is a must have and I have tried MANY different lotions as I am an avid tanner. I gave this product 5 stars and I wish the product got a little hotter since I have gotten use to the tingle shortly after I started using this lotion.  My only gripe is the lotion wasn&#x27;t as hot as expected BUT it did a FANTASTIC job turning me at least half a dozen shades darker in TWO uses!! YES DARKER!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED BY THIS PRODUCT!!! I also highly recommend that you rotate lotions so your body doesn&#x27;t adjust to this mild tingle lotion as fast.</li>
            <li> I love this tingler!! It&#x27;s a strong one so be carful! Definitely worth the money! An u will still be tingling up to a hour or so later! An also gets you dark :)</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, because I&#x27;ve used tingles in the past.  However, this one isn&#x27;t quite that intense, until after the tan.  It&#x27;s no more intense than Pink Diamond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However...  Even though I was disappointed with the tingle, I&#x27;m very pleased with the result in color.  Very dark after about a week&#x27;s use.  It&#x27;s blown the Pink Diamond out of the water with color.  I will be ordering more of this</li>
            <li> Alright, but not hot enough for me.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s heated be prepared for your skin to feel like it&#x27;s burning. Once you get past the initial application it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> This is a great tingle lotion, definitely has some &amp;#34; HEAT &amp;#34; to it and as well as a bronzer, which I love!! Gives you that extra color boost you crave after getting a base tan! Delicious &amp;#34; APPLE &amp;#34; scent, smells fabulous!! Product was sealed and I received it really fast, thank you!!</li>
            <li> I have gotten some pretty good results with this lotion.  Would definitely recommend to others. It arrived with no spills, and very time;y.</li>
            <li> Pretty good tanning lotion, I like the tingle but to me this wasnt as hot as others I have had.</li>
            <li> my husband use this one it didnt work for him</li>
            <li> I have used slot of lotions with this brand and they always seemed to work good except for this one. I was very disappointed with it and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using it. And it has a strange smell to it.. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this To anyone. If you want to see a difference I recommend Australian Gold Classic Sydney T4 Tingle Bronzer Tanning Lotion!! I love it!</li>
            <li> Good for a first time tingle lotion but I like it a little bit stronger of a tingle</li>
            <li> Very light and smells great.  I can tell that there is a bronzer in it.  When I apply my skin turns a brown imidiately.  I mix it with the Aussy Tingle Bronzer and works great!</li>
            <li> Used this 2 times, i love tingle lotion, but this one made me feel like fire ants were all over me, even after a shower i was still itchy and had red blotches on me.</li>
            <li> Not much tingle but I liked it.</li>
            <li> If you like tingle this lotion is for you. The Apple smell is great! I could not believe how much darker i was the very first time i used this lotion! WOW.</li>
            <li> Great lotion if you are looking for a lot of tingle.</li>
