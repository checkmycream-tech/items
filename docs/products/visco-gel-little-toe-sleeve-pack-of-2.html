    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to have bought and use it with all my shoes</li>
            <li>and it works perfect</li>
            <li>otherwise, everything else is perfect.  </li>
            <li>This is a great solution to protect that skin.</li>
            <li>I find these, and the gel toe separators, a great help.</li>
            <li>not as great as I hoped</li>
            <li>They have been a great help.</li>
            <li>They would be good if you could get them to stay put while running.</li>
            <li>I was more than happy to find this product again.</li>
            <li>If I was walking, they would be great, as they fit on my pinky toes, but I need them when playing soccer.  </li>
            <li>It will move on its own</li>
            <li>it is very easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li>It is a great protection to avoid a very sore toe!</li>
            <li>But it is very comfortable and does help cushion my corns.</li>
            <li>My toe hurt more with them than without.  </li>
            <li>Product is just okay</li>
            <li>My son stated that it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Love Love .</li>
            <li>They are good but they stretch out fast and then slide off your toe.</li>
            <li>Perfect prevents the little toe on my rt foot from chafing and blistering.</li>
            <li>Great helper for my 4th toe, fits very well, it&#x27;s like a band aid but without slipping away, one doesn&#x27;t feel like using anything because it doesn&#x27;t use any room more that your own toe</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re pretty cheap</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>My toes are annoyingly short, so even though I do my best to find nice wide comfy shoes the toe tips tend to rub against each other when I walk.</li>
            <li>A podiatrist recommended a way to tape my 2nd toe, but these cushions work better.</li>
            <li>Your shoes should be a lot bigger or the sleeve will hurt more than the shoe alone..</li>
            <li>It gives more protection than a band aid, but I would say it&#x27;s only a temporary solution.</li>
            <li>As a nurse working on my feet, for more than 12 hours a day several days a week, all I can say is yeah!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try them immediately, and if they work as well, I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>Wearing these gel toe sleeves really helps.  </li>
            <li>These work very well for running.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t help my pinky toe as much as I thought slipped off a bit too often</li>
            <li>really have doubt on the durability of the product.</li>
            <li>It works just as hoped - protects baby toe from adjoining toe very well.  </li>
            <li>and it fits well, comfortable and actually stays on my toe while running</li>
            <li>These have worked well the first handful of times, but now the material has worn down significantly that while I&#x27;m wearing this, it will roll up and not cushion in between the toes as well.</li>
            <li>I love these if I have a shoe that is pinching my little toe.</li>
            <li>I mainly use these because my pinky toe on my right foot is constantly poking into the neighbor toe which has now created a sore blistery spot.</li>
            <li>it has been very helpful, it relieves the pain considerably.</li>
            <li>but, after all it is old and very used.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly the same as the one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The only down side was that I had to go through several sets, because the material stretches out at body temperature, and the sleeves don&#x27;t stay on if they are worn for more than about three days.</li>
            <li>I bought it because my little toe used to always rub against all of my new shoes they feel funny and come off</li>
            <li>I had two left about 6 months ago, but now I&#x27;m down to only one and it is pretty old and tends to come off my toe now,</li>
            <li>Too little for too much money.</li>

            <li> I ordered these to wear with one pair of ballerina flats that squeezed my little toe.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Serves its purpose, but slides up and off my toe and I sometimes have to take off my shoe and re-position it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.  My toe hurt more with them than without.  They provide no protection for existing corns or callouses.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to wear with one pair of ballerina flats that squeezed my little toe.  Wearing these gel toe sleeves really helps.  At the end of the day, my toes still feel a bit sore, but nothing like before.</li>
            <li> Way too big for my size 9 women little toe - totally useless for me. Suggest you schlepp yourself to a specialty shoe or drug store for this product so you know what you&#x27;re getting will actually work for you</li>
            <li> These are lifesavers for me. A podiatrist recommended a way to tape my 2nd toe, but these cushions work better. I am thankful I found them through Amazon since I can no longer find them in local stores.</li>
            <li> These work very well for running. I have a problem where my little toe tends to push into the next toe causing blisters and callouses. This is a great solution to protect that skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my pinky toe as much as I thought slipped off a bit too often</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that the sleeve didn&#x27;t work because it kept rolling up and moving off of the spot on my toe that I wanted it to protect.</li>
            <li> I love these if I have a shoe that is pinching my little toe. It is a great protection to avoid a very sore toe! My foot doctor approves!</li>
            <li> It is waist of money&lt;br /&gt;Does not protect the toe in any way Does not aleviate the toe pain .</li>
            <li> I have a deformed little toe and have also broken it twice. This helps separate it from the next toe.</li>
            <li> The won&#x27;t stay on my toes.</li>
            <li> I have not used these yet so I can&#x27;t review. I gave it a 3 because I can&#x27;t just push it on my toe with my fingers.  Which means someone else will have to put it on my toe when I need it.</li>
            <li> My toes are annoyingly short, so even though I do my best to find nice wide comfy shoes the toe tips tend to rub against each other when I walk. I find these, and the gel toe separators, a great help.</li>
            <li> Great helper for my 4th toe, fits very well, it&#x27;s like a band aid but without slipping away, one doesn&#x27;t feel like using anything because it doesn&#x27;t use any room more that your own toe but no more pain. Of course it&#x27;s washable. I&#x27;m very happy to have bought and use it with all my shoes</li>
            <li> Your shoes should be a lot bigger or the sleeve will hurt more than the shoe alone..</li>
            <li> I returned the item and, to date, was not credited for it.  Insa Kipping[[ASIN:B004G8HSCA Pedifix Visco-gel Little Toe Sleeves, 2-Count (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> These do what they claim to do, but they didn&#x27;t work for my purposes.  If I was walking, they would be great, as they fit on my pinky toes, but I need them when playing soccer.  When I play they slide around and I still feel my blisters.  I tried some tape with them, but that still didn&#x27;t work.  They would be good if you could get them to stay put while running.</li>
            <li> Product is just okay .The body of the sleeves are distorted.&lt;br /&gt;I really have doubt on the durability of the product.</li>
            <li> No problem with order.</li>
            <li> I mainly use these because my pinky toe on my right foot is constantly poking into the neighbor toe which has now created a sore blistery spot. These have worked well the first handful of times, but now the material has worn down significantly that while I&#x27;m wearing this, it will roll up and not cushion in between the toes as well. It will move on its own and then I have to adjust it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these though because it will help ease the pain unless it moves. It gives more protection than a band aid, but I would say it&#x27;s only a temporary solution.</li>
            <li> not as great as I hoped</li>
            <li> Virtually clear even on dark skin. The only issue is it sometimes creeps up the toe and depending on the shoe it might fall off your toe without realizing it. But it is very comfortable and does help cushion my corns.</li>
            <li> They are good but they stretch out fast and then slide off your toe.</li>
            <li> I use these on my outer toes when I wear narrow shoes like heels or cowboy boots (Size 7). My toes used to hurt on the sides but when I wear these, it&#x27;s not even an issue. And they&#x27;re pretty cheap so it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> it is brittle and breaks in pocket!!!.. not worth the money at all in my opinion</li>
            <li> My son stated that it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> These were lifesavers when I had to protect and separate my toes for an extended period.  The only down side was that I had to go through several sets, because the material stretches out at body temperature, and the sleeves don&#x27;t stay on if they are worn for more than about three days.</li>
            <li> It works just as hoped - protects baby toe from adjoining toe very well.  I would buy the product again.</li>
            <li> i actually use these on my toe that is next to my little toe and it fits well, comfortable and actually stays on my toe while running</li>
            <li> Too difficult to keep on toe.  Plastic not suitable for comfort.</li>
            <li> it has been very helpful, it relieves the pain considerably. it is very easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product sometime ago, but not sure where I found it. I purchased a total of four but over the time I&#x27;ve had them which is probably approx. 2 years, I seem to lose them one by one. I had two left about 6 months ago, but now I&#x27;m down to only one and it is pretty old and tends to come off my toe now, but, after all it is old and very used.  They have been a great help. I was more than happy to find this product again. My little toe and the toe next to it on my right foot seem to get pushed together and causes painful calluses on my little toe. As a nurse working on my feet, for more than 12 hours a day several days a week, all I can say is yeah! I&#x27;ve looked for these for some time now and was afraid I was going to have to find a substitute. These are exactly the same as the one&#x27;s I had before, and I hope they work as well and as long. I&#x27;m going to try them immediately, and if they work as well, I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> Love Love . I wear these on the 4th toe of each foot. I gave worn with strappy sandals and closed toe shoes.</li>
            <li> I am on my feet all the time.  I did not put this on the little toe, but the one next to it and it works perfect</li>
            <li> I bought it because my little toe used to always rub against all of my new shoes they feel funny and come off</li>
            <li> Worked well to prevent blisters.</li>
            <li> too short for my little toe (1 1/4 in long).  otherwise, everything else is perfect.  total length is 3/4 in., taper from 1/2 to 9/16 in. ID, wall thickness of ~1/16 in.</li>
            <li> Perfect prevents the little toe on my rt foot from chafing and blistering. Very thin barely notice that its there.</li>
            <li> Too little for too much money.</li>
