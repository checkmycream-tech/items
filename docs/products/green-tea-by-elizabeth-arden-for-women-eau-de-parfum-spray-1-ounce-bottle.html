            <li>It arrived in perfect shape and very quickly.</li>

            <li>This fragrance is light and refreshing and a wonderful summer scent.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>you,&lt;br /&gt;Native Rose</li>
            <li>I love it and will order again .&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Have used this fragrance for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Could not be more pleased :-)</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume which is light and nice</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance, it has a nice light clean smell.</li>
            <li>This is a nice light clean scent for daywear .</li>
            <li>On me, after a while, it turns into a bit more floral, still light, but sweeter.  </li>
            <li>Love this light Spring/Summer fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Easy for gift too.  </li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>Great present for moms and grandma&#x27;s around the holidays.</li>
            <li>I suppose I really use it more for aromatherapy than I do most scents.</li>
            <li>Light and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh scent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, and</li>
            <li>The intensity of the scent is just right; not too overwhelming and you still smell fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Light fresh.  </li>
            <li>this is exactly what I expected got package in great condition</li>
            <li>Which makes me wonder how the Post Office lets them ship it in the first place!</li>
            <li>Such a light and refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li>The order came in right on time and my mother in-law loves it.</li>
            <li>fresh.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not my favorite scent to wear out if I want compliments, and it&#x27;s not a big man pleaser -</li>
            <li>It seems to be a fragrance that really depends on one&#x27;s body</li>
            <li>When you want a gentle, spring scent, this is the one and price doesn&#x27;t break the bank.  </li>
            <li>but what it is great for is to keep by my desk for a scent wake up.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is energizing and seems to help me concentrate, and it doesn&#x27;t last long, so it&#x27;s not a big deal to get a spray a couple of times a day.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate that in this particular fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and a little citrusy.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too bad--a little too sweet but not very green tea-ish.</li>
            <li>This scent is very light, and not that complex, it&#x27;s mainly a green tea with citrus tones.  </li>

            <li> This is a nice light clean scent for daywear . I love it and will order again .&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Native Rose</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh scent! Love it</li>
            <li> Such a light and refreshing fragrance. Good value for this product and shipping was on time as promised. Will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, it has a nice light clean smell.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is light and refreshing and a wonderful summer scent.  Kept mine in the refrigerator and gave myself a squirt when I needed to be refreshed.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad--a little too sweet but not very green tea-ish. The worst part is it broke me out and I can&#x27;t return it! Be very careful before you order any thing like this as Amazon considers it a fire hazard and you can&#x27;t return it. Which makes me wonder how the Post Office lets them ship it in the first place! Frankly, I will never order anything like this again if it can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> This scent is very light, and not that complex, it&#x27;s mainly a green tea with citrus tones.  It&#x27;s clean, and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not my favorite scent to wear out if I want compliments, and it&#x27;s not a big man pleaser - but what it is great for is to keep by my desk for a scent wake up.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is energizing and seems to help me concentrate, and it doesn&#x27;t last long, so it&#x27;s not a big deal to get a spray a couple of times a day.  On me, after a while, it turns into a bit more floral, still light, but sweeter.  My mother could not wear it all though; and neither can my sister.  It seems to be a fragrance that really depends on one&#x27;s body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;It does not last long.  I appreciate that in this particular fragrance.  Sometimes I might pick up a different scent to use later on in the day, and it doesn&#x27;t affect it.  I suppose I really use it more for aromatherapy than I do most scents.</li>
            <li> Have used this fragrance for many years.  Love this light Spring/Summer fragrance.  It does not,  however stay with you for long period of time,,, it needs to be refreshed in just a couple hours.</li>
            <li> When you want a gentle, spring scent, this is the one and price doesn&#x27;t break the bank.  Try it and you&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I expected got package in great condition this is the perfect gift item.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> Light and clean smelling. Love it</li>
            <li> Perfect size bottle, easily fits in my purse. This is a wonderful day time fragrance! It arrived in perfect shape and very quickly.</li>

            <li> I think this scented splash is perfect for the summer. It&#x27;s clean and a little citrusy.

The 1-Ounce is the perfect size to get me through the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was also impeccable. Could not be more pleased :-)</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I suspect its a knock off. The bottle was smaller than I thought it would be and the smell is not like how I use to remember it.</li>
            <li> Easy for gift too.  Light fresh.  Easy.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume which is light and nice</li>
            <li> Wonderful, refreshing scent--not overpowering. I wear it occasionally (casually) when I want a different scent from my usual favorite perfume fragrances.</li>
