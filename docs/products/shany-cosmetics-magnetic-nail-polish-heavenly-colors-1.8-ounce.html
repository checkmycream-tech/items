            <li>I loved this!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a beautiful brand of polish</li>
            <li>To my surprise, the pattern came out beautifully, the longer you leave the magnet hovered (in any angle)</li>
            <li>He colors are beautiful.  </li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s really happy now.</li>
            <li>However, even without the magnetic designs the polish itself is a great cover coat.</li>
            <li>Great deal, and product.</li>
            <li>Great price for six magnetic nail polishes.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>where else can you find nail polish with great quality for almost $1 ?</li>
            <li>This nail polish set is great.  </li>
            <li>I have some Sally Hanson and the effect is great.</li>
            <li>I just love it!!</li>
            <li>it works wonderfully and easily!</li>
            <li>Awesome color selection, many magnet designs.</li>
            <li>All good, my wife is happy with these . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li>The polish goes on real smooth and they are beautiful shades.  </li>
            <li>works great and looks amazing.....</li>
            <li>Good color selections.</li>
            <li>The bottles are good size</li>
            <li>The daughtres loved it....</li>
            <li>I bought this for both my wife and my sister in law for Christmas and they loved it.  </li>
            <li>The polish is very smooth, goes on beautifully and the magnets work if you follow directions . . .  </li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t know how this works, what you do is paint your nails with the beautiful nail polish that is in the kit, then you hold the magnet of your choice over your nail an</li>
            <li>She was very pleased with the color selections.</li>
            <li>Each time it gets easier, and you get a bit more daring!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first Shany product and I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>I love these nail polishes!</li>
            <li>love them!</li>
            <li>I love this set!</li>
            <li>Excellent quality and super cute colors.</li>
            <li>I already own this and bought it as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li>Nice colors and magnet designs.</li>
            <li>All of the colors are nice.  </li>
            <li>The polish goes on smooth and the magnets work perfectly to make fun designs.  </li>
            <li>i love it so elegent nice colour</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying the Sally Hanson kind.</li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve found so far for the magnetic is Sally Hansen...</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>Price  is  great, colors are so pretty  </li>
            <li>SO ITS A GOOD WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU LIKE BEFORE BUYING FULL SIZE SETS.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even bother with a top coat since I wasn&#x27;t really happy with my first attempt</li>
            <li>I am able to get a design with magnets not included with this set.</li>
            <li>Depending on the design you will be able to see the design forming if you peek in from the side.</li>
            <li>The polish has designs that are brought to the top surface of the polished nail, using the magnetic bottle cover.  </li>
            <li>It takes some practice and patience to make this work, but your efforts will be paid off with interesting nail designs.</li>
            <li>Tried to coat on top of the polish, but it would ruin the magnetic design.</li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the magnets fall out of the cap and can ruin your nails as your trying to make the pattern.</li>
            <li>PLEASE FOR THE LOVE</li>
            <li>Overall very good product!</li>
            <li>Then top coat.</li>
            <li>I put some top coat over it for my pedicure and it lasted despite wearing work shoes all week</li>
            <li>such a great deal !</li>
            <li>LOVE THE COLORS</li>
            <li>The one redeeming quality however, was the color.</li>
            <li>Love the patterns.</li>
            <li>hope this helps. :)</li>
            <li>Very beautiful colors, though the red is more of a brownish color.</li>
            <li>nail polish has more colors than Sally Hansen,however Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail polish has a more distinctive magnetic nail polish than SHANY&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to get the hang of it immediately.....</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get the polish to make the design on the top of the lid.</li>
            <li>I love these nail colors.</li>
            <li>Love magnetic nail polish as well as SHANY so this was a no brainer for me.</li>
            <li>I love these colors and the fact that they are magnetic just adds to it.</li>
            <li>This is way better than the overpriced brands in the stores.  </li>
            <li>A better price per bottle with design options.  </li>
            <li>I seem to have better results with some pattern magnets I purchased separately.</li>
            <li>I Love the colors, the designs are fun!!</li>
            <li>Not only is the nail polish worth buying, but it comes in an attractive box that is great for gift giving.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that it is just fine at sea level.</li>
            <li>the more detailed the pattern will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I figured that maybe if I can remove the cover (which I did) by easily pulling it off and then hovering it over my nail for two minutes.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and stays on for while.</li>
            <li>Upon my first use, I could not get the magnets to work and the downfall about this was that there were no step by step instructions in the kit on how to use the magnets to get the best possible result.</li>
            <li>5 of the bottles are completely fine and seem to work with no problems.</li>
            <li>you get a gorgeous professional nail look!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s all about nails, makeup etc., and my sister and my girlfriend were enjoying some new style in their nails, and this was the reason, so she made me order her own magnetic polish box</li>
            <li>Accurate magnets.</li>
            <li>Such great colors and quality.</li>
            <li>As a nail polish junkie, I have tried all levels of brands from cheap to pricey.</li>
            <li>I AM NEVER DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my girlfriend because she wanted cool designs on her nails</li>
            <li>about 1.cm away from your finger make sure your not moving your hand to much or the nail polish would not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;step 3</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I received my order because it was so nicely presented the reusable storage box.  </li>
            <li>and the magnetic designs it comes with are pretty cool!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to risk polish dripping off the brush to use the magnet of the one I was using, and you have to work quickly</li>
            <li>Item shipped quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>I will most likely not purchase again but am still glad I got for my girlfriend</li>
            <li>Very pretty designs.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be trying more Shany products!</li>
            <li>The first nail worked perfect and the second took a little more time to get right, but with practice my wife has it down pat now and gets great use out of this product.  </li>
            <li>The polish itself, is very vibrant and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Dries real fast.</li>
            <li>And it gose on smooth, and it also dries fast, too.  </li>
            <li>Magnetic nail polishes are so much fun, to begin with.</li>
            <li>These six colors are fun.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the highest quality polish, but it makes for fun experiments.  </li>
            <li>Magnetic nail polish is a great and easy way to spice up one&#x27;s nails, especially if you are not a professional.  </li>
            <li>pretty  and fun but takes some  patience  and practice.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and so much better than the other magnetic nail polishes that are on the market.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know exactly what it did when I bought it, but my wife knew right away</li>
            <li>It takes a couple of tries (I&#x27;m a beginner), but in the end the product is pretty easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived only three or four days after I ordered it, I am overall happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>Only wish there were better directions on how to get the magnetic effect look just right.  </li>
            <li>I figured out that as you put a coat on you have to immediately hold the cap very, very close to your nail to get it to work.  </li>
            <li>The colors are pretty though</li>
            <li>Not many companies have such a great color selection when it comes to magnetic polishes but this set had them all!</li>
            <li>This sale price is what you pay for ONE bottle of some of the higher end brands.</li>
            <li>sure to shake the bottle prior to application otherwise</li>
            <li>These polishes are way better than some that cost twice as much and better than a few that cost three times what these do.</li>
            <li>First, it and foremost, it did not come with any instructions.</li>
            <li>The box arrived looking pretty shabby and with quite a bit of damage.</li>
            <li>Just a heads up---if you are giving this as a gift---it may not look too pretty when it arrives.</li>
            <li>In person, it seems to be more orange than red.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS KIT BECAUSE YOU GET DIFFERENT COLORS</li>
            <li>Colors not so hot either</li>
            <li>I had to do this with one because I accidentally dinged the polish with the magnet and with another because I held the magnet at a different angle from the rest and wasn&#x27;t happy that the design was slightly askew.</li>
            <li>Use more than you normally do on a second coat, but not so much there are gobs on your nails</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re considering purchasing this set I would suggest you purchase it directly from Shany Cosmetics instead of through Amazon because damaged nail polish cannot be replaced through Amazon but Shany should be able to refund or replace your items when bought directly.</li>
            <li>all reviews of this were positive.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t hold the magnet over it too long.  </li>
            <li>The product was received in remarkable time however, the product sucks...</li>
            <li>and she may use on certain occasions.</li>
            <li>The actual nail polish appears to be fine.</li>
            <li>with  the magnetic  application  which  really  helps.  </li>
            <li>the process  goes  much  smoother.  </li>
            <li>I use these often and the magnets really work.</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>: realized I was using too much polish.</li>
            <li>and and it works really well C:</li>
            <li>/&gt;you want to have the real distinctive magnetic nail polish</li>
            <li>I really like this kit</li>
            <li>so if you want it well buy it and the shipping was really fast</li>
            <li>i really like it the polish, at the first time a was unsure to buy because other customers wrote not a good feed back about this product but in my opion for the price that i brough is a good deal and the product is really good</li>
            <li>Unlike many other polishes I&#x27;ve used, it doesn&#x27;t chip after one day.  </li>
            <li>It does require working quickly, one nail at a time, so the polish does not dry before the magnet is held over it.</li>
            <li>For a low price, I was able to get 6 different colors with really neat designs.  </li>
            <li>I had the best luck with the stripes because you can rock the cap back and forth to get the design across the entire nail but the caps are flat so the other designs don&#x27;t show up as well.</li>
            <li>if you want:&lt;br /&gt;the nail polish that is less distinctive but has more variety of colors buy SHANY</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important, cause you don&#x27;t want to have to wait froever for it to dry.</li>
            <li>nail polish lasted for a decent amount of time said my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>Although many reviewers said that the magnets do not seem to work, it took me almost 20 minutes to finally solve my similar problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**After</li>
            <li>The magnet designs work decently well.</li>
            <li>* A steady hand and *</li>
            <li>I highly suggest anyone purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it for anyone looking to get a gift for a woman that they might not be expecting.</li>
            <li>There are more then a few disappointments she has noticed with the product.</li>
            <li>It is probably not worth the effort to send it back for a replacement (and her birthday is tomorrow), but I am kind of embarassed to be giving the set to her in this condition.</li>
            <li>If you use the right amount you will notice that the designs appear almost instantly.</li>
            <li>The designs when you use the magnet isn&#x27;t overly showable, but it&#x27;s a nice subtle design.</li>
            <li>Goes on well and stays on very a pretty long time!</li>
            <li>The only problem I expect anyone would have is if hey didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;T follow directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>The colors are amazing but the polish doesn&#x27;t last long even with a top coat; not sure if it&#x27;s because I get my hands wet too often or not.</li>
            <li>I thought some different colors besides the usual I wear in the sally Hansen collection might be nice as well.</li>
            <li>fine but green nail polish or #4 don&#x27;t give me any design??</li>
            <li>These, I don&#x27;t think the magnet is strong enough, very minimal.</li>
            <li>This is a really neat way to achieve a look different each time, without salon prices!  </li>
            <li>and I never use up a whole bottle of polish anyway, especially before it goes out of style.</li>
            <li>Looks professional.</li>
            <li>I really like the different colors of the nail polishes!</li>
            <li>The colors are ok but they must have been quite stingy with the iron particles because while my usual brand will have the design appear instantly this does not.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;ll get better with practice, but I&#x27;m not sure the magnetic tops are all created equal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy this polish just for that since normal stuff cracks on me the next day.</li>
            <li>oh and do it quickly dont let the polish for the second time dry before using the magnet!!!</li>
            <li>The Cosmopolitan Nail Polish Set (24 Colors Premium Quality and Quick Dry), 40 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li>2) paint the 2nd (thick but not goopy) coat on only one nail and immediately hold the magnet to it by resting the raised lip of the cap just outside your cuticle (not on the nail of course) and holding it about 1 mm away from the nail (you have to be steady to keep from accidentally touching the nail).  </li>
            <li>This is a great idea, but can&#x27;t seem to get it to work as expected, will only leave a small impression, if you have little fingernails, would not recommend</li>
            <li>Too much will take a long time to pull enough of the pattern.</li>
            <li>It far exceeds my last shellac manicure!</li>
            <li>The polish colors are great, so I just use them as they are basically and scrap the magnetic step..rather disappointing!</li>
            <li>but 6 days later not a single one.</li>
            <li>Subtle designs, clean lines.</li>
            <li>What a fun way to spice up plain ole&#x27; nail polish!</li>
            <li>, I flipped the cover with brush upside down and hovered it above my nail (about 1/2 inch) very still for one minute.</li>
            <li>Even holding it 30 seconds will barely get an image to appear and there is not a high enough lip on the magnet itself to prevent you from touching your nail if your hand gets tired of having to hold it so long.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> i love it so elegent nice colour</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying the Sally Hanson kind.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve found so far for the magnetic is Sally Hansen...</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> Price  is  great, colors are so pretty  </li>
            <li> SO ITS A GOOD WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU LIKE BEFORE BUYING FULL SIZE SETS.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even bother with a top coat since I wasn&#x27;t really happy with my first attempt</li>
            <li> I am able to get a design with magnets not included with this set.</li>
            <li> Depending on the design you will be able to see the design forming if you peek in from the side.</li>
            <li> The polish has designs that are brought to the top surface of the polished nail, using the magnetic bottle cover.  </li>
            <li> It takes some practice and patience to make this work, but your efforts will be paid off with interesting nail designs.</li>
            <li> Tried to coat on top of the polish, but it would ruin the magnetic design.</li>
            <li> Love the colors.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the magnets fall out of the cap and can ruin your nails as your trying to make the pattern.</li>
            <li> PLEASE FOR THE LOVE</li>
            <li> Overall very good product!</li>
            <li> Then top coat.</li>
            <li> I put some top coat over it for my pedicure and it lasted despite wearing work shoes all week</li>
            <li> such a great deal !</li>
            <li> LOVE THE COLORS</li>
            <li> The one redeeming quality however, was the color.</li>
            <li> Love the patterns.</li>
            <li> hope this helps. :)</li>
            <li> Very beautiful colors, though the red is more of a brownish color.</li>
            <li> nail polish has more colors than Sally Hansen,however Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail polish has a more distinctive magnetic nail polish than SHANY&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to get the hang of it immediately.....</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the polish to make the design on the top of the lid.</li>
            <li> I love these nail colors.</li>
            <li> Love magnetic nail polish as well as SHANY so this was a no brainer for me.</li>
            <li> I love these colors and the fact that they are magnetic just adds to it.</li>
            <li> This is way better than the overpriced brands in the stores.  </li>
            <li> A better price per bottle with design options.  </li>
            <li> I seem to have better results with some pattern magnets I purchased separately.</li>
            <li> I Love the colors, the designs are fun!!</li>
            <li> Not only is the nail polish worth buying, but it comes in an attractive box that is great for gift giving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that it is just fine at sea level.</li>
            <li> the more detailed the pattern will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I figured that maybe if I can remove the cover (which I did) by easily pulling it off and then hovering it over my nail for two minutes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and stays on for while.</li>
            <li> Upon my first use, I could not get the magnets to work and the downfall about this was that there were no step by step instructions in the kit on how to use the magnets to get the best possible result.</li>
            <li> 5 of the bottles are completely fine and seem to work with no problems.</li>
            <li> you get a gorgeous professional nail look!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s all about nails, makeup etc., and my sister and my girlfriend were enjoying some new style in their nails, and this was the reason, so she made me order her own magnetic polish box</li>
            <li> Accurate magnets.</li>
            <li> Such great colors and quality.</li>
            <li> As a nail polish junkie, I have tried all levels of brands from cheap to pricey.</li>
            <li> I AM NEVER DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because she wanted cool designs on her nails</li>
            <li> about 1.cm away from your finger make sure your not moving your hand to much or the nail polish would not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;step 3</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received my order because it was so nicely presented the reusable storage box.  </li>
            <li> and the magnetic designs it comes with are pretty cool!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to risk polish dripping off the brush to use the magnet of the one I was using, and you have to work quickly</li>
            <li> Item shipped quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> I will most likely not purchase again but am still glad I got for my girlfriend</li>
            <li> Very pretty designs.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be trying more Shany products!</li>
            <li> The first nail worked perfect and the second took a little more time to get right, but with practice my wife has it down pat now and gets great use out of this product.  </li>
            <li> The polish itself, is very vibrant and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Dries real fast.</li>
            <li> And it gose on smooth, and it also dries fast, too.  </li>
            <li> Magnetic nail polishes are so much fun, to begin with.</li>
            <li> These six colors are fun.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the highest quality polish, but it makes for fun experiments.  </li>
            <li> Magnetic nail polish is a great and easy way to spice up one&#x27;s nails, especially if you are not a professional.  </li>
            <li> pretty  and fun but takes some  patience  and practice.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and so much better than the other magnetic nail polishes that are on the market.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know exactly what it did when I bought it, but my wife knew right away</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of tries (I&#x27;m a beginner), but in the end the product is pretty easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived only three or four days after I ordered it, I am overall happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Only wish there were better directions on how to get the magnetic effect look just right.  </li>
            <li> I figured out that as you put a coat on you have to immediately hold the cap very, very close to your nail to get it to work.  </li>
            <li> The colors are pretty though</li>
            <li> Not many companies have such a great color selection when it comes to magnetic polishes but this set had them all!</li>
            <li> This sale price is what you pay for ONE bottle of some of the higher end brands.</li>
            <li> sure to shake the bottle prior to application otherwise</li>
            <li> These polishes are way better than some that cost twice as much and better than a few that cost three times what these do.</li>
            <li> First, it and foremost, it did not come with any instructions.</li>
            <li> The box arrived looking pretty shabby and with quite a bit of damage.</li>
            <li> Just a heads up---if you are giving this as a gift---it may not look too pretty when it arrives.</li>
            <li> In person, it seems to be more orange than red.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS KIT BECAUSE YOU GET DIFFERENT COLORS</li>
            <li> Colors not so hot either</li>
            <li> I had to do this with one because I accidentally dinged the polish with the magnet and with another because I held the magnet at a different angle from the rest and wasn&#x27;t happy that the design was slightly askew.</li>
            <li> Use more than you normally do on a second coat, but not so much there are gobs on your nails</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re considering purchasing this set I would suggest you purchase it directly from Shany Cosmetics instead of through Amazon because damaged nail polish cannot be replaced through Amazon but Shany should be able to refund or replace your items when bought directly.</li>
            <li> all reviews of this were positive.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t hold the magnet over it too long.  </li>
            <li> The product was received in remarkable time however, the product sucks...</li>
            <li> and she may use on certain occasions.</li>
            <li> The actual nail polish appears to be fine.</li>
            <li> with  the magnetic  application  which  really  helps.  </li>
            <li> the process  goes  much  smoother.  </li>
            <li> I use these often and the magnets really work.</li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>
            <li> : realized I was using too much polish.</li>
            <li> and and it works really well C:</li>
            <li> /&gt;you want to have the real distinctive magnetic nail polish</li>
            <li> I really like this kit</li>
            <li> so if you want it well buy it and the shipping was really fast</li>
            <li> i really like it the polish, at the first time a was unsure to buy because other customers wrote not a good feed back about this product but in my opion for the price that i brough is a good deal and the product is really good</li>
            <li> Unlike many other polishes I&#x27;ve used, it doesn&#x27;t chip after one day.  </li>
            <li> It does require working quickly, one nail at a time, so the polish does not dry before the magnet is held over it.</li>
            <li> For a low price, I was able to get 6 different colors with really neat designs.  </li>
            <li> I had the best luck with the stripes because you can rock the cap back and forth to get the design across the entire nail but the caps are flat so the other designs don&#x27;t show up as well.</li>
            <li> if you want:&lt;br /&gt;the nail polish that is less distinctive but has more variety of colors buy SHANY</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s important, cause you don&#x27;t want to have to wait froever for it to dry.</li>
            <li> nail polish lasted for a decent amount of time said my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Although many reviewers said that the magnets do not seem to work, it took me almost 20 minutes to finally solve my similar problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**After</li>
            <li> The magnet designs work decently well.</li>
            <li> * A steady hand and *</li>
            <li> I highly suggest anyone purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it for anyone looking to get a gift for a woman that they might not be expecting.</li>
            <li> There are more then a few disappointments she has noticed with the product.</li>
            <li> It is probably not worth the effort to send it back for a replacement (and her birthday is tomorrow), but I am kind of embarassed to be giving the set to her in this condition.</li>
            <li> If you use the right amount you will notice that the designs appear almost instantly.</li>
            <li> The designs when you use the magnet isn&#x27;t overly showable, but it&#x27;s a nice subtle design.</li>
            <li> Goes on well and stays on very a pretty long time!</li>
            <li> The only problem I expect anyone would have is if hey didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;T follow directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> The colors are amazing but the polish doesn&#x27;t last long even with a top coat; not sure if it&#x27;s because I get my hands wet too often or not.</li>
            <li> I thought some different colors besides the usual I wear in the sally Hansen collection might be nice as well.</li>
            <li> fine but green nail polish or #4 don&#x27;t give me any design??</li>
            <li> These, I don&#x27;t think the magnet is strong enough, very minimal.</li>
            <li> This is a really neat way to achieve a look different each time, without salon prices!  </li>
            <li> and I never use up a whole bottle of polish anyway, especially before it goes out of style.</li>
            <li> Looks professional.</li>
            <li> I really like the different colors of the nail polishes!</li>
            <li> The colors are ok but they must have been quite stingy with the iron particles because while my usual brand will have the design appear instantly this does not.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;ll get better with practice, but I&#x27;m not sure the magnetic tops are all created equal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy this polish just for that since normal stuff cracks on me the next day.</li>
            <li> oh and do it quickly dont let the polish for the second time dry before using the magnet!!!</li>
            <li> The Cosmopolitan Nail Polish Set (24 Colors Premium Quality and Quick Dry), 40 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> 2) paint the 2nd (thick but not goopy) coat on only one nail and immediately hold the magnet to it by resting the raised lip of the cap just outside your cuticle (not on the nail of course) and holding it about 1 mm away from the nail (you have to be steady to keep from accidentally touching the nail).  </li>
            <li> This is a great idea, but can&#x27;t seem to get it to work as expected, will only leave a small impression, if you have little fingernails, would not recommend</li>
            <li> Too much will take a long time to pull enough of the pattern.</li>
            <li> It far exceeds my last shellac manicure!</li>
            <li> The polish colors are great, so I just use them as they are basically and scrap the magnetic step..rather disappointing!</li>
            <li> but 6 days later not a single one.</li>
            <li> Subtle designs, clean lines.</li>
            <li> What a fun way to spice up plain ole&#x27; nail polish!</li>
            <li> , I flipped the cover with brush upside down and hovered it above my nail (about 1/2 inch) very still for one minute.</li>
            <li> Even holding it 30 seconds will barely get an image to appear and there is not a high enough lip on the magnet itself to prevent you from touching your nail if your hand gets tired of having to hold it so long.</li>
            <li> You have to put the polish on thick and get the magnet on it quick because as soon as it starts to dry it stops working.</li>
            <li> (8000&#x27;)I think that I am having a harder time that usual getting it to work right.  </li>
            <li> If the design doesn&#x27;t line up how you wanted you can repeat starting with step 2 after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> Dry time is long.</li>
            <li> On your thumb you may have to rock the magnet back and forth a little to cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li> Please use the same polish the magnetic came with other nail polish wont work.</li>
            <li> :wait until the nail polish it dry then</li>
            <li> The polish seem to take a while to dry.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; was really more of a copper color, but the blue, green, and purple are much nicer.</li>
            <li> She thought it looked like she had done a bad job, when in reality the design just distorted the top coat.</li>
            <li> Some nails looked great and others looked awful.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a week if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
            <li> So we spent 15 minutes trying to figure out how to get the magnetic design.</li>
            <li> The polish is beyond what I had expected.  </li>
            <li> Let dry completely, then paint over it with a very thick coat.</li>
            <li> The magnet designs were not consistent.  </li>
            <li> There are endless ideas you can create with these magnetic nail polishes.</li>
            <li> The magnetic does not work as well as other brands I have bought from boutiques and stores.  </li>
            <li> I had to use magnetic tops from other brands to bring out the polish.</li>
            <li> let it dry and then put a heavy layer of polish on your finger (do one finger at a time.)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having a hard time getting the design to show up, you aren&#x27;t using enough polish.</li>
            <li> One of my fingers only took like 5 seconds, seriously.</li>
            <li> but with less variety of color&#x27;s buy sally Hansen&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I bought this set because the Sally Hansen magnetic that I usually buy is getting harder to find</li>
            <li> : 1) paint each nail with a (not too thick) coat of the polish and let dry.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the color of the \\&quot;red\\&quot; polish is a little bit misguiding.</li>
            <li> And the green - I never could get to work at all.  </li>
            <li> For some it has worked a few seconds, but for me it takes about 1-2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And if you still are having trouble with the product watch a tutorial on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The polish in the last bottle, however, was completely dried up and the brush was completely broken off.</li>
            <li> I also tried hovering the magnet over the nail in different positions and using some of the other colors, but it was useless.  </li>
            <li> 3) hold magnet in place for approximately 10 to 15 seconds careful to to touch your nail.</li>
            <li> Although some of the designs are repetitive, I would still recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, the magnets are not strong and require you to hover over the nail for 10 seconds while slowly rotating around the curvature of the nail.</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t seem to get the magnetic part to work hardly at all...very inconsistent.</li>
            <li> I have read tons of reviews of other brands that failed and</li>
            <li> shaking the bottle then applying a wet sufficient amount of polish to my nail (that is covered with dry base coat)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe i found this gem and the sale price is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> it is the magnets that are  too weak.</li>
            <li> These are ugly colors and the magnets take TWICE as long to make the impression.</li>
            <li> something different from other boring brands!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s idiot proof and so simple!</li>
            <li> The magnates don&#x27;t work very well and the nail polish itself is horrible</li>
            <li> You need to do a thin layer of nail polish</li>
            <li> The pattern was faint.</li>
            <li> Colors are subdued and saturated, expensive looking.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t return these because Amazon does not accept returns on nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Use a base coat then a thin coat of the polish on all your nails.</li>
            <li> Sad :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a bad batch, but this magnetic nail polish kit doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I HATED THIS!!!</li>
            <li> THIS WAS VERY EXPENSIVE FOR SOMETHING THAT DOESNT EVEN WORK!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> She&#x27;s all about nails, makeup etc., and my sister and my girlfriend were enjoying some new style in their nails, and this was the reason, so she made me order her own magnetic polish box and she&#x27;s really happy now.</li>
            <li> I bought this set because the Sally Hansen magnetic that I usually buy is getting harder to find so I assume it must have been discontinued. I thought some different colors besides the usual I wear in the sally Hansen collection might be nice as well. The colors are ok but they must have been quite stingy with the iron particles because while my usual brand will have the design appear instantly this does not. Even holding it 30 seconds will barely get an image to appear and there is not a high enough lip on the magnet itself to prevent you from touching your nail if your hand gets tired of having to hold it so long. Oh well you get what you pay for and now I know why this was so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;*update*&lt;br /&gt;After having tried this polish again with a different magnet I would have to say it is not that the polish itself lacks the metal particles it is the magnets that are  too weak. I am able to get a design with magnets not included with this set.</li>
            <li> Just got my set in the mail today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. I used the reddish color with the magnet on the bronze colored bottle. It doesn&#x27;t appear the caps are removable and I didn&#x27;t want to risk polish dripping off the brush to use the magnet of the one I was using, and you have to work quickly so screwing the cap on each time was out of the question. There are no instructions included so I used it the same way the Sally Hansen ones work since they have instructions. If it doesn&#x27;t work for you it&#x27;s probably because you&#x27;re not doing it correctly, which isn&#x27;t your fault since they didn&#x27;t include instructions. Here&#x27;s how to do it: 1) paint each nail with a (not too thick) coat of the polish and let dry. 2) paint the 2nd (thick but not goopy) coat on only one nail and immediately hold the magnet to it by resting the raised lip of the cap just outside your cuticle (not on the nail of course) and holding it about 1 mm away from the nail (you have to be steady to keep from accidentally touching the nail).  3) hold magnet in place for approximately 10 to 15 seconds careful to to touch your nail. Depending on the design you will be able to see the design forming if you peek in from the side. If the design doesn&#x27;t line up how you wanted you can repeat starting with step 2 after it&#x27;s dry. I had to do this with one because I accidentally dinged the polish with the magnet and with another because I held the magnet at a different angle from the rest and wasn&#x27;t happy that the design was slightly askew.</li>
            <li> These came with no directions at all.  I figured out that as you put a coat on you have to immediately hold the cap very, very close to your nail to get it to work.  And the green - I never could get to work at all.  The one time I did get all of my nails done well I got lots of compliments on them..</li>
            <li> This is a really neat way to achieve a look different each time, without salon prices!  The polish has designs that are brought to the top surface of the polished nail, using the magnetic bottle cover.  It does require working quickly, one nail at a time, so the polish does not dry before the magnet is held over it. Each time it gets easier, and you get a bit more daring!  Good color selections. Christmas gift that was a surprise!</li>
            <li> It takes some practice and patience to make this work, but your efforts will be paid off with interesting nail designs. I&#x27;m going to order some additional patterns. However, even without the magnetic designs the polish itself is a great cover coat.</li>
            <li> pretty  and fun but takes some  patience  and practice.  My  husband  purchased  these  for me and  suggested  that&lt;br /&gt;he  assist  with  the magnetic  application  which  really  helps.  So  if you can do it  with  a friend  the process  goes  much  smoother.  Price  is  great, colors are so pretty  and it lasts a week if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
            <li> Item shipped quickly and as described. I already own this and bought it as a gift for a friend. I use these often and the magnets really work.</li>
            <li> i love it so elegent nice colour i think when ever i have a chance to put thm on i will</li>
            <li> Magnets didn&#x27;t work well like I would expect. I bought this for my girlfriend because she wanted cool designs on her nails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the magnets are not strong and require you to hover over the nail for 10 seconds while slowly rotating around the curvature of the nail. This caused repainting over and reusing the magnet multiple times to achieve the desired affect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish lasted for a decent amount of time said my girlfriend. (3 days) This was without a coating for protection on them. Tried to coat on top of the polish, but it would ruin the magnetic design. I will most likely not purchase again but am still glad I got for my girlfriend and she may use on certain occasions.</li>
            <li> The magnet designs were not consistent.  Some nails looked great and others looked awful. I tried several times on both me and my daughter and the results were always the same. The colors are pretty though so we just use them without the designs.</li>
            <li> Such great colors and quality. There are endless ideas you can create with these magnetic nail polishes. Not many companies have such a great color selection when it comes to magnetic polishes but this set had them all!</li>
            <li> Love the colors. Dries fast. The magnet feature does not work but it&#x27;s a beautiful brand of polish</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift from my dad (last year)... Upon my first use, I could not get the magnets to work and the downfall about this was that there were no step by step instructions in the kit on how to use the magnets to get the best possible result. Although many reviewers said that the magnets do not seem to work, it took me almost 20 minutes to finally solve my similar problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**After shaking the bottle then applying a wet sufficient amount of polish to my nail (that is covered with dry base coat), I flipped the cover with brush upside down and hovered it above my nail (about 1/2 inch) very still for one minute. The pattern was faint. So, I figured that maybe if I can remove the cover (which I did) by easily pulling it off and then hovering it over my nail for two minutes. To my surprise, the pattern came out beautifully, the longer you leave the magnet hovered (in any angle) the more detailed the pattern will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion the use of these magnets require patience as you have to keep so still for it to work.For some it has worked a few seconds, but for me it takes about 1-2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> The magnet designs work decently well. You have to put the polish on thick and get the magnet on it quick because as soon as it starts to dry it stops working. I had the best luck with the stripes because you can rock the cap back and forth to get the design across the entire nail but the caps are flat so the other designs don&#x27;t show up as well. Note that there are NO instructions included with this set and I couldn&#x27;t find any online either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this polish is it doesn&#x27;t crack or chip! I didn&#x27;t even bother with a top coat since I wasn&#x27;t really happy with my first attempt and I figured I would take the color off as soon as it started cracking but 6 days later not a single one. I&#x27;d buy this polish just for that since normal stuff cracks on me the next day. It far exceeds my last shellac manicure!</li>
            <li> The magnets were off and I had to take them out and re-position them. The colors are amazing but the polish doesn&#x27;t last long even with a top coat; not sure if it&#x27;s because I get my hands wet too often or not. However for the time that my nails are perfect, I am getting complements from people.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. You&#x27;re better off buying the Sally Hanson kind. These are ugly colors and the magnets take TWICE as long to make the impression. On top of that, the magnets fall out of the cap and can ruin your nails as your trying to make the pattern. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE GOD DON&#x27;T BUY THESE POLISHES. IT&#x27;S A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.</li>
            <li> Magnetic nail polishes are so much fun, to begin with. And these colors are absolutely gorgeous! What a fun way to spice up plain ole&#x27; nail polish! Great deal, and product.</li>
            <li> Nice colors and magnet designs. Easy to use and stays on for while. Great price for six magnetic nail polishes. Overall very good product! Also recommend Shany&#x27;s regular nail polish.[[ASIN:B005X2F7JY Shany Cosmetics The Cosmopolitan Nail Polish Set (24 Colors Premium Quality and Quick Dry), 40 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I ordered this item even though it said \\&quot;out of stock\\&quot; but received it within a week anyway! It only took 2 days in shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Shany product and I&#x27;m impressed. This sale price is what you pay for ONE bottle of some of the higher end brands. Even the Sally Hansen ones are about $10 a pop. I can&#x27;t believe i found this gem and the sale price is ridiculous. Awesome color selection, many magnet designs. Colors are subdued and saturated, expensive looking. The bottles are good size and I never use up a whole bottle of polish anyway, especially before it goes out of style. Best of all, IT WORKS. I have read tons of reviews of other brands that failed and all reviews of this were positive.  Subtle designs, clean lines. So on trend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to shake the bottle prior to application otherwise the iron particles will remain at the bottom, and do one nail at a time for second coat. Use a base coat then a thin coat of the polish on all your nails. Let dry completely, then paint over it with a very thick coat. Hold the magnet against your cuticle for 10-30 seconds using the lip to balance. The thicker the coat, the faster the design appears. One of my fingers only took like 5 seconds, seriously. On your thumb you may have to rock the magnet back and forth a little to cover the entire nail. Dry time is long. Then top coat. If you&#x27;re having a hard time getting the design to show up, you aren&#x27;t using enough polish. It&#x27;s idiot proof and so simple! Couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: realized I was using too much polish. There&#x27;s a learning curve. Use more than you normally do on a second coat, but not so much there are gobs on your nails lol. Middle ground. If you use the right amount you will notice that the designs appear almost instantly. Use your brain, it needs to be enough to \\&quot;move around\\&quot; a smidge. Too much will take a long time to pull enough of the pattern.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  The polish is very smooth, goes on beautifully and the magnets work if you follow directions . . .  Practice.  Make sure you don&#x27;t hold the magnet over it too long.  The only problem I expect anyone would have is if hey didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;T follow directions exactly.  He colors are beautiful.  I put some top coat over it for my pedicure and it lasted despite wearing work shoes all week</li>
            <li> Box came in scratched and looked a bit beat up. I gave it to my manager for xmas. There was no instructions but she figured it and and it works really well C:</li>
            <li> 6 magnetic nail polish for $17, its almost like getting it for $1 which is superb. where else can you find nail polish with great quality for almost $1 ? such a great deal !</li>
            <li> These six colors are fun. Only wish there were better directions on how to get the magnetic effect look just right.  But with trial and error you can get the effect working for you.</li>
            <li> As a nail polish junkie, I have tried all levels of brands from cheap to pricey. These polishes are way better than some that cost twice as much and better than a few that cost three times what these do.</li>
            <li> THE BEST FOR YOUR BUCK! I AM NEVER DISAPPOINTED. LOVE THE COLORS AND THE FINISHED PRODUCT IS JUST BREATH TAKING. A GOT TO GET.</li>
            <li> I HATED THIS!!! THE MAGNETS DO NOT WORK AT ALL!!! DONT ORDER!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!! THIS WAS VERY EXPENSIVE FOR SOMETHING THAT DOESNT EVEN WORK!!</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish set for my wife. There are more then a few disappointments she has noticed with the product. First, it and foremost, it did not come with any instructions. So we spent 15 minutes trying to figure out how to get the magnetic design. Turns out that magnets are on the cap of each bottle. She also didn&#x27;t like how the design showed up. She thought it looked like she had done a bad job, when in reality the design just distorted the top coat. The one redeeming quality however, was the color. She was very pleased with the color selections. Don&#x27;t buy this for the magnetic property, its a gimmick.</li>
            <li> The product was received in remarkable time however, the product sucks... The magnates don&#x27;t work very well and the nail polish itself is horrible, when applying you get lumps and air bubbles. Not to mention it starts chipping by day 3... I would not recommend this nail polish... The best I&#x27;ve found so far for the magnetic is Sally Hansen...</li>
            <li> I just love it!! Product is as described. I would recommend this product. All 6 colors work well. Love the patterns.</li>
            <li> You need to do a thin layer of nail polish let it dry and then put a heavy layer of polish on your finger (do one finger at a time.) oh and do it quickly dont let the polish for the second time dry before using the magnet!!! and hold the magnetic close to your nail for 20 seconds. Please use the same polish the magnetic came with other nail polish wont work. And please note it takes practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you still are having trouble with the product watch a tutorial on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps. :)</li>
            <li> I love these nail polishes! Very beautiful colors, though the red is more of a brownish color. It takes a couple of tries (I&#x27;m a beginner), but in the end the product is pretty easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived only three or four days after I ordered it, I am overall happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> For the price paid I wasn&#x27;t expecting a package like this one. There is not need for a second coat to bring out  the color.  Dries real fast. Accurate magnets. Very pretty designs.  Looks professional.</li>
            <li> Let it be written that I haven&#x27;t even tried the nail polish yet. I was giving this set as a gift to my sister for her birthday. The box arrived looking pretty shabby and with quite a bit of damage. The actual nail polish appears to be fine. It is probably not worth the effort to send it back for a replacement (and her birthday is tomorrow), but I am kind of embarassed to be giving the set to her in this condition. Just a heads up---if you are giving this as a gift---it may not look too pretty when it arrives. And this is coming from someone who has never left a review for anything I purchase on Amazon--ever.</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews;some were saying it does not work some say it does work.So I bought it with a 50% chance that it might not work or it will work,and guess what IT WORKS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;you need:&lt;br /&gt;* timer/watch/clock or anything that measures time&lt;br /&gt;* A steady hand and *patience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;step 1: apply the nail polish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;step 2: while it&#x27;s drying put the magnet about 1.cm away from your finger make sure your not moving your hand to much or the nail polish would not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;step 3:wait until the nail polish it dry then your done!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;step 4: repeat step 1,2,3,4&lt;br /&gt;SHANY&#x27;s nail polish has more colors than Sally Hansen,however Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail polish has a more distinctive magnetic nail polish than SHANY&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so if :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you want to have the real distinctive magnetic nail polish but with less variety of color&#x27;s buy sally Hansen&lt;br /&gt;but if you want:&lt;br /&gt;the nail polish that is less distinctive but has more variety of colors buy SHANY</li>
            <li> I was able to get the hang of it immediately..... works great and looks amazing..... The daughtres loved it.... awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 2 stars because the item arrived damaged. 5 of the bottles are completely fine and seem to work with no problems. The polish in the last bottle, however, was completely dried up and the brush was completely broken off. If you&#x27;re considering purchasing this set I would suggest you purchase it directly from Shany Cosmetics instead of through Amazon because damaged nail polish cannot be replaced through Amazon but Shany should be able to refund or replace your items when bought directly. Additionally, the color of the \\&quot;red\\&quot; polish is a little bit misguiding. In person, it seems to be more orange than red.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the polish to make the design on the top of the lid. The polish seem to take a while to dry.</li>
            <li> I love these nail colors. The polish goes on real smooth and they are beautiful shades.  I purchased another one for my granddaughter and she loves them also.  You do not have to use the magnet, I don&#x27;t and they still look great!</li>
            <li> Love magnetic nail polish as well as SHANY so this was a no brainer for me. Excellent quality and super cute colors. Def would recommend to everyone to try!</li>
            <li> The magnetic does not work as well as other brands I have bought from boutiques and stores.  The polish itself, is very vibrant and goes on smoothly.  I had to use magnetic tops from other brands to bring out the polish.</li>
            <li> I love these colors and the fact that they are magnetic just adds to it. The designs when you use the magnet isn&#x27;t overly showable, but it&#x27;s a nice subtle design.</li>
            <li> these colors are heavenly! love them! and the magnetic designs it comes with are pretty cool! something different from other boring brands!</li>
            <li> I really like the different colors of the nail polishes! Goes on well and stays on very a pretty long time! Easy to use!</li>
            <li> This nail polish set is great.  The polish goes on smooth and the magnets work perfectly to make fun designs.  Unlike many other polishes I&#x27;ve used, it doesn&#x27;t chip after one day.  Not only is the nail polish worth buying, but it comes in an attractive box that is great for gift giving.  I was pleasantly surprised when I received my order because it was so nicely presented the reusable storage box.  I love this set!</li>
            <li> This is way better than the overpriced brands in the stores.  A better price per bottle with design options.  Can&#x27;t beat it for price, quality and it lasts too! Will definitely be trying more Shany products!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a bad batch, but this magnetic nail polish kit doesn&#x27;t work.  I tried shaking the bottle to ensure the magnetic particles were activated, but nothing happened.  I also tried hovering the magnet over the nail in different positions and using some of the other colors, but it was useless.  The magnetic effect wouldn&#x27;t materialize.  I contacted Shany&#x27;s customer service department twice, but didn&#x27;t receive a response.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t return these because Amazon does not accept returns on nail polish.  I&#x27;m sticking to Sally Hansen&#x27;s Magnetic polishes.  Those work without a hassle.</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t know how this works, what you do is paint your nails with the beautiful nail polish that is in the kit, then you hold the magnet of your choice over your nail an you get a gorgeous professional nail look! I really like this kit it works wonderfully and easily!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;ll get better with practice, but I&#x27;m not sure the magnetic tops are all created equal.  I seem to have better results with some pattern magnets I purchased separately.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful.  The polish is beyond what I had expected.  It is so easy to use and so much better than the other magnetic nail polishes that are on the market.  I highly suggest anyone purchasing this product.  I am a Shany fan!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS KIT BECAUSE YOU GET DIFFERENT COLORS AND ALSO DIFFERENT DESIGNS SO ITS A GOOD WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU LIKE BEFORE BUYING FULL SIZE SETS.</li>
            <li> Everyone works fine but green nail polish or #4 don&#x27;t give me any design?? Is like a regular nail polish!! Sad :(</li>
            <li> I loved this! I bought one color of magnetic nail polish at a department store for about 5 or 6 dollars, so I went online and found this product and I just had to get it.  For a low price, I was able to get 6 different colors with really neat designs.  Although some of the designs are repetitive, I would still recommend this product.  Magnetic nail polish is a great and easy way to spice up one&#x27;s nails, especially if you are not a professional.  You get great products for an inexpensive price with Shany Cosmetics!</li>
            <li> All good, my wife is happy with these . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t seem to get the magnetic part to work hardly at all...very inconsistent. The polish colors are great, so I just use them as they are basically and scrap the magnetic step..rather disappointing!</li>
            <li> I bought this for both my wife and my sister in law for Christmas and they loved it.  I didn&#x27;t even know exactly what it did when I bought it, but my wife knew right away and I watched her put the nail polish on and then make the \\&quot;magnet magic\\&quot; happen.  The first nail worked perfect and the second took a little more time to get right, but with practice my wife has it down pat now and gets great use out of this product.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it for anyone looking to get a gift for a woman that they might not be expecting.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, but can&#x27;t seem to get it to work as expected, will only leave a small impression, if you have little fingernails, would not recommend</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the highest quality polish, but it makes for fun experiments.  I was a little disappointed that the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; was really more of a copper color, but the blue, green, and purple are much nicer.</li>
            <li> I have some Sally Hanson and the effect is great. These, I don&#x27;t think the magnet is strong enough, very minimal. Colors not so hot either</li>
            <li> I Love the colors, the designs are fun!! And it gose on smooth, and it also dries fast, too.  That&#x27;s important, cause you don&#x27;t want to have to wait froever for it to dry.</li>
            <li> i really like it the polish, at the first time a was unsure to buy because other customers wrote not a good feed back about this product but in my opion for the price that i brough is a good deal and the product is really good so if you want it well buy it and the shipping was really fast</li>
            <li> All of the colors are nice.  Because of my altitude (8000&#x27;)I think that I am having a harder time that usual getting it to work right.  it takes me almost 3 times longer to get it to work.  I&#x27;m sure that it is just fine at sea level.</li>
