            <li>the strap is nothing more than a 0.01 cent elastic band pushed through the plastic.</li>
            <li>Works well, but wish the strap was better.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m confident it&#x27;d work well that way, considering the materials all seem quite durable.</li>
            <li>Would have been a better product if it had more beads.</li>
            <li>Way to hot!!!</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Feels pretty good.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of the gel beads thinking it would be more gentle and soothing on my face</li>
            <li>but it seems to be fine when heated.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think fit your face like you want it or think.</li>

            <li>Good price, fit is okay, does what it says by providing a nice cold soothing effect.  </li>
            <li>I ended up throwing it away after the first use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for that price.  </li>
            <li>it is absolute junk!</li>
            <li>Very helpful when having a headache or a hot flash.</li>
            <li>as far as being cool, the minute it is place on your face, it become room temperature.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old.</li>
            <li>this is made from a hard plastic like your shower courting, so never will place on your face in a smooth way</li>

            <li> plastic is kind of hard and not really comfortable to wear on my face and isn&#x27;t that the point?</li>
            <li> i find that i&#x27;m better off avoiding excessively salty foods, alcohol late at night without drinking plenty of water, and supplements like melatonin that cause bags under my eyes,</li>
            <li> I never find these things to be terribly well made, but this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li> but it didnt allow the mask to stay frozen long enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased at a discount store where it was marked down from 6.59 to 3.99.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the face well, and if you put it on your face straight from the freezer it is quite painful.</li>
            <li> It would be a decent price for people with small heads or who are bald.</li>
            <li> Better of with cold rag.</li>
            <li> I guess it wasn&#x27;t made to retain heat that long.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal or not.</li>
            <li> waste of money, this product is too big for the eye area and seats on the forehead and upper cheeks.</li>
            <li> The one i had in the past was all gel and could be completely frozen.</li>
            <li> but that is expected since this has such a small mass of beads.</li>
            <li> The mask does not fit  on your face properly and pulling the skin around the eyes down.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the $8 it&#x27;s currently listed at on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Less beads, squishes around.</li>
            <li> Helps a little with puffiness, but price has been upped for some reason, cheaper in the store.</li>
            <li> In the morning if my face is a little puffy I&#x27;ll put on this ice mask while doing stomach crunches.</li>
            <li> just a few minutes with this little beauty</li>
            <li> This one I left in the freezer over night and it still only stayed cold for 15 minutes max.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the face well, and if you put it on your face straight from the freezer it is quite painful. Helps a little with puffiness, but price has been upped for some reason, cheaper in the store.</li>
            <li> Works great. Can&#x27;t see while using, but, very soothing.</li>
            <li> I wasnt too thrilled with this product. I used to have an ice pack eye mask years ago and recently started looking for another one for my migraines. The one i had in the past was all gel and could be completely frozen. This one I left in the freezer over night and it still only stayed cold for 15 minutes max. I liked the idea of the gel beads thinking it would be more gentle and soothing on my face but it didnt allow the mask to stay frozen long enough.</li>
            <li> Did not get the item that was pictured, mine was TINY and did not have eye holes. the strap is nothing more than a 0.01 cent elastic band pushed through the plastic.</li>
            <li> waste of money, this product is too big for the eye area and seats on the forehead and upper cheeks. as far as being cool, the minute it is place on your face, it become room temperature.</li>
            <li> Totally agree with this review---Did not get the item that was pictured, mine was TINY and did not have eye holes. the strap is nothing more than a 0.01 cent elastic band pushed through the plastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a awesome idea... I heated it up for 15 seconds and placed it on my face or started too... Way to hot!!! So I waited a few minutes and tried again. The mask stays on your face with velcro straps that wrap around the back of your head. I like the way it fit snugly, especially on the bridge of my nose. It was nice a warm and felt great. The only downside; it doesn&#x27;t stay warm very long! Maybe only a couple of minutes. I guess it wasn&#x27;t made to retain heat that long. I&#x27;ve never used something like this before so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal or not. It&#x27;s good relief for about 5 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product expecting to receive the mask pictured, but I received one with no eye holes.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worked well enough for 3months, helped while looking at computer.  But, uncomfortable one the nose, and eventually started leaking the &amp;#34;fluid/gel balls&amp;#34; on my face.  Going to try another manuf.</li>
            <li> This product is as advertised. Satisfactorily made and serves the purpose for which it was designed. Would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> They shipped me a different mask than pictured. The one I got did not have the eyes cut out and had a thin elastic band. Simple mistake I guess but still not happy.</li>
            <li> Very helpful when having a headache or a hot flash. Its a multi-tasker and I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 of them!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even stay cold for 5 minutes. I should have known it was no good by the price. Better of with cold rag.</li>
            <li> this works great - put it in the freezer and use it to cool down, help a headache, migraine or whatever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great</li>
            <li> Had eye surgery and this worked great at keeping the puffiness down. Liked that I was still able to watch TV or read when wearing it.</li>
            <li> plastic is kind of hard and not really comfortable to wear on my face and isn&#x27;t that the point? lol</li>
            <li> I suffer from migraines since I work a lot with screens and computers and this gel mask really does help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to cool my eyes and forehead, it says you can also use it as a heat pad by putting it in the microwave but I havent gotten to do that yet.</li>

            <li> My wife was in need of ice to relax her eyes and this product has worked really good for her. It does not stay cold as long as a larger size body ice pack but that is expected since this has such a small mass of beads.</li>
            <li> Did everything I thought it would. Good product nothing to rave about just something to start off with in the morning</li>
            <li> Great for migraine headaches!</li>
            <li> These were bought for sinus headaches, but my dad, while on parole, used them after an all night bachelor party, and said they helped his &amp;#34;hangover.&amp;#34; Awesome!! Shipped fast. Beads smell like lavender.</li>
            <li> it very usfull for the eye it will give you the  Relaxation .you can get it  it will help your eye and head</li>
            <li> I was so worried about my eyes being puffy in the mornings and just a few minutes with this little beauty and I felt refreshed and bright eyed.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Feels pretty good. Looks like it will last and I can watch tv while I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it could cure migraines.</li>
            <li> Works well, but wish the strap was better.</li>
            <li> Wifey loved this thin. I never find these things to be terribly well made, but this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Great product for a pregnant mamma and those pesky migraines</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, good quality. Got rid of some morning puffiness around the eyes in no time. Also aided in quelling a migraine coming on. Haven&#x27;t tried it heated [I got it mainly for cold use] - but I&#x27;m confident it&#x27;d work well that way, considering the materials all seem quite durable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think fit your face like you want it or think. this is made from a hard plastic like your shower courting, so never will place on your face in a smooth way</li>

            <li> I like this, but got it in Marshalls for $3.  It&#x27;s worth it for that price.  Not sure about the $8 it&#x27;s currently listed at on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I think it is lost of money. The mask does not fit  on your face properly and pulling the skin around the eyes down.</li>
            <li> The strap is too small, and my hair gets tangled in the velcro part of the strap. Does not stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel mask itself is on the small side but dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased at a discount store where it was marked down from 6.59 to 3.99. It would be a decent price for people with small heads or who are bald.</li>
            <li> Good price, fit is okay, does what it says by providing a nice cold soothing effect.  Haven&#x27;t tried the warm option.  I store this in the freezer so when I need it, it is always ready.</li>
            <li> Have not used Cold yet but it seems to be fine when heated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I&#x27;ll put on this ice mask while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.</li>
            <li> Less beads, squishes around. Would have been a better product if it had more beads.</li>
