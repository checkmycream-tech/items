            <li>Great for people who are active who love easy no-hassle makeup!</li>

            <li>Goes on smooth and stays on.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>This is true.</li>
            <li>Pros - easy to apply, dries fast, smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Great product, doesn&#x27;t crease even after pool and extreme heat.</li>
            <li>Nice for blending with a white to help with shading</li>
            <li>Cons - mild eyelid irritation just after application, very light/pale color.</li>
            <li>Service was prompt, and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I purchased Brown Bling at my local Rite Aid and was very excited to try this product.</li>

            <li>But the whole reason I ordred this product was that it was supposed to have primer in it so it wouldn&#x27;t crease during the day.  </li>
            <li>it stays on all day long but washes off easily.  </li>
            <li>A great color -- subtle -- not harsh but noticeable.</li>
            <li>I love the color, and the texture is creamy but it has better staying power than the other much more expensive cream shadows I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Do manufacturers believe older people don&#x27;t wear eye shadow?</li>
            <li>One of the last cream eye shadows that isn&#x27;t full of glitter, though I&#x27;d prefer if it was completely matte.</li>
            <li>As I have said previously, I am so disappointed that they discontinued making this marvelous eyeshadow that applies so easily so quickly and stays on all day long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin but cannot wear this anymore.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin but cannot wear this anymore.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the application stick, but after application my eyelids started to burn like crazy &amp; swelled up for two days after wearing.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find this eye shadow in local stores any more, and so relieved when I found it here.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> so you need to keep your eyes closed for a minute to let it set up.</li>
            <li> Other reviews online said that it improves the pigmentation of powder shadows.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other colors</li>
            <li> and it was  a big hit, so as usual..</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s more annoying because it goes on wet</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow and use it as a base over the majority of my eyelid, then use a powder shadow that&#x27;s slightly darker in the crease.</li>
            <li> I have dark tanned skin, brown hair, and green eyes.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base before applying power shadow which helps the eyeshadow last longer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it creases just as badly as any other eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> Sadly I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore</li>
            <li> Too bad it was discontinued by cover girl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a base or sometimes alone for years...</li>
            <li> I hated that I couldn&#x27;t find this in any store.  </li>

            <li> I love the color and the application stick, but after application my eyelids started to burn like crazy &amp; swelled up for two days after wearing. I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin but cannot wear this anymore. bummer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not intense, its more subtle,but i like it. I would buy it again, i hope to find it in more colors</li>
            <li> I purchased Brown Bling at my local Rite Aid and was very excited to try this product. I have dark tanned skin, brown hair, and green eyes. I wished to use this product as a primer under my Loreal brown shadows. Other reviews online said that it improves the pigmentation of powder shadows. This is true. However, when used alone this seemingly brown shadow appears dusky purple/taupe on my skin. I love the color on so much more than the one in the bottle. Great product, doesn&#x27;t crease even after pool and extreme heat. Great for people who are active who love easy no-hassle makeup! I can&#x27;t wait to try the other colors</li>
            <li> I bought the beige color and love it for an under eyebrow brightner.  It stays all day and looks great.  I put it on with the want and smooth it with a shadow brush.  I went back and bought the brown to accent.  I would recommend this for all day wear.</li>
            <li> Glad to be able to find it. Too bad it was discontinued by cover girl. Really appreciate the lenght of wear and that since it is not a powder, no problems with getting into my contacts</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it can be used alone or with another eye shadow. When I am in a hurry, I just swipe it on my eyelids and am good to go!!</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow and use it as a base over the majority of my eyelid, then use a powder shadow that&#x27;s slightly darker in the crease. Great effect. Also, this eye shadow stays in place and does not gather up in my crease.</li>
            <li> This appears to be a discontinued product, wich happens when you find something that works well.  I bought it all!!</li>
            <li> I really love using this product.  Not only does it go on smoothly, it stays on for hours and hours!! I will never use another shadow again!!</li>
            <li> love this product. i use it as a basecoat for powder eyeshadow to prevent creasing--works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Nice for blending with a white to help with shading</li>
            <li> This came in three days in a cushioned envelope and was just what I wanted.  If you have never tried Cover Girl&#x27;s Lash Blast shadow with the built in primer you will love it.  Never creases.</li>
            <li> Love it. Will reorder bc I can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li> One of the last cream eye shadows that isn&#x27;t full of glitter, though I&#x27;d prefer if it was completely matte. Do manufacturers believe older people don&#x27;t wear eye shadow? We don&#x27;t want glitter on our eye lids!</li>
            <li> Easy to put on. This color  stays on for 15 hours without melting! I have one in almost every color.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye shadow and I love it.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND THEY TOOK IT OFF THE SHELVES IN MOSTLY ALL THE STORES, GOOD JOB AMAZON FOR KEEPING THIS PRODUCT FOR SALE!!!!</li>
            <li> I have somewhat oily lids and this stays on all day!  Easy to remove with coconut oil, vaseline or soap and water.  A great color -- subtle -- not harsh but noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find this eye shadow in local stores any more, and so relieved when I found it here. Service was prompt, and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as expected. This is the best eye shadow and they stopped making it. Why?! Anyway glad I could get some to put away until I find something else but haven&#x27;t yet</li>
            <li> I hated that I couldn&#x27;t find this in any store.  I bought it once and it was  a big hit, so as usual.. I searched Amazon and found it.  Perfect color, texture, etc.</li>
            <li> Love the color.  Sometimes it changes.  It can look blue, it can look gray, and can look brown.  Think it depends on what you are wearing!  Goes on smooth and lasts all day and does not crease!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a base or sometimes alone for years...love it</li>
            <li> As I have said previously, I am so disappointed that they discontinued making this marvelous eyeshadow that applies so easily so quickly and stays on all day long. Why did they discontinue it? This is the best product ever!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and stays on. Wish it was a little darker but overall a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best eye shadow that Covergirl  has come out with in the last couple of years, but of course, they no longer make it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product.  However, it creased in 30 minutes and made my eyelids feel like they were burning. That&#x27;s a shame.</li>
            <li> I love this color and how long this shadow lasts (all day without smudging). Sadly I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore (I think it has been discontinued) so I was super happy to find it here and at about the same price it was in stores.</li>
            <li> Pros - easy to apply, dries fast, smooth and creamy. Cons - mild eyelid irritation just after application, very light/pale color. I have olive/light tanned skin and the brown bling is only just visible against my skin. I use it as a base before applying power shadow which helps the eyeshadow last longer.</li>
            <li> I put this shadow on and it looked nice, but within 15 minutes it started to burn my eyelids.  Even after I removed it and put moisturizer on it continued to burn my skin for hours.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in stores anywhere and thankfully found it here!! and LOVE it!! This lasts all day and looks great</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow it stays on all day long but washes off easily.  I will keep using this until they discontinue it.  Which will be soon because they ALWAYS discontinue my favorite makeups :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye shadow for many years.  When I needed more, I could not find the product any where.  There is a reason for this.  Covergirl has stopped making it.  The only place I could find it was Amazon.  Do don&#x27;t try it and get hooked on it.</li>
            <li> Love the color and the ease which it can be applied.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time - I love the color, and the texture is creamy but it has better staying power than the other much more expensive cream shadows I&#x27;ve tried. I wish Covergirl would make this product in a couple dozen more colors!</li>
            <li> So glad I could get these as I haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere. C&#x27;mon Covergirl, bring them back!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great delivery.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye shadow I wear. It never leaves my lids until I take it off.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and haven&#x27;t had any irritation like others have talked about (and I would same I have medium-sensitive skin).  But the whole reason I ordred this product was that it was supposed to have primer in it so it wouldn&#x27;t crease during the day.  Unfortunately, it creases just as badly as any other eye shadow.  Plus it&#x27;s more annoying because it goes on wet so you need to keep your eyes closed for a minute to let it set up.</li>
            <li> BEST BEST BEST EVER PRODUCT especially if you had an eye lid surgery and have a scar .</li>
