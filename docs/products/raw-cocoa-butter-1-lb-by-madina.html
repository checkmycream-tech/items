            <li>I make my own lotions and this product is lovely to work with.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s especially good for darker skin tones, which tend to be more sensitive and should avoid chemically enhanced products.  </li>

            <li>It was packaged nice and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>The best way t break them down is to melt them and mix it with shea butter or really good olive oil to make it softer.  </li>

            <li>I am well pleased</li>
            <li>There is nothing like \\&quot;purity\\&quot; for the more melanated skin types.    </li>

            <li>It is just fantastic!</li>
            <li>I see now that the description does not say it&#x27;s edible, but also does not say it&#x27;s not food safe.</li>
            <li>perfect smell and feel, also if proper stored</li>
            <li>Im already in love with it.</li>

            <li>Thanks for making this great product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly as shown in the picture and when I opened it to examine it the smell was amazing!  </li>
            <li>This butter is better than any cellulite cream around here.</li>
            <li>Okay... I know what you&#x27;re thinking.  </li>
            <li>and I was worried that I would get more during pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, the product smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not going to be able to get it done.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Its clumpy and could have been better looking product if it had been melted before putting it in the plastic tub.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to see it come in</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>I have used it in so many things.  </li>
            <li>I love this so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised, we made lotion bars that worked wonderful and smelled good enough to eat.</li>
            <li>Nice big silky chunks great coco smell</li>
            <li>This is good for homemade facial creams and good for diaper rashes on babies.  </li>
            <li>So all in all, this seems to be an all natural product of great quality.</li>
            <li>Its works great on my skin, making it feel so soft.</li>
            <li>The seller was very quick to send out a replacement pronto.</li>
            <li>All pieces melted very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easily melts in your fingers.</li>
            <li>the benefits of this product with consistent use will please one who is looking for healthy,hydrated,radiant,supple,healing and restores complexion overall just a great product also very pleased wth qty.</li>
            <li>Which probably contains the butter just fine in lower temperatures.</li>
            <li>Some are huge chunks.</li>
            <li>The chunks of cocoa butter vary in size; I have a huge chunk that takes up 3/4 of the container.</li>
            <li>But I am concerned now, because they no longer say its \\&quot;Edible\\&quot;, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>Now its really important to</li>
            <li>I made a combo butter with this as part of the mix and it mixed great</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to smell like an Almond Joy, add some essential oils.</li>
            <li>Every night, he would appear in the light of the moon and sneak into our house.</li>
            <li>so good so far.....</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have already made a batch of lotion with it and it melted down so easy and feels so good on our skin!  </li>
            <li>The jar has in far more than I anticipated so am pleased with that.  </li>
            <li>Infuse with your favorite oil, just make sure it&#x27;s all natural like i.e. \\&quot;grape seed oil\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>Natural cocoa butter is excellent, especially if mixed with shea butter, wheat germ oil, where heated in a water bath and placed on the hair&lt;</li>
            <li>but some was really hard to get out but excellent on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that my skin looks fabulous, much  more clear and toned!!</li>
            <li>Since I wear waterproof mascara I take a piece and get it really warm under the hot water and gently start rubbing it on my eyes..</li>
            <li>i would blow to cool before pouring into hand</li>
            <li>Back in the day, I use to use Palmers cocoa butter lotion and loved the smell, so</li>
            <li>It smells good enough to eat</li>
            <li>It smelled nice, and based on other reviews, I&#x27;m sure it will work just fine for the projects I have in mind.</li>
            <li>It melted down beautifully</li>
            <li>the right amount of exfoliation, and use of the butter, I will be blemish free in no time.</li>
            <li>Not only was it large but it was packed with product, and the packaging was great.</li>
            <li>I love this Raw Cocoa Butter, the skin is so soft and smooth after you use this butter, and is very good for cellulite.</li>
            <li>i wouldnt recommend stovetop method for most but for a  well cordinated, attentive adult the safest method would be micro wich i dont use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for blending or fading dark spot and healing of stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>Where I live, cocoa butter costs over 3 times more.</li>
            <li>A billion times better than any &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; you can get, and natural as well!</li>
            <li>Seeing what this has done for my skin in the short while I have been using it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Love this item because of its natural properties as well as its ability to become liquid.</li>
            <li>smells so yummy and is so fresh.</li>
            <li>ooOh smooth and silky and best of all, after only a few applications my skin felt and looked like a baby&#x27;s too.  </li>
            <li>I love that its all natural</li>
            <li>I love that it is 100% natural.  </li>
            <li>I melted the whole thing with some coconut oil and sweet almond oil, let it cool, and then began to use it.</li>
            <li>WORTH</li>
            <li>my lotion bars, they add a distinct, chocolately smell, and it works wonders to moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smelled very nice, but it came in huge chunks which made it rather hard to handle and measure.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and found that this is good for removing stretch marks and other scars.  </li>
            <li>i love all natural products and this is the first time i bought cocoa butter in a container instead of oil form.</li>
            <li>was exactly what I needed to make all natural body products :-)</li>
            <li>But I will certainly keep in mind to order it during cooler months, and never try it in July again!</li>
            <li>It was not in block form and did not have an aroma of pure cocoa butter!</li>
            <li>Once the chucks of Cocoa Butter are completely melted turn the flame off to avoid the oil becoming too hot and popping.  </li>
            <li>I recieved this product quickly and am very happen with the quality and price.</li>
            <li>Considering I bought these to make suppositories, it&#x27;s kind of disturbing to have it smell so good.  </li>
            <li>Read all the reviews, received the product super fast.</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit surprised that it came in large chunks and wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to apply it.  </li>
            <li>Raw cocoa butter is simply the best!!</li>
            <li>good stuff, comes in a little tub like the illustration.</li>
            <li>I bought the cocoa butter on recommendation from persons that it is the only thing that would be able to lighten the spots that came up on my skin during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>First, the container was taped with packing tape, not factory sealed.</li>
            <li>The butter gets absorbed by the skin very well and does not leave greasy residue at all.</li>
            <li>, i know exactly what</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is my first time using this</li>
            <li>First I just placed pieces in foil and placed it into the toaster oven to melt and use as is.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FIRST TIME ORDERING AND USING COCOA BUTTER.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t feel comfortable using a completely opened product.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I would get the butter of Coacoa in a box as it was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>I was expecting smaller pieces or more of a butter texture, I suppose.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how to break it up, so I left it there.</li>
            <li>I particularly like to use this right after I shave to condition my skin.</li>
            <li>It came pretty fast and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it is very impractical.  </li>
            <li>This is a good size for small projects, or just to have it around.  </li>
            <li>Product comes in tub that is &amp;#34;pre chunked&amp;#34; and the larger chunks are easy to split if need be.</li>
            <li>Will not be ordering from this company again, that is certain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% pure Cocoa Butter</li>
            <li>Pure in about 3/4 to 1/2 a cup of the oil with the melted Cocoa Butter.  </li>
            <li>I bought this and 4oz of pure Emu oil.</li>
            <li>: My house smells like pure chocolate after melting this on the stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon is my go to place first when I am looking for a particular product.  </li>
            <li>It did not disappoint - very high quality product.</li>
            <li>a little warm</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend anything sold by him!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>And the price is very affordable as well.</li>
            <li>and my complexion was much lighter a very noticable diff.</li>
            <li>Then I put the whole mixture in a plastic container with a lid.</li>
            <li>, I immediately put it in a plastic container and stored until ready to use.</li>
            <li>I was very happilysurprised at the arrivial time of the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It would probably take you an hour to try to moisturize your whole body.   </li>
            <li>Really wish I&#x27;d stuck to Shea or just bought some Palmers.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>it was too much to bother with</li>
            <li>It really helps with eczema.</li>
            <li>I also used with mango and shea and really all you can smell is the cocoa.</li>
            <li>but really can&#x27;t smell it because of the cocoa butter that is used.</li>
            <li>The absolute biggest problem is that there is NO safety seal WHATSOEVER on this package.</li>
            <li>and is the real deal.</li>
            <li>now at the age of 38 im going more natural in products this butter intrigued me enough.</li>
            <li>so I did some more research and found that mixing it with another oil will keep it soft enough to be used as a cream/butter.  </li>
            <li>I bought this recently when I started making my own lotions and personal care items.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I love using this stuff</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t waste your money on this product if you live in a warm climate.</li>
            <li>I also have eczema and SEVERELY dry skin to where I can&#x27;t use anything OTC, this stuff melts into your skin immediately, leaving you absolutely smooth, no burning sensations and no bumps.</li>
            <li>im rubbing on my skin and allowing my body to absorb (especially because Im pregnant.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for Cookies and Chocolates that I make, because it&#x27;s one of the most reasonable Raw Cocoa Butters on the Market.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the other chunks were easy to work</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and leaves your skin completely moisturized</li>
            <li>Cocoa Butter has a very rich, dark chocolate flavor, and is heavenly in CHOCOLATE!  </li>
            <li>I added several different oils I had on hand to one bowl along with some rose essential oil.  </li>
            <li>However, taking a few chunks and placing them in a container and then placing them in the microwave for about 30 seconds seemed to work better.</li>
            <li>going to take me a long time to go through this bucket, but when i finally do, I will be right back here to order more.</li>
            <li>Love this product, especially during the winter months for the dry, ashy skin.  </li>
            <li>especially did not care for the strong scent it left on me.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I keep it in my bathroom and put in on my skin daily right after my shower.</li>
            <li>In the past this was a great product for Brownies and other Chocolate type desserts that I have made.</li>
            <li>NEW SCARRING..</li>
            <li>I live this product.</li>
            <li>you are new to cocoa butter</li>
            <li>You live and you learn.  </li>
            <li>YET I did not get one new stretch mark on my stomach during my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>So, until they start marketing this Raw Cocoa Butter as \\&quot;Ediable\\&quot; and safe to use in Cooking and Baking.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin and nothing else has ever helped.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much butter I lost in the process, but it&#x27;s certainly not worth the mess to attempt getting more right now.</li>
            <li>WE CANNOT PURCHASE THIS IN MY SMALL COMMUNITY AND ORDERING HERE WAS EASY AND FAST.</li>
            <li>It was pretty tasty frying up french toast in it!</li>
            <li>The cocoa smell mixes well with the scent of beeswax and many other essential oil scents.</li>
            <li>When they water got hot enough I turned it off and let it sit.  </li>
            <li>Only problem is the higher melting temperature</li>
            <li>Container was packed with small pieces and most of it was 2/3 crumbs in all 3 containers.  </li>
            <li>As im melting, i added olive oil (my favorite oil) to keep it soft and also melted in raw Mango butter</li>
            <li>Much better than the watered down forms of cocoa butter that you can buy at the local drug stores.</li>
            <li>more than half of the cocoa butter leaked out all over the entire contents of my shipment.  </li>
            <li>I prepared mine like the top comment says by melting it down and putting in a 1/4 a cup of organic EVOO and poured it in a couple of old Chinese food containers and store it in the fridge.</li>
            <li>I quickly realized that it hardens back to a solid in a matter of minutes (in the winter, I suppose).  </li>
            <li>While it still becomes a solid, it is still soft enough that your fingers can dig in and it quickly melts in your palms when you rub them together.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is a certain kick when you open the jar to smell it.</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to because it isn&#x27;t smooth and creamy until you rub it in your hands</li>
            <li>so I am kind of skeptical about whether it is truly pure cocoa butter..</li>
            <li>oven mit for removal)the key is DONT over heat maybe 2-3 min on low if you see bubbles it too HOT! or can try micro method..</li>
            <li>My daughter is 2 months old today</li>
            <li>Use it for your heals, knees, elbows, or all over for soft conditioned skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried writing directly to the company to find if this is still \\&quot;Edible\\&quot; Cocoa Butter, but have not receieved an answer yet.</li>
            <li>I soften it either my microwave, for mixing, or hair dryer for direct application.</li>
            <li>it could last very long&lt;</li>
            <li>and I wake up every morning with my face ready again for the next day without face lotion..</li>
            <li>MY 4 yr old GRANDDAUGHTER INSISTED THAT I SHARE WITH HER.</li>
            <li>SO I ORDERED HER A CONTAINER FOR HER SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for an all natural moisturizer for a while</li>
            <li>An old man (I can&#x27;t remember how to pronounce the title the man possessed) made this mixture to place on the victims and it hid the scars/marks.</li>
            <li>The butter softened the look of the marks/scars but it didn&#x27;t make them go away completely.</li>
            <li>This item came quickly, packaged like the photo with large pieces and small pieces.  </li>
            <li>I usually apply it after shower on warm and wet skin and rub it in energetically so that moisture is sealed in.</li>
            <li>So first impression: awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never smelled pure, raw cocoa butter before</li>
            <li>I bought this product because for the first time in my life I have developed extra dry skin and severe itchiness about my body from the winter weather.  </li>
            <li>I make a chocolate mint body butter, and I think I have ordered from this same place multiple times (3-4), and it always comes fast, the quality is just what I need for my homemade beauty products and they never disappoint me.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I also apply this in my hair, right down to my scalp</li>
            <li>and i have no other choice than to microwave it each time I use it which defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>The hard part is that it comes in huge chucks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it for pregnant women its a odd smell and very time consuming to apply because you have to melt it down not what i wanted ...</li>
            <li>I have recommended RAW cocoa butter to all of my pregnant friends</li>
            <li>it is summer and clearly the package was left in the sun...</li>
            <li>so it only makes sense that I have natural Cocoa Butter.  </li>
            <li>It only helped the victims not feel so conscious about themselves.</li>
            <li>The texture of the butter is thick and smooth.</li>
            <li>Cocoa Butter in raw form is a great product to use on skin or as a base for homemade, chemical free deodorant.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to&lt;br /&gt;Using the handy chunks, but unfortunately my grandson left it by&lt;br</li>
            <li>~First remove the chucks from the container and melt it down in a pot over a low flame.  </li>
            <li>spoon gets a little hot and butter oil</li>
            <li>the latter I never expected .  </li>
            <li>As soon as I ran back in the house I wasted no time to pull the box open and at first I was surprised at how big the container was.</li>
            <li>I love this RAW COCOA BUTTER!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an amateur at making body products, but this was so easy to melt and mix into other things.</li>
            <li>first time purchase of the cocoa butter, it is firm, chunks and smaller chunks</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used raw cocoa butter</li>
            <li>so it has a wonderful faint chocolate smell, its hard, and a little waxy to the touch.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Okay... I know what you&#x27;re thinking.  </li>
            <li> and I was worried that I would get more during pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, the product smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not going to be able to get it done.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Its clumpy and could have been better looking product if it had been melted before putting it in the plastic tub.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to see it come in</li>

            <li> Which probably contains the butter just fine in lower temperatures.</li>
            <li> Some are huge chunks.</li>
            <li> The chunks of cocoa butter vary in size; I have a huge chunk that takes up 3/4 of the container.</li>
            <li> But I am concerned now, because they no longer say its \\&quot;Edible\\&quot;, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> Now its really important to</li>
            <li> I made a combo butter with this as part of the mix and it mixed great</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to smell like an Almond Joy, add some essential oils.</li>
            <li> Every night, he would appear in the light of the moon and sneak into our house.</li>
            <li> so good so far.....</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have already made a batch of lotion with it and it melted down so easy and feels so good on our skin!  </li>
            <li> The jar has in far more than I anticipated so am pleased with that.  </li>
            <li> Infuse with your favorite oil, just make sure it&#x27;s all natural like i.e. \\&quot;grape seed oil\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> Natural cocoa butter is excellent, especially if mixed with shea butter, wheat germ oil, where heated in a water bath and placed on the hair&lt;</li>
            <li> but some was really hard to get out but excellent on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my skin looks fabulous, much  more clear and toned!!</li>
            <li> Since I wear waterproof mascara I take a piece and get it really warm under the hot water and gently start rubbing it on my eyes..</li>
            <li> i would blow to cool before pouring into hand</li>
            <li> Back in the day, I use to use Palmers cocoa butter lotion and loved the smell, so</li>
            <li> It smells good enough to eat</li>
            <li> It smelled nice, and based on other reviews, I&#x27;m sure it will work just fine for the projects I have in mind.</li>
            <li> It melted down beautifully</li>
            <li> the right amount of exfoliation, and use of the butter, I will be blemish free in no time.</li>
            <li> Not only was it large but it was packed with product, and the packaging was great.</li>
            <li> I love this Raw Cocoa Butter, the skin is so soft and smooth after you use this butter, and is very good for cellulite.</li>
            <li> i wouldnt recommend stovetop method for most but for a  well cordinated, attentive adult the safest method would be micro wich i dont use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for blending or fading dark spot and healing of stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> Where I live, cocoa butter costs over 3 times more.</li>
            <li> A billion times better than any &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; you can get, and natural as well!</li>
            <li> Seeing what this has done for my skin in the short while I have been using it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this item because of its natural properties as well as its ability to become liquid.</li>
            <li> smells so yummy and is so fresh.</li>
            <li> ooOh smooth and silky and best of all, after only a few applications my skin felt and looked like a baby&#x27;s too.  </li>
            <li> I love that its all natural</li>
            <li> I love that it is 100% natural.  </li>
            <li> I melted the whole thing with some coconut oil and sweet almond oil, let it cool, and then began to use it.</li>
            <li> WORTH</li>
            <li> my lotion bars, they add a distinct, chocolately smell, and it works wonders to moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smelled very nice, but it came in huge chunks which made it rather hard to handle and measure.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and found that this is good for removing stretch marks and other scars.  </li>
            <li> i love all natural products and this is the first time i bought cocoa butter in a container instead of oil form.</li>
            <li> was exactly what I needed to make all natural body products :-)</li>
            <li> But I will certainly keep in mind to order it during cooler months, and never try it in July again!</li>
            <li> It was not in block form and did not have an aroma of pure cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> Once the chucks of Cocoa Butter are completely melted turn the flame off to avoid the oil becoming too hot and popping.  </li>
            <li> I recieved this product quickly and am very happen with the quality and price.</li>
            <li> Considering I bought these to make suppositories, it&#x27;s kind of disturbing to have it smell so good.  </li>
            <li> Read all the reviews, received the product super fast.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit surprised that it came in large chunks and wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to apply it.  </li>
            <li> Raw cocoa butter is simply the best!!</li>
            <li> good stuff, comes in a little tub like the illustration.</li>
            <li> I bought the cocoa butter on recommendation from persons that it is the only thing that would be able to lighten the spots that came up on my skin during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> First, the container was taped with packing tape, not factory sealed.</li>
            <li> The butter gets absorbed by the skin very well and does not leave greasy residue at all.</li>
            <li> , i know exactly what</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is my first time using this</li>
            <li> First I just placed pieces in foil and placed it into the toaster oven to melt and use as is.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FIRST TIME ORDERING AND USING COCOA BUTTER.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t feel comfortable using a completely opened product.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I would get the butter of Coacoa in a box as it was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> I was expecting smaller pieces or more of a butter texture, I suppose.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how to break it up, so I left it there.</li>
            <li> I particularly like to use this right after I shave to condition my skin.</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it is very impractical.  </li>
            <li> This is a good size for small projects, or just to have it around.  </li>
            <li> Product comes in tub that is &amp;#34;pre chunked&amp;#34; and the larger chunks are easy to split if need be.</li>
            <li> Will not be ordering from this company again, that is certain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% pure Cocoa Butter</li>
            <li> Pure in about 3/4 to 1/2 a cup of the oil with the melted Cocoa Butter.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and 4oz of pure Emu oil.</li>
            <li> : My house smells like pure chocolate after melting this on the stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon is my go to place first when I am looking for a particular product.  </li>
            <li> It did not disappoint - very high quality product.</li>
            <li> a little warm</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend anything sold by him!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> And the price is very affordable as well.</li>
            <li> and my complexion was much lighter a very noticable diff.</li>
            <li> Then I put the whole mixture in a plastic container with a lid.</li>
            <li> , I immediately put it in a plastic container and stored until ready to use.</li>
            <li> I was very happilysurprised at the arrivial time of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It would probably take you an hour to try to moisturize your whole body.   </li>
            <li> Really wish I&#x27;d stuck to Shea or just bought some Palmers.</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> it was too much to bother with</li>
            <li> It really helps with eczema.</li>
            <li> I also used with mango and shea and really all you can smell is the cocoa.</li>
            <li> but really can&#x27;t smell it because of the cocoa butter that is used.</li>
            <li> The absolute biggest problem is that there is NO safety seal WHATSOEVER on this package.</li>
            <li> and is the real deal.</li>
            <li> now at the age of 38 im going more natural in products this butter intrigued me enough.</li>
            <li> so I did some more research and found that mixing it with another oil will keep it soft enough to be used as a cream/butter.  </li>
            <li> I bought this recently when I started making my own lotions and personal care items.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I love using this stuff</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this product if you live in a warm climate.</li>
            <li> I also have eczema and SEVERELY dry skin to where I can&#x27;t use anything OTC, this stuff melts into your skin immediately, leaving you absolutely smooth, no burning sensations and no bumps.</li>
            <li> im rubbing on my skin and allowing my body to absorb (especially because Im pregnant.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for Cookies and Chocolates that I make, because it&#x27;s one of the most reasonable Raw Cocoa Butters on the Market.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the other chunks were easy to work</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast and leaves your skin completely moisturized</li>
            <li> Cocoa Butter has a very rich, dark chocolate flavor, and is heavenly in CHOCOLATE!  </li>
            <li> I added several different oils I had on hand to one bowl along with some rose essential oil.  </li>
            <li> However, taking a few chunks and placing them in a container and then placing them in the microwave for about 30 seconds seemed to work better.</li>
            <li> going to take me a long time to go through this bucket, but when i finally do, I will be right back here to order more.</li>
            <li> Love this product, especially during the winter months for the dry, ashy skin.  </li>
            <li> especially did not care for the strong scent it left on me.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I keep it in my bathroom and put in on my skin daily right after my shower.</li>
            <li> In the past this was a great product for Brownies and other Chocolate type desserts that I have made.</li>
            <li> NEW SCARRING..</li>
            <li> I live this product.</li>
            <li> you are new to cocoa butter</li>
            <li> You live and you learn.  </li>
            <li> YET I did not get one new stretch mark on my stomach during my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> So, until they start marketing this Raw Cocoa Butter as \\&quot;Ediable\\&quot; and safe to use in Cooking and Baking.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and nothing else has ever helped.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much butter I lost in the process, but it&#x27;s certainly not worth the mess to attempt getting more right now.</li>
            <li> WE CANNOT PURCHASE THIS IN MY SMALL COMMUNITY AND ORDERING HERE WAS EASY AND FAST.</li>
            <li> It was pretty tasty frying up french toast in it!</li>
            <li> The cocoa smell mixes well with the scent of beeswax and many other essential oil scents.</li>
            <li> When they water got hot enough I turned it off and let it sit.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is the higher melting temperature</li>
            <li> Container was packed with small pieces and most of it was 2/3 crumbs in all 3 containers.  </li>
            <li> As im melting, i added olive oil (my favorite oil) to keep it soft and also melted in raw Mango butter</li>
            <li> Much better than the watered down forms of cocoa butter that you can buy at the local drug stores.</li>
            <li> more than half of the cocoa butter leaked out all over the entire contents of my shipment.  </li>
            <li> I prepared mine like the top comment says by melting it down and putting in a 1/4 a cup of organic EVOO and poured it in a couple of old Chinese food containers and store it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> I quickly realized that it hardens back to a solid in a matter of minutes (in the winter, I suppose).  </li>
            <li> While it still becomes a solid, it is still soft enough that your fingers can dig in and it quickly melts in your palms when you rub them together.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is a certain kick when you open the jar to smell it.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to because it isn&#x27;t smooth and creamy until you rub it in your hands</li>
            <li> so I am kind of skeptical about whether it is truly pure cocoa butter..</li>
            <li> oven mit for removal)the key is DONT over heat maybe 2-3 min on low if you see bubbles it too HOT! or can try micro method..</li>
            <li> My daughter is 2 months old today</li>
            <li> Use it for your heals, knees, elbows, or all over for soft conditioned skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried writing directly to the company to find if this is still \\&quot;Edible\\&quot; Cocoa Butter, but have not receieved an answer yet.</li>
            <li> I soften it either my microwave, for mixing, or hair dryer for direct application.</li>
            <li> it could last very long&lt;</li>
            <li> and I wake up every morning with my face ready again for the next day without face lotion..</li>
            <li> MY 4 yr old GRANDDAUGHTER INSISTED THAT I SHARE WITH HER.</li>
            <li> SO I ORDERED HER A CONTAINER FOR HER SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an all natural moisturizer for a while</li>
            <li> An old man (I can&#x27;t remember how to pronounce the title the man possessed) made this mixture to place on the victims and it hid the scars/marks.</li>
            <li> The butter softened the look of the marks/scars but it didn&#x27;t make them go away completely.</li>
            <li> This item came quickly, packaged like the photo with large pieces and small pieces.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply it after shower on warm and wet skin and rub it in energetically so that moisture is sealed in.</li>
            <li> So first impression: awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never smelled pure, raw cocoa butter before</li>
            <li> I bought this product because for the first time in my life I have developed extra dry skin and severe itchiness about my body from the winter weather.  </li>
            <li> I make a chocolate mint body butter, and I think I have ordered from this same place multiple times (3-4), and it always comes fast, the quality is just what I need for my homemade beauty products and they never disappoint me.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also apply this in my hair, right down to my scalp</li>
            <li> and i have no other choice than to microwave it each time I use it which defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> The hard part is that it comes in huge chucks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it for pregnant women its a odd smell and very time consuming to apply because you have to melt it down not what i wanted ...</li>
            <li> I have recommended RAW cocoa butter to all of my pregnant friends</li>
            <li> it is summer and clearly the package was left in the sun...</li>
            <li> so it only makes sense that I have natural Cocoa Butter.  </li>
            <li> It only helped the victims not feel so conscious about themselves.</li>
            <li> The texture of the butter is thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> Cocoa Butter in raw form is a great product to use on skin or as a base for homemade, chemical free deodorant.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to&lt;br /&gt;Using the handy chunks, but unfortunately my grandson left it by&lt;br</li>
            <li> ~First remove the chucks from the container and melt it down in a pot over a low flame.  </li>
            <li> spoon gets a little hot and butter oil</li>
            <li> the latter I never expected .  </li>
            <li> As soon as I ran back in the house I wasted no time to pull the box open and at first I was surprised at how big the container was.</li>
            <li> I love this RAW COCOA BUTTER!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an amateur at making body products, but this was so easy to melt and mix into other things.</li>
            <li> first time purchase of the cocoa butter, it is firm, chunks and smaller chunks</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used raw cocoa butter</li>
            <li> so it has a wonderful faint chocolate smell, its hard, and a little waxy to the touch.  </li>
            <li> In addition to all over body my specific favorite is using a small piece on my dry cuticles, it has helped a lot over a few applications.</li>
            <li> It is softening and healing when mixed with other ingredients for a complete lotion or salve.</li>
            <li> can melt over stove with large spoon for small applications (face) tip:</li>
            <li> I received it in no time flat.</li>
            <li> I think I will be using this same tub for a long time!</li>
            <li> my skin is dry and this product left my skin moisturized and hydrated .</li>
            <li> I started finding cat or dog hairs; I found probably 5 long animal hairs.  </li>
            <li> Too long have my family</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter arrived as described, in large chunks with some smaller broken up pieces at the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li> I continue to use it for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Once it is melted down and mixed with a little extra virgin olive oil, it&#x27;s second to none!</li>
            <li> But with the 100 degree heat we&#x27;ve been experiencing the last few days, the butter melted and oozed out of the jar all over the package, through the cardboard box and apparently onto other packages in the delivery truck.</li>
            <li> I suffered from pityriasis rosea, and I was left with dark blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I make chocolate candy bars that are dark and regular chocolate.</li>
            <li> The spirits would make their mark upon a victim and haunt him or her.</li>
            <li> The marks would scar the victim for life leaving them with shame and humiliation.</li>
            <li> As a victim of Cerebus, I ordered the butter of Cocoa after reading the legend.</li>
            <li> As it is raw, it is in chunks, some bigger, some smaller.</li>
            <li> immediately put it in a double boiler to melt it down.</li>
            <li> I melted the butter down and mixed it with olive oil.  </li>
            <li> , they give you some good pieces and some bad or really small pieces.</li>
            <li> So disappointed to throw a whole batch of white chocolate out when the whole thing tasted flowery/soapy....</li>
            <li> The butter itself was great quality, but very disappointed about the animal hairs, I had to throw the rest away.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t melt the cocoa butter down as other suggested, b/c I read that doing so can destroy some of the natural properties of  cocoa.</li>
            <li> I will definitely give an update in a few months.</li>
            <li> But once I received the treasure, it was as I expected it.</li>
            <li> I chose extra virgin olive oil to mix with the raw cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> I mixed the raw cocoa butter with sesame oil</li>
            <li> usually i would  melt enough for head to toe coverage inside a durable non painted, without handle style of ceramic cup</li>
            <li> I plan to melt it into other products to make a lotion</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t ship well in extreme heat, as some oozed out around the edges, but what are you doing to do?  </li>
            <li> What I did was mix a little with almond oil and use it as a lotion or moisturizer which works for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It was kind of a heavy annoying smell; to me anyway.</li>
            <li> like I was was, and founds several dairy free/sugar free recipes for white chocolate with cocoa butter as the start ingredient, you&#x27;ll be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brand of cocoa butter to anyone who has dark spots or scars that need clearing up.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve notice the dark areas on my face</li>
            <li> Of late my legs have become scaly and my back and arms and legs have cuts and scrapes from my fingernails digging in.  </li>
            <li> I also did the same with just plain cocoa butter and have a small block of that also in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to break it down.  </li>
            <li> down before I can use it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a slight difference in the appearance of my skin</li>
            <li> I took about half of this tub</li>
            <li> Afterward I poured the cocoa into a bowl and used my handheld mixer and added about half the bottle of Emu oil.</li>
            <li> It was half gone cause it melted and leaked out when I got it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the real raw coco butter as advertised.</li>
            <li> This stuff showed up as rock hard lumps and you can mess with it for minutes and only end up with a small greasy coating on your hands.</li>
            <li> This item is the second item down on a search for &amp;#34;edible raw cocoa butter&amp;#34; so wood chips are a serious issue - Amazon may need to revise their search protocol.</li>
            <li> and it smells a little bit like chocolate</li>
            <li> I just heated up some water, put the chucks in a plastic sandwich bag, put the bag in the water for a few minutes until the cocoa butter melted, then put the bags in the freezer until it harden up again.</li>
            <li> I got tired of heating it up twice daily</li>
            <li> and it was quit heavy as a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I run my hands through my hair a few times.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a body butter, but the consistency was to hard; even after melting it down.</li>
            <li> No weird odors or bad texture.</li>
            <li> Buying another container to make some raw brownies with.  </li>
            <li> I was advised to use raw cocoa butter to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I use both raw cocoa butter and shea butter for my eczema prone skin.  </li>
            <li> It is truly raw and not refined, and it smells like chocolate.</li>
            <li> The raw tag is misleading - I thought this was edible cocoa butter</li>
            <li> that you make raw food desserts from.</li>
            <li> We must obtain raw butter of Cocoa.</li>
            <li> My mom and I both have very sensitive skins and cannot use any artificial products.</li>
            <li> I let it harden for a little bit until you could poke your finger but not too hard that it&#x27;s solidified.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard though so you would need to heat it up a little bit in the microwave in order to use it.</li>
            <li> When my Cocoa Butter arrived, I found that I had a lot of small pieces in my batch.</li>
            <li> Oh and the cocoa butter will harden a bit, but you just put a small chunk in your palms and rub your hands together, the cocoa will melt in your hands</li>
            <li> I poured it into a small glass container and put it in the freezer for 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> I turned the small block of butter out and keep it in a jar in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I break off a small piece at a time and keep it in a container in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I warmed the chunks of cocoa butter in a small pan on the stove to melt them.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for myself but everyone in the family loves the smell and can&#x27;t resist walking past a block to rub it on their hands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered raw Shea Butter on the past and though it starts off thick it immediatly melts in your hand.</li>
            <li> I know some people had a hard time trying to figure out how to use it</li>
            <li> Now I have a pound of chocolate smelling, soap tasting, rock hard chunks to fool with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any hopes it will prevent them, but at least I keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> No graininess noted as others had complained about.  </li>
            <li> , i put a very small on my fingertips and rubbed it til&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to receive this product in a clear bag (not in a jar as pictured) without any labels, not even to describe (or confirm) the ingredients...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also very hard</li>
            <li> I complained to the company and they said this is impossible.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this just didn&#x27;t work out in my favor.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I will never buy this product again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I took photo&#x27;s to verify and then they said it is too expensive for them to replace the product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re wrong.  </li>
            <li> Legend goes the people of Cocoa used the butter to ward off evil spirits, Cerebus, who tormented them in their sleep and their daily lives.</li>
            <li> I have an allergy to artificial fragrance</li>
            <li> it will leave a grainy feeling on your skin which is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> (I had bad acne as a kid)</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> I just received my order yesterday, from a very unhappy UPS driver.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;d whisper awful things into our ears like,</li>
            <li> One day I ventured to the library and found an ancient book on how to get rid of this awful night fiend.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent quality and was delivered as promised. I use this product to make my own hand cream. I will definitely reorder this product again.  Amazon is my go to place first when I am looking for a particular product.  Thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> Very excellent and I would recommend everyone Ptejrebha&lt;br /&gt;Beneficial to the body and good Ra√∫ana and not troublesome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liked a lot and will buy it again</li>
            <li> Love this item because of its natural properties as well as its ability to become liquid. What I did was mix a little with almond oil and use it as a lotion or moisturizer which works for my dry skin. I recommend this item it is top notch!!!!!</li>
            <li> more than half of the cocoa butter leaked out all over the entire contents of my shipment.  it is summer and clearly the package was left in the sun... but, one would think that the container would &amp;#34;contain&amp;#34; the product in it&#x27;s liquid or solid form.  don&#x27;t waste your money on this product if you live in a warm climate.</li>
            <li> smells so yummy and is so fresh. you can either eat it out of the jar or use it as lotion under your eyes. so fantastically fabulous! highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got the product promptly and am very happy with it so far. The jar has in far more than I anticipated so am pleased with that.  I bought the cocoa butter on recommendation from persons that it is the only thing that would be able to lighten the spots that came up on my skin during my pregnancy. My daughter is 2 months old today and I&#x27;ve seen a slight difference in the appearance of my skin so good so far.....</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit surprised that it came in large chunks and wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to apply it.  Don&#x27;t try to break it down.  Just grab a chunk and start rubbing into your skin. That is the best way to apply this product.  It is great in the summer because it is a bit thinner in application and absorbs quicker into the skin then the shea butter.  This is really good stuff!  Love it!  The smell of cocoa is great too!  I will never buy over the counter skin lotions again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I suffered from pityriasis rosea, and I was left with dark blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I melted the butter and combined it with my cocoa butter lotion, and it has been working miracles.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks and feels heavenly. My blemishes are clearing up.&lt;br /&gt;With the right amount of exfoliation, and use of the butter, I will be blemish free in no time.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter arrived as described, in large chunks with some smaller broken up pieces at the bottom of the container. It was obvious that this was home packaged for several reasons. First, the container was taped with packing tape, not factory sealed. That was not an issue, sometimes you can get the best deals this way.   However, when I got 1/2 way through the cocoa butter I started finding cat or dog hairs; I found probably 5 long animal hairs.  The butter itself was great quality, but very disappointed about the animal hairs, I had to throw the rest away. Will not be ordering from this company again, that is certain.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  It came pretty fast and well packaged.  It&#x27;s 100% pure Cocoa Butter so it has a wonderful faint chocolate smell, its hard, and a little waxy to the touch.  However, it works wonders for the skin if you know how to use it. I know some people had a hard time trying to figure out how to use it so I have provided some instructions if you want to try it.      ~First remove the chucks from the container and melt it down in a pot over a low flame.  Once the chucks of Cocoa Butter are completely melted turn the flame off to avoid the oil becoming too hot and popping.  Infuse with your favorite oil, just make sure it&#x27;s all natural like i.e. \\&quot;grape seed oil\\&quot;, \\&quot;emu oil\\&quot;, or an \\&quot;olive oil\\&quot;.  Pure in about 3/4 to 1/2 a cup of the oil with the melted Cocoa Butter.  Mix it in then put the mixture into a plastic container with a lid and put it in freezer over night.  In the morning you will have a softer more usable product the melts when you rub it in your hands.  Use it for your heals, knees, elbows, or all over for soft conditioned skin.  It absorbs fast and leaves your skin completely moisturized it&#x27;s great for blending or fading dark spot and healing of stretch marks.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and the USPS smashed the lid during shipping. The seller was very quick to send out a replacement pronto. I received it in no time flat. Shipper knows and gives EXCELLENT customer service and I would highly recommend anything sold by him! This is a quality product and the aroma of melting chocolate is ALWAYS a winner in my book. Since it is BUTTER its going to be greasy. It was pretty tasty frying up french toast in it!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time. I am well pleased and I would recommedn this shipper.</li>
            <li> Perfect for candy making</li>
            <li> I love this RAW COCOA BUTTER!!!  Once it is melted down and mixed with a little extra virgin olive oil, it&#x27;s second to none! It&#x27;s GREAT for any type of skin repair and/or maintenance.  It feels so-ooOh smooth and silky and best of all, after only a few applications my skin felt and looked like a baby&#x27;s too.  I would recommend this brand of cocoa butter to anyone who has dark spots or scars that need clearing up.  I think it&#x27;s especially good for darker skin tones, which tend to be more sensitive and should avoid chemically enhanced products.  There is nothing like \\&quot;purity\\&quot; for the more melanated skin types.    C.A, Los Angeles</li>
            <li> I recieved this product quickly and am very happen with the quality and price. I have been making salves and lotions and lip balms with it for gifts and I love it! The cocoa smell is strong but absolutely wonderful!  It smells SO good you might crave chocolate after getting a whiff. The cocoa smell mixes well with the scent of beeswax and many other essential oil scents. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i got the butter in chunks , it has a nice chocolate but strong smell :)  it&#x27;s also very hard , i put a very small on my fingertips and rubbed it til&#x27; it turned to oil , and massaged it on my face :)  veeery moisturizing ^_^</li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times, and love it. But I am concerned now, because they no longer say its \\&quot;Edible\\&quot;, which is important to me. I have been using it for Cookies and Chocolates that I make, because it&#x27;s one of the most reasonable Raw Cocoa Butters on the Market. I have tried writing directly to the company to find if this is still \\&quot;Edible\\&quot; Cocoa Butter, but have not receieved an answer yet. So, my quess is that it&#x27;s not \\&quot;Edible\\&quot; So, until they start marketing this Raw Cocoa Butter as \\&quot;Ediable\\&quot; and safe to use in Cooking and Baking. I will have to stop Using it. :-( I hope things will change soon. In the past this was a great product for Brownies and other Chocolate type desserts that I have made. NO I AM NOT SCARED OF SATURATED FAT. . . . . .SATURATED FAT IS NOT WHAT CAUSES HEART DESEASE. Anyway, I hope this Company will look into selling it again as a Butter that can be used in foods.</li>
            <li> This item is a must have for anyone who want to have or maintain beautiful healthy skin. I am a repeat customer and will only by this brand. The item is shipped and remain in excellent form.</li>
            <li> I am a chocolate lover so it only makes sense that I have natural Cocoa Butter.  The hard part is that it comes in huge chucks. The best way t break them down is to melt them and mix it with shea butter or really good olive oil to make it softer.  I bought my pound of Cocoa Butter in April 2011 and I still have 2 chunks left.  I love Halaleveryday for the products they provide and i will continue to buy my butters from them.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this Shea Butter.  The price was great and the product exceeded my expectations.  It can be used alone or mixed with another oil lotion.  I soften it either my microwave, for mixing, or hair dryer for direct application.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.  Great for my homemade mixture with shea butter.</li>
            <li> No label saying it is edible!  According to seller it is edible, however, we decided not to eat it... Besides, it does not have an expiry date!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the quality of this cocoa butter. As it is raw, it is in chunks, some bigger, some smaller. It does not melt or soften at room temperature. To apply it on my skin, I melt it in my hands or briefly over the gas burner in a spoon. The butter has a strong and pleasant cocoa powder aroma which disappears after application on the skin. The texture of the butter is thick and smooth. This is great for skin, especially thin facial skin. I usually apply it after shower on warm and wet skin and rub it in energetically so that moisture is sealed in. The butter gets absorbed by the skin very well and does not leave greasy residue at all. My mom and I both have very sensitive skins and cannot use any artificial products. I&#x27;m glad to say that the cocoa butter does not irritate even if it gets in the eyes. So all in all, this seems to be an all natural product of great quality. And the price is very affordable as well. Where I live, cocoa butter costs over 3 times more.</li>
            <li> This product came packaged as pictured, not wrapped in plastic like one review stated. It has a lovely chocolate scent as it&#x27;s not de-scented. It&#x27;s definitely the real raw coco butter as advertised. I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!...when i was around 20 i would steam my face and apply otc cocoa butter every nite for a couple of weeks and my complexion was much lighter a very noticable diff. and i credit that to the healing properties of cocoa butter. now at the age of 38 im going more natural in products this butter intrigued me enough. usually i would  melt enough for head to toe coverage inside a durable non painted, without handle style of ceramic cup (maybee hand made) tip:stove top heating method(use oven mit for removal)the key is DONT over heat maybe 2-3 min on low if you see bubbles it too HOT! or can try micro method.. havent tried micro...can melt over stove with large spoon for small applications (face) tip:spoon gets a little hot and butter oil a little warm i would blow to cool before pouring into hand i wouldnt recommend stovetop method for most but for a  well cordinated, attentive adult the safest method would be micro wich i dont use. the benefits of this product with consistent use will please one who is looking for healthy,hydrated,radiant,supple,healing and restores complexion overall just a great product also very pleased wth qty. recieved and it also has a great aroma. this butter requires a bit more work than your avg. lotion but its worth the effort....  ENJOY!!!!!!!! and be safe</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a body butter, but the consistency was to hard; even after melting it down. Unfortunately this just didn&#x27;t work out in my favor. I tried mixing it with extra virgin olive oil to give it a smoother feel, but its still not doing the trick.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have always used it to get ride of my scars.  It works well and I will gladly purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to receive this product in a clear bag (not in a jar as pictured) without any labels, not even to describe (or confirm) the ingredients... The butter didn&#x27;t smell anything close to the cocoa butter I&#x27;ve purchased before from another source so I am kind of skeptical about whether it is truly pure cocoa butter.. I am using it in a mixture with coconut oil to prevent stretchmarks during my pregnancy. I don&#x27;t have any hopes it will prevent them, but at least I keep my skin moisturized. I will not be repurchasing this product once I run out.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. When my Cocoa Butter arrived, I found that I had a lot of small pieces in my batch. Not a problem at all! I just heated up some water, put the chucks in a plastic sandwich bag, put the bag in the water for a few minutes until the cocoa butter melted, then put the bags in the freezer until it harden up again. Once that happens, take the chucks out of the bag and put it back into the container. Now when I need to moisture my skin, I just pick up a chuck and start rubbing it on my skin! Just note that you can&#x27;t put this stuff on your skin in it&#x27;s liquid state, or else it will leave a grainy feeling on your skin which is unpleasant. Other than that, I love using this stuff and I&#x27;ve notice the dark areas on my face (I had bad acne as a kid) has started to lighten up. It also leaves a chocolate smell on your skin which is lovely. Can&#x27;t wait to get some more.</li>
            <li> Natural cocoa butter is excellent, especially if mixed with shea butter, wheat germ oil, where heated in a water bath and placed on the hair&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great butter and cocoa smell normal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ÿ≤ÿ®ÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÉÿßŸÉÿßŸà ÿßŸÑÿ∑ÿ®ŸäÿπŸäÿ© ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ÿ© ÿÆÿµŸàÿµÿß ÿ•ÿ∞ÿß ÿÆŸÑÿ∑ÿ™ ŸÖÿπ ÿ≤ÿ®ÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¥Ÿäÿß Ÿàÿ≤Ÿäÿ™ ÿ¨ŸÜŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÇŸÖÿ≠ ÿ≠Ÿäÿ´ ÿ™ÿ≥ÿÆŸÜ ÿØÿßÿÆŸÑ ÿ®ÿ≠ŸÖÿßŸÖ ŸÖÿßÿ¶Ÿä Ÿàÿ™Ÿàÿ∂ÿπ ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿπÿ±&lt;br /&gt;ÿ£ŸÜŸáÿß ÿ≤ÿ®ÿØÿ© ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿπŸá Ÿàÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿ≠ÿ™Ÿáÿß ŸÉÿßŸÉÿßŸà ÿ∑ÿ®ŸäÿπŸä</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! I bought this and 4oz of pure Emu oil. I took about half of this tub and I put it in a food processor. Afterward I poured the cocoa into a bowl and used my handheld mixer and added about half the bottle of Emu oil. I mixed it on a medium setting until it had the consistency of butter. Then I put the whole mixture in a plastic container with a lid. I keep it in my bathroom and put in on my skin daily right after my shower. My skin is soooooooo smooth and smells of chocolate! I feel soft and delicious after applying! Oh and the cocoa butter will harden a bit, but you just put a small chunk in your palms and rub your hands together, the cocoa will melt in your hands then you can apply.&lt;br /&gt; P.S. I didn&#x27;t melt the cocoa butter down as other suggested, b/c I read that doing so can destroy some of the natural properties of  cocoa. I also didn&#x27;t freeze or refrigerate, after I mixed the oil and cocoa, I immediately put it in a plastic container and stored until ready to use.</li>
            <li> This item came quickly, packaged like the photo with large pieces and small pieces.  I put a glass bowl in a pot of water and added several pieces to the bowl.  When they water got hot enough I turned it off and let it sit.  All pieces melted very quickly.  I added several different oils I had on hand to one bowl along with some rose essential oil.  I poured it into a small glass container and put it in the freezer for 2 hours.  I turned the small block of butter out and keep it in a jar in the bathroom.  I also did the same with just plain cocoa butter and have a small block of that also in the bathroom.  Also made one up for my daughters house.  I have super dry skin and nothing else has ever helped.  I&#x27;ve only used it for two days now, but I will try to update when I have used it a bit longer.  I love the smell of this cocoa butter.  No graininess noted as others had complained about.  I plan to use this is a brownie recipe.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. Some reviews said they left the cocoa butter out at room temperature and it melted. The cocoa butter I received never melts and i have no other choice than to microwave it each time I use it which defeats the purpose. Unfortunately I will never buy this product again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Just used this to make chapstick, and have many more recipes in store for this product! It is just fantastic! Smells and feels great!  Would definatly recommend and would purchase more!</li>
            <li> Product smells awesome. However, it has wood chips in it. I find 5-10 slivers of wood per oz. This item is the second item down on a search for &amp;#34;edible raw cocoa butter&amp;#34; so wood chips are a serious issue - Amazon may need to revise their search protocol. I see now that the description does not say it&#x27;s edible, but also does not say it&#x27;s not food safe. And frankly, wood chips would be undesirable for use in a cosmetic anyway.</li>
            <li> I make chocolate candy bars that are dark and regular chocolate. This is great for making fudge and chocolate, but with chocolate candy bars there is no liquid anything and milk chocolate has no milk or grainy milk powder.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotions and this product is lovely to work with. Nice big silky chunks great coco smell</li>
            <li> It does Softens skin, but i liked it more because it makes you and the shower smell like chocolate :)</li>
            <li> I literally just got my cocoa butter in the mail today. As soon as I ran back in the house I wasted no time to pull the box open and at first I was surprised at how big the container was. Not only was it large but it was packed with product, and the packaging was great. So first impression: awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never smelled pure, raw cocoa butter before so when i opened the lid and inhaled I was in chocolate heaven. I am so amazed at how this stuff smells. I was going to put essential oils in it but decided against it after smelling this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately put it in a double boiler to melt it down. As im melting, i added olive oil (my favorite oil) to keep it soft and also melted in raw Mango butter (also purchased from this company, will write review for that on that product&#x27;s page). It melted down beautifully and I put it in a glass jar to cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells amazing. Im in heaven. I love that its all natural, i know exactly what im rubbing on my skin and allowing my body to absorb (especially because Im pregnant. Now its really important to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS: My house smells like pure chocolate after melting this on the stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its going to take me a long time to go through this bucket, but when i finally do, I will be right back here to order more.</li>
            <li> I discovered shea butter and cocoa butter about a year ago and haven&#x27;t turned back. A billion times better than any &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; you can get, and natural as well!</li>
            <li> I melted the butter down and mixed it with olive oil.  I used it the entire duration of my pregnancy and did not get any stretch marks.  I love that it is 100% natural.  I continue to use it for dry skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> perfect smell and feel, also if proper stored it could last very long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seriosly recommend if your woman loves massage and aroma theropy</li>
            <li> I recieved the product which had leaked out of the container into the box. I complained to the company and they said this is impossible. I took photo&#x27;s to verify and then they said it is too expensive for them to replace the product. I would never recommend this product or company to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this cocoa butter because I had had a rash and I wanted to keep the skin softened and try to bring the color back in it.  I don&#x27;t know what my results will be because I just started using it but I can tell you that it does keep my skin moisturized.  Also, it comes in crystal like chunks and I tried softening it in my hands and was successful to a degree.  However, taking a few chunks and placing them in a container and then placing them in the microwave for about 30 seconds seemed to work better.</li>
            <li> good smell, and great for home made lotions and lip balms</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail today. Im already in love with it. The smell is amazing and it feels so nice on my skin. I plan to melt it into other products to make a lotion but today I just rubbed it onto my skin like a lotion bar. It melted into my skin perfectly. I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> Considering I bought these to make suppositories, it&#x27;s kind of disturbing to have it smell so good.  Buying another container to make some raw brownies with.  Doesn&#x27;t ship well in extreme heat, as some oozed out around the edges, but what are you doing to do?  Stock up in the cooler months perhaps.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a year ago and everytime I open the container its like unwrapping a chocolate bar.. I bought these initially to make body butters but I have discovered these are perfect for me to wash my face off at night.. Since I wear waterproof mascara I take a piece and get it really warm under the hot water and gently start rubbing it on my eyes.. It takes a couple rounds of splashing your face with water to remove excess smeared makeup but you are doing no harm since your skin is protected by being hydrated.. Afterwards I have such a glow and I wake up every morning with my face ready again for the next day without face lotion.. Oh and when I sleep at night its not greasy and doesn&#x27;t get on my pillows.. Hope this helps :-)</li>
            <li> Purchased for Soap Supplies.  Great products</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews, received the product super fast. Thank you  to whoever has the directions on how to use and to prepare it for skin care. If that was not on here, I would be like the person who didn&#x27;t like it. When i received my package of joy, i could smell the chocolate threw the package. I am lucky that i even received it!! lol The only think that i was not expecting was that my coca butter did not come in a container like the picture. It is just a solid square block wrapped in plastic. Not a big deal for me, but some people might have an issue with that. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS SOME REALLY GOOD STUFF. iT HELPS CHAPPED SKIN, STRETCH MARKS,&lt;br /&gt;AND NEW SCARRING.. HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS...</li>
            <li> This Cocoa butter works wonders!! I was advised to use raw cocoa butter to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy. I love this stuff!! I rub it over my stomach once in the morning and once in the evening and so far so good! I have not seen one stretch mark yet! I have also noticed that my skin looks fabulous, much  more clear and toned!! Raw cocoa butter is simply the best!! Much better than the watered down forms of cocoa butter that you can buy at the local drug stores. I will be making another purchase once I run out!!</li>
            <li> I made a combo butter with this as part of the mix and it mixed great and I use it for my body &amp; hair</li>
            <li> Used cocoa butter to help make soap very pleased with the result</li>
            <li> Love this product, especially during the winter months for the dry, ashy skin.  I do use it all year from my head to my toes.</li>
            <li> The product was in a good sealed container.A good clean product.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again.I was very happilysurprised at the arrivial time of the product.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, we made lotion bars that worked wonderful and smelled good enough to eat. I would recommend this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this cocoa butter for making my own lotion and bath products.  It smells absolutely delicious and now my children ask me for the &amp;#34;chocolate lotion&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I use both raw cocoa butter and shea butter for my eczema prone skin.  Both work great but cocoa butter smells way better!  Only problem is the higher melting temperature so I have to microwave it before use but it only takes a couple minutes.  I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have no idea how to use this product. I&#x27;ve ordered raw Shea Butter on the past and though it starts off thick it immediatly melts in your hand. This stuff showed up as rock hard lumps and you can mess with it for minutes and only end up with a small greasy coating on your hands. It would probably take you an hour to try to moisturize your whole body.   Really wish I&#x27;d stuck to Shea or just bought some Palmers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this butter to use in a lotion bar recipe. It did not disappoint - very high quality product. It is truly raw and not refined, and it smells like chocolate. The shipping speed could be faster, but it was still within the promised date range. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Seeing what this has done for my skin in the short while I have been using it is amazing. I have an allergy to artificial fragrance so it is perfect for me. It takes a little getting used to because it isn&#x27;t smooth and creamy until you rub it in your hands but I love it. I prepared mine like the top comment says by melting it down and putting in a 1/4 a cup of organic EVOO and poured it in a couple of old Chinese food containers and store it in the fridge. I break off a small piece at a time and keep it in a container in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I just received my order yesterday, from a very unhappy UPS driver. As I discovered, the jar does not come with a film seal or shrink-wrap or anything. Just the lid screwed on. Which probably contains the butter just fine in lower temperatures. But with the 100 degree heat we&#x27;ve been experiencing the last few days, the butter melted and oozed out of the jar all over the package, through the cardboard box and apparently onto other packages in the delivery truck. I don&#x27;t know how much butter I lost in the process, but it&#x27;s certainly not worth the mess to attempt getting more right now. It smelled nice, and based on other reviews, I&#x27;m sure it will work just fine for the projects I have in mind. But I will certainly keep in mind to order it during cooler months, and never try it in July again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! I USE IT IN FOOD AND ON MY BODY. MY 4 yr old GRANDDAUGHTER INSISTED THAT I SHARE WITH HER. SO I ORDERED HER A CONTAINER FOR HER SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> It was half gone cause it melted and leaked out when I got it.  The product itself is wonderful!  So change the  packaging or only buy it in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Love it.... Smells wonderful...would recommend it. Feels wonderful on skin mixed in my recipe for sunscreen and body lotion.. Definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an amateur at making body products, but this was so easy to melt and mix into other things. I also have eczema and SEVERELY dry skin to where I can&#x27;t use anything OTC, this stuff melts into your skin immediately, leaving you absolutely smooth, no burning sensations and no bumps. In addition to all over body my specific favorite is using a small piece on my dry cuticles, it has helped a lot over a few applications. Product arrived promptly and was packaged well also.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in as one of the ingredients in soap making. Good stuff. I will buy again. Good value and exceptional quality....</li>
            <li> I bought this to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy. Two babies later and still no stretch marks! I have recommended RAW cocoa butter to all of my pregnant friends</li>
            <li> This product tastes like soap. When I called the company to see why, they said it&#x27;s not food grade. Literally tastes like soap, so it must have been lingering and co-mingling with soap products. The raw tag is misleading - I thought this was edible cocoa butter that you make raw food desserts from. Now I have a pound of chocolate smelling, soap tasting, rock hard chunks to fool with. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have given up putting excess chemicals on my body. I purchased this and jojoba oil to use as moisturizer that I can use from head to toe. I particularly like to use this right after I shave to condition my skin. I also apply this in my hair, right down to my scalp and it&#x27;s just wonderful.  It smells really really good too, like chocolate. Get it, apply, repeat, all over your body!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this great product.  I was looking forward to&lt;br /&gt;Using the handy chunks, but unfortunately my grandson left it by&lt;br /&gt;The front door because I wasn&#x27;t home.  So now I will be melting&lt;br /&gt;It down before I can use it.  My problem, not yours.  Thanks again&lt;br /&gt;For making this great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome cocoa butter. Solid, creamy chunks. Smells amazing, like really good chocolate. Def recommend this to others. I use this for DIY lotions and lip balms, works great.</li>
            <li> I live this product. It smells Beautiful and is a wonderful addition to my whipped Shea butter. It is pure and wonderful.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because for the first time in my life I have developed extra dry skin and severe itchiness about my body from the winter weather.  I read the reviews and found that this is good for removing stretch marks and other scars.  Of late my legs have become scaly and my back and arms and legs have cuts and scrapes from my fingernails digging in.  I am hoping that this product will work to totally fade all the marks that have developed.&lt;br /&gt;It is my first time using this so I experimented with several ways.  First I just placed pieces in foil and placed it into the toaster oven to melt and use as is.  I quickly realized that it hardens back to a solid in a matter of minutes (in the winter, I suppose).  I got tired of heating it up twice daily so I did some more research and found that mixing it with another oil will keep it soft enough to be used as a cream/butter.  I chose extra virgin olive oil to mix with the raw cocoa butter.  I mixed equal amounts of both.  While it still becomes a solid, it is still soft enough that your fingers can dig in and it quickly melts in your palms when you rub them together.&lt;br /&gt;I have only started using this cocoa butter/olive oil combination a week ago so I have not yet (obviously) seen signs of the marks fading (they still itch by the way so I have to get rid of the itch first lol), however, I started using this on my face and I must say that my face looks radiant and it glows. I will definitely give an update in a few months.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my stretch marks for my pregnancy. I took the chunks, melted it with 1 cup almond oil and 1 cup coconut oil. I let it harden for a little bit until you could poke your finger but not too hard that it&#x27;s solidified. I threw it in the Kitchenaid with the whisk attachment, whipped it up, now I have tons of body butter for my skin. I absolutely love it. If you don&#x27;t want to smell like an Almond Joy, add some essential oils. But add a lot because the cocoa smell is dominant.</li>
            <li> This product melted all over the packaging, I did not send it back it was too much to bother with</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter is perfect. Although, I did not just simply start rubbing this on my skin. I melted the whole thing with some coconut oil and sweet almond oil, let it cool, and then began to use it. It really helps with eczema.</li>
            <li> The smell is like not like what I was used to in reference to the Cocoa butter but that is because it is not processed. There is a certain kick when you open the jar to smell it. It goes into your nose and there is a whoa factor, but a very good fresh kind of whoa!!</li>
            <li> I use this product in soapmaking and moisturizers and it is so nice to work with.  The aroma is really nice in the finished product.</li>
            <li> first time purchase of the cocoa butter, it is firm, chunks and smaller chunks and it smells like cocoa, the latter I never expected .  good stuff, comes in a little tub like the illustration.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great! It melts easily and is so awesome! I don&#x27;t like how the provider shaves it and packages it though, they give you some good pieces and some bad or really small pieces.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently when I started making my own lotions and personal care items.  It arrived exactly as shown in the picture and when I opened it to examine it the smell was amazing!  My daughter and I have already made a batch of lotion with it and it melted down so easy and feels so good on our skin!  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FIRST TIME ORDERING AND USING COCOA BUTTER. WE CANNOT PURCHASE THIS IN MY SMALL COMMUNITY AND ORDERING HERE WAS EASY AND FAST.</li>
            <li> So disappointed to throw a whole batch of white chocolate out when the whole thing tasted flowery/soapy....gross!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to cocoa butter like I was was, and founds several dairy free/sugar free recipes for white chocolate with cocoa butter as the start ingredient, you&#x27;ll be disappointed! Cocoa Butter has a very rich, dark chocolate flavor, and is heavenly in CHOCOLATE!  You live and you learn.  I also made a lovely skin cream with this too!</li>
            <li> Very strong smell! If you are making  a body butter and don&#x27;t want it to smell like cocoa butter, don&#x27;t use a lot. I also used with mango and shea and really all you can smell is the cocoa. I like the way it smells but sometimes I like to add essential oils but really can&#x27;t smell it because of the cocoa butter that is used.</li>
            <li> Made soaps, lip balms &amp; body butter bars with this for all my female sisters &amp; granddaughters.  Keep some for ourselves, too.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this Raw Cocoa Butter, the skin is so soft and smooth after you use this butter, and is very good for cellulite. If you go to gym 4 days a week and you use this Cocoa Butter on your skin after gym and every day where you have cellulite ,you will see a change in 2-3 week&#x27;s. This butter is better than any cellulite cream around here. I will buy this again and again and again.</li>
            <li> Okay... I know what you&#x27;re thinking.  Stretch marks are genetic and there&#x27;s nothing you can do to prevent them.  You&#x27;re wrong.  I got stretch marks during puberty and I was worried that I would get more during pregnancy.  I SLATHERED my body in this daily during my second and third trimester.  Not one stretch mark.  My mother&#x27;s stomach is covered in them - and I have them on my hips and thighs from a weight gain during my teenage years - YET I did not get one new stretch mark on my stomach during my pregnancy.  I gained 40 lbs. and had a HUGE belly too!  TRY IT!!!  I warmed the chunks of cocoa butter in a small pan on the stove to melt them.  Then I buttered myself up.  Yes, it gets everywhere.  Yes, you smell somewhat chocolatey.  Yes, your dogs will try to lick it off you.  Yes, you will feel greasy.  BUT OH IS IT WORTH IT IF YOU DON&#x27;T GET STRETCH MARKS!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good size for small projects, or just to have it around.  It smells yummy.  I use it in homemade soap and sometimes even use it all alone if my skin gets chapped</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an all natural moisturizer for a while so I ordered this.  First of all, it is very impractical.  You take a piece out of the bucket and then try to melt it between your hands as you rub them together.  It takes a while to get this to disintegrate.  Then your hands end up greasy feeling.  Back in the day, I use to use Palmers cocoa butter lotion and loved the smell, so I thought I&#x27;d like this product. Well, I personally didn&#x27;t like the smell of this.  It was kind of a heavy annoying smell; to me anyway.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the product smells fantastic. The absolute biggest problem is that there is NO safety seal WHATSOEVER on this package. I&#x27;m not typically a paranoid person but to literally not even have tape, a sticker, a seal, anything to let you know that you are the first person opening it is ridiculous. I ordered this because i need to make white chocolate for a party and I&#x27;m not going to be able to get it done. I can&#x27;t feel comfortable using a completely opened product.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and I absolutely love it. It has an amazing chocolate aroma to it. Its works great on my skin, making it feel so soft. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I make a chocolate mint body butter, and I think I have ordered from this same place multiple times (3-4), and it always comes fast, the quality is just what I need for my homemade beauty products and they never disappoint me. I had to write another cookbook, and put the recipe for my beauty supplies in it cause people wouldn&#x27;t leave me alone. Very happy!!</li>
            <li> This basic product has offered enormous relief to a friend who has numerous skin problems. Expect to be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Its clumpy and could have been better looking product if it had been melted before putting it in the plastic tub. Smells good. Easily melts in your fingers.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to my cosmetic-making supplies and I am very pleased with how well it smells, feels, melts and works.</li>
            <li> Item came as described. No weird odors or bad texture. I use this product in making homemade body butter and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is good for homemade facial creams and good for diaper rashes on babies.  It is softening and healing when mixed with other ingredients for a complete lotion or salve.</li>
            <li> I mixed the raw cocoa butter with sesame oil and it was quit heavy as a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I especially did not care for the strong scent it left on me.&lt;br /&gt;Will use it sparingly on heels and knees just the toughest spots.</li>
            <li> i love all natural products and this is the first time i bought cocoa butter in a container instead of oil form. i liked it but some was really hard to get out but excellent on my skin. will purchase again</li>
            <li> was exactly what I needed to make all natural body products :-)</li>
            <li> Have bought several times.</li>
            <li> Container was packed with small pieces and most of it was 2/3 crumbs in all 3 containers.  It was not in block form and did not have an aroma of pure cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful ! I will be buying more. my skin is dry and this product left my skin moisturized and hydrated .</li>
            <li> Product comes in tub that is &amp;#34;pre chunked&amp;#34; and the larger chunks are easy to split if need be. Melts quickly and did a great job in the body butter I was making. Will order again.</li>
            <li> This is used to add moisturizers to the soaps I make . It smells good enough to eat but you would get fat.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I would get the butter of Coacoa in a box as it was shown in the picture. But once I received the treasure, it was as I expected it. Too long have my family and I suffered from the torment of the Cerebus. Every night, he would appear in the light of the moon and sneak into our house. He&#x27;d whisper awful things into our ears like, \\&quot;You didn&#x27;t plug your phone in.\\&quot; or \\&quot;You have to go pee, I know you just got comfy.\\&quot; We could never get rid of him. One day I ventured to the library and found an ancient book on how to get rid of this awful night fiend. We must obtain raw butter of Cocoa. Legend goes the people of Cocoa used the butter to ward off evil spirits, Cerebus, who tormented them in their sleep and their daily lives. The spirits would make their mark upon a victim and haunt him or her. The marks would scar the victim for life leaving them with shame and humiliation. An old man (I can&#x27;t remember how to pronounce the title the man possessed) made this mixture to place on the victims and it hid the scars/marks. The people of Cocoa rejoiced and used this mixture they then called butter (because of the texture of the substance). The butter softened the look of the marks/scars but it didn&#x27;t make them go away completely. It only helped the victims not feel so conscious about themselves. The smell of the butter drove the spirits away. As a victim of Cerebus, I ordered the butter of Cocoa after reading the legend. I was so pleased to see it come in and it has driven away the evil spirit. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product, I used it to make homemade cocoa butter (with shea butter, vitamin e, beeswax, and coconut oil). Smells amazing. Love this stuff</li>
            <li> Smells divine.  Wonderful high quality product.  I have used it in so many things.  Even made homemade deoderant with it.</li>
            <li> Just as described, I use it to whip up a body butter with coconut oil and shea butter...good price and is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I bought it for myself but everyone in the family loves the smell and can&#x27;t resist walking past a block to rub it on their hands.  I also use it as a hair conditioner, after rubbing it on my hands I run my hands through my hair a few times.  My daughter says it smells like cookies.</li>
            <li> I have learned to make my own body butter and I use this along with Shea butter, coconut oil and almond oil.  It was packaged nice and easy to work with.  I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Used in Buddha soap.  Love the fragrance feel of the cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> It smelled very nice, but it came in huge chunks which made it rather hard to handle and measure.  I wasn&#x27;t quite expecting that.  I was expecting smaller pieces or more of a butter texture, I suppose.  Be warned, that this may come in chunks larger than an ice cube.  It does have a wonderful chocolate smell, though.</li>
            <li> Cocoa Butter in raw form is a great product to use on skin or as a base for homemade, chemical free deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have used this for both baking and beauty products. It&#x27;s worked great for both. If I have any complaints, it&#x27;s that the pieces are so irregular in shape. Some are huge chunks. Some are tiny slivers. However, this is just the nature of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it for pregnant women its a odd smell and very time consuming to apply because you have to melt it down not what i wanted ...</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used raw cocoa butter and I love it! It is easy to use and a little goes a long way. I think I will be using this same tub for a long time!</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly! It comes in a plastic container, which I really liked. The chunks of cocoa butter vary in size; I have a huge chunk that takes up 3/4 of the container. I wasn&#x27;t sure how to break it up, so I left it there. Otherwise, the other chunks were easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my lotion bars, they add a distinct, chocolately smell, and it works wonders to moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I bought all ingredients for roughly $40 total. I&#x27;ve used maybe 1/5 of the cocoa butter and I already have nine bars! I love this so much.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d repurchase if I run out</li>
            <li> Love this!!!! Will buy again and again. Great for body and making candy.</li>
            <li> Good cocoa butter and it smells a little bit like chocolate, it&#x27;s hard though so you would need to heat it up a little bit in the microwave in order to use it.</li>
