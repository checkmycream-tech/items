            <li>I like them much better then the spheres.</li>
            <li>and i recommend it to many of my friends</li>
            <li>and they love it too</li>
            <li>I love the taste and smell.</li>
            <li>and I love the formula.</li>
            <li>and I just like the scent better.</li>
            <li>but these are e-zer to carry around and people do talk to me more.....</li>
            <li>Love these lip balms.</li>
            <li>The pomegranate raspberry was lovely.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I will repurchase for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>They fit better in your pocket and are very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and hydrating and easy to put in my pocket when I go out.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that EOS is available in stick form.</li>
            <li>Love this lip balm it make lips feel smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Same great eos lip balm in a much more convenient stick form.</li>
            <li>They are very mild compared to the sphere ones.</li>
            <li>Great basic balm in stick version of the spheres by EOS.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only opened the vanilla bean and it smells very nice, sweet and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>Stick to the original sphere ones.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see they made lip balms in this shape.</li>
            <li>I love the other kind a lot more</li>
            <li>Since I love eos so much I went ahead and gave these a try.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The vanilla bean was so mild, the scent was virtually non existent.</li>
            <li>I love their egg-shaped balms, but this is great for when I have a tiny purse or only my pockets to hold lip balm.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so most lip balms break me out after a while.</li>
            <li>and wow I love these.</li>
            <li>Smooth, not greasy, and fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>The container is very, very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Still love EOS, but will probably just stick to the regular ones instead of ordering the sticks again.</li>
            <li>They were nice enough to send me new ones so all is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the original Eos lip balms that are egg shaped but they didnt fit in my smaller purses or my pockets.</li>
            <li>To me, they smell the same, although they aren&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li>I was simply looking for a lip balm that would fit into my wristlets.</li>
            <li>I use the EOS egg style Chapstick so wanted to order smaller sticks to fit into my pocket.</li>
            <li>I really like EOS lip balms, they have replaced my other favorite.</li>
            <li>The sticks are a little large so they aren&#x27;t pocket friendly if you&#x27;re the type who likes to tote balm around in the pockets.</li>
            <li>Anyways, these are a lot easier to carry around other then those little balls and they are good smelling.</li>
            <li>Love this brand, it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used the past 5 years.</li>
            <li>these are not even the same smell as the first kinds</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and will order these again in the future.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I feel like the balm sticks didn&#x27;t last as long as the spheres, so it seems like I paid more for less.</li>
            <li>its a decent product but not worth the price.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong - they definitely fit in pockets, but they are a little large.</li>
            <li> You get far less lip balm in the tube style.  </li>
            <li> Makes my lips so kissable no soft.</li>

            <li> BUT they all made my lips dry and peel.</li>
            <li> I kept seeing all my female friends with these little balls of lip balm.</li>
            <li> Just disappointed that you don&#x27;t get the entire tube filled with lip balm (maybe 25% to 35%)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me over a week using other products to restore my lips to their pre-EOS condition.</li>
            <li> Only three stars for the fact that I love it&#x27;s in a tube, I hate having the round one in my pocket.  </li>
            <li> The stick form fits in my pocket easier than the round.</li>
            <li> For what I paid, I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was AWFUL.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love love love! I have always loved eos eggs but theese are even better since they fit in your pocket nicer than the egg!</li>
            <li> Love them I can put them in my pocket, no use them anytime I need them. Makes my lips so kissable no soft.</li>
            <li> EOS delivers again. I love their egg-shaped balms, but this is great for when I have a tiny purse or only my pockets to hold lip balm. I&#x27;ve only opened the vanilla bean and it smells very nice, sweet and not too overpowering. Although it was a bit pricey, buying them each separately would have been way more.</li>
            <li> 2 out of 3 were messed up. They were nice enough to send me new ones so all is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the stick style. Easier to bring around when you just want to leave it in your pocket.</li>
            <li> I love eos but this was a rip off for the price. You only get about 1inch of product. Stick to the original sphere ones.</li>
            <li> Such a great product!!</li>
            <li> For what I paid, I was a bit disappointed. I love EOS and I wanted a the lip balm stick because I can put it in my pocket or slide it into my purse pocket, unlike the EOS sphere. I feel like the balm sticks didn&#x27;t last as long as the spheres, so it seems like I paid more for less. Still love EOS, but will probably just stick to the regular ones instead of ordering the sticks again.</li>
            <li> The lady loves these things!</li>
            <li> Loved it! The sticks are so much better than the balls. Not just because of convenience, but they go on smoother!</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my niece, she likes it</li>
            <li> Awesome &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; and they are so much easier to carry in the tube style, as opposed to the egg style. Love this brand, it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that EOS is available in stick form.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect</li>
            <li> I liked these lip balms. To me, they smell the same, although they aren&#x27;t that strong. Which is a good thing in my opinion. Anyways, these are a lot easier to carry around other then those little balls and they are good smelling. I loved it.</li>
            <li> I was simply looking for a lip balm that would fit into my wristlets. I really like the original Eos lip balms that are egg shaped but they didnt fit in my smaller purses or my pockets. I have sensitive skin so most lip balms break me out after a while. I have been using Eos products for about a year now and have yet to have a breakout. I was excited to see they made lip balms in this shape.</li>
            <li> These are awesome and should be sold in every store. They fit better in your pocket and are very easy to apply. All my friends ask where I got them and now most of them also have them. I like them much better then the spheres.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm it make lips feel smooth and hydrated. I will be ordering again once this is gone.</li>
            <li> I have been using eos products for a long time and i haven&#x27;t had any problems with shipping or the statement it is in i lobe eos products and i recommend it to many of my friends and they love it too</li>
            <li> Only the Vanilla Bean flavor comes in a package. The other two are individually wrapped. The three items are then in a plastic bag. Convenient to carry around. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift.  She was very happy with it.  This is the only gloss I&#x27;ll use.  I love the taste and smell.</li>
            <li> Same great eos lip balm in a much more convenient stick form. The sticks are a little large so they aren&#x27;t pocket friendly if you&#x27;re the type who likes to tote balm around in the pockets. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - they definitely fit in pockets, but they are a little large. This isn&#x27;t a deterrence for me because I carry them around in my purse and I love the formula. Smooth, not greasy, and fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> Since I love eos so much I went ahead and gave these a try. They are very mild compared to the sphere ones. Very smooth and hydrating and easy to put in my pocket when I go out. The spheres are not as portable as these sticks but I would stick to the spheres because they&#x27;re 95% organic and I just like the scent better.</li>
            <li> I really like EOS lip balms, they have replaced my other favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the other kind a lot more these are not even the same smell as the first kinds but these are e-zer to carry around and people do talk to me more.....so that&#x27;s what i think</li>
            <li> Love these lip balms. The egg shape is not convenient, so this stick pack is a nice option!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Perfect to put in a pocket! 👌</li>
            <li> Love that my favorite balm is now in a more convenient stick!!!!!!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> The vanilla bean was so mild, the scent was virtually non existent. The sweet mint was delicious. The pomegranate raspberry was lovely. BUT they all made my lips dry and peel. It was AWFUL. It&#x27;s taken me over a week using other products to restore my lips to their pre-EOS condition. A great gift for a frenemy.</li>
            <li> Love EOS lip balms! Saw the tubes and thought they would be neat to have! Love the flavors and the size of the tube is a great size!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased so far! I had been using Vaseline but I think I prefer the EOS; for one thing, the ease in carrying around.</li>
            <li> Love these. The stick form fits in my pocket easier than the round.</li>
            <li> Great basic balm in stick version of the spheres by EOS. I will repurchase for sure.</li>
            <li> its a decent product but not worth the price. I feel robbed</li>
            <li> I wanted to know what all the hype was with these. I kept seeing all my female friends with these little balls of lip balm. So I found this sticks and wow I love these. My favorite is the mint one, so yummy!</li>
            <li> I use the EOS egg style Chapstick so wanted to order smaller sticks to fit into my pocket. Loved them! Fast delivery and will order these again in the future.</li>
            <li> Only three stars for the fact that I love it&#x27;s in a tube, I hate having the round one in my pocket.  You get far less lip balm in the tube style.  They are refillable (if you know how to make lip balm) so it&#x27;s not a total loss.  Just disappointed that you don&#x27;t get the entire tube filled with lip balm (maybe 25% to 35%) the rest is just for show.  I love this product and I know how to make my own lip balm, so I&#x27;ll just refill them when they run out.  The container is very, very sturdy.</li>
