            <li>This is the best sunscreen I have found for my sun sensitive lips.  </li>
            <li>Very good, my favorite lip balm (Except for the high price).</li>
            <li>I love that brand</li>
            <li>so i was very happy to find that I could order several of them.  </li>
            <li>The SPF is great.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by beautipedia.com, and I&#x27;m glad I bought one for trial, and re-bought this time 6 more.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Like the product very much.  </li>
            <li>Out in the sun for the first time this summer</li>
            <li>would recommend this product (in package of 6) to anyone who&#x27;s sensitive to sun/bright light exposure on their lips.</li>
            <li>I bought this six-pack for one reason: we always forget lip screen, and I wanted to have it on hand in as many places (car, backpacks, etc) as possible.</li>
            <li>TEENAGE BOY FRIENDLY!</li>
            <li>Through the years, I have relied on reviews to make smart purchases and now I&#x27;m trying to &amp;#34;pay</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting this product if you go somewhere with intense heat and plan on being out in the sun a lot.</li>
            <li>As much as I&#x27;m on the water, my lips need protection to the max, which is why I bought this product</li>
            <li>As a former redhead with fair skin and a history of melanoma, he is very careful to protect his skin, including lips.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>And so far, thanks to my Banana Boat spf 50 lip balm, it hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>other balms, it doesn&#x27;t melt, and I live in a very hot and humid place.</li>
            <li>The six-pack was very convenient -- allowed me to stash a stick in multiple places.</li>
            <li>The scent and flavor are mild and not strong or obnoxious.</li>
            <li>It has a great year without one single  cold</li>
            <li>This is a scentless, tasteless balm which I love!</li>

            <li> I have mild perfume sensitivity and find some sunscreens such as Hawaiian Tropic to be irritating -- but these lip balms are not.</li>
            <li> My husband frequently got sun blisters/cold sores from too much sun exposure, but this stuff does really seem to help him not get those sun blisters/ cold sores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to smell like cherry all day long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, keep in mind that I didn&#x27;t lay in the sun all day long either..</li>
            <li> I have cold sores, specially when exposed to the sun (even for a short period of time)...</li>
            <li> The texture is OK, not too thick but not too thin -- perhaps a little smoother than Chapstick.</li>
            <li> I use it several times a day every day to reduce exposure to the sun and harsh light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> spent a week on vacation on Brazil and bought 5 of these...</li>
            <li> Good grief!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other sunscreen lip balms, I find that this one does not leave an excessively greasy residue, and does not have any flavor, which can give that bitter taste in one&#x27;s mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Resulted in red swollen lips, which turned into the worse case of chapped lips you&#x27;ve ever seen: sand paper city.  </li>
            <li> MY GRANDSON HAD CHRONICALLY CHAPPED LIPS PREVIOUSLY, BUT NO MORE SINCE HE HAS BEEN USING THIS LIP BALM.</li>
            <li> And no more sunburn.  </li>
            <li> For the first time, I didn&#x27;t have a cold sore while on vacation!</li>
            <li> Works OK and has an acceptable texture but leaves a terrible taste in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get tired of the flavor like other lip balms.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find this in my out of the way town</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t need to plaster it on thick, or apply it to inside of your lips.  </li>
            <li> This is one of only a few that I have found,that does not have the horrible taste that seem to be associated with &amp;#34;high SPF &amp;#34;lip balm.</li>
            <li> as a sunscreen but left a terrible taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But even with the precautions mentioned above, I used to get cold sores EVERY time I would go on vacation!!!</li>
            <li> I prefer this product to others I&#x27;ve tried for its texture, tasteless and protective qualities.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are three reviews that says it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they could make something for your lips that taste soooooo bad.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of 6 and it tasted so bad that I just couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Leaves the worst taste in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves the worst taste in your mouth.</li>

            <li> Out in the sun for the first time this summer and wowzers did my lips get sunburned.  Resulted in red swollen lips, which turned into the worse case of chapped lips you&#x27;ve ever seen: sand paper city.  Good grief!  I ordered this product to hopefully prevent that from ever happening again!  And so far, thanks to my Banana Boat spf 50 lip balm, it hasn&#x27;t.  I like the product a lot.  It feels great going on, smooth and moist and good, like a lip balm should. And no more sunburn.  It does have a bit of a metallic/bitter taste, but I&#x27;m not buying it to eat it. And you don&#x27;t need to plaster it on thick, or apply it to inside of your lips.  And you don&#x27;t want to be smearing your regular sun block on your lips, so get some of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought for Disney World.  Great protection.  Like the product very much.  The six-pack was very convenient -- allowed me to stash a stick in multiple places.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re prone to fever blisters this is a must have. I prefer this product to others I&#x27;ve tried for its texture, tasteless and protective qualities. My husband likes that it is unscented. Even works well over a lip stain cosmetic. I purchased a multi pack and keep one in my purse, the car, travel bag, etc.</li>
            <li> Great service! I have used Banana Boat Sport sunscreen lip balms for years! This is the best sunscreen lip balm made.</li>
            <li> I went to Punta Cana and was concerned about my lips burining.  However, this lip balm did the trick.  I had no issues and my lips stayed moist and did not burn and all.  I would recommend getting this product if you go somewhere with intense heat and plan on being out in the sun a lot.</li>
            <li> This is great sun-block lip balm because there is no bad taste or after taste and it is very smooth.</li>
            <li> As much as I&#x27;m on the water, my lips need protection to the max, which is why I bought this product</li>
            <li> Great product, works great!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RATES FOR LIP THERAPY AND TASTES GREAT, TOO. MY GRANDSON HAD CHRONICALLY CHAPPED LIPS PREVIOUSLY, BUT NO MORE SINCE HE HAS BEEN USING THIS LIP BALM. TEENAGE BOY FRIENDLY!</li>
            <li> I love that brand, it&#x27;s very effective; no sun-burns and no wind chaffing. I use it several times a day every day to reduce exposure to the sun and harsh light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other sunscreen lip balms, I find that this one does not leave an excessively greasy residue, and does not have any flavor, which can give that bitter taste in one&#x27;s mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product (in package of 6) to anyone who&#x27;s sensitive to sun/bright light exposure on their lips. This does the trick.</li>
            <li> as a sunscreen but left a terrible taste in my mouth.  tainted the flavor of food all day.  Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I have found for my sun sensitive lips.  Works great, has a pleasant light smell.  I don&#x27;t get tired of the flavor like other lip balms.  I hope Banana Boat never stops making it.</li>
            <li> My husband frequently got sun blisters/cold sores from too much sun exposure, but this stuff does really seem to help him not get those sun blisters/ cold sores.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find this in my out of the way town so i was very happy to find that I could order several of them.  I am one of the lucky people that gets mouth blisters or swelling from the sun.  This keeps my mouth from burning and/or swelling.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product.  I find no issues with after taste or smell.  It is a good value for the consumer</li>
            <li> This is a scentless, tasteless balm which I love! I don&#x27;t want to smell like cherry all day long. Plus, fragrance is sensitising. The SPF is great.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by beautipedia.com, and I&#x27;m glad I bought one for trial, and re-bought this time 6 more.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other balms, it doesn&#x27;t melt, and I live in a very hot and humid place.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say...  Really good product and if it&#x27;s something you use regularly, why not buy several and not run out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses this lip sunscreen whenever he is outdoors (which is often).  As a former redhead with fair skin and a history of melanoma, he is very careful to protect his skin, including lips.  Wise move!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find this review helpful, please let me know by using the voting buttons.

            <li> Always good. The only lip balm that we use!</li>
            <li> Leaves the worst taste in your mouth.  I threw it all out.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.  It is great for walking and going to the beach.  It stays on for a long time - great purchase!</li>
            <li> I used Chap Stick for years until I found this stuff.  Nice texture and consistency.  Haven&#x27;t burned my lips since I started using it.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is one of only a few that I have found,that does not have the horrible taste that seem to be associated with &amp;#34;high SPF &amp;#34;lip balm.</li>
            <li> I bought this six-pack for one reason: we always forget lip screen, and I wanted to have it on hand in as many places (car, backpacks, etc) as possible. For the price, this pack makes it easy and affordable to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, it&#x27;s fine. The scent and flavor are mild and not strong or obnoxious. I have mild perfume sensitivity and find some sunscreens such as Hawaiian Tropic to be irritating -- but these lip balms are not. The texture is OK, not too thick but not too thin -- perhaps a little smoother than Chapstick. As for sun protection, I have not noticed any burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the sun but stay healthy!</li>
            <li> Good stuff&lt;br /&gt;There are three reviews that says it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  I guess everyone has an opinion but I taste nothing.  And I&#x27;m not coating my tongue but my lip.  It goes on easy and provides great protection.  I had cancer removed from my lower lip that was caused by sun damage and this is the only stuff I&#x27;m going to use.</li>
            <li> Very good, my favorite lip balm (Except for the high price).</li>
            <li> I have cold sores, specially when exposed to the sun (even for a short period of time)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent a week on vacation on Brazil and bought 5 of these... For the first time, I didn&#x27;t have a cold sore while on vacation! I was so pleased!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, keep in mind that I didn&#x27;t lay in the sun all day long either.. And also tried to wear a hat when possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even with the precautions mentioned above, I used to get cold sores EVERY time I would go on vacation!!! So I need to believe that this lip protector 50 must have something to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I keep one in my purse all the time!. It has a great year without one single  cold sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you find this review helpful.</li>
            <li> best stuff for skiing and sun</li>
            <li> I orderred this because I am out in the sun a lot and my lips get sunburned. Used this and it leaves the worst taste in your mouth. I had to stop using it. Never had any lip balm do this. Very disappointed. Wish it had worked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they could make something for your lips that taste soooooo bad. I bought a pack of 6 and it tasted so bad that I just couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I got this primarily for UV protection. It turns out that it is surprisingly effective at relieving my perpetually chapped lips. I would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Works OK and has an acceptable texture but leaves a terrible taste in your mouth.  Try one before buying multiples.  Can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
