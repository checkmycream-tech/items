    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for two days now and the results are just awesome.</li>
            <li>I decided it would be best to listen to this warning and not use this, since I am on Antihistamines.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy that I did!</li>
            <li>Great product for the cost!!</li>
            <li>Very great, cleared a 3 yr acne scar</li>
            <li>Product works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This this is awesome</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working great for me!</li>
            <li>best results.</li>
            <li>but my ZAP machine is always there at hand and works great!!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products he has ever used.</li>
            <li>you feel a pimple coming or have one, the best thing you can use to minimize it is Nexcare Acne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product for 3 day and was very impressed</li>
            <li>But Tansa Zap is really great!</li>
            <li>Very good for disinfect</li>
            <li>I am very pleased!</li>
            <li>It says that after 1000 uses you will have to buy a replacement but it works great.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind replacing the batteries EVERY day, this is a great item.  </li>
            <li>win i turned it on</li>
            <li>All in all this is a great product</li>
            <li>This thing works great for me.  </li>
            <li>I saw it had great reviews</li>
            <li>This thing works great.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for about two days</li>
            <li>so it was a great day.  </li>
            <li>After years of varied medication I am so happy to find this device.</li>
            <li>everyone claims its so great</li>
            <li>Out of frustration (and maybe desperation), I bought his acne zapper hoping for great results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bummer because I liked it in theory!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a remarkable improvement.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Maybe once technology catches up, it&#x27;ll be a good product.</li>
            <li>I have got a fair amount of treatments off the batteries that came with it.</li>
            <li>so it gives good range in targeting surrounding tissue.</li>
            <li>Good flashlight though.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>But I bought rechargeable batteries and they&#x27;re typically good for about 8 treatments before</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked this good.  </li>
            <li>Good Luck.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my results so</li>
            <li>I am sure it&#x27;s a great product if it doesn&#x27;t stop working though.</li>
            <li>A very interesting fact, look at the date that the reviews were posted, 7-20-12.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s ok, it will probably work for me!</li>
            <li>save your money for a cheaper and better product!</li>
            <li>IT WILL MAKE YOU BREAK OUT MORE!  </li>
            <li>The first tanda zap I got, it worked great!</li>
            <li>cystic ance, which is the most severe type of acne!</li>
            <li>This is a great device that is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The Tanda Zap is just amazing.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>What an amazing technology.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my son and amazingly it has helped alot.</li>
            <li>It is not for my kind of acne.</li>
            <li>I used the Zeno acne device before, and it work effectively for my pimples.</li>
            <li>TO GO AWAY ON THIER OWN.</li>
            <li>It effectively helps control pimples and they heal faster.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product, It worked for me.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is really effective at &amp;#34;flattening&amp;#34; any pimples I have.</li>
            <li>Under the skin kind.</li>
            <li>I would believe these so-called experts and then find myself breaking out and then do my own test and find that eating chocolate does cause acne.</li>
            <li>as effective</li>
            <li>I honestly bought it thinking it would be returned within a week but was happy to keep it when it worked and worked quickly.  </li>
            <li>The 24 hour claim sounds very magical and way too magical..</li>
            <li>I read e paperwork to use it correctly and it seemed to work great, love love love it.</li>
            <li>This device has been more effective than any dermatologist I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li>And for that use I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>We got lucky, this works surprisingly well, albeit on one zit at a time.</li>
            <li>The Tanda Zap has a nice warmth when it treats, and the size of it makes it easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a groupon deal and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The more you use this unit, the more energy it seems to require.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see if it gets better.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Should have known better than to use a vibration on the face.</li>
            <li>It has saved me a visit to a dermatologist, which would have cost much more...</li>
            <li>The Tanda Zap is a great product, it really does kill the acne.</li>
            <li>but it shrinks the area and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li>This tanda zap is my favorite tool at fighting cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a skin care expert and have been for many years.  </li>
            <li>For me it takes at most 2 night treatments (I use it almost every night) to my pimples to go away.  </li>
            <li>if I could just plug it to an electric outlet. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the whitehead type pimples any more</li>
            <li>i love it already...</li>
            <li>NOT QUITE SURE</li>
            <li>and it seemed OK</li>
            <li>Better than the zeno.</li>
            <li>item also uses up so many batteries and mine stopped working after a month of use.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how this product works</li>
            <li>but i have found it works better if you put on acne treatment then use it</li>
            <li>Drink more water.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product twice already and will buy one more once my uses run out (1k).</li>
            <li>I once used the zap on my cheek, more than 5 applications in a row</li>
            <li>I surly wouldn&#x27;t pay any more for it, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>noticed some blemishes seem to respond better than others, for me</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>I havent counted how many uses I get out of a charge</li>
            <li>This thing works, although not the 24 magic they claimed, it does work.  </li>
            <li>I believe the counter goes by how many times you turn it on.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Just fantastic!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!!</li>
            <li>Helps reduce pimples but it needs too many batteries and stopped working after a couple hundred uses.  </li>
            <li>Requires replacement after so many uses (1,000 applications according to the packaging).&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more helpful to my acne.</li>
            <li>I had too many pimples to hold that thing at my face for 3 minutes on each spot.</li>
            <li>tried it the moment I received it and used it on my chin area, which is my most problem area.</li>
            <li>Ok, I got suckered in and thought this might be the solution to my acne problem I&#x27;ve been fighting for years.  </li>
            <li>It was interesting to see the reviews on Amazon vs. the Tanda Zap web page.  </li>
            <li>So everyone decided to post their excellent comments on the same day.  </li>
            <li>I was diagnosed more than 2 years ago with rosacea</li>
            <li>I totally love it.  </li>
            <li>Latest research suggests time is better spend focusing on diet</li>
            <li>great device that really seems to work</li>
            <li>I love my ZAP.</li>
            <li>And, on top of it, the top will not stay on.  </li>
            <li>*One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>To be effective you must leave it on the area youre treating the full two miutes.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely worth the money to me!!</li>
            <li>This gadget didn&#x27;t work for me, BUT I did end up buying the Tanda Clear and it works great.  </li>
            <li>This product works GREAT on acne, but does not deliver nearly the amount of &amp;#34;servings&amp;#34; it says it will.  </li>
            <li>The results I got from Acne Free has been outstanding and even surpasses ProActiv.</li>
            <li>Powerful tool for any kind of acne.</li>
            <li>It reduces the pimples very quickly.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I love the tanda, only wish it was not just batter operated... would be great</li>
            <li>I have one large one right now that I have been zapping twice a day for three days, and is showing great progress this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they dont give you anything to clean the top of the leds which can have bacteria if you put it on your face.</li>
            <li>Easy to use (</li>
            <li>so it is easy to put away in a drawer or take with you to work or school.&lt;br</li>
            <li>yes, it eats up batteries very quickly, so get rechargeable</li>
            <li>The first one I bought worked great - exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>However, it eats batteries very quickly, and died after about six months.</li>
            <li>The batteries have a spring underneath and the notches in the top that are supposed to hold them in don&#x27;t do a great job, so it constantly comes undone.  </li>
            <li>I put them in 2 weeks ago and have used the Zap 4-5 a day since then, its still going strong.</li>
            <li>the vibration or whatever it is doesnt have a strong pulse.</li>
            <li>Wow, what an amazing product!</li>
            <li>Not as effective as the Zeno hot spot, vibration does nothing.</li>
            <li>2-3 times a a day is fine, One in the morning, afternoon, and night</li>
            <li>I went through many triple A batteries since this product drains them so quickly.</li>
            <li>This little one works great though!</li>
            <li>I had a huge cystic mark on my cheek and have been using this 3x a day on it since it popped up.</li>
            <li>Light works for acne, but this light doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re buying cheap alkaline batteries, you&#x27;ll be replacing them every 8-10 uses.  </li>
            <li>instructions say to hold the light on the bump for 2 minutes, 3 times a day.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s important to know that this is a SPOT TREATMENT, not a treatment for people who have severe acne all over their face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m one of the people who were warned in the instructions against use because they could have a sensitivity to light or if the thing just drew out imperfections before their time</li>
            <li>However there is no way to tell when it has worn out because there is no battery indicator light.</li>
            <li>I would have choose 0 star&#x27;s if it was available.</li>
            <li>I currently use it whenever I feel a breakout coming on and also use It when my time of the month is coming, in my breakout zones to prevent any acne and it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better investment to buy the full size, rechargeable unit, because the cost of batteries to run the portable one would cover the difference in price between the portable unit and full size one.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Of course, you will need to practice a good regimen to help clear up your skin.</li>
            <li>I bought the Tanda zap a while ago because I could no longer find the Zeno which by far was a superior product.</li>
            <li>This is the best little invention around!</li>
            <li>Also worthwhile to mention, the manual states not to use it if you&#x27;re taking any drugs that makes skin sensitive to light - important if you&#x27;re taking a tetracycline for acne, as many people do.</li>
            <li>The first week I noticed a huge difference in my skin!   </li>
            <li>Cystic stuff loves to hang around for weeks, but it has shrunk significantly (around 75%) in one week.  </li>
            <li>used it exactly as directed, twice a day, sometimes more.</li>
            <li>Believe me it is worth a try!</li>
            <li>I notice is that Tanda appears to work on those with actual pimple issues, not those with &#x27;great&#x27; skin already who have that rare flare-up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that all of the positive reviews are written by constituents of the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Both my mother and I have used this successfully over the last year or so on the relatively mild cystic acne we get on our chins.</li>
            <li>light therapy beds never worked for me but the red light therapy machine ($75) by tanda is amazing....</li>
            <li>:) I had one pimple that was really bothering me.</li>
            <li>this thing lights up like a full moon and is so powerfull i was like ooo this might work</li>
            <li>thanks tanda zap for my magic wand...</li>
            <li>good if you have occasional breakouts.  </li>
            <li>if you have more pimples, I won&#x27;t suggest this as it will take too much time.</li>
            <li>but it left his skin looking good.</li>
            <li>Only good for 100 uses and you use 2-3 time a day.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and nothing really works on me, not even 10% benzoyl peroxide, which \\&quot;burned\\&quot; my face after two weeks.</li>
            <li>Not as good and effective as the regular blue light treatments.</li>
            <li>and now I have some mild scarring, on both cheeks.</li>
            <li>It works best if you have only one or two areas where you break out that you want to treat, and is probably not cost-effective if you want to treat your entire face.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a useful adjunct to a good, proper skincare routine (i.e., sunscreen, moisturizer, adequate cleansing) and does seem to lessen the life cycle of pesky zits.  </li>
            <li>This also required batteries which die out quick when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I used the Tanda Zap for about 2 months on my mild to medium severity acne.</li>
            <li>While it *might* help to start reducing an already-exisitng pimple, there isn&#x27;t a quick change in the pimple&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This device is GREAT for back of head/neck zits - especially since you can&#x27;t really put any kind of benzoyl peroxide or anything on those spots.</li>
            <li>I have gone 5 days without a new pimple since using it and that is outstanding for my condition.  </li>
            <li>For something that is supposed to be heat activated, it doesn&#x27;t even get that hot!</li>
            <li>It has already made a significant difference in my skin in the first week.</li>
            <li>I am sure a lot of people are having to use it on multiple spots so the life of this guy will go very quickly</li>
            <li>Very bright and hard on eyes;however, the product works well wih repeated use.</li>
            <li>I have the illumask light therapy mask for Acne (which I highly recommend!)</li>
            <li>What is amazing is that it took only one application to make a cystic acne under my lower lip disappear.</li>
            <li>I think I got my money&#x27;s worth, and then some.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is worth the $50.</li>
            <li>The red light covered more areas, made pimples go away longer, and helped my wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My sister didn&#x27;t have any success with this item either.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>For 50$ it may be worth it.  </li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>this it worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Yes, I may go through batteries, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>However, it wasn&#x27;t worth dealing with the batteries.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the effort</li>
            <li>Because in order for it to be effective, each pimple needs about 6 mins of treatment, a larger surface would save you a lot of time.</li>
            <li>Even with rechargeable batteries, it kept dying on me the day after I put freshly charged batteries in it.</li>
            <li>It worked better at first when the pimple was new and still &amp;#34;growing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It seems to be able to stop the formation of early blemishes if caught right away.</li>
            <li>I strongly dislike that this company set up their device to only work for 1000 uses, when they could have easily gotten it to work indefinitely.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER after having owned one for a year and another for like 2 months, NEITHER is working right now.</li>
            <li>the batteries didn&#x27;t sit right in my Zap.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I feel one coming on, I use my Zap and either it goes away right away or helps it go away faster</li>
            <li>works very well, easy, and it is  very fiunctional</li>
            <li>definitely plan on replacing the Tanda when its 1000 uses are up, if not upgrading to the Clear+ to avoid wasting batteries and being able to use the replaceable head for 6x as many treatments.  </li>
            <li>I originally used ProActiv but the cost for this program is too high.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for being a super store online.</li>
            <li>After testing out the Tanda Zap for a few months now, I have found that it works better to hold it on a bump for more like 4-6 minutes at a time, 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li>I used up the batteries it came with in two days, however, I have put duracel in it and so far I am on day 5 and going strong.    </li>
            <li>(My eyes are very sensitive to light even though I close them during the treatment, and frankly I don&#x27;t have the patience to close my eyes</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s specifically the early breakouts that respond the best rather than the fully developed blemish which is less affected by the treatment.  </li>
            <li>:) If my acne continues beyond the life of the product, I would definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li>First off you need to read all the directions and warnings.</li>
            <li>Works well if you are persistent and use it when the first sign of a pimple shows.</li>
            <li>First off, as others have said, the thing goes through batteries</li>
            <li>This product is made for quickie zit zap-pin only if your finding yourself using it in more than 3[-4 spots at a time this product is not for you.  </li>
            <li>After using this exactly as directed I can say without a doubt......  </li>
            <li>It really does work for me!  </li>
            <li>The textured plastic over the light can hurt over a sensitive breakout as it is viabrating.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>It went away but still, DO NOT USE IT MORE THAN 3 TIMES ON ONE SAME AREA.</li>
            <li>I will say that if you buy cheap batteries they will not go as far.</li>
            <li>It really does kill the bacteria!</li>
            <li>This would be consistent with it&#x27;s mechanism of fighting off the acne-causing flora that colonize the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In the beginning it actually seemed like I was having more breakouts</li>
            <li>I still remember that when I found out my first one stopped working</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m here on amazon looking for a bigger one to cover more</li>
            <li>so I used it on a lot (8-10) of spots for the first week 2-3 times a day which was pretty time consuming.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>when the first one I bought died I doubted my estimate of usage.  </li>
            <li>worked on first application for me) and it says on the direction to use two to three times a day on acne.</li>
            <li>I have been on acne medications for year and have recently decided not to take it any more.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much!</li>
            <li>I want to keep my skin nice and am not afraid to spend a little extra on some batteries! :)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Acne Free to do the main job of clearing up the skin.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve saved so much money and embarrassment over a large pimples!</li>
            <li>Most of them just help with the surface stuff but arent much help with the deep pimples.  </li>
            <li>The device is only good for a specific number of timed cycles so if you have a lot of zits, you may go through it&#x27;s lifespan faster than anticipated.</li>
            <li>I quickly realized that it was kind of pointless for me.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews (mostly positive) on this product, I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>but it does...tried it twice already and both times I have had positive results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve had amazing success with the Tanda Zap to treat deep pimples that you can feel coming for several days before they surface.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the red light therapy by tanda does the same and BETTER job than this product.</li>
            <li>This is going to take SO much longer to clear than those original spots would have, and it&#x27;s going to leave SCARS.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I was very reluctant at first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered another blue light therapy product that&#x27;s bigger and covers more of my face at one time.</li>
            <li>This small pocket-size device is really good for acne around eyes.</li>
            <li>battery gets low very very quickly.</li>
            <li>The pimple was hot, red and filled w/pus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my second one as the first one died after 2 years of use, which is fine by me considering how much use it got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only thing that has worked on a consistent basis for me is Acne Free</li>
            <li>: 1) it seems EATS batteries, which is fine, because I have rechargeable double AA&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I am 45 with acne prone skin and it has been such a great little device to help control my acne.</li>
            <li>; however I occasionally get a cystic bump on the very bottom of my chin or in my eyebrow region, where the light on the illumask does not reach.</li>
            <li>I really kinda let it get out of control</li>
            <li>Taking antibiotics clears up my acne very well, but after the medication is gone, it returns.   </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I really see any results.</li>
            <li>The combination of blue-light, heat, and vibration really does seem to be preventing the bacteria growth that leads to acne.    </li>
            <li>Unbelievably, it really works.</li>
            <li>So worth the price for clear skin.</li>
            <li>But what really get&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I really like the Tanda zap.</li>
            <li>Very tricky way to get you to keep forking out money by this</li>
            <li>as to now when it is decreasing in size I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li>but this has made me very nervous to try anything.</li>
            <li>This acne device does absolutely nothing for my pimples.</li>
            <li>I recommend the red light but not this blue light...</li>
            <li>up pimples fast.  </li>
            <li>In conjunction with the blue light, the device vibrates.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to do an at home light treatment treatment over the entire face, I would recommend checking out the illumask.</li>
            <li>thing I want to point out is that you do have to use it properly - first, only 2-3 treatments a day, don&#x27;t use it over the thyroid/neck area (apparently can cause hyperthyroidism), and make sure not to look at the laser.  </li>
            <li>Four stars because, as mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t really help all blemishes, but the ones that do respond, respond well.</li>
            <li>It does reduce the number of breakouts and makes the existing ones heal much faster.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t unzit the acne although i was very hopeful.  </li>
            <li>, i really recomend it.  </li>
            <li>so you know really it doesn&#x27;t happen just overnight.</li>
            <li>After using this, 2x a day for 2 days the pimple is very diminished.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even know if I saw real results the couple of times I used it...</li>
            <li>I would have gave it 5 stars but it uses batteries up so much.</li>
            <li>Absorbing Cover or put BP cream on it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>If you do not have access to Acne Free, you should request your local Costco or Sam&#x27;s Club to carry it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it on the blackheads on my nose and chin, and my skin is much smoother in those areas and the blackheads are still there</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to use than creams,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because, in my opinion, it&#x27;s really just</li>
            <li>Statistically speaking, very probable.</li>
            <li>The whole battery thing would prevent me from buying again.</li>
            <li>By the way, it goes through batteries so fast that you would be spending over 50 dollars a year on batteries alone.</li>
            <li>This really eliminated it</li>
            <li>Not work very well.</li>
            <li>But heck, even if you have have to replace the batteries but have clear skin in exchange, isn&#x27;t it worth it???</li>
            <li>Received last week so far everything okay.</li>
            <li>Every time they started to clear another blemish would arise right adjacent.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical if this would really work, but I am happy to announce that it did.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write product reviews, and I&#x27;m one of the biggest skeptics out there, but felt the need to post about the Tanda Zap!</li>
            <li>I am older and have infrequent breakouts and have found Tanda to be VERY helpful.  </li>
            <li>The device really works to clear up acne fast!</li>
            <li>you will still have to wash your face or use a facial tone to wipe your skin clean, but it did get rid of the zit.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money - pretty much sums it up.</li>
            <li>They seem to last a long time and are quite effective for me.</li>
            <li>In 4 treatments the large, nodular zits were reduced by more than half</li>
            <li>have been on antibiotic and topical medications, but still experienced at least one huge pimple per month (especially the week before menstruation).</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m using rechargeable batteries for this, highly encouraged as its consumes energy fast.  </li>
            <li>But when I have had really tender blimishes, it makes them less tender for sure.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve got full on, inflamed, patches of acne in the areas that those initial blemishes used to be.  </li>
            <li>If this is problematic, Tanda makes a more professional model (Tanda Clear Plus) with a larger treatment area and rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li>It is programmed to shut down permanently after so many applications.  </li>
            <li>If you are going through new batteries every day, then you are probably trying to use this tool too much.</li>
            <li>I have scars now and waiting for new skin to come up, but because I&#x27;m not getting acne over and over again, my skin actually can see the light of forming new skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product a lot, because I have so many blemishes, but I find myself using it less today, because it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>In that respect they are creating less scarring and it has helped slightly more than a placebo.</li>
            <li>Many of the ones that were red are no longer red.</li>
            <li>only made for quick results and to kill bacteria...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is if I spend this amount of money on a gadget I expected it to shrink pimples faster and more completely.</li>
            <li>ALSO don&#x27;t apply on same area more than 3 times in a row in the same area.</li>
            <li>but I will still use it on a much smaller scale to get a better idea of whether it actually does anything.</li>
            <li>Further, if you use rechargeable batteries, realize that many chargers can only charge batteries in twos or fours.</li>
            <li>The original batteries have lasted that long.</li>
            <li>luck, save your money and make the splurge for the red light, I guarantee you better results and a machine that isn&#x27;t battery powered and small.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a spot treatment machine or a acne clearing machine get a high frequency device.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This product is rated too high.</li>
            <li>I ordered the zap and a red light therapy from someone else within same time frame that I just never used the zap again and have been faithful to my red light therapy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I and my skin are highly irritated.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, I would highly recommend this product to those who get those cystic acne flare ups.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>(looks like dairy, high glycemic index foods, etc.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clear them terribly fast, but it does help a bit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unfortunate because it&#x27;s a great concept otherwise.</li>
            <li>You will burn through three AAA batteries per day with normal use.  </li>
            <li>The larger version is much better quality and has lasted me for a long time.</li>
            <li>It works OK if you use it everyday, but don&#x27;t skip days.</li>
            <li>I use it 2/3 times a day on the zit and the zit clears up in 2 to 3 days instead of my normal 7 days.</li>
            <li>ABOUT THE NORMAL TIME FOR PIMPLES</li>
            <li>I like it, but with the sometimes many blemishes I&#x27;ll have at the same time, I&#x27;ll use this thing back-to-back on different spots on my face for occasionally 10 minutes straight!</li>
            <li>since they don&#x27;t develop fully and never pop...may be a good thing from a scaring perspective, but still, it&#x27;s no magic bullet for larger blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Overall still worth a try as the cost isn&#x27;t that prohibitive.</li>
            <li>Normally, when I get these cystic acne they remain for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>The next day, it got bigger and turned into a full zit!</li>
            <li>but it definitely makes the pimple SHRINK and easy to  cover the next day!</li>
            <li>I only get zits right before my period.</li>
            <li>I have been using it several times a day in 3-4 spots with several repetitions and the batteries are just fine.</li>
            <li>Not very eco friendly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s time to get a new one.</li>
            <li>After that time, you dispose the device and buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>read about the Tanda blue light products and settled on the Tanda Zap because it was way cheaper than the actual wand.</li>
            <li>But when I first got the unit, the batteries lasted a few days, now I&#x27;m lucky if I get through a morning or evening session.</li>
            <li>this is my 4th time on this product, love it for its small size which makes it so portable.&lt;br /&gt;Dries</li>
            <li>would keep a realistic perspective with these treatments (it&#x27;s not going to clear up skin completely overnight),</li>
            <li>I never had acne as a teenager, so this is new for me and nothing seems to completely clear my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two months and it has cleared 90 percent of old and new lesions and with no side effects.</li>
            <li>anyone who wants to get one with larger surface, Tanda Clear+ is really expensive, so I use Aurora, which is a lot cheaper but very effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding that the more I use it the less of those deep breakouts I have.  </li>
            <li>I am a vegetarian, eat very healthy and exercise daily, which helps a lot to keep my skin clear, but I would still get a few zits on my cheeks and chin over and over in the same spots.</li>
            <li>Mid-twenties skin with a smattering of deep-forming zits that aren&#x27;t affected by topical creams until they&#x27;ve already breached the surface and become quite large.</li>
            <li>It only works on certain types of acne as stated in the included guide</li>
            <li>only con I&#x27;ve found is that it does take a suprisingly large amount of batteries.</li>
            <li>also works great on cold sores.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and have struggled to get clear skin.</li>
            <li>I mmediately used the Tanda Zap when I received it and in a matter of days my problem areas were clear and have not recurred.  </li>
            <li>I expected to feel a zap or something, but it&#x27;s just a blue light that doesn&#x27;t get any warmer than a flashlight might.</li>
            <li>This time it was taking weeks to clear.</li>
            <li>The Zap acne device helped clear my blemishes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already seen an almost complete elimination of emerging blemishes on my face.     </li>
            <li>Maybe the professional version helps, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything for my on and off moderate to severe cystic acne and nothing has helped my skin as much as the tanda zap.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>far I have not had to change out the batteries.  </li>
            <li>This really really does make my pimples tiny if i use it after trying everything else.</li>
            <li>Batteries don&#x27;t die quite as fast as reviewers have said, but maybe that&#x27;s because I only use it on a couple of spots per day.</li>
            <li>I have adult, hormone-related acne (I&#x27;m 28)</li>
            <li>/&gt;SERIOUSLY DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li>Call a professional about Rx creams, antibiotics, or birth control.</li>
            <li>For some spots it did nothing at all but for others I think it worked, but not overnight or completely.</li>
            <li>Overall it didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li>Although many do not believe that chocolate cause acne I have from experience found that it does, at least for me.</li>
            <li>This time around I was pleasantly surprised that it was no longer</li>
            <li>(I frown on ordering cleansing products online as it adds a whole lot to the cost of such necessities).</li>
            <li>so much I have given as a gift and also purchased the larger rechargable unit.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this for about 3 weeks now but really does work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to work when I start treatment in the early stages of pimple development and on some types of pimples.</li>
            <li>only downside is batteries wear out fast.</li>
            <li>Ergo, my suggestion is that this is not for people who have a lot of acne, it&#x27;s more for those that just get a few deep pimples here and there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been doubtful about blue light therapy treatment for acne, but I&#x27;ve been routinely receiving professional blue light treatment for the last 2 months now and my skin has never been this good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good device to have if you suffer from blemishes if you can get it at a discount, I think the full price is very expensive especially since it&#x27;s essentially a disposable item because once it&#x27;s predetermined number of zaps is over you have to throw it out and get a new one.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;ve seen very little progress over the last several months.  </li>
            <li>do not mean to sound so negative</li>
            <li>I got a high frequency machine for the same cost as this.</li>
            <li>But I guess if they say one bad thing about it (something easily overlooked) people will think the reviews are more genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After two days of using it, it was significantly smaller than normal.</li>
            <li>It helps calm down pimple swelling and redness.</li>
            <li>Please note that Section 5 of the FTC Act, prohibits deceptive acts or practices, such as reselling a returned product as new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may still provoke new spots in different places, but I hope eventually the face will be cleared</li>
            <li>The Tanda Zap has helped me clear up those last areas I couldn&#x27;t seem to get clear.</li>
            <li>Have now had this device for a few weeks, and it does genuinely work, but for very specific situations.  </li>
            <li>I was very skeptical at first, but after using the Tanda for sometime now I can honestly say it works.</li>
            <li>If you are going to charge people $50 for something like this, it better damn well last past 2 months!</li>
            <li>so then I tried on my face and it cause major irritation and did nothing to diminish the zit.</li>
            <li>I used this and the next day it was almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>Using the large device around the eyes is not very convenient for me.</li>
            <li>I think it makes my blemishes heal a little faster, plus it&#x27;s fun to use</li>
            <li>This pricy little gadget does do what it says, but not fast or effectively enough for me to be able to justify the price.</li>
            <li>Generally works well.</li>
            <li>I did notice that my skin generally looked smoother after  use</li>
            <li>The Tandazap is promoted as &#x27;clinically proven to clear or fade acne blemishes within 24 hours using it 2-3 times daily&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Tanda Zap in hopes that it would preform similarly and help clear</li>
            <li>but I feel like the blemish takes the same amount of time to clear</li>
            <li>It only took three days for all my blemishes to clear using this product.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money and get the Clear and bypass the Zap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>I like it but recommend the Clear Model and especially the rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>I currently have had acne issues from hormonal imbalance and this has helped clear up the acne because of that.</li>
            <li>After switching my birth control around, I&#x27;ve had adult acne for several years now.</li>
            <li>I believe this technique may work on a larger, professional scale, but this Tanda Zap did not work at all.</li>
            <li>But I found out by trying it that THE TRICK TO KEEPING YOUR BATTERIES LASTING LONGER is to take them completely out of the Tanda Zap when not using it and when you need to use it again for a treatment</li>
            <li>And it barely vibrates (which I think is just another gimmick</li>
            <li>I think it did help my daughter when I made her use it, but we could barely get two sessions out of one set of batteries.  </li>
            <li>so well, that I bought a second one for my young niece</li>
            <li>Naturally thinking it was the batteries I exchanged them and same issue.</li>
            <li>Before that I&#x27;m not sure if it worked, but it was a good idea and kept me from squeezing the offending zits so they would at least heal on their own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that if I used it a few times a day, my blemish quickly disappeared and have been using it for approx 6 mths now with the same results again and again.  </li>
            <li>Once you get past those few caveats, this device is pretty helpful and straightforward to use.  </li>
            <li>It became a constant stream of one huge welt at a time, at least twice a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin type: early twenties, moderate acne with occasional cysts.</li>
            <li>For example, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work on those pimples that turn fast into white heads but works on those that either take longer to come out or never really do.</li>
            <li>No dry patches or scars....</li>
            <li>The batteries didn&#x27;t last as long as the first one and the button was jammed soon after.</li>
            <li>I tried this and the swelling really went down within 2 days.</li>
            <li>and I have a very noticibly less blackheads.</li>
            <li>Claims to &amp;#34;clear blemishes within 24 hours&amp;#34; and it didn&#x27;t clear a single thing.</li>
            <li>Apparently there are several different kinds of AAAs, and it prefers the ones that are one use only.</li>
            <li>It does seem to help my acne (or at least it keeps me from touching my face with my hands), but I have gone through two packs of 20 batteries in less than a month.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, and definitely keeps pimples from getting worse.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s not a bad purchase, especially if you only get very small blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suffer from an extreme form of acne, but it got rid of my existing acne and prevents new ones from surfacing.</li>
            <li>The larger of the two got a little weepy after the treatments, leading me to believe that it was really working.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two days now and the results are just awesome.</li>
            <li> I decided it would be best to listen to this warning and not use this, since I am on Antihistamines.</li>
            <li> and I am so happy that I did!</li>
            <li> Great product for the cost!!</li>
            <li> Very great, cleared a 3 yr acne scar</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s working great for me!</li>
            <li> best results.</li>
            <li> but my ZAP machine is always there at hand and works great!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products he has ever used.</li>
            <li> you feel a pimple coming or have one, the best thing you can use to minimize it is Nexcare Acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for 3 day and was very impressed</li>
            <li> But Tansa Zap is really great!</li>
            <li> Very good for disinfect</li>
            <li> I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> It says that after 1000 uses you will have to buy a replacement but it works great.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind replacing the batteries EVERY day, this is a great item.  </li>
            <li> win i turned it on</li>
            <li> All in all this is a great product</li>
            <li> This thing works great for me.  </li>
            <li> I saw it had great reviews</li>
            <li> This thing works great.  </li>
            <li> It worked great for about two days</li>
            <li> so it was a great day.  </li>
            <li> After years of varied medication I am so happy to find this device.</li>
            <li> everyone claims its so great</li>
            <li> Out of frustration (and maybe desperation), I bought his acne zapper hoping for great results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bummer because I liked it in theory!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a remarkable improvement.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Maybe once technology catches up, it&#x27;ll be a good product.</li>
            <li> I have got a fair amount of treatments off the batteries that came with it.</li>
            <li> so it gives good range in targeting surrounding tissue.</li>
            <li> Good flashlight though.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> But I bought rechargeable batteries and they&#x27;re typically good for about 8 treatments before</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked this good.  </li>
            <li> Good Luck.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my results so</li>
            <li> I am sure it&#x27;s a great product if it doesn&#x27;t stop working though.</li>
            <li> A very interesting fact, look at the date that the reviews were posted, 7-20-12.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s ok, it will probably work for me!</li>
            <li> save your money for a cheaper and better product!</li>
            <li> IT WILL MAKE YOU BREAK OUT MORE!  </li>
            <li> The first tanda zap I got, it worked great!</li>
            <li> cystic ance, which is the most severe type of acne!</li>
            <li> This is a great device that is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The Tanda Zap is just amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> What an amazing technology.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son and amazingly it has helped alot.</li>
            <li> It is not for my kind of acne.</li>
            <li> I used the Zeno acne device before, and it work effectively for my pimples.</li>
            <li> TO GO AWAY ON THIER OWN.</li>
            <li> It effectively helps control pimples and they heal faster.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this product, It worked for me.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is really effective at &amp;#34;flattening&amp;#34; any pimples I have.</li>
            <li> Under the skin kind.</li>
            <li> I would believe these so-called experts and then find myself breaking out and then do my own test and find that eating chocolate does cause acne.</li>
            <li> as effective</li>
            <li> I honestly bought it thinking it would be returned within a week but was happy to keep it when it worked and worked quickly.  </li>
            <li> The 24 hour claim sounds very magical and way too magical..</li>
            <li> I read e paperwork to use it correctly and it seemed to work great, love love love it.</li>
            <li> This device has been more effective than any dermatologist I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li> And for that use I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> We got lucky, this works surprisingly well, albeit on one zit at a time.</li>
            <li> The Tanda Zap has a nice warmth when it treats, and the size of it makes it easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a groupon deal and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The more you use this unit, the more energy it seems to require.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see if it gets better.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Should have known better than to use a vibration on the face.</li>
            <li> It has saved me a visit to a dermatologist, which would have cost much more...</li>
            <li> The Tanda Zap is a great product, it really does kill the acne.</li>
            <li> but it shrinks the area and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li> This tanda zap is my favorite tool at fighting cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skin care expert and have been for many years.  </li>
            <li> For me it takes at most 2 night treatments (I use it almost every night) to my pimples to go away.  </li>
            <li> if I could just plug it to an electric outlet. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the whitehead type pimples any more</li>
            <li> i love it already...</li>
            <li> NOT QUITE SURE</li>
            <li> and it seemed OK</li>
            <li> Better than the zeno.</li>
            <li> item also uses up so many batteries and mine stopped working after a month of use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this product works</li>
            <li> but i have found it works better if you put on acne treatment then use it</li>
            <li> Drink more water.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product twice already and will buy one more once my uses run out (1k).</li>
            <li> I once used the zap on my cheek, more than 5 applications in a row</li>
            <li> I surly wouldn&#x27;t pay any more for it, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> noticed some blemishes seem to respond better than others, for me</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> I havent counted how many uses I get out of a charge</li>
            <li> This thing works, although not the 24 magic they claimed, it does work.  </li>
            <li> I believe the counter goes by how many times you turn it on.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Just fantastic!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!!</li>
            <li> Helps reduce pimples but it needs too many batteries and stopped working after a couple hundred uses.  </li>
            <li> Requires replacement after so many uses (1,000 applications according to the packaging).&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more helpful to my acne.</li>
            <li> I had too many pimples to hold that thing at my face for 3 minutes on each spot.</li>
            <li> tried it the moment I received it and used it on my chin area, which is my most problem area.</li>
            <li> Ok, I got suckered in and thought this might be the solution to my acne problem I&#x27;ve been fighting for years.  </li>
            <li> It was interesting to see the reviews on Amazon vs. the Tanda Zap web page.  </li>
            <li> So everyone decided to post their excellent comments on the same day.  </li>
            <li> I was diagnosed more than 2 years ago with rosacea</li>
            <li> I totally love it.  </li>
            <li> Latest research suggests time is better spend focusing on diet</li>
            <li> great device that really seems to work</li>
            <li> I love my ZAP.</li>
            <li> And, on top of it, the top will not stay on.  </li>
            <li> *One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> To be effective you must leave it on the area youre treating the full two miutes.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely worth the money to me!!</li>
            <li> This gadget didn&#x27;t work for me, BUT I did end up buying the Tanda Clear and it works great.  </li>
            <li> This product works GREAT on acne, but does not deliver nearly the amount of &amp;#34;servings&amp;#34; it says it will.  </li>
            <li> The results I got from Acne Free has been outstanding and even surpasses ProActiv.</li>
            <li> Powerful tool for any kind of acne.</li>
            <li> It reduces the pimples very quickly.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I love the tanda, only wish it was not just batter operated... would be great</li>
            <li> I have one large one right now that I have been zapping twice a day for three days, and is showing great progress this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they dont give you anything to clean the top of the leds which can have bacteria if you put it on your face.</li>
            <li> Easy to use (</li>
            <li> so it is easy to put away in a drawer or take with you to work or school.&lt;br</li>
            <li> yes, it eats up batteries very quickly, so get rechargeable</li>
            <li> The first one I bought worked great - exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> However, it eats batteries very quickly, and died after about six months.</li>
            <li> The batteries have a spring underneath and the notches in the top that are supposed to hold them in don&#x27;t do a great job, so it constantly comes undone.  </li>
            <li> I put them in 2 weeks ago and have used the Zap 4-5 a day since then, its still going strong.</li>
            <li> the vibration or whatever it is doesnt have a strong pulse.</li>
            <li> Wow, what an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Not as effective as the Zeno hot spot, vibration does nothing.</li>
            <li> 2-3 times a a day is fine, One in the morning, afternoon, and night</li>
            <li> I went through many triple A batteries since this product drains them so quickly.</li>
            <li> This little one works great though!</li>
            <li> I had a huge cystic mark on my cheek and have been using this 3x a day on it since it popped up.</li>
            <li> Light works for acne, but this light doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying cheap alkaline batteries, you&#x27;ll be replacing them every 8-10 uses.  </li>
            <li> instructions say to hold the light on the bump for 2 minutes, 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s important to know that this is a SPOT TREATMENT, not a treatment for people who have severe acne all over their face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m one of the people who were warned in the instructions against use because they could have a sensitivity to light or if the thing just drew out imperfections before their time</li>
            <li> However there is no way to tell when it has worn out because there is no battery indicator light.</li>
            <li> I would have choose 0 star&#x27;s if it was available.</li>
            <li> I currently use it whenever I feel a breakout coming on and also use It when my time of the month is coming, in my breakout zones to prevent any acne and it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better investment to buy the full size, rechargeable unit, because the cost of batteries to run the portable one would cover the difference in price between the portable unit and full size one.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Of course, you will need to practice a good regimen to help clear up your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought the Tanda zap a while ago because I could no longer find the Zeno which by far was a superior product.</li>
            <li> This is the best little invention around!</li>
            <li> Also worthwhile to mention, the manual states not to use it if you&#x27;re taking any drugs that makes skin sensitive to light - important if you&#x27;re taking a tetracycline for acne, as many people do.</li>
            <li> The first week I noticed a huge difference in my skin!   </li>
            <li> Cystic stuff loves to hang around for weeks, but it has shrunk significantly (around 75%) in one week.  </li>
            <li> used it exactly as directed, twice a day, sometimes more.</li>
            <li> Believe me it is worth a try!</li>
            <li> I notice is that Tanda appears to work on those with actual pimple issues, not those with &#x27;great&#x27; skin already who have that rare flare-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that all of the positive reviews are written by constituents of the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Both my mother and I have used this successfully over the last year or so on the relatively mild cystic acne we get on our chins.</li>
            <li> light therapy beds never worked for me but the red light therapy machine ($75) by tanda is amazing....</li>
            <li> :) I had one pimple that was really bothering me.</li>
            <li> this thing lights up like a full moon and is so powerfull i was like ooo this might work</li>
            <li> thanks tanda zap for my magic wand...</li>
            <li> good if you have occasional breakouts.  </li>
            <li> if you have more pimples, I won&#x27;t suggest this as it will take too much time.</li>
            <li> but it left his skin looking good.</li>
            <li> Only good for 100 uses and you use 2-3 time a day.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and nothing really works on me, not even 10% benzoyl peroxide, which \\&quot;burned\\&quot; my face after two weeks.</li>
            <li> Not as good and effective as the regular blue light treatments.</li>
            <li> and now I have some mild scarring, on both cheeks.</li>
            <li> It works best if you have only one or two areas where you break out that you want to treat, and is probably not cost-effective if you want to treat your entire face.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a useful adjunct to a good, proper skincare routine (i.e., sunscreen, moisturizer, adequate cleansing) and does seem to lessen the life cycle of pesky zits.  </li>
            <li> This also required batteries which die out quick when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I used the Tanda Zap for about 2 months on my mild to medium severity acne.</li>
            <li> While it *might* help to start reducing an already-exisitng pimple, there isn&#x27;t a quick change in the pimple&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This device is GREAT for back of head/neck zits - especially since you can&#x27;t really put any kind of benzoyl peroxide or anything on those spots.</li>
            <li> I have gone 5 days without a new pimple since using it and that is outstanding for my condition.  </li>
            <li> For something that is supposed to be heat activated, it doesn&#x27;t even get that hot!</li>
            <li> It has already made a significant difference in my skin in the first week.</li>
            <li> I am sure a lot of people are having to use it on multiple spots so the life of this guy will go very quickly</li>
            <li> Very bright and hard on eyes;however, the product works well wih repeated use.</li>
            <li> I have the illumask light therapy mask for Acne (which I highly recommend!)</li>
            <li> What is amazing is that it took only one application to make a cystic acne under my lower lip disappear.</li>
            <li> I think I got my money&#x27;s worth, and then some.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is worth the $50.</li>
            <li> The red light covered more areas, made pimples go away longer, and helped my wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sister didn&#x27;t have any success with this item either.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> For 50$ it may be worth it.  </li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> this it worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Yes, I may go through batteries, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t worth dealing with the batteries.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the effort</li>
            <li> Because in order for it to be effective, each pimple needs about 6 mins of treatment, a larger surface would save you a lot of time.</li>
            <li> Even with rechargeable batteries, it kept dying on me the day after I put freshly charged batteries in it.</li>
            <li> It worked better at first when the pimple was new and still &amp;#34;growing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It seems to be able to stop the formation of early blemishes if caught right away.</li>
            <li> I strongly dislike that this company set up their device to only work for 1000 uses, when they could have easily gotten it to work indefinitely.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER after having owned one for a year and another for like 2 months, NEITHER is working right now.</li>
            <li> the batteries didn&#x27;t sit right in my Zap.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I feel one coming on, I use my Zap and either it goes away right away or helps it go away faster</li>
            <li> works very well, easy, and it is  very fiunctional</li>
            <li> definitely plan on replacing the Tanda when its 1000 uses are up, if not upgrading to the Clear+ to avoid wasting batteries and being able to use the replaceable head for 6x as many treatments.  </li>
            <li> I originally used ProActiv but the cost for this program is too high.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for being a super store online.</li>
            <li> After testing out the Tanda Zap for a few months now, I have found that it works better to hold it on a bump for more like 4-6 minutes at a time, 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> I used up the batteries it came with in two days, however, I have put duracel in it and so far I am on day 5 and going strong.    </li>
            <li> (My eyes are very sensitive to light even though I close them during the treatment, and frankly I don&#x27;t have the patience to close my eyes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s specifically the early breakouts that respond the best rather than the fully developed blemish which is less affected by the treatment.  </li>
            <li> :) If my acne continues beyond the life of the product, I would definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> First off you need to read all the directions and warnings.</li>
            <li> Works well if you are persistent and use it when the first sign of a pimple shows.</li>
            <li> First off, as others have said, the thing goes through batteries</li>
            <li> This product is made for quickie zit zap-pin only if your finding yourself using it in more than 3[-4 spots at a time this product is not for you.  </li>
            <li> After using this exactly as directed I can say without a doubt......  </li>
            <li> It really does work for me!  </li>
            <li> The textured plastic over the light can hurt over a sensitive breakout as it is viabrating.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> It went away but still, DO NOT USE IT MORE THAN 3 TIMES ON ONE SAME AREA.</li>
            <li> I will say that if you buy cheap batteries they will not go as far.</li>
            <li> It really does kill the bacteria!</li>
            <li> This would be consistent with it&#x27;s mechanism of fighting off the acne-causing flora that colonize the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In the beginning it actually seemed like I was having more breakouts</li>
            <li> I still remember that when I found out my first one stopped working</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m here on amazon looking for a bigger one to cover more</li>
            <li> so I used it on a lot (8-10) of spots for the first week 2-3 times a day which was pretty time consuming.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> when the first one I bought died I doubted my estimate of usage.  </li>
            <li> worked on first application for me) and it says on the direction to use two to three times a day on acne.</li>
            <li> I have been on acne medications for year and have recently decided not to take it any more.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much!</li>
            <li> I want to keep my skin nice and am not afraid to spend a little extra on some batteries! :)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Acne Free to do the main job of clearing up the skin.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve saved so much money and embarrassment over a large pimples!</li>
            <li> Most of them just help with the surface stuff but arent much help with the deep pimples.  </li>
            <li> The device is only good for a specific number of timed cycles so if you have a lot of zits, you may go through it&#x27;s lifespan faster than anticipated.</li>
            <li> I quickly realized that it was kind of pointless for me.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews (mostly positive) on this product, I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> but it does...tried it twice already and both times I have had positive results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve had amazing success with the Tanda Zap to treat deep pimples that you can feel coming for several days before they surface.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the red light therapy by tanda does the same and BETTER job than this product.</li>
            <li> This is going to take SO much longer to clear than those original spots would have, and it&#x27;s going to leave SCARS.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I was very reluctant at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered another blue light therapy product that&#x27;s bigger and covers more of my face at one time.</li>
            <li> This small pocket-size device is really good for acne around eyes.</li>
            <li> battery gets low very very quickly.</li>
            <li> The pimple was hot, red and filled w/pus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my second one as the first one died after 2 years of use, which is fine by me considering how much use it got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only thing that has worked on a consistent basis for me is Acne Free</li>
            <li> : 1) it seems EATS batteries, which is fine, because I have rechargeable double AA&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am 45 with acne prone skin and it has been such a great little device to help control my acne.</li>
            <li> ; however I occasionally get a cystic bump on the very bottom of my chin or in my eyebrow region, where the light on the illumask does not reach.</li>
            <li> I really kinda let it get out of control</li>
            <li> Taking antibiotics clears up my acne very well, but after the medication is gone, it returns.   </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I really see any results.</li>
            <li> The combination of blue-light, heat, and vibration really does seem to be preventing the bacteria growth that leads to acne.    </li>
            <li> Unbelievably, it really works.</li>
            <li> So worth the price for clear skin.</li>
            <li> But what really get&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I really like the Tanda zap.</li>
            <li> Very tricky way to get you to keep forking out money by this</li>
            <li> as to now when it is decreasing in size I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> but this has made me very nervous to try anything.</li>
            <li> This acne device does absolutely nothing for my pimples.</li>
            <li> I recommend the red light but not this blue light...</li>
            <li> up pimples fast.  </li>
            <li> In conjunction with the blue light, the device vibrates.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to do an at home light treatment treatment over the entire face, I would recommend checking out the illumask.</li>
            <li> thing I want to point out is that you do have to use it properly - first, only 2-3 treatments a day, don&#x27;t use it over the thyroid/neck area (apparently can cause hyperthyroidism), and make sure not to look at the laser.  </li>
            <li> Four stars because, as mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t really help all blemishes, but the ones that do respond, respond well.</li>
            <li> It does reduce the number of breakouts and makes the existing ones heal much faster.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t unzit the acne although i was very hopeful.  </li>
            <li> , i really recomend it.  </li>
            <li> so you know really it doesn&#x27;t happen just overnight.</li>
            <li> After using this, 2x a day for 2 days the pimple is very diminished.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even know if I saw real results the couple of times I used it...</li>
            <li> I would have gave it 5 stars but it uses batteries up so much.</li>
            <li> Absorbing Cover or put BP cream on it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> If you do not have access to Acne Free, you should request your local Costco or Sam&#x27;s Club to carry it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it on the blackheads on my nose and chin, and my skin is much smoother in those areas and the blackheads are still there</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to use than creams,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because, in my opinion, it&#x27;s really just</li>
            <li> Statistically speaking, very probable.</li>
            <li> The whole battery thing would prevent me from buying again.</li>
            <li> By the way, it goes through batteries so fast that you would be spending over 50 dollars a year on batteries alone.</li>
            <li> This really eliminated it</li>
            <li> Not work very well.</li>
            <li> But heck, even if you have have to replace the batteries but have clear skin in exchange, isn&#x27;t it worth it???</li>
            <li> Received last week so far everything okay.</li>
            <li> Every time they started to clear another blemish would arise right adjacent.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical if this would really work, but I am happy to announce that it did.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write product reviews, and I&#x27;m one of the biggest skeptics out there, but felt the need to post about the Tanda Zap!</li>
            <li> I am older and have infrequent breakouts and have found Tanda to be VERY helpful.  </li>
            <li> The device really works to clear up acne fast!</li>
            <li> you will still have to wash your face or use a facial tone to wipe your skin clean, but it did get rid of the zit.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money - pretty much sums it up.</li>
            <li> They seem to last a long time and are quite effective for me.</li>
            <li> In 4 treatments the large, nodular zits were reduced by more than half</li>
            <li> have been on antibiotic and topical medications, but still experienced at least one huge pimple per month (especially the week before menstruation).</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m using rechargeable batteries for this, highly encouraged as its consumes energy fast.  </li>
            <li> But when I have had really tender blimishes, it makes them less tender for sure.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve got full on, inflamed, patches of acne in the areas that those initial blemishes used to be.  </li>
            <li> If this is problematic, Tanda makes a more professional model (Tanda Clear Plus) with a larger treatment area and rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> It is programmed to shut down permanently after so many applications.  </li>
            <li> If you are going through new batteries every day, then you are probably trying to use this tool too much.</li>
            <li> I have scars now and waiting for new skin to come up, but because I&#x27;m not getting acne over and over again, my skin actually can see the light of forming new skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product a lot, because I have so many blemishes, but I find myself using it less today, because it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> In that respect they are creating less scarring and it has helped slightly more than a placebo.</li>
            <li> Many of the ones that were red are no longer red.</li>
            <li> only made for quick results and to kill bacteria...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is if I spend this amount of money on a gadget I expected it to shrink pimples faster and more completely.</li>
            <li> ALSO don&#x27;t apply on same area more than 3 times in a row in the same area.</li>
            <li> but I will still use it on a much smaller scale to get a better idea of whether it actually does anything.</li>
            <li> Further, if you use rechargeable batteries, realize that many chargers can only charge batteries in twos or fours.</li>
            <li> The original batteries have lasted that long.</li>
            <li> luck, save your money and make the splurge for the red light, I guarantee you better results and a machine that isn&#x27;t battery powered and small.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a spot treatment machine or a acne clearing machine get a high frequency device.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is rated too high.</li>
            <li> I ordered the zap and a red light therapy from someone else within same time frame that I just never used the zap again and have been faithful to my red light therapy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I and my skin are highly irritated.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, I would highly recommend this product to those who get those cystic acne flare ups.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> (looks like dairy, high glycemic index foods, etc.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clear them terribly fast, but it does help a bit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate because it&#x27;s a great concept otherwise.</li>
            <li> You will burn through three AAA batteries per day with normal use.  </li>
            <li> The larger version is much better quality and has lasted me for a long time.</li>
            <li> It works OK if you use it everyday, but don&#x27;t skip days.</li>
            <li> I use it 2/3 times a day on the zit and the zit clears up in 2 to 3 days instead of my normal 7 days.</li>
            <li> ABOUT THE NORMAL TIME FOR PIMPLES</li>
            <li> I like it, but with the sometimes many blemishes I&#x27;ll have at the same time, I&#x27;ll use this thing back-to-back on different spots on my face for occasionally 10 minutes straight!</li>
            <li> since they don&#x27;t develop fully and never pop...may be a good thing from a scaring perspective, but still, it&#x27;s no magic bullet for larger blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Overall still worth a try as the cost isn&#x27;t that prohibitive.</li>
            <li> Normally, when I get these cystic acne they remain for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> The next day, it got bigger and turned into a full zit!</li>
            <li> but it definitely makes the pimple SHRINK and easy to  cover the next day!</li>
            <li> I only get zits right before my period.</li>
            <li> I have been using it several times a day in 3-4 spots with several repetitions and the batteries are just fine.</li>
            <li> Not very eco friendly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s time to get a new one.</li>
            <li> After that time, you dispose the device and buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> read about the Tanda blue light products and settled on the Tanda Zap because it was way cheaper than the actual wand.</li>
            <li> But when I first got the unit, the batteries lasted a few days, now I&#x27;m lucky if I get through a morning or evening session.</li>
            <li> this is my 4th time on this product, love it for its small size which makes it so portable.&lt;br /&gt;Dries</li>
            <li> would keep a realistic perspective with these treatments (it&#x27;s not going to clear up skin completely overnight),</li>
            <li> I never had acne as a teenager, so this is new for me and nothing seems to completely clear my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two months and it has cleared 90 percent of old and new lesions and with no side effects.</li>
            <li> anyone who wants to get one with larger surface, Tanda Clear+ is really expensive, so I use Aurora, which is a lot cheaper but very effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding that the more I use it the less of those deep breakouts I have.  </li>
            <li> I am a vegetarian, eat very healthy and exercise daily, which helps a lot to keep my skin clear, but I would still get a few zits on my cheeks and chin over and over in the same spots.</li>
            <li> Mid-twenties skin with a smattering of deep-forming zits that aren&#x27;t affected by topical creams until they&#x27;ve already breached the surface and become quite large.</li>
            <li> It only works on certain types of acne as stated in the included guide</li>
            <li> only con I&#x27;ve found is that it does take a suprisingly large amount of batteries.</li>
            <li> also works great on cold sores.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and have struggled to get clear skin.</li>
            <li> I mmediately used the Tanda Zap when I received it and in a matter of days my problem areas were clear and have not recurred.  </li>
            <li> I expected to feel a zap or something, but it&#x27;s just a blue light that doesn&#x27;t get any warmer than a flashlight might.</li>
            <li> This time it was taking weeks to clear.</li>
            <li> The Zap acne device helped clear my blemishes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already seen an almost complete elimination of emerging blemishes on my face.     </li>
            <li> Maybe the professional version helps, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for my on and off moderate to severe cystic acne and nothing has helped my skin as much as the tanda zap.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> far I have not had to change out the batteries.  </li>
            <li> This really really does make my pimples tiny if i use it after trying everything else.</li>
            <li> Batteries don&#x27;t die quite as fast as reviewers have said, but maybe that&#x27;s because I only use it on a couple of spots per day.</li>
            <li> I have adult, hormone-related acne (I&#x27;m 28)</li>
            <li> /&gt;SERIOUSLY DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Call a professional about Rx creams, antibiotics, or birth control.</li>
            <li> For some spots it did nothing at all but for others I think it worked, but not overnight or completely.</li>
            <li> Overall it didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li> Although many do not believe that chocolate cause acne I have from experience found that it does, at least for me.</li>
            <li> This time around I was pleasantly surprised that it was no longer</li>
            <li> (I frown on ordering cleansing products online as it adds a whole lot to the cost of such necessities).</li>
            <li> so much I have given as a gift and also purchased the larger rechargable unit.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about 3 weeks now but really does work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to work when I start treatment in the early stages of pimple development and on some types of pimples.</li>
            <li> only downside is batteries wear out fast.</li>
            <li> Ergo, my suggestion is that this is not for people who have a lot of acne, it&#x27;s more for those that just get a few deep pimples here and there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doubtful about blue light therapy treatment for acne, but I&#x27;ve been routinely receiving professional blue light treatment for the last 2 months now and my skin has never been this good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good device to have if you suffer from blemishes if you can get it at a discount, I think the full price is very expensive especially since it&#x27;s essentially a disposable item because once it&#x27;s predetermined number of zaps is over you have to throw it out and get a new one.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;ve seen very little progress over the last several months.  </li>
            <li> do not mean to sound so negative</li>
            <li> I got a high frequency machine for the same cost as this.</li>
            <li> But I guess if they say one bad thing about it (something easily overlooked) people will think the reviews are more genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After two days of using it, it was significantly smaller than normal.</li>
            <li> It helps calm down pimple swelling and redness.</li>
            <li> Please note that Section 5 of the FTC Act, prohibits deceptive acts or practices, such as reselling a returned product as new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may still provoke new spots in different places, but I hope eventually the face will be cleared</li>
            <li> The Tanda Zap has helped me clear up those last areas I couldn&#x27;t seem to get clear.</li>
            <li> Have now had this device for a few weeks, and it does genuinely work, but for very specific situations.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first, but after using the Tanda for sometime now I can honestly say it works.</li>
            <li> If you are going to charge people $50 for something like this, it better damn well last past 2 months!</li>
            <li> so then I tried on my face and it cause major irritation and did nothing to diminish the zit.</li>
            <li> I used this and the next day it was almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> Using the large device around the eyes is not very convenient for me.</li>
            <li> I think it makes my blemishes heal a little faster, plus it&#x27;s fun to use</li>
            <li> This pricy little gadget does do what it says, but not fast or effectively enough for me to be able to justify the price.</li>
            <li> Generally works well.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my skin generally looked smoother after  use</li>
            <li> The Tandazap is promoted as &#x27;clinically proven to clear or fade acne blemishes within 24 hours using it 2-3 times daily&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Tanda Zap in hopes that it would preform similarly and help clear</li>
            <li> but I feel like the blemish takes the same amount of time to clear</li>
            <li> It only took three days for all my blemishes to clear using this product.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money and get the Clear and bypass the Zap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> I like it but recommend the Clear Model and especially the rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> I currently have had acne issues from hormonal imbalance and this has helped clear up the acne because of that.</li>
            <li> After switching my birth control around, I&#x27;ve had adult acne for several years now.</li>
            <li> I believe this technique may work on a larger, professional scale, but this Tanda Zap did not work at all.</li>
            <li> But I found out by trying it that THE TRICK TO KEEPING YOUR BATTERIES LASTING LONGER is to take them completely out of the Tanda Zap when not using it and when you need to use it again for a treatment</li>
            <li> And it barely vibrates (which I think is just another gimmick</li>
            <li> I think it did help my daughter when I made her use it, but we could barely get two sessions out of one set of batteries.  </li>
            <li> so well, that I bought a second one for my young niece</li>
            <li> Naturally thinking it was the batteries I exchanged them and same issue.</li>
            <li> Before that I&#x27;m not sure if it worked, but it was a good idea and kept me from squeezing the offending zits so they would at least heal on their own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that if I used it a few times a day, my blemish quickly disappeared and have been using it for approx 6 mths now with the same results again and again.  </li>
            <li> Once you get past those few caveats, this device is pretty helpful and straightforward to use.  </li>
            <li> It became a constant stream of one huge welt at a time, at least twice a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin type: early twenties, moderate acne with occasional cysts.</li>
            <li> For example, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work on those pimples that turn fast into white heads but works on those that either take longer to come out or never really do.</li>
            <li> No dry patches or scars....</li>
            <li> The batteries didn&#x27;t last as long as the first one and the button was jammed soon after.</li>
            <li> I tried this and the swelling really went down within 2 days.</li>
            <li> and I have a very noticibly less blackheads.</li>
            <li> Claims to &amp;#34;clear blemishes within 24 hours&amp;#34; and it didn&#x27;t clear a single thing.</li>
            <li> Apparently there are several different kinds of AAAs, and it prefers the ones that are one use only.</li>
            <li> It does seem to help my acne (or at least it keeps me from touching my face with my hands), but I have gone through two packs of 20 batteries in less than a month.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, and definitely keeps pimples from getting worse.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s not a bad purchase, especially if you only get very small blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from an extreme form of acne, but it got rid of my existing acne and prevents new ones from surfacing.</li>
            <li> The larger of the two got a little weepy after the treatments, leading me to believe that it was really working.  </li>
            <li> I do have about five trouble spots on my face, but moving the unit around my face twice a day can burn up 3 AAA batteries in less than two full uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne since teenager and in my late 20&#x27;s right now and still suffer from acne.</li>
            <li> If you catch it right when it is starting to get sore, this will usually make it go completely away within a few days if you use it multiple times.</li>
            <li> Normally, it would take several days for the painful pimple under the skin to come to the top, then it would break and heal.  </li>
            <li> I do notice that the zits will either stay pretty small or not stick around as long as if I didn&#x27;t use it, but it has not actually prevented one from forming, FYI.</li>
            <li> The web site for the product claims that there money back guarantee if it doesn&#x27;t work, but apparently, not if you buy it from amazon.</li>
            <li> It takes less than 15 minutes 2x a day and three new AAA batteries each week.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that battery doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The smaller blemishes reduced in size and swelling, but so far are still a little red.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it really works ...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it really works, because I usually get the cystic acne, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work well on them.</li>
            <li> And the AAA batteries dont last too long.  </li>
            <li> It is a bummer that the batteries don&#x27;t last as long as one would hope.</li>
            <li> that long if I got several pimples around my</li>
            <li> They will last a long time.</li>
            <li> But for regularly getting multiple pimples, its simply not realistic.</li>
            <li> All I wanted to do was clear a few moderately sized blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this in conjunction with raw honey.  </li>
            <li> I have seen dermatologists who prescribed products that were either too harsh or were not good long term solutions such as antibiotics to cleansing foams that are no longer available.</li>
            <li> The batteries run out daily,  the vibration only works about half the time, and it does not seem to get rid of pimples, only flattens them</li>
            <li> and so far I have noticed a little difference</li>
            <li> Goes through batteries very quickly &amp; difficult to use in areas where the light may shine in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having problem with the cyst type of pimple, and this have helped me to clear quite a few of them.</li>
            <li> Stick with it as long as it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to your skin and it will work.</li>
            <li> Really strange, this device.</li>
            <li> As long as You follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> When you activate the device it is timed, its not however long you want it to run, you turn it on and it runs for two minutes.</li>
            <li> I tried it on pimples of all sizes with absolutely no improvement in the time it took for the zit to be smaller or disappear.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on different treatments for acne</li>
            <li> it appears much smaller and less red.</li>
            <li> Initially, I did have positive results but after a week of use my condition got CONSIDERABLY worse.  </li>
            <li> There is a larger tanda that is made for other acne issues.  </li>
            <li> I have occasional breakouts, and when I do they are not pretty.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work at All, I&#x27;m a teen and would recommend to look for other options</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that other customers have had the same issues.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to those with very minor acne.</li>
            <li> Within 12-24 hours is when I notice that it feels clearer, and one thing that is beneficial with this device compared to a spot treatment or acne serum is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li> I can do 2-3 treatment cycles twice a day and regular disposable AAA batteries last me a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Wish that it wasnt limited to 1000 uses</li>
            <li> The unit does have a limited life span.  </li>
            <li> Usually it would take a couple weeks for them to completely clear up (come to the surface, pop and then heal), with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products (Proactiv, topical clindamycin, salicylic acid, etc) with minimal results.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the package although the seal on the box  was intact, the support inside the box was ripped and the device was loose.</li>
            <li> half good reviews and half bad</li>
            <li> The pimples that would last for 2 weeks were shorted to one week or less with it.</li>
            <li> so it probably won&#x27;t work for you either unless you have black heads only or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only have the odd one now and again ...</li>
            <li> I tracked on the second one - less than 25% of the promised applications.  </li>
            <li> I just had a lot of deep bacteria that when I started using it all started coming to the surface, now that I&#x27;ve used it for a little while it&#x27;s definitely happening less</li>
            <li> If four AAA&#x27;s would result in a device that is a little larger</li>
            <li> Because of the costs, I will be stopping my visits to clinic and I&#x27;ve been nervouse for awhile and started searching for alternatives and found this tiny little thing, which I thought I can give a try for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This little unit works really well on pimples, the problem is you have to replace 3 AAA batteries at least every 12-15 uses.</li>
            <li> Really bad, in fact my daughter followed the directions to the letter, and ended up with more acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Am I frustrated, you better believe it.</li>
            <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone who suffers with breakouts all over their face, because the surface area on the light is&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am surprised reading the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Tanda Zap Acne Clearing Device lately and have been pleasantly surprised by its results.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not much when they tell you to use it three times per day per zit.  </li>
            <li> I followed instructions carefully.  </li>
            <li> I just spent $30 on rechargable batteries b/c</li>
            <li> this is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> total waste</li>
            <li> I had two nodular zits and a few smaller pimples that needed tending to.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I can do now is warn you not to waste your money like I did.  </li>
            <li> Notice the wide discrepancy.  </li>
            <li> I get big sore cystic acne every few months.</li>
            <li> I do noticed a reduction of redness and inflammation of trouble spots, and it works really well for very small blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this device, but interested enough to try it and see if it worked.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, I am not a teenager and do not have frequent or serious breakouts</li>
            <li> Unless you solve the internal reason for acne, this will do very little</li>
            <li> I tried it on one of my very small, mild zits and it only made it worse!</li>
            <li> One caveat - it does give the kids something to do other than squeezing them.  </li>
            <li> Also like other reviews have stated, I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s not reusable after 1000 uses.</li>
            <li> I other reviews can be discouraging</li>
            <li> Even when used everyday my skin is not completely clear.</li>
            <li> The smaller ones usually disappear within a day.  </li>
            <li> I use it 2-3 times and usually the next day it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li> Based on other reviews I went ahead and bought rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my teenage son and we followed instructions and were still not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Even with a disciplined cleansing regimen you will still get a breakout here and there due to genetics or predisposition due to your diet.</li>
            <li> The scale of the device is really only designed to treat one or a small cluster of breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d say for the past 2-3 years, I would experience constant breakouts by my mouth and chin.</li>
            <li> I have small white heads on my chin that I couldn&#x27;t get to go away till I started using this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it actually worked at all, but I was giving it a shot anyway.</li>
            <li> but when I do there are a bad and this makes it not so red and doesnt last near as long..........</li>
            <li> Since I wrote this reveiw the product stopped working, less than 3 months with minimal usage.  </li>
            <li> The product itself worked but on such a small scale that it was not worth getting again or even recommending.</li>
            <li> The product insert states that it can be used 1000x&#x27;s before it craps out, so with my going average I will have to replace the batteries 20 times with 3 AAA batteries each time, so you can do the math on battery costs.  </li>
            <li> With how much I have to replace the batteries though, I will not be purchasing another one when this one completely fails.</li>
            <li> (they just prescribed drugs with potentially risky side effects) and Proactive which was way too harsh and actually made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a primary treatment tool -- if you use it this way, you&#x27;ll quickly become frustrated with how long it takes (2 minutes per treatment) -- and the number of batteries you use.  </li>
            <li> its now 4:46pm and the area that i went over has shrunken down alot...</li>
            <li> This does cut down the healing time.  </li>
            <li> I broke down and bought the Tanda when I started getting hormonal breakouts after getting off birth control.  </li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive, but after reading the other reviews decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Even the scars seem to be less prominent(because</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s less spots to use it on now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the TandaZap for about a week and a half</li>
            <li> You will notice a slight temporary darkening in the area you used it on, but it goes away in minutes.</li>
            <li> Given the previous two points, if you were trying to cover a lot of area (meaning you have a lot of acne) it could take all morning and use the product up a lot quicker</li>
            <li> So if you have to stop in the middle of one session that unfortunately will count 1, and if your batteries died in the middle that will count as 1 too..</li>
            <li> but much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this years ago and use less than 5 times and it broke.</li>
            <li> After half a dozen battery swaps, it started to leak battery acid over my fingers every time I tried replacing the batteries.</li>
            <li> Using the Zap, these pimples never surfaced -- healed in about half the time -- without any scar or blemish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works on keeping cystic pimples less painful and smaller.</li>
            <li> It began running for less than 8 seconds.</li>
            <li> I go through a new set of batteries every two days, whether they are the less expensive store or name brands.</li>
            <li> A little background on me:</li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s a little picture on it indicating that I should NOT throw it away.</li>
            <li> This little device requires you to treat pimples three times a day for two minutes each for it to work.</li>
            <li> Usually these huge pimples are very painful and last for months and then leaves a scar.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, folks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of $50</li>
            <li> It appears to work after a few treatments.</li>
            <li> I had a few stubborn pimples that were taking forever to go away</li>
            <li> but if i use this at-least twice a day everyday my batteries have lasted me at-least a week.  </li>
            <li> stopped working after a few days.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this product.</li>
            <li> actual product I got from this seller was broken.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few uses.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t work at all, waste of money, uses a lot of batteries.</li>
            <li> I believe people on here who are saying that it worked are probably just trying to convince themselves that they didn&#x27;t waste their money.</li>
            <li> dont waste ur time or money on this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50s and still get a few zits now and again.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a few days...</li>
            <li> Completely waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am 25 and was having a lot of trouble with acne, and was looking for any way out.</li>
            <li> Its now in my cabinet, and I have not used it since the few weeks I bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago because I am in my 40&#x27;s and started getting  cystic acne on my chin every month.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this product again, it&#x27;s not worth the money wasted!~</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything dont waste your money, try doing a Folic acid peel.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Leaves a circle mark and temporarily darkens the skin, but it usually clears up after a few hours/day.</li>
            <li> Batteries: Yes, this thing sucks down batteries.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is really any &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34; to completely eliminate these nasty cystic pimples within days.</li>
            <li> I am honestly not sure of the exact purpose of the vibration, but I have found that it can sometimes be painful over a breakout.</li>
            <li> This little goody does so works!</li>
            <li> I usually get the ones that are really under the skin that hurt really bad.</li>
            <li> I have tried to contact the seller to send it back, unfortunately I am getting no response.  </li>
            <li> i was thinking it was gonna let out this small ligt and vibration..</li>
            <li> Total rip-off!  </li>
            <li> NOT CHEAP!</li>
            <li> a spot will usually disappear within 24-hours</li>
            <li> The small size is convenient so it is also portable.</li>
            <li> small.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how well it works, but maybe maybe.  </li>
            <li> The surface is relatively small.</li>
            <li> Based on the Amazon reviews, I bought this expecting it to either work small miracles or do nothing.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes about a week for me to see it gone.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about two weeks but not sure if it does what it advertised.</li>
            <li> I have read some of these studies but they are questionable due to the fact that the subjects were either not predisposed to acne or other dietary factors were not included.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small</li>
            <li> if not more so.  </li>
            <li> At least they give you that small</li>
            <li> The case itself was also hard to shut.</li>
            <li> Hard to see the effect.</li>
            <li> I will revoke my negative review if it works.</li>
            <li> treat the blemish as soon as it appears, with a treatment at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> but it does have to be replaced often enough that if I were using disposable batteries it would get expensive and would be frustrating, but with rechargeables</li>
            <li> I have the hormonal under the skin bumps once or twice a month, and this was not effective in clearing them.</li>
            <li> The biggest complaint is the battery life, which I remedied by getting rechargables.</li>
            <li> The second one I purchased was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Not amazing though either.</li>
            <li> I thought there was something wrong with the batteries I bought and seriously thought about complaining to the store until I saw the other review.</li>
            <li> Breakouts plus facial massage are a bad idea why on earth did I think to use this.</li>
            <li> Bought this product and tried it on a painful bump deep under the skin.  </li>
            <li> This is not good customer loyalty.</li>
            <li> They last a long time and scar terribly.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this unit.</li>
            <li> The kicker is that the very vibration spreads one pimple and turns it into a pimple cluster on my skin with horrific results.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my breakouts decrease with two uses, but changing the batteries does get frustrating.</li>
            <li> I would say that it Definately manages the pimples so they don&#x27;t get worse and speeds up healing.</li>
            <li> Tried it and acne got worse.</li>
            <li> Total piece of crap</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another reason I think the manufacturers are behind the reviews is that I never had any problems with the batteries.</li>
            <li> The company Tanda Zap would not replace it or stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hopeful that this will help me break my horrible picking habit.  </li>
            <li> are behind acne).</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that the product I was sold was clearly used and reboxed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going through a really bad break out for the past couple of months</li>
            <li> That cleared up all acne and lasts way longer than this cheesy device.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I fell for it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it goes through dozens of batteries</li>
            <li> Also, you get 1000 uses out of this for $50 (not including batteries, which are also expensive).</li>
            <li> When it broke, it became too expensive to buy a replacement because the company that made Zeno increased their prices by a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I bought a second one and it was pathetic.</li>
            <li> As soon as i felt a pimple coming (blind pimple)</li>
            <li> Therefore, each treatment is 4 times as expensive.  </li>
            <li> Salicylic acid is useless.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I&#x27;m telling you - it works.</li>
            <li> Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this useless product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> i was desperate enough to try anything, but this product is terrible.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look crazy.  </li>
            <li> I broke out like crazy in the areas I used this.</li>
            <li> does suck batteries like crazy.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest disappointment I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Also, it goes through batteries like crazy.</li>
            <li> When I opened the battery compartment, the battery cartridge was dirty, and one of the springs was bent over.</li>
            <li> I got the tandazap in a desperate need for SOMETHING.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it works!</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to tell if this works or not.</li>
            <li> I had a bad bout with acne infection on my face.</li>
            <li> If you can use this  Tanda device on a blemish as it develops, you can prevent a really bad breakout.</li>
            <li> My pimples immediately reduce in size and for the painful swollen ones, it reduces discomfort.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ugly head.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> i gave one to my nephew and he was totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> Mine ran out of batteries! :(</li>
            <li> and it died just before picture day :(</li>
            <li> really disappointed in  this product.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the Tanda device.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy this crap!</li>
            <li> and that was because the ones that come with the unit are horrible and lasted one day...</li>
            <li> Also, the battery life is HORRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> I dont have terrible acne</li>
            <li> - the battery life is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product does not work at all, I wish I can get my money back! Do not buy this crap!</li>
            <li> The vibration feature (which cannot be turned off) plus the shape makes this product appear eerily suggestive. The kicker is that the very vibration spreads one pimple and turns it into a pimple cluster on my skin with horrific results. Light works for acne, but this light doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I got this as a groupon deal and I love it. It says that after 1000 uses you will have to buy a replacement but it works great. I use it 3 times a day when I have a white head and the next day it appears much smaller and less red. I love it. Wish that it wasnt limited to 1000 uses but I will definitely buy another when I need to.</li>
            <li> I thought there was something wrong with the batteries I bought and seriously thought about complaining to the store until I saw the other review. The more you use this unit, the more energy it seems to require. I do have about five trouble spots on my face, but moving the unit around my face twice a day can burn up 3 AAA batteries in less than two full uses. But when I first got the unit, the batteries lasted a few days, now I&#x27;m lucky if I get through a morning or evening session. It does seem to help my acne (or at least it keeps me from touching my face with my hands), but I have gone through two packs of 20 batteries in less than a month.</li>
            <li> No difference and stains my skin. I am african american and not on any prescription meds. every time i use it, it leaves a circular mark wear the UV rays were. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see if it gets better. I will revoke my negative review if it works.</li>
            <li> A little background on me: After switching my birth control around, I&#x27;ve had adult acne for several years now. I really kinda let it get out of control and now I have some mild scarring, on both cheeks. Taking antibiotics clears up my acne very well, but after the medication is gone, it returns.   I&#x27;ve been using this product for two days now and the results are just awesome. All the swelling in any of the blemishes on my face are gone. Many of the ones that were red are no longer red. Even the scars seem to be less prominent(because they&#x27;re not red anymore). I&#x27;ve been using the product a lot, because I have so many blemishes, but I find myself using it less today, because it&#x27;s working and there&#x27;s less spots to use it on now. :) I had one pimple that was really bothering me. After using the Zap on it just once, I could poke it without pain. You could tell, within minutes of using it, that it was working.  Stuff I don&#x27;t like about it: 1) it seems EATS batteries, which is fine, because I have rechargeable double AA&#x27;s. :) No sweat. 2) I read in the manual that after 1000 uses that it just shuts off and will never power back on. 3) Also, there&#x27;s a little picture on it indicating that I should NOT throw it away. I hope they have a recycling program....  ***One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time. I wish I got the bigger one, but I just couldn&#x27;t afford it. This little one works great though! I think I got my money&#x27;s worth, and then some. :) If my acne continues beyond the life of the product, I would definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> First off you need to read all the directions and warnings. It specifically states in the User Manuel, CAUTION! Do not use if you are taking any Antihistamines or Anti-inflammatory drugs. I decided it would be best to listen to this warning and not use this, since I am on Antihistamines. I have tried to contact the seller to send it back, unfortunately I am getting no response.  It&#x27;s a shame they do not tell you this before you order.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it works!</li>
            <li> The first week I noticed a huge difference in my skin!   Found out about the product on the Today show and I am so happy that I did!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I really see any results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the TandaZap for about a week and a half and I&#x27;ve already seen an almost complete elimination of emerging blemishes on my face.     My skin type: Mid-twenties skin with a smattering of deep-forming zits that aren&#x27;t affected by topical creams until they&#x27;ve already breached the surface and become quite large. The combination of blue-light, heat, and vibration really does seem to be preventing the bacteria growth that leads to acne.    Batteries: Yes, this thing sucks down batteries. Buy a jumbo pack of triple AAAs and stop complaining. I&#x27;m sufficiently sold on this product that when I hit the maximum 1000 uses I plan to buy the more expensive rechargeable Tanda model.</li>
            <li> Bought these for both my son and daughter.  I&#x27;ve seen them use them several times a day.  We went through lots of batteries before I started using camera grade rechargables.  To be honest, I&#x27;ve seen very little progress over the last several months.  (Unless a worsening of their respective facial acne is to be considered progress.)  Maybe the professional version helps, but given what this one does, I wouldn&#x27;t pay for it.  One caveat - it does give the kids something to do other than squeezing them.  In that respect they are creating less scarring and it has helped slightly more than a placebo.</li>
            <li> Product seems to work well.  Ordering another to replace it (already).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;Batteries don&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;Only lasted about a month before it burned out.</li>
            <li> I go through a new set of batteries every two days, whether they are the less expensive store or name brands. I have noticed my breakouts decrease with two uses, but changing the batteries does get frustrating.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson and he feels it is working for him.  The redness from the acne is almost gone and the pimples are going away.</li>
            <li> I bought it for our teenagers. Unbelievably, it really works. It reduces the pimples very quickly. They are telling all their friends. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 3 months and I am very pleased with my purchase.  I read the reviews beforehand and bought the rechargeable batteries, which are a must.  My pimples immediately reduce in size and for the painful swollen ones, it reduces discomfort.  My husband recently asked me why I use it if it doesn&#x27;t permentantly cure my acne, and I replied, it keeps them under control so I don&#x27;t look crazy.  I would say that it Definately manages the pimples so they don&#x27;t get worse and speeds up healing.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind replacing the batteries EVERY day, this is a great item.  Warning!  You will burn through three AAA batteries per day with normal use.  Research this item before you buy it.  It&#x27;s a better investment to buy the full size, rechargeable unit, because the cost of batteries to run the portable one would cover the difference in price between the portable unit and full size one.  Also, note that this unit only runs for 1,000 uses.  That&#x27;s not much when they tell you to use it three times per day per zit.  I do not recommend the Tanda Zap.</li>
            <li> I followed instructions carefully.  Visit product website....IT DOES NOT WORK.  The Tandazap is promoted as &#x27;clinically proven to clear or fade acne blemishes within 24 hours using it 2-3 times daily&#x27;.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Works well if you are persistent and use it when the first sign of a pimple shows. Leaves a circle mark and temporarily darkens the skin, but it usually clears up after a few hours/day. Good product. Eats up battery so get rechargeable ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fare. Not as good and effective as the regular blue light treatments. It does diminishes some of the swelling from acne.</li>
            <li> Should have known better than to use a vibration on the face. Breakouts plus facial massage are a bad idea why on earth did I think to use this. The vibration stimulates oil glands. I broke out like crazy in the areas I used this. I got a high frequency machine for the same cost as this. That cleared up all acne and lasts way longer than this cheesy device. If you are looking for a spot treatment machine or a acne clearing machine get a high frequency device. Skip this!</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical if this would really work, but I am happy to announce that it did. I followed the directions to the letter and it actually worked. Stick with it as long as it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to your skin and it will work. I am 45 with acne prone skin and it has been such a great little device to help control my acne. So worth the price for clear skin. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Goes through batteries very quickly &amp; difficult to use in areas where the light may shine in your eyes.  Very bright and hard on eyes;however, the product works well wih repeated use.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews (mostly positive) on this product, I decided to give it a shot. Boy was I disappionted. First off, as others have said, the thing goes through batteries like there&#x27;s no tomorrow. That I could deal with. But what really get&#x27;s me is that after One Month, and only using it twice a day, the thing stopped working! I don&#x27;t know how I could have gone through 1000 uses in one month! What a waste of money. Buyer Beware.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after watching The Doctor&#x27;s Show. I was a little apprehensive, but after reading the other reviews decided to give it a try. It truly works! I had a bad bout with acne infection on my face. This product has healed the spot and the scar is beginning to fade. I have use it faithfully  twice a day for about two weeks. The original batteries have lasted that long. I did order the rechargeable ones also. Great product for the cost!! It has saved me a visit to a dermatologist, which would have cost much more...Thanks to Amazon for being a super store online.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, folks.  This is a big scam. This turd did absolutley nothing for my acne- nothing !!  I&#x27;m sorry I fell for it.</li>
            <li> I believe this technique may work on a larger, professional scale, but this Tanda Zap did not work at all. I followed the directions to a T and nothing improved. I have had it for 1-2 mos and nothing! It&#x27;s a waste of $50</li>
            <li> Very great, cleared a 3 yr acne scar</li>
            <li> Broke after about 5 months. The larger version is much better quality and has lasted me for a long time.</li>
            <li> It somewhat helps with cystic acne. Not as noticeable a difference as I had hoped. Also like other reviews have stated, I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s not reusable after 1000 uses. Not very eco friendly.</li>
            <li> In theory it should work. However, it did not hold up. I returned it- twice! Maybe once technology catches up, it&#x27;ll be a good product.</li>
            <li> I really like the Tanda zap. It appears to work after a few treatments. I had a few stubborn pimples that were taking forever to go away and when I used this product it helped to get rid of them after about a week of daily treatments. The downside is that is does suck batteries like crazy. But I found out by trying it that THE TRICK TO KEEPING YOUR BATTERIES LASTING LONGER is to take them completely out of the Tanda Zap when not using it and when you need to use it again for a treatment just put the batteries back in. It must continue to suck the battery life even when not being used if the batteries are in the product.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and have struggled to get clear skin. I am a vegetarian, eat very healthy and exercise daily, which helps a lot to keep my skin clear, but I would still get a few zits on my cheeks and chin over and over in the same spots. The Tanda Zap has helped me clear up those last areas I couldn&#x27;t seem to get clear. You have to keep using everyday-but it works.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought it after i watched a review on Dr. oz. and read the instruction. It does not work at all. Sent it back</li>
            <li> It is not for my kind of acne. It was advertised as something that can just take care of your pimple/acne, but it&#x27;s not so.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I bought this, I guess on a whim that it might work. It doesn&#x27;t. Now it&#x27;s sitting in the back of my cabinet collecting dust.</li>
            <li> The Tanda Zap is a great product, it really does kill the acne. HOWEVER after having owned one for a year and another for like 2 months, NEITHER is working right now. I just spent $30 on rechargable batteries b/c the Zap EATS batteries like you read about, and now neither unit is working. Am I frustrated, you better believe it. If you are going to charge people $50 for something like this, it better damn well last past 2 months!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for my on and off moderate to severe cystic acne and nothing has helped my skin as much as the tanda zap. I&#x27;ve been using it for two months and it has cleared 90 percent of old and new lesions and with no side effects. It takes less than 15 minutes 2x a day and three new AAA batteries each week. I will never use antibiotics or drying topicals ever again. The Tanda Zap is just amazing.</li>
            <li> Product works wonderfully. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s an overnight miracle worker but it shrinks the area and makes it more manageable. After two days of using it, it was significantly smaller than normal. I wish I got  this product earlier.</li>
            <li> It works for 1,000 uses.  The batteries it came with didn&#x27;t work.  And the AAA batteries dont last too long.  Supposed to use on one pimple 2-3 times per day, two minutes each, it times itself.  No pain.  It does work, I dont get pimples often but when I do there are a bad and this makes it not so red and doesnt last near as long..........Since I wrote this reveiw the product stopped working, less than 3 months with minimal usage.  The sellers did refund me however i was charged a $10 restocking fee for a defective product?!!!  Why is is there a fee to restock when you shouldnt restock a broke product!</li>
            <li> From my experience with it, it is just scam. I threw it away. Do not waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li> This this is awesome but it does require a lot of energy.  If you&#x27;re buying cheap alkaline batteries, you&#x27;ll be replacing them every 8-10 uses.  Buy LITHIUM batteries!  I put them in 2 weeks ago and have used the Zap 4-5 a day since then, its still going strong.</li>
            <li> I bought the tanda zap 1 week ago. Ive used it over and over and havent gotten rid if one zit</li>
            <li> I other reviews can be discouraging so I thought I would share my results. When I purchased this product last month I wanted help for the breakouts I get around my cycle. This device works for me. The breakouts disappear.  iover night or become much smaller. This is worth the $50. I have got a fair amount of treatments off the batteries that came with it. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> This tanda zap is my favorite tool at fighting cystic acne.  Unfortunately it goes through dozens of batteries but I still use it over and over because it is a life saver for my face!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money. Tried it and acne got worse. This product is rated too high.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this while out of her mind on medications following surgery.  We got lucky, this works surprisingly well, albeit on one zit at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skin care expert and have been for many years.  This product is made for quickie zit zap-pin only if your finding yourself using it in more than 3[-4 spots at a time this product is not for you.  I have only had battery issues once and that was because the ones that come with the unit are horrible and lasted one day...but if i use this at-least twice a day everyday my batteries have lasted me at-least a week.  But like I said if your acne is always there on your face this isn&#x27;t the product for you it&#x27;s made for those blemishes that appear once-twice a month.  There is a larger tanda that is made for other acne issues.  This is equivalent to the Clinique spot healing gel. only made for quick results and to kill bacteria...</li>
            <li> My bff bought this one for me and I started using it for my occasional breakout. Works wonder. For me it takes at most 2 night treatments (I use it almost every night) to my pimples to go away.  It helps calm down pimple swelling and redness. However in about a month of using it, my tanda unexpectly died on me. &#x3D;( I&#x27;m trying to see if Sephora will replace it for me considering it was my bff who bought it for me. Anyhow, I love the tanda, only wish it was not just batter operated... would be great if I could just plug it to an electric outlet. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I mmediately used the Tanda Zap when I received it and in a matter of days my problem areas were clear and have not recurred.  I also used it on my husband and his bumps also did not become Zits; this was the same problem I was having.  It has been sitting since then just waiting to come to our rescue again.</li>
            <li> This pricy little gadget does do what it says, but not fast or effectively enough for me to be able to justify the price. Also, you get 1000 uses out of this for $50 (not including batteries, which are also expensive). Basically if you use this one one pimple 3x a day for a week you&#x27;re going to get to use it for 47 spots only. I am sure a lot of people are having to use it on multiple spots so the life of this guy will go very quickly and it&#x27;s time to get a new one. Very tricky way to get you to keep forking out money by this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for efficacy, it does do what it says. I had a huge cystic mark on my cheek and have been using this 3x a day on it since it popped up. Cystic stuff loves to hang around for weeks, but it has shrunk significantly (around 75%) in one week.  It worked better at first when the pimple was new and still &amp;#34;growing&amp;#34; as to now when it is decreasing in size I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference. It is still there, still noticeable, and still red. I don&#x27;t anticipate the post inflammatory red mark to fade any quicker because of the device, but it did help me not to pick at it, which in turn will help with the redness. I don&#x27;t get the whitehead type pimples any more so I can&#x27;t speak for how this device works on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is if I spend this amount of money on a gadget I expected it to shrink pimples faster and more completely. I don&#x27;t think there is really any &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34; to completely eliminate these nasty cystic pimples within days. I strongly dislike that this company set up their device to only work for 1000 uses, when they could have easily gotten it to work indefinitely. Oh wait, there is one of those and it&#x27;s $100!</li>
            <li> You might be thinking of buying this product, but trust me, do not  buy it! It doesn&#x27;t work at all! I tried it on one of my very small, mild zits and it only made it worse! The next day, it got bigger and turned into a full zit! When buying this, I thought hmmm... half good reviews and half bad, that&#x27;s ok, it will probably work for me! But I should&#x27;ve trusted the people who warned me. Now I am warning you.... save your money for a cheaper and better product! By the way, the batteries suck and I would&#x27;ve given it zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I have been using this device for about a week and so far I have noticed a little difference, it definitely helps with healing the pimple faster and i feel like it does decrease in size if it is cystic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this price i would totally recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> well the mail man brought our package at 10:20am....and we opened it and started playing with it instantly....its now 4:46pm and the area that i went over has shrunken down alot...so with that being sed i love it already...win i turned it on i was thinking it was gonna let out this small ligt and vibration..this thing lights up like a full moon and is so powerfull i was like ooo this might work and yes it works bout to run my second treatment...thanks tanda zap for my magic wand...</li>
            <li> This product 1) didn&#x27;t work 2) stopped working after a few days. I returned it.</li>
            <li> May work for others, but not for me.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest disappointment I have ever seen. I read reviews all over the Internet before purchasing. The majority of the reviews raved that not only does this zap your acne but oftentimes within 24 hours! Not only does this not work but, it has actually made my tiny acne bigger! Total rip-off!  UPDATE!    After using this exactly as directed I can say without a doubt......  THIS DOES NOT WORK!!! IT WILL MAKE YOU BREAK OUT MORE!  I&#x27;M getting bumps on my face where I have never in my 39 years gotten them! Like around my eyes! I thought about trying this instead: [[ASIN:B0019ZMFYE Zeno Mini Acne Clearing Device, White]]  but this has made me very nervous to try anything.</li>
            <li> Works well but not a miracle cure.  I highly recommend using this in conjunction with raw honey.  In the morning rub honey all over your face.  5 minutes later wash it all off and use your zap.  It&#x27;s working great for me!</li>
            <li> Unless you solve the internal reason for acne, this will do very little</li>
            <li> I used the Zeno acne device before, and it work effectively for my pimples. When it broke, it became too expensive to buy a replacement because the company that made Zeno increased their prices by a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about the Tanda blue light products and settled on the Tanda Zap because it was way cheaper than the actual wand. This acne device does absolutely nothing for my pimples. I have used it religiously on my pimples for about 3 months, and it has made no noticeable difference in terms of pimple size, redness, or pimple healing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have severe acne, but for whatever reason I have started breaking out on my chin only. I never had acne as a teenager, so this is new for me and nothing seems to completely clear my skin. I bought this product after seeing it on the Dr. Oz show. It works OK if you use it everyday, but don&#x27;t skip days. Even when used everyday my skin is not completely clear. Also, it goes through batteries like crazy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, unless maybe you get the one occasional blemish every month. Maybe it works for that.</li>
            <li> I used my sisters and decided to get one myself.  I am in my 40&#x27;s but still get zits.  This does cut down the healing time.  I use it 2/3 times a day on the zit and the zit clears up in 2 to 3 days instead of my normal 7 days.</li>
            <li> THE FENCE ABOUT THIS ITEM. NOT CHEAP! SO, ASSUMED IT WOULD WORK. NOT QUITE SURE IF IT DOES OR NOT IT TAKES ABOUT 3-4 DAYS NOT 1 DAY. AND THATS BESIDE THE POINT FOR GETTING IT AS THATS ABOUT THE NORMAL TIME FOR PIMPLES TO GO AWAY ON THIER OWN. SO, I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND SPENDING YOUR MONEY ON IT.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that the product I was sold was clearly used and reboxed. When I opened the package although the seal on the box  was intact, the support inside the box was ripped and the device was loose. When I opened the battery compartment, the battery cartridge was dirty, and one of the springs was bent over. The case itself was also hard to shut. I am returning this product.

            <li> worked for my non-cystic acne. a spot will usually disappear within 24-hours (my experience with this product). i gave one to my nephew and he was totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tested it like they said on my arm and it seemed OK so then I tried on my face and it cause major irritation and did nothing to diminish the zit. Returned.</li>
            <li> The first tanda zap I got, it worked great! The pimples that would last for 2 weeks were shorted to one week or less with it. So I bought a second one and it was pathetic. The batteries didn&#x27;t last as long as the first one and the button was jammed soon after. Total piece of crap</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, and definitely keeps pimples from getting worse.  It doesn&#x27;t clear them terribly fast, but it does help a bit.  Better than the zeno.</li>
            <li> This product was ok, as in mediocre. The product itself worked but on such a small scale that it was not worth getting again or even recommending. In fact, the red light therapy by tanda does the same and BETTER job than this product. The red light covered more areas, made pimples go away longer, and helped my wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual product I got from this seller was broken. It worked for about 2 weeks before breaking. I ordered the zap and a red light therapy from someone else within same time frame that I just never used the zap again and have been faithful to my red light therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red light therapy beds never worked for me but the red light therapy machine ($75) by tanda is amazing....best results. I recommend the red light but not this blue light...I have moderate chin acne and some that occur on the chest now and then...it didn&#x27;t work at ALL for either type of acne so it probably won&#x27;t work for you either unless you have black heads only or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, save your money and make the splurge for the red light, I guarantee you better results and a machine that isn&#x27;t battery powered and small. Batteries suck!</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few uses. Thankfully my money was refunded but the item needs work. It&#x27;s unfortunate because it&#x27;s a great concept otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Tanda Zap for two months now.  I am in my 40s, and still get the occasional acne blemish and whitehead.  I am very pleased with my results so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I treat the blemish as soon as it appears, with a treatment at least twice a day.  The smaller ones usually disappear within a day.  I have one large one right now that I have been zapping twice a day for three days, and is showing great progress this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have not had to change out the batteries.  The Tanda Zap has a nice warmth when it treats, and the size of it makes it easy to pack for travel.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It really does work for me!  I wish I had know about this before the wedding, it would have saved trying to cover up makeup...</li>
            <li> It works to reduce inflammation but sleep is still the sacred grail to no pimples!.....battery gets low very very quickly.</li>
            <li> Tested over a year. This really really does make my pimples tiny if i use it after trying everything else.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t work at all, waste of money, uses a lot of batteries. i was desperate enough to try anything, but this product is terrible.</li>
            <li> I like it, but with the sometimes many blemishes I&#x27;ll have at the same time, I&#x27;ll use this thing back-to-back on different spots on my face for occasionally 10 minutes straight! (and they tell you to use this on a spot 2-3X/day) I do notice that the zits will either stay pretty small or not stick around as long as if I didn&#x27;t use it, but it has not actually prevented one from forming, FYI.</li>
            <li> I get the occasional acne and my sister does too. So I saw this item on &amp;#34;The Doctors&amp;#34; so I decided to give it a try. I would use this product on acne and blemishes but nothing happened or changed. My sister didn&#x27;t have any success with this item either. I believe people on here who are saying that it worked are probably just trying to convince themselves that they didn&#x27;t waste their money. It is all in their head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not mean to sound so negative but it is the truth. The item did not perform as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item also uses up so many batteries and mine stopped working after a month of use.</li>
            <li> This works and it&#x27;s a must have item...</li>
            <li> Really strange, this device. It does work, no doubt, but doesn&#x27;t work on everything. I tend to only get a couple of zits at a time, but they get to be almost cyst-like - I never seem to get those tiny micro-zits everyone else gets. I also shave my head so I tend to break out on the back of my neck where the hair line meets. This device is GREAT for back of head/neck zits - especially since you can&#x27;t really put any kind of benzoyl peroxide or anything on those spots. Doesn&#x27;t work as well for those deep cheek zits. No idea why. Batteries don&#x27;t die quite as fast as reviewers have said, but maybe that&#x27;s because I only use it on a couple of spots per day. I&#x27;ve found this product in combination with Niapads has helped me quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Mine ran out of batteries! :( I absolutely love how this product works but i have found it works better if you put on acne treatment then use it it doesn&#x27;t make it all dissapear but it definitely makes the pimple SHRINK and easy to  cover the next day!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really works ... you use it a couple of time and have to replace the batteries ... for the amount of batteries I was putting in, probably would be cheaper to go to a skin doctor.</li>
            <li> this is a total waste of money. doesnt do nada. dont waste ur time or money on this. total waste</li>
            <li> I had this for about a month before it just broke. I used it aprox 20 times. Before that I&#x27;m not sure if it worked, but it was a good idea and kept me from squeezing the offending zits so they would at least heal on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further you have to put AAA batteries in this and I had to replace the batteries on a weekly basis. Factor that into the cost and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bummer because I liked it in theory!</li>
            <li> this is my 4th time on this product, love it for its small size which makes it so portable.&lt;br /&gt;Dries up pimples fast.  good if you have occasional breakouts.  i&#x27;m using rechargeable batteries for this, highly encouraged as its consumes energy fast.  if you have more pimples, I won&#x27;t suggest this as it will take too much time.</li>
            <li> This is a great device that is easy to use.  It effectively helps control pimples and they heal faster.  I would recommend this product for anyone who has occasional breakouts.  The small size is convenient so it is also portable.</li>
            <li> I have the illumask light therapy mask for Acne (which I highly recommend!); however I occasionally get a cystic bump on the very bottom of my chin or in my eyebrow region, where the light on the illumask does not reach. I bought the Tanda Zap in hopes that it would preform similarly and help clear my occasional cystic/hormonal breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to hold the light on the bump for 2 minutes, 3 times a day. After testing out the Tanda Zap for a few months now, I have found that it works better to hold it on a bump for more like 4-6 minutes at a time, 2-3 times a day. I have found this to help bring the bump to a head faster. In conjunction with the blue light, the device vibrates. I am honestly not sure of the exact purpose of the vibration, but I have found that it can sometimes be painful over a breakout. The textured plastic over the light can hurt over a sensitive breakout as it is viabrating.&lt;br /&gt;Does it work, yes. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone who suffers with breakouts all over their face, because the surface area on the light is&lt;br /&gt;so small. If you are looking to do an at home light treatment treatment over the entire face, I would recommend checking out the illumask. All in all this is a great product and I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50s and still get a few zits now and again.  This thing works great for me.  I carry it with me and when I feel a zit coming on I use it 2-3 times and usually the next day it&#x27;s gone.  I did have one zit that it took 2-3 days to notice improvement, but if I had not used the Zapper it would have been 6-7 days before I would have notice any improvement. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have adult, hormone-related acne (I&#x27;m 28) and all I can say is: WHAT A SCAM! I&#x27;m confident that all of the positive reviews are written by constituents of the manufacturer. DON&#x27;T waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a total fraud. For something that is supposed to be heat activated, it doesn&#x27;t even get that hot! I expected to feel a zap or something, but it&#x27;s just a blue light that doesn&#x27;t get any warmer than a flashlight might. And it barely vibrates (which I think is just another gimmick anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it exactly as directed, twice a day, sometimes more. I saw NO difference on ANY of the zits and pimples (regardless of size) I used it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I think the manufacturers are behind the reviews is that I never had any problems with the batteries. I never had to change them from the ones they came with. But I guess if they say one bad thing about it (something easily overlooked) people will think the reviews are more genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Drink more water. Chill out on the dairy (esp milk chocolate). Wash your face with a salicylic acid cleanser twice a day. Exfoliate 2x a week. Try a sulfur mask. Use benzoyl peroxide as a spot treatment. Use a low-dose hydroquinone serum for scars. Call a professional about Rx creams, antibiotics, or birth control. WHATEVER YOU DO STAY AWAY FROM TANDA ZAP!</li>
            <li> Never would have believed this would work...but it does...tried it twice already and both times I have had positive results.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, It worked for me. As soon as i felt a pimple coming (blind pimple) i started zapping. It won&#x27;t make a blemish go away in a day, but will definitely speed up the process and reduce redness. I have bought this product twice already and will buy one more once my uses run out (1k). ALSO don&#x27;t apply on same area more than 3 times in a row in the same area. You will notice a slight temporary darkening in the area you used it on, but it goes away in minutes. I once used the zap on my cheek, more than 5 applications in a row and i was left with a discoloration on my cheek for over a day. It went away but still, DO NOT USE IT MORE THAN 3 TIMES ON ONE SAME AREA. 2-3 times a a day is fine, One in the morning, afternoon, and night</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this unit. I saw it had great reviews but I feel like the blemish takes the same amount of time to clear</li>
            <li> I am surprised reading the negative reviews. I am older and have infrequent breakouts and have found Tanda to be VERY helpful.  The one I just ordered is my second.  They seem to last a long time and are quite effective for me.</li>
            <li> Very good for disinfect</li>
            <li> I bought this device last night. Used it twice last night and once this morning. I have noticed a significant difference! The pimple was hot, red and filled w/pus. Today it has shrunken to a regular sized pimple w/a pin head. So far so good. I am in my forties and these break outs happen every once in a while. They last a long time and scar terribly. In fact I still have a collection on my chin from one pimple that turned into several! I feel hopeful!</li>
            <li> If you can use this  Tanda device on a blemish as it develops, you can prevent a really bad breakout.</li>
            <li> It is a bummer that the batteries don&#x27;t last as long as one would hope. I will say that if you buy cheap batteries they will not go as far. I used up the batteries it came with in two days, however, I have put duracel in it and so far I am on day 5 and going strong.    It has already made a significant difference in my skin in the first week. I am hooked! I want to keep my skin nice and am not afraid to spend a little extra on some batteries! :)</li>
            <li> For 50$ it may be worth it.  I surly wouldn&#x27;t pay any more for it, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.  Pro&#x27;s &#x3D; I do noticed a reduction of redness and inflammation of trouble spots, and it works really well for very small blemishes.  Con&#x27;s &#x3D; it makes my very deep zits stick around for longer, since they don&#x27;t develop fully and never pop...may be a good thing from a scaring perspective, but still, it&#x27;s no magic bullet for larger blemishes.  Also, the battery life is HORRIBLE.  Don&#x27;t try to use it on multiple spots in one sitting.  After a week it will poop out on you.  I recommend rechargeable batteries.  Of course you still have to take the time to switch them out, but you save some money.  All in all, it&#x27;s not a bad purchase, especially if you only get very small blemishes.  Not amazing though either.</li>
            <li> I have occasional breakouts, and when I do they are not pretty. This time it was taking weeks to clear. Every time they started to clear another blemish would arise right adjacent. It only took three days for all my blemishes to clear using this product. It really does kill the bacteria! I am very pleased! The tip of the tanda is about the size of a Nickle so it gives good range in targeting surrounding tissue.</li>
            <li> Powerful tool for any kind of acne. I have 4 teenage kids at home. They all use it. As long as You follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I will occasionally get an deep cyst, and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that helps. If you catch it right when it is starting to get sore, this will usually make it go completely away within a few days if you use it multiple times.</li>
            <li> Snake oil. Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Good flashlight though.</li>
            <li> Both my mother and I have used this successfully over the last year or so on the relatively mild cystic acne we get on our chins. It definitely helps pimples heal and fade faster, and if you can catch a pimple before it comes to the surface, this tool can reduce the swelling and prevent the pimple from breaking the skin. However, it&#x27;s important to know that this is a SPOT TREATMENT, not a treatment for people who have severe acne all over their face. I can do 2-3 treatment cycles twice a day and regular disposable AAA batteries last me a few weeks. If you are going through new batteries every day, then you are probably trying to use this tool too much. It works best if you have only one or two areas where you break out that you want to treat, and is probably not cost-effective if you want to treat your entire face.</li>
            <li> Do not think this product works.&lt;br /&gt;Did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li> This little unit works really well on pimples, the problem is you have to replace 3 AAA batteries at least every 12-15 uses. It would be nicer if this unit has an ac adapter with it.</li>
            <li> I saw the Tanda Zap being touted on Dr. Oz and decided to give it a try. This device has been more effective than any dermatologist I&#x27;ve seen (they just prescribed drugs with potentially risky side effects) and Proactive which was way too harsh and actually made my skin worse. While breakouts may still occur, I can treat them at the onset and control and stop them from getting larger. No snake oil here! It works and I bought a second one.</li>
            <li> I had this product for about a month now, I have used it maybe a total of 10 days, twice a day on 4 or 5 zits.  I have had to replace the batteries twice already.  The batteries die with about 5 days of use, twice a day (the product insert suggest&#x27;s 2-3x&#x27;s a day). The product insert states that it can be used 1000x&#x27;s before it craps out, so with my going average I will have to replace the batteries 20 times with 3 AAA batteries each time, so you can do the math on battery costs.  The product I believe does what it&#x27;s suppose to, since I have seen a reduction in my existing zits healing time (no prevention though).  With how much I have to replace the batteries though, I will not be purchasing another one when this one completely fails.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how well it works, but maybe maybe.  It worked once out of 6 times, but that was a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this device, but interested enough to try it and see if it worked.  I have to say after a week of fairly regular usage, that my skin does look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I want to point out is that you do have to use it properly - first, only 2-3 treatments a day, don&#x27;t use it over the thyroid/neck area (apparently can cause hyperthyroidism), and make sure not to look at the laser.  Also worthwhile to mention, the manual states not to use it if you&#x27;re taking any drugs that makes skin sensitive to light - important if you&#x27;re taking a tetracycline for acne, as many people do. Once you get past those few caveats, this device is pretty helpful and straightforward to use.  Basically just push the button and hold it to your face (whatever part you have blemishes on) for 2 minutes until it stops vibrating.  Within 12-24 hours is when I notice that it feels clearer, and one thing that is beneficial with this device compared to a spot treatment or acne serum is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some blemishes seem to respond better than others, for me it&#x27;s specifically the early breakouts that respond the best rather than the fully developed blemish which is less affected by the treatment.  This would be consistent with it&#x27;s mechanism of fighting off the acne-causing flora that colonize the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would keep a realistic perspective with these treatments (it&#x27;s not going to clear up skin completely overnight), but it&#x27;s a useful adjunct to a good, proper skincare routine (i.e., sunscreen, moisturizer, adequate cleansing) and does seem to lessen the life cycle of pesky zits.  Four stars because, as mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t really help all blemishes, but the ones that do respond, respond well.</li>
            <li> If not for batteries, I would give it five stars. It does reduce the number of breakouts and makes the existing ones heal much faster. It is especially helpful for cysts, that are not affected by topical medications such as salicylic acid, sulfur and benzoyl peroxide, and for whiteheads. The only con is that it requires batteries replacement about every 50 uses. I bought a set of rechargeable batteries and it solved the problem.     My skin type: early twenties, moderate acne with occasional cysts.</li>
            <li> This thing works great.  When I run out of uses on it, I will purchase another one.&lt;br /&gt;It also works great on cold sores.</li>
            <li> I dont have terrible acne but I do get those occassional deep pimples.  Usually it would take a couple weeks for them to completely clear up (come to the surface, pop and then heal), with this product it&#x27;s a few days...that&#x27;s a remarkable improvement.  I&#x27;ve used other products (Proactiv, topical clindamycin, salicylic acid, etc) with minimal results.  Most of them just help with the surface stuff but arent much help with the deep pimples.  That&#x27;s what this product, in my opinion, is designed for and it does that job well.  Here are some things I would note:&lt;br /&gt;1) I&#x27;m finding that the more I use it the less of those deep breakouts I have.  In the beginning it actually seemed like I was having more breakouts but I think what was going on is I just had a lot of deep bacteria that when I started using it all started coming to the surface, now that I&#x27;ve used it for a little while it&#x27;s definitely happening less often.&lt;br /&gt;2) Based on other reviews I went ahead and bought rechargeable batteries. Glad I did. I havent counted how many uses I get out of a charge but it does have to be replaced often enough that if I were using disposable batteries it would get expensive and would be frustrating, but with rechargeables it&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;3) When you activate the device it is timed, its not however long you want it to run, you turn it on and it runs for two minutes. To be effective you must leave it on the area youre treating the full two miutes.&lt;br /&gt;4) The surface is relatively small. It&#x27;s about the size of a nickel so it doesnt cover a lot of area.&lt;br /&gt;5) Given the previous two points, if you were trying to cover a lot of area (meaning you have a lot of acne) it could take all morning and use the product up a lot quicker (it has a maximum 1000 uses, then it dies..according to the manual).  Ergo, my suggestion is that this is not for people who have a lot of acne, it&#x27;s more for those that just get a few deep pimples here and there.  And for that use I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is really effective at &amp;#34;flattening&amp;#34; any pimples I have. I think it makes my blemishes heal a little faster, plus it&#x27;s fun to use</li>
            <li> This gadget didn&#x27;t work for me, BUT I did end up buying the Tanda Clear and it works great.  I have gone 5 days without a new pimple since using it and that is outstanding for my condition.  Spend the extra money and get the Clear and bypass the Zap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the batteries didn&#x27;t sit right in my Zap.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> Based on the Amazon reviews, I bought this expecting it to either work small miracles or do nothing.  Initially, I did have positive results but after a week of use my condition got CONSIDERABLY worse.  All I wanted to do was clear a few moderately sized blemishes.  Now I&#x27;ve got full on, inflamed, patches of acne in the areas that those initial blemishes used to be.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m one of the people who were warned in the instructions against use because they could have a sensitivity to light or if the thing just drew out imperfections before their time but I and my skin are highly irritated.  This is going to take SO much longer to clear than those original spots would have, and it&#x27;s going to leave SCARS.  Please- if you take a chance on this thing, do it with caution.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t unzit the acne although i was very hopeful.  I purchased for my teenage son and we followed instructions and were still not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Generally works well. Can prevent breakouts that you can feel coming on but cant yet see.  However there is no way to tell when it has worn out because there is no battery indicator light. Ours finally stopped working but we just thought it was the batteries and it died just before picture day :(</li>
            <li> I used this for about 2 weeks on potential breakouts, and did not find that this made any difference in a zit.  Returned it.</li>
            <li> works very well, easy, and it is  very fiunctional, i really recomend it.  xxxxxx xxxxx xxxx xx xxxx xx x</li>
            <li> The batteries run out daily,  the vibration only works about half the time, and it does not seem to get rid of pimples, only flattens them</li>
            <li> It works&lt;br /&gt;It works fast&lt;br /&gt;It may still provoke new spots in different places, but I hope eventually the face will be cleared</li>
            <li> This thing works, although not the 24 magic they claimed, it does work.  I&#x27;ve been having problem with the cyst type of pimple, and this have helped me to clear quite a few of them. The 24 hour claim sounds very magical and way too magical..so you know really it doesn&#x27;t happen just overnight. It usually takes about a week for me to see it gone. If you use this on a &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; (or younger..whatever you wanna call it) cyst you get to see it gone quicker.  The reason why I took one star off is not because of the batteries ( actually my second purchase had the batteries last longer I don&#x27;t know why..), but because of the 1000 time use. I still remember that when I found out my first one stopped working I thought I&#x27;d go for a refund until I saw that 1000 time thing. I believe the counter goes by how many times you turn it on. So if you have to stop in the middle of one session that unfortunately will count 1, and if your batteries died in the middle that will count as 1 too..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer in this product. I have been using it for three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second one as the first one died after 2 years of use, which is fine by me considering how much use it got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer use lotions or topical ointments for spots. When I feel sore on my face, as if a pimple is looming, I tanda zap it to nip it in the bud, so to speak.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about two weeks but not sure if it does what it advertised. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I only have the odd one now and again ... but my ZAP machine is always there at hand and works great!!</li>
            <li> It worked great for about two days and then it just stopped working correctly. I had to send it back. I am sure it&#x27;s a great product if it doesn&#x27;t stop working though. I didn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it really works, because I usually get the cystic acne, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work well on them.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for anyone with acne.  I have 3 teenage daughters and they all use the Zap on a regular basis. The device really works to clear up acne fast! What an amazing technology.</li>
            <li> This item does not work! Don&#x27;t waist your money on it. I would have choose 0 star&#x27;s if it was available.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li> I am 42 and still get a couple of break outs a month.  Bought this product and tried it on a painful bump deep under the skin.  Normally, it would take several days for the painful pimple under the skin to come to the top, then it would break and heal.  After using this, 2x a day for 2 days the pimple is very diminished.  I bought this product elsewhere for $20 so it was a great day.  I&#x27;m here on amazon looking for a bigger one to cover more area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li> I started using the product and stopped using it because I left it at home while traveling. I may have had 2-3 uses. When I returned from my trip, this device didn&#x27;t even work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money and I don&#x27;t even know if I saw real results the couple of times I used it...</li>
            <li> I bought this from Groupon, after seeing the so so reviews on here I figured it was worth a try. I&#x27;ve used it for about two weeks and haven&#x27;t seen much of an overall improvement. I&#x27;ve been going through a really bad break out for the past couple of months so I used it on a lot (8-10) of spots for the first week 2-3 times a day which was pretty time consuming. For some spots it did nothing at all but for others I think it worked, but not overnight or completely. Overall it didn&#x27;t really work for me but I will still use it on a much smaller scale to get a better idea of whether it actually does anything. I don&#x27;t regret buying it though as I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle. The batteries lasted longer than I thought they would after reading some of the reviews but you should invest in some, you can get 24 AAA&#x27;s on here for around $10 which will last you a while at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and have tried just about everything, this it worth a shot. I hope it works for you. Good luck.</li>
            <li> The vibrating device inside stopped working with only about 10 minutes of use. The company Tanda Zap would not replace it or stand behind their product. This is not good customer loyalty. Would not buy anything from Tanda Zap.</li>
            <li> Have now had this device for a few weeks, and it does genuinely work, but for very specific situations.  It does seem to reduce the duration of the breakout, as well as reduce the redness and irritation.  In some cases, it didn&#x27;t do anything.  Overall still worth a try as the cost isn&#x27;t that prohibitive.</li>
            <li> I would have gave it 5 stars but it uses batteries up so much. needs replaced constantly. I bought it for my son and amazingly it has helped alot.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first, but after using the Tanda for sometime now I can honestly say it works. I don&#x27;t suffer from an extreme form of acne, but it got rid of my existing acne and prevents new ones from surfacing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my son who has occasional acne outbreaks. This is one of the best products he has ever used. It not only cleared up his acne but it left his skin looking good. No dry patches or scars.... I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This actually works!!</li>
            <li> After years of varied medication I am so happy to find this device. It really works! Yes, I may go through batteries, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Try it and it works. Like it that&#x27;s all I can say from now. Received last week so far everything okay.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell any change after using as directions stated.  Only good for 100 uses and you use 2-3 time a day.</li>
            <li> This little goody does so works! I have big cysts zits. Under the skin kind. Horrible.&lt;br /&gt;And about six shots of this thing and the next day noticeably different. Swelling way, way down!&lt;br /&gt;Yep you go thru batteries but who cares! I would rather go thru batteries than walk around with&lt;br /&gt;a gigantic bump on my face!!!! This is the best little invention around! I have just recently seen them at Costco.&lt;br /&gt;My kids have started using it too. Just fantastic! Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!!</li>
            <li> This product works GREAT on acne, but does not deliver nearly the amount of &amp;#34;servings&amp;#34; it says it will.  It is programmed to shut down permanently after so many applications.  It worked so well when the first one I bought died I doubted my estimate of usage.  I tracked on the second one - less than 25% of the promised applications.  Therefore, each treatment is 4 times as expensive.  If it worked the way they said it would (auto shut off that is) it would be a 5 stars product.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to tell if this works or not. I use it as instructed ( 3 times) sometimes even 5 times a day to get rid of a pimple that I feel coming but this doesn&#x27;t always get rid of it. This also required batteries which die out quick when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also they dont give you anything to clean the top of the leds which can have bacteria if you put it on your face. At least they give you that small case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you feel a pimple coming or have one, the best thing you can use to minimize it is Nexcare Acne Absorbing Cover or put BP cream on it.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce pimples but it needs too many batteries and stopped working after a couple hundred uses.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> not only did the battery die after the 1st two uses of it, it didn&#x27;t do its job. i don&#x27;t have acne just spots here and there, the vibration or whatever it is doesnt have a strong pulse. really disappointed in  this product.  everyone claims its so great well i beg to differ</li>
            <li> I have had a acne since the age of 13 years. As such I have tried everything under the sun from exfoliating scrubs to buff puffs. I have seen dermatologists who prescribed products that were either too harsh or were not good long term solutions such as antibiotics to cleansing foams that are no longer available. The only thing that has worked on a consistent basis for me is Acne Free and that does not solve all the problems. I originally used ProActiv but the cost for this program is too high. Add to that the fact that the stores do not carry it and you have an additional pain in the butt just to get a cleanser. The results I got from Acne Free has been outstanding and even surpasses ProActiv. Even with a disciplined cleansing regimen you will still get a breakout here and there due to genetics or predisposition due to your diet. Although many do not believe that chocolate cause acne I have from experience found that it does, at least for me. I would believe these so-called experts and then find myself breaking out and then do my own test and find that eating chocolate does cause acne. I have read some of these studies but they are questionable due to the fact that the subjects were either not predisposed to acne or other dietary factors were not included.&lt;br /&gt;As I have mentioned, even with a regimented system I still do have a breakout once in a while. And this product which I found at Costco actually did indeed work. What is amazing is that it took only one application to make a cystic acne under my lower lip disappear. I could still feel the bump underneath the skin&#x27;s surface but it no longer was swollen like it had been the night before. Normally, when I get these cystic acne they remain for a couple of days. This time around I was pleasantly surprised that it was no longer swollen.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Works!&lt;br /&gt;2. Easy to use (worked on first application for me) and it says on the direction to use two to three times a day on acne. Just two minutes on the skinand the session is over.&lt;br /&gt;3. Small so it is easy to put away in a drawer or take with you to work or school.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Requires replacement after so many uses (1,000 applications according to the packaging).&lt;br /&gt;2. Requires three AAA batteries. Why did they not design it to use two AA batteries instead? I can never understand the three AAA batteries requirement. Why not four AAA batteries? These batteries are not sold in threes. Further, if you use rechargeable batteries, realize that many chargers can only charge batteries in twos or fours. I would have preferred two AA&#x27;s or two AAA&#x27;s. If four AAA&#x27;s would result in a device that is a little larger so be it.&lt;br /&gt;3. A rechargeable version would be better.&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I would highly recommend this product to those who get those cystic acne flare ups. This stuff is the real deal. It WORKS! Of course, you will need to practice a good regimen to help clear up your skin. I would highly recommend Acne Free to do the main job of clearing up the skin. This product is not meant to do that job. It is only a touch up device for those flare ups. If you do not have access to Acne Free, you should request your local Costco or Sam&#x27;s Club to carry it. Otherwise you may have to search your drug stores or order it online (I frown on ordering cleansing products online as it adds a whole lot to the cost of such necessities).</li>
            <li> I like it but recommend the Clear Model and especially the rechargeable.  The product works well if you follow scheduled acne cleaning procedures.  The goal is to kill and eliminate bacteria.  This aids in the bacteria elimination</li>
            <li> As with all products nothing is a 100% prefect, but this product has work for me and my family.  I have been on acne medications for year and have recently decided not to take it any more.  I&#x27;ve used the product for 3 day and was very impressed, I had a zit on my nose, I used the device for 2 day morning and night and the zit had disappeared.  Mind you will still have to wash your face or use a facial tone to wipe your skin clean, but it did get rid of the zit.</li>
            <li> I broke down and bought the Tanda when I started getting hormonal breakouts after getting off birth control.  I had two nodular zits and a few smaller pimples that needed tending to.  In 4 treatments the large, nodular zits were reduced by more than half and my skin even seemed to heal faster.  The larger of the two got a little weepy after the treatments, leading me to believe that it was really working.  The smaller blemishes reduced in size and swelling, but so far are still a little red.  I&#x27;ve even used it on the blackheads on my nose and chin, and my skin is much smoother in those areas and the blackheads are still there but much less noticeable.  I&#x27;m really hopeful that this will help me break my horrible picking habit.  I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and have noticed some scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely plan on replacing the Tanda when its 1000 uses are up, if not upgrading to the Clear+ to avoid wasting batteries and being able to use the replaceable head for 6x as many treatments.  I highly recommend the product!</li>
            <li> Not as effective as the Zeno hot spot, vibration does nothing. I have the hormonal under the skin bumps once or twice a month, and this was not effective in clearing them. I did notice that my skin generally looked smoother after  use but it had no effect on the under the skin bump.</li>
            <li> Just remember to come back and fill in my review. Purchased this years ago and use less than 5 times and it broke. Completely waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used the Tanda Zap for about 2 months on my mild to medium severity acne. I thought it would be more helpful to my acne. I believe it made my zits go away a day or two sooner in the four to five days that they&#x27;d typically last. However, it wasn&#x27;t worth dealing with the batteries. I went through many triple A batteries since this product drains them so quickly. After half a dozen battery swaps, it started to leak battery acid over my fingers every time I tried replacing the batteries. It wasn&#x27;t worth the effort and I simply tossed it in the trash.</li>
            <li> It kinda works on the smaller acne.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my daughter.</li>
            <li> This is our second tanda zap, and my son likes it.  It&#x27;s so much easier to use than creams,&lt;br /&gt;and as effective if not more so.  We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work at All, I&#x27;m a teen and would recommend to look for other options</li>
            <li> do not waste your money - pretty much sums it up. Used it a lot of times with no results. I bought it to treat occasional pimple or two. doesn&#x27;t work at all! The web site for the product claims that there money back guarantee if it doesn&#x27;t work, but apparently, not if you buy it from amazon. what a fraud!</li>
            <li> I am 25 and was having a lot of trouble with acne, and was looking for any way out. I got the tandazap in a desperate need for SOMETHING. I quickly realized that it was kind of pointless for me. I had too many pimples to hold that thing at my face for 3 minutes on each spot. If you get 1 pimple, once in awhile, maybe its what you need. But for regularly getting multiple pimples, its simply not realistic. Its now in my cabinet, and I have not used it since the few weeks I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne since teenager and in my late 20&#x27;s right now and still suffer from acne. Been to dermatologists and acne clinics to help with my never ending battle with acne, and it&#x27;s always been temporary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doubtful about blue light therapy treatment for acne, but I&#x27;ve been routinely receiving professional blue light treatment for the last 2 months now and my skin has never been this good. I have scars now and waiting for new skin to come up, but because I&#x27;m not getting acne over and over again, my skin actually can see the light of forming new skin. Because of the costs, I will be stopping my visits to clinic and I&#x27;ve been nervouse for awhile and started searching for alternatives and found this tiny little thing, which I thought I can give a try for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it the moment I received it and used it on my chin area, which is my most problem area. I do think it&#x27;s working. The instruction was to use it 2 minutes per area, but I did it for 4 minutes. I definitely will give it a try.</li>
            <li> Ok, I got suckered in and thought this might be the solution to my acne problem I&#x27;ve been fighting for years.  Once again, I got duped.  Only thing I can do now is warn you not to waste your money like I did.  This thing did absolutley nothing except burn up a dozen batteries before I finally threw it where it belongs, in the trash.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because, in my opinion, it&#x27;s really just ok.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t quite get the results that had been advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to those with very minor acne.</li>
            <li> I just bought this on Groupon ($25 today) after reviewing some reviews on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I notice is that Tanda appears to work on those with actual pimple issues, not those with &#x27;great&#x27; skin already who have that rare flare-up.</li>
            <li> The Tanda Zap is not a panacea for acne.  It is however a terrific tool to keep in your arsenal to fight occasional breakouts and treat pesky zits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a primary treatment tool -- if you use it this way, you&#x27;ll quickly become frustrated with how long it takes (2 minutes per treatment) -- and the number of batteries you use.  The scale of the device is really only designed to treat one or a small cluster of breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve had amazing success with the Tanda Zap to treat deep pimples that you can feel coming for several days before they surface.  Using the Zap, these pimples never surfaced -- healed in about half the time -- without any scar or blemish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device does consume batteries, but if you&#x27;re only using it as an occasional tool -- the consumption is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that the LED array in the device is only rated for 1000 treatments.  After that time, you dispose the device and buy a new one.  If this is problematic, Tanda makes a more professional model (Tanda Clear Plus) with a larger treatment area and rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> The Zap acne device helped clear my blemishes. Noticeable difference within a day, no pain or irritation. Also,I appreciate the convenience of this tool, pocket size.</li>
            <li> I bought it on Groupon, which was $25. It totally worked! I have oily skin and not only moderate, but cystic ance, which is the most severe type of acne! I have tried many products and nothing really works on me, not even 10% benzoyl peroxide, which \\&quot;burned\\&quot; my face after two weeks. Salicylic acid is useless. But Tansa Zap is really great! It kills bacteria which caused break out. It won&#x27;t work on whiteheads and blackheads though, because that&#x27;s caused by build-ups and oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this device, my swollen, hardened bumps get smaller on the second day, and then disappeared on the 3rd or 4th day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who have severe acne problem, I would recommend get this device for travel and also buy one with a larger surface. Because in order for it to be effective, each pimple needs about 6 mins of treatment, a larger surface would save you a lot of time. This small pocket-size device is really good for acne around eyes. Using the large device around the eyes is not very convenient for me. (My eyes are very sensitive to light even though I close them during the treatment, and frankly I don&#x27;t have the patience to close my eyes that long if I got several pimples around my eyes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, it eats up batteries very quickly, so get rechargeable batteries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stops working after 1000 times. For me, that was about 7 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who wants to get one with larger surface, Tanda Clear+ is really expensive, so I use Aurora, which is a lot cheaper but very effective. I have tried reVive once but that device didn&#x27;t work on me and I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps some of you!</li>
            <li> It does work on acne!!! The only problem I have is that battery doesn&#x27;t last long. Batteries can be replaced &amp; it is still working. Had for 10-11 months now.</li>
            <li> It was interesting to see the reviews on Amazon vs. the Tanda Zap web page.  Notice the wide discrepancy.  Almost all reviews at the Tanda Zap web page were 5&#x27;s.  A very interesting fact, look at the date that the reviews were posted, 7-20-12.  So everyone decided to post their excellent comments on the same day.  Statistically speaking, very probable. What do you think?</li>
            <li> I only get zits right before my period. I usually get the ones that are really under the skin that hurt really bad. I used this and the next day it was almost completely gone! I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Space age technology.  I have periodic breakouts - this widget zaps the zit. I was skeptical, but I&#x27;m telling you - it works. Have purchased several for friends and family.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for my kids through groupon I believe.  I think it did help my daughter when I made her use it, but we could barely get two sessions out of one set of batteries.  I tried taking the batteries out after using thinking it might somehow be draining even when not in use, but that did not make a difference. We might&#x27;ve used it about 10 times over 1.5 years and it stopped working. The whole battery thing would prevent me from buying again.</li>
            <li> Really bad, in fact my daughter followed the directions to the letter, and ended up with more acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bleh...... 2 stars cause she uses it to find dog pee stains at her friends houses.</li>
            <li> Out of frustration (and maybe desperation), I bought his acne zapper hoping for great results. While it *might* help to start reducing an already-exisitng pimple, there isn&#x27;t a quick change in the pimple&#x27;s appearance. The device is only good for a specific number of timed cycles so if you have a lot of zits, you may go through it&#x27;s lifespan faster than anticipated. In addition, this device goes through batteries quicker than it kiils pimples. I probably would not buy it again knowing what I know now.</li>
            <li> The metal part on the inside broke and then started to smoke with batteries in it. Almost burnt my hand. By the way, it goes through batteries so fast that you would be spending over 50 dollars a year on batteries alone.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write product reviews, and I&#x27;m one of the biggest skeptics out there, but felt the need to post about the Tanda Zap! I was diagnosed more than 2 years ago with rosacea and I&#x27;d say for the past 2-3 years, I would experience constant breakouts by my mouth and chin. I have scarring from the effects. It became a constant stream of one huge welt at a time, at least twice a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been on antibiotic and topical medications, but still experienced at least one huge pimple per month (especially the week before menstruation). It was a guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I got the Tanda Zap in July, I can count on one hand the amount of PIMPLES I have had... not breakouts, pimples! And even when I&#x27;ve had a pimple, with Tanda treatment, it&#x27;s gone in a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s been about 5 months of usage until my family and friends starting complimenting me on my skin. I use it every 2-3 days and just do a treatment of my chin/mouth area. I 100% give credit to it for my lack of breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes - the battery life is horrible. But I bought rechargeable batteries and they&#x27;re typically good for about 8 treatments before I recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely worth the money to me!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. My facialist used this on me I had to have it. Works great</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for just under a year.  I like it so much I have given as a gift and also purchased the larger rechargable unit.  My skin has never looked this good.  I have small white heads on my chin that I couldn&#x27;t get to go away till I started using this.  Seems to make my pores tighter and I have a very noticibly less blackheads. Helps with larger cystic acne on a case by case basis. But when I have had really tender blimishes, it makes them less tender for sure. I totally love it.  The biggest complaint is the battery life, which I remedied by getting rechargables. (one star off) The unit does have a limited life span.  I started using in June and just replaced it in March.</li>
            <li> I have seen no noticeable effect from the Tanda Zap whatsoever. Latest research suggests time is better spend focusing on diet (looks like dairy, high glycemic index foods, etc. are behind acne). Save your money, this product does nothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son who is battling with acne and it broke after 3 days.  I did not see any difference in his acne.  Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this useless product.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago because I am in my 40&#x27;s and started getting  cystic acne on my chin every month. I tried this and the swelling really went down within 2 days. Usually these huge pimples are very painful and last for months and then leaves a scar. This really eliminated it and I didn&#x27;t get a scar. I will buy another one when this one wears out. Buy lithium batteries... They will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about 3 weeks now but really does work it has made a pimple go away after a couple of days.... My only concern is that it has left a mark of a circle on a couple of places I have used it on my face. I hope it will go away if I don&#x27;t use it on that area for a while.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought worked great - exactly as promised.  The second one I purchased was a disappointment.  Even with rechargeable batteries, it kept dying on me the day after I put freshly charged batteries in it.</li>
            <li> great device that really seems to work</li>
            <li> This little device requires you to treat pimples three times a day for two minutes each for it to work. I&#x27;ve found it to work when I start treatment in the early stages of pimple development and on some types of pimples. For example, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work on those pimples that turn fast into white heads but works on those that either take longer to come out or never really do. It&#x27;s a good device to have if you suffer from blemishes if you can get it at a discount, I think the full price is very expensive especially since it&#x27;s essentially a disposable item because once it&#x27;s predetermined number of zaps is over you have to throw it out and get a new one.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was very reluctant at first. I read e paperwork to use it correctly and it seemed to work great, love love love it.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I am not a teenager and do not have frequent or serious breakouts but when I do, I want them gone.  I&#x27;ve used the Tanda Zap Acne Clearing Device lately and have been pleasantly surprised by its results.  I honestly bought it thinking it would be returned within a week but was happy to keep it when it worked and worked quickly.  I found that if I used it a few times a day, my blemish quickly disappeared and have been using it for approx 6 mths now with the same results again and again.  It only works on certain types of acne as stated in the included guide but that&#x27;s what I seem to have so it works for me so well, that I bought a second one for my young niece and she likes it too!&lt;br /&gt;The only con I&#x27;ve found is that it does take a suprisingly large amount of batteries.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and a waste of money. Claims to &amp;#34;clear blemishes within 24 hours&amp;#34; and it didn&#x27;t clear a single thing.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my house uses this. It really works on keeping cystic pimples less painful and smaller.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the Tanda device.  I&#x27;m sorry to say it doesn&#x27;t work.  I tried it on pimples of all sizes with absolutely no improvement in the time it took for the zit to be smaller or disappear.  I am requesting a refund.</li>
            <li> I think it helps but it is no miracle worker. It seems to be able to stop the formation of early blemishes if caught right away.</li>
            <li> (UPDATE)~ These Tanda Zap Devices last for 3 months tops before they die. I&#x27;ve had two and they both died after 3 months of daily use. I won&#x27;t buy this product again, it&#x27;s not worth the money wasted!~ It works on acne just as it says it does. It heals the acne blemish faster than any topical medication. The drawback is it&#x27;s size,  It&#x27;s only big enough for spot treatment after the zit has already reared it&#x27;s ugly head. So if you need to use it as a preventative method for killing the bacteria before a break out happens, then this isn&#x27;t big enough. I&#x27;ve ordered another blue light therapy product that&#x27;s bigger and covers more of my face at one time. Hopefully with the proper use on a daily basis it will prevent the acne from even surfacing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it actually worked at all, but I was giving it a shot anyway. However, it eats batteries very quickly, and died after about six months. Don&#x27;t recommend. Also, if you use recharging batteries, it doesn&#x27;t like those either. Apparently there are several different kinds of AAAs, and it prefers the ones that are one use only. If you do end up buying it, the lighted tip never gets uncomfortable, but it will leave an imprint on your skin if you hold it directly against your face until the light goes off.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything dont waste your money, try doing a Folic acid peel.</li>
            <li> Not work very well. Hard to see the effect.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and the person who started using it recently says the claims made by the manufacturer of what this product will do are not working.</li>
            <li> I love my ZAP. I get big sore cystic acne every few months. As soon as I feel one coming on, I use my Zap and either it goes away right away or helps it go away faster and it is not as sore. I highly recomend this product.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is batteries wear out fast.</li>
            <li> Wow, what an amazing product! It just seems to shrink the zits. I have never seen results like this with any medicine. I have been using it several times a day in 3-4 spots with several repetitions and the batteries are just fine. Maybe people should try a different battery  brand? But heck, even if you have have to replace the batteries but have clear skin in exchange, isn&#x27;t it worth it???</li>
            <li> I bought the Tanda zap a while ago because I could no longer find the Zeno which by far was a superior product. The Tanda stopped working after 2 weeks, at 17 uses (I counted). It began running for less than 8 seconds. Naturally thinking it was the batteries I exchanged them and same issue. I tried calling Customer Service which is basically non-existent. I was on hold for almost an hour at which point I hung up. I&#x27;ve emailed them multiple times and though I get the \\&quot;auto reply\\&quot;, I&#x27;ve never heard a word from anyone there. Waste of money and time. I hope this helps. I&#x27;ve read that other customers have had the same issues. Good Luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed no change with this device at all.  And, on top of it, the top will not stay on.  The batteries have a spring underneath and the notches in the top that are supposed to hold them in don&#x27;t do a great job, so it constantly comes undone.  This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I struggled with acne throughout my teens and I wish I would&#x27;ve had this! I currently have had acne issues from hormonal imbalance and this has helped clear up the acne because of that. I currently use it whenever I feel a breakout coming on and also use It when my time of the month is coming, in my breakout zones to prevent any acne and it works great. Over the years I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on different treatments for acne I wish I had known about this I would&#x27;ve saved so much money and embarrassment over a large pimples! Believe me it is worth a try!</li>
