            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, sticks to tub floor &amp; feels good.</li>
            <li>so it is something good  for me.</li>
            <li>In some ways, I feel like I could have just removed an industrial sweeper head and added some suction to my shower floor, because that&#x27;s kind of what this is like, but the product has been great</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>but this one is just right for me!!!!  </li>
            <li>I have one myself, and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>she was very pleased.</li>

            <li>I love this !  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Truth be told, I think it does a better job than I ever did!</li>
            <li>Really love this in my shower!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my needs - it&#x27;s great to be able to give my feet a real thorough scrubbing without bending over or balancing on one foot in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love that too!</li>
            <li>love this scrubber - purchased one for my sister as well - wonderful for those of us with arthritis no being able to bend so easily.</li>
            <li>My niece liked it when I gave it to her for her birthday</li>
            <li>I really love using this, it feels so good.  </li>
            <li>gel is quite nice as well, with tea tree oil to help control bacteria and deodorize as well.</li>
            <li>It is nice.</li>
            <li>Works nicely.  </li>
            <li>This foot scrubber is great, it stays in place and gets my feet squeaky clean</li>
            <li>a good soapy lather is great - good for the circulation and refreshing for my feet.&lt;br /&gt;There are suction cups on the bottom of the scrubber, but it is necessary to stabilize it by using one foot to stand on a flap to keep it secured to the shower or tub floor.</li>
            <li>Very nice brush, and the gel smells so fresh and revitalising.</li>
            <li>Product is made from exceptional material, not just cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>My feet feel clean and good after using the scrubber.  </li>
            <li>But its purpose to clean the foot succeeds:  </li>
            <li>This has helped tremendously!!</li>
            <li>That is HUGE!</li>
            <li>Myself, my husband and my daughter all LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>feet are SOOOOO smooth!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this device may sound &amp;#34;Foofy&amp;#34;, but in all seriousness, it&#x27;s just the perfect thing to complete your cleansing rituals.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It probably would work much better in a tub/shower</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>I am not elderly or concerned about falling, but if I did have any stability issues this would not be an appropriate product, unless I knew I could use it while sitting.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THE &amp;#34;SHOWER FOOT SCRUBBER</li>
            <li>▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄★☆☆Super Fast Shipping &amp; Great Price</li>

            <li>I love the feel of the bristles and</li>
            <li>It has a hole on the top in case you want to hang it</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>It may slip every once in a awhile, but thats with most things.  </li>
            <li>The sides are even better.  </li>
            <li>Had back surgery and can no longer been over, so this is great for me!</li>
            <li>I love my foot scrubber.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my feet feel after a shower,</li>
            <li>The Shower Foot  Scrubber is very good and easy to use and cleans your foot very well while you are in a safe secure standing position.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best gift for anyone pregnant--keep your feet pretty without having to . . .</li>
            <li>It feels nice, gets the feet clean, and does exfoliate some.  </li>
            <li>Does clean feet nicely however.  </li>
            <li>Being pregnant, I thought it would be great not to have to bend down to clean my feet, however the brush doesn&#x27;t do a very good job</li>
            <li>In the shower, I found it works best to wet the brushes, turn off the water, squirt on the soap and use it.</li>
            <li>The product I received is great but the paperwork clearly states that a rope to pull it up with was included and it was not.  </li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time barefoot and a good scrub is appreciated.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and rinses well.</li>
            <li>scrubber is easy to use and the hang</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The suction cups are so strong that I store it on my shower wall</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has suction cups, that hold it on the walls of my shower just fine, but cannot grip my textured shower floor.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the stiffness of the bristles, but they&#x27;re fine....</li>
            <li>It sticks on the wall just fine for storage.  </li>
            <li>If you have a textured bottom tub or shower, it can slip, but with the design you can also stand on one of the rubber pads and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s easy to clean feet.</li>
            <li>we ended up sticking it on one of the tub surround ledges, but for a smooth tub, it would be a 5 star item</li>
            <li>It works well to keep your feet feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to give your tootsies a daily scrub.  </li>
            <li>Far superior than the \\&quot;as seen on TV\\</li>
            <li>and it rinses easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>just move this around, with your feet, press it down to hold it, squirt on your favorite shower gel or liquid soap and lets the suds fly with those piggies.&lt;br /&gt;Sock</li>
            <li>This makes washing my feet fun and pleasurable!  </li>
            <li>Great for cleaning and getting rid of dry skin.</li>
            <li>Your feel refresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Will keep your feet clean with ease.</li>
            <li>Whats the point it the unit moves when you try to clean your feet?  </li>
            <li>I now feel that I am getting my feet clean without having to stand on one leg each time I scrub a foot.  </li>
            <li>Plan on taking some effort to clean your feet.  </li>
            <li>Really cleans feet and makes them feel better.</li>
            <li>just what we needed and quick shipping</li>
            <li>With the shower running, the soap is washed away too quickly.</li>
            <li>The soap that came with it is great, I can see the fungus on my toenail slowly getting better.</li>
            <li>It just plain feels good!</li>
            <li>and I enjoy using it very much.</li>
            <li>I really great method of scrubbing feet really well with a nice med hard brush system...  </li>
            <li>Feet becoming much smoother.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m a guy through and through, I wear original old spice deodorant, I use a shaving mug and when I&#x27;m hunting water fowl or pheasants</li>
            <li>The scrubby part is awesome, could be a little stiffer for a man&#x27;s foot, but good quality, i docked 1 star because the suction cups are too small if you have a tub with any sort of texture on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this for everyone!!</li>
            <li>but otherwise, a good clean and massage for average feet.</li>
            <li>I was a bit leery about the price, but have found that it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This is a truly useful product for the summer.</li>
            <li>LIke many of the prior reviewers my feet have never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li>I have reached the age where my balance and flexibility are not quite up to par, and I can now really keep my feet clean.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i needed to keep my feet smooth and dry cracked skin free !</li>
            <li>Just watching this video was very relaxing!  </li>
            <li>exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>The Shower Foot Scrubber is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>At first glance looks like mud scrubber.</li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the unbearable tickle against my feet.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you need at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>This foot scrubber was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s akward to use, and honestly, it could be a slipping hazard!</li>
            <li>I was surprised how clean it gets my feet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the second time I&#x27;ve given this product to someone, and the response has been the same - they all loved it.  </li>
            <li>I go barefoot all the time and this actually gets the bottoms of my feet clean!</li>
            <li>I would still recommend this for anyone who could benefit from not having to bend over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: my first one developed mildew, so I bought the imitation one that was cheaper and realized there&#x27;s good reason it was cheaper.</li>
            <li>That was my first response, but I learned to not be gentle as I placed my foot in the scrubber bristles.  </li>
            <li>But it relies upon suction cups to stick to your flat surface, and even then it&#x27;s not 100% solid in place, which means you are not getting a really good scrub.  </li>
            <li>Amazing that the old one lasted so long.  </li>
            <li>I have back problems and can&#x27;t reach them easily.  </li>
            <li>too large and cumbersome .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to throw this down in the tub, splash with water, drizzle some soap, and get-a-scrubbin.</li>
            <li>Really like this.  </li>
            <li>It suctions very well to the bottom of the tub</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how well this product really works.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and seems to be well made.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li>Also a real plus that it is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy product.</li>
            <li>You just have to make sure you are careful when you are learning how to use it.</li>
            <li>He does not stop talking about how much he loves it.  </li>
            <li>Sooo really love how sturdy the brushes are... just be careful when you have one soapy foot to not slip...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>This scrubber really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks for handling all of that for me</li>
            <li>Works very well and hanging it up after use and rinishing to prevent mildewing.</li>
            <li>(we take showers), and we both really like it.</li>
            <li>It seems very sturdy and it feels like it will hold up to repeated use.  </li>
            <li>harder you scrub, the more you need to use the side &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; to hold the scrubber in place under your feet.  </li>
            <li>Would absolutely purchase again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay in one position very well, but works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product to everyone!</li>
            <li>so much that I skipped my pedicure.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, rinse, hang to dry in shower.</li>
            <li>However, the bottom of my tub has a slight texture (like most tubs today)</li>
            <li>It does a decent job of scrubbing your feet without bending over and built of quality long-lasting materials.</li>
            <li>Scratchy, calloused, alligator feet, that crack like California in a high fault area.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this thing.  </li>
            <li>Sure a little bit, but here&#x27;s the thing.  </li>
            <li>BTW, I soaked the old one in white vinegar and pressure washed clean; have a spare now.</li>
            <li>The price was kinda high, but the other ones were to (except the $10 one, but it was cheap plastic), so I picked this one becasue of how it looked.  </li>
            <li>I was searching for something that would help clean my feet since they are incredibly dry!</li>
            <li>There was quite a gap when I couldn&#x27;t get a new one.  </li>
            <li>, It dries completely, and has no mold or mildew issues.t!)</li>
            <li>The scrubber rinses easily, dries quickly, and rests behind the grab bar on the shower wall between uses.  </li>
            <li>But a mild cleaning can be done by just running your foot back and forth, since the scrubber is heavy enough to remain in place for a light cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It cleans between my toes with a little maneuvering, and leaves my feet soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I have actually noticed a huge improvement with my rough feet.</li>
            <li>Makes my feet tickle when using it, keeping my feet soft too.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even felt the need for a professional pedicure since I started using this scrubber.</li>
            <li>, It dries completely, and has no mold or mildew issues.</li>
            <li>You have to get used to this as my feet are too sensitive, I still cannot use it.</li>
            <li>neither too soft nor too scratchy.  </li>
            <li>This will be so awesome in the summer when my feet get filthy from gardening.</li>
            <li>Provides a good scrubbing that is difficult otherwise to perform in a shower.</li>
            <li>I have seriously dry feet (thanks, Mom!).</li>
            <li>If it is a slick bottom tub, it will stick just fine.  </li>
            <li>I had one that I bought 15 years ago and just recently replaced it with a new one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing one in the very near future and be keeping it in mind for gift giving!  </li>
            <li>No regrets now!</li>
            <li>The drawback for me, is that the instructions clearly say to make sure the suctions cups are firmly stuck down before using the scrubber.</li>
            <li>I have severe arthritis and mobility issues, plus a general lack of limber-ness ( I know, not a word).</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of getting used to with the bristles, especially if you have sensitive soles.</li>
            <li>Extreme care needs to be taken though because your feet are going to be very soapy, slippery.</li>
            <li>I went back to using my cheap foot wand after trying really hard to like this brush for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>l love the product, no more bending down to scrub my feet.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are just right, not too soft or too hard.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure my feet have ever been this clean for so long.  </li>
            <li>Now we have it down and really like it.</li>
            <li>Suction cups don&#x27;t hold, must use your other foot to hold steady.  </li>
            <li>I have no trouble sticking it to the bottom of my tub for use, then sticking it to the wall of the tub to drain and dry between uses.  </li>

            <li> But the scrubber is great for removing gardening dirt from sides and bottom of feet.</li>
            <li> My wife thinks it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> is great</li>
            <li> This is a great product it feels like going to the spa.</li>
            <li> This works great, but won&#x27;t stick to my textured shower floor, so I have to jam it up against the wall.</li>
            <li> Shower Foot Scrubber is great.</li>
            <li> A great help in any shower.</li>

            <li> Feel great on your feet.</li>
            <li> Works great does and really good job on my feet...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, sticks to tub floor &amp; feels good.</li>
            <li> so it is something good  for me.</li>
            <li> In some ways, I feel like I could have just removed an industrial sweeper head and added some suction to my shower floor, because that&#x27;s kind of what this is like, but the product has been great</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> but this one is just right for me!!!!  </li>
            <li> I have one myself, and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> she was very pleased.</li>
            <li> The liquid soap is nice, lots of suds and smells good.</li>
            <li> I love this !  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Truth be told, I think it does a better job than I ever did!</li>
            <li> Really love this in my shower!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs - it&#x27;s great to be able to give my feet a real thorough scrubbing without bending over or balancing on one foot in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> love this!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I love that too!</li>
            <li> love this scrubber - purchased one for my sister as well - wonderful for those of us with arthritis no being able to bend so easily.</li>
            <li> My niece liked it when I gave it to her for her birthday</li>
            <li> I really love using this, it feels so good.  </li>
            <li> gel is quite nice as well, with tea tree oil to help control bacteria and deodorize as well.</li>
            <li> It is nice.</li>
            <li> Works nicely.  </li>
            <li> This foot scrubber is great, it stays in place and gets my feet squeaky clean</li>
            <li> a good soapy lather is great - good for the circulation and refreshing for my feet.&lt;br /&gt;There are suction cups on the bottom of the scrubber, but it is necessary to stabilize it by using one foot to stand on a flap to keep it secured to the shower or tub floor.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush, and the gel smells so fresh and revitalising.</li>
            <li> Product is made from exceptional material, not just cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> My feet feel clean and good after using the scrubber.  </li>
            <li> But its purpose to clean the foot succeeds:  </li>
            <li> This has helped tremendously!!</li>
            <li> That is HUGE!</li>
            <li> Myself, my husband and my daughter all LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> feet are SOOOOO smooth!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this device may sound &amp;#34;Foofy&amp;#34;, but in all seriousness, it&#x27;s just the perfect thing to complete your cleansing rituals.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It probably would work much better in a tub/shower</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> I am not elderly or concerned about falling, but if I did have any stability issues this would not be an appropriate product, unless I knew I could use it while sitting.</li>

            <li> In the shower, I found it works best to wet the brushes, turn off the water, squirt on the soap and use it.</li>
            <li> The product I received is great but the paperwork clearly states that a rope to pull it up with was included and it was not.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;It has suction cups, that hold it on the walls of my shower just fine, but cannot grip my textured shower floor.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the stiffness of the bristles, but they&#x27;re fine....</li>
            <li> It sticks on the wall just fine for storage.  </li>
            <li> If you have a textured bottom tub or shower, it can slip, but with the design you can also stand on one of the rubber pads and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s easy to clean feet.</li>
            <li> we ended up sticking it on one of the tub surround ledges, but for a smooth tub, it would be a 5 star item</li>

            <li> This is a great way to give your tootsies a daily scrub.  </li>

            <li> Really cleans feet and makes them feel better.</li>
            <li> just what we needed and quick shipping</li>
            <li> With the shower running, the soap is washed away too quickly.</li>
            <li> The soap that came with it is great, I can see the fungus on my toenail slowly getting better.</li>
            <li> It just plain feels good!</li>
            <li> and I enjoy using it very much.</li>

            <li> Feet becoming much smoother.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m a guy through and through, I wear original old spice deodorant, I use a shaving mug and when I&#x27;m hunting water fowl or pheasants</li>
            <li> The scrubby part is awesome, could be a little stiffer for a man&#x27;s foot, but good quality, i docked 1 star because the suction cups are too small if you have a tub with any sort of texture on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this for everyone!!</li>
            <li> but otherwise, a good clean and massage for average feet.</li>
            <li> I was a bit leery about the price, but have found that it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is a truly useful product for the summer.</li>
            <li> LIke many of the prior reviewers my feet have never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li> I have reached the age where my balance and flexibility are not quite up to par, and I can now really keep my feet clean.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i needed to keep my feet smooth and dry cracked skin free !</li>
            <li> Just watching this video was very relaxing!  </li>
            <li> exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The Shower Foot Scrubber is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> At first glance looks like mud scrubber.</li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the unbearable tickle against my feet.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you need at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This foot scrubber was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s akward to use, and honestly, it could be a slipping hazard!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how clean it gets my feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the second time I&#x27;ve given this product to someone, and the response has been the same - they all loved it.  </li>
            <li> I go barefoot all the time and this actually gets the bottoms of my feet clean!</li>
            <li> I would still recommend this for anyone who could benefit from not having to bend over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: my first one developed mildew, so I bought the imitation one that was cheaper and realized there&#x27;s good reason it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> That was my first response, but I learned to not be gentle as I placed my foot in the scrubber bristles.  </li>
            <li> But it relies upon suction cups to stick to your flat surface, and even then it&#x27;s not 100% solid in place, which means you are not getting a really good scrub.  </li>
            <li> Amazing that the old one lasted so long.  </li>
            <li> I have back problems and can&#x27;t reach them easily.  </li>
            <li> too large and cumbersome .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to throw this down in the tub, splash with water, drizzle some soap, and get-a-scrubbin.</li>
            <li> Really like this.  </li>
            <li> It suctions very well to the bottom of the tub</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how well this product really works.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and seems to be well made.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li> Also a real plus that it is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy product.</li>
            <li> You just have to make sure you are careful when you are learning how to use it.</li>
            <li> He does not stop talking about how much he loves it.  </li>
            <li> Sooo really love how sturdy the brushes are... just be careful when you have one soapy foot to not slip...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> This scrubber really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks for handling all of that for me</li>
            <li> Works very well and hanging it up after use and rinishing to prevent mildewing.</li>
            <li> (we take showers), and we both really like it.</li>
            <li> It seems very sturdy and it feels like it will hold up to repeated use.  </li>
            <li> harder you scrub, the more you need to use the side &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; to hold the scrubber in place under your feet.  </li>
            <li> Would absolutely purchase again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in one position very well, but works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product to everyone!</li>
            <li> so much that I skipped my pedicure.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, rinse, hang to dry in shower.</li>
            <li> However, the bottom of my tub has a slight texture (like most tubs today)</li>
            <li> It does a decent job of scrubbing your feet without bending over and built of quality long-lasting materials.</li>
            <li> Scratchy, calloused, alligator feet, that crack like California in a high fault area.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this thing.  </li>
            <li> Sure a little bit, but here&#x27;s the thing.  </li>
            <li> BTW, I soaked the old one in white vinegar and pressure washed clean; have a spare now.</li>
            <li> The price was kinda high, but the other ones were to (except the $10 one, but it was cheap plastic), so I picked this one becasue of how it looked.  </li>
            <li> I was searching for something that would help clean my feet since they are incredibly dry!</li>
            <li> There was quite a gap when I couldn&#x27;t get a new one.  </li>
            <li> , It dries completely, and has no mold or mildew issues.t!)</li>
            <li> The scrubber rinses easily, dries quickly, and rests behind the grab bar on the shower wall between uses.  </li>
            <li> But a mild cleaning can be done by just running your foot back and forth, since the scrubber is heavy enough to remain in place for a light cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It cleans between my toes with a little maneuvering, and leaves my feet soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and I have actually noticed a huge improvement with my rough feet.</li>
            <li> Makes my feet tickle when using it, keeping my feet soft too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even felt the need for a professional pedicure since I started using this scrubber.</li>
            <li> , It dries completely, and has no mold or mildew issues.</li>
            <li> You have to get used to this as my feet are too sensitive, I still cannot use it.</li>
            <li> neither too soft nor too scratchy.  </li>
            <li> This will be so awesome in the summer when my feet get filthy from gardening.</li>
            <li> Provides a good scrubbing that is difficult otherwise to perform in a shower.</li>
            <li> I have seriously dry feet (thanks, Mom!).</li>
            <li> If it is a slick bottom tub, it will stick just fine.  </li>
            <li> I had one that I bought 15 years ago and just recently replaced it with a new one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing one in the very near future and be keeping it in mind for gift giving!  </li>
            <li> No regrets now!</li>
            <li> The drawback for me, is that the instructions clearly say to make sure the suctions cups are firmly stuck down before using the scrubber.</li>
            <li> I have severe arthritis and mobility issues, plus a general lack of limber-ness ( I know, not a word).</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of getting used to with the bristles, especially if you have sensitive soles.</li>
            <li> Extreme care needs to be taken though because your feet are going to be very soapy, slippery.</li>
            <li> I went back to using my cheap foot wand after trying really hard to like this brush for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> l love the product, no more bending down to scrub my feet.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are just right, not too soft or too hard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure my feet have ever been this clean for so long.  </li>
            <li> Now we have it down and really like it.</li>
            <li> Suction cups don&#x27;t hold, must use your other foot to hold steady.  </li>
            <li> I have no trouble sticking it to the bottom of my tub for use, then sticking it to the wall of the tub to drain and dry between uses.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks of using it daily all the rough dry skin is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> Not for someone older who may have trouble balancing.  </li>
            <li> A little stiffer, but not hard on my feet at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My husband even uses this which is really annoying - get your own!  </li>
            <li> The brushes are soft but firm enough to scrub.</li>
            <li> The suction cups don&#x27;t work very well, so it&#x27;s always sliding around and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I tied a long ribbon to it</li>
            <li> , I think that&#x27;s why it lasted so long.</li>
            <li> When I get a pedicure, I pay extra for them to break out the cheese grater and file the rough patches off.</li>
            <li> (I attached a long plastic Panduit</li>
            <li> Overall, my feet seem a little softer with this regular invigorating brushing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s go the blue wings on the side, so with one foot I stand on the wing and scrub the other foot.  </li>
            <li> so I can hang it in the shower to dry.</li>
            <li> to dry feature is appriciated by all the family</li>
            <li> Feels good...getting rid of dry skin....</li>
            <li> I have several pumice stones, a PedEgg, have used various emulsions and creams, etc., including a heavy duty one from my podiatrist.</li>
            <li> However, the side flaps are wide enough to stand on with one foot, while scrubbing the other.</li>
            <li> Not worth it, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> especially like curling my toes and running them up and down the bristles.  </li>
            <li> I go barefoot all the time, and my feet get dirty easily.  </li>
            <li> A slight draw back was the suction cups.  </li>
            <li> I have had rough, dry heals for years.</li>
            <li> some are too soft and some are too hard...</li>
            <li> but I think that will be a long time from now!!!</li>
            <li> The cracks are painful, and the ridges I develop on the edge of my feet make my tile floors that much more slippery for me.  </li>
            <li> Seriously rough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it is quite pricey and a total waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> That is a very small price to pay for soft feet.</li>
            <li> Not good for sensitive feet, it feels like you are using a floor scrub brush.  </li>
            <li> The reviews of this scrubber ,and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to bend to use it (other than pick it up), convinced me to give it</li>
            <li> I would have given this 4.5 stars for no top scrubbing band, but that is remedied with a back brush.</li>
            <li> After going through this one and the other one I chose this one even tho</li>
            <li> Works well, just remember to step on one of the flaps while you scrub the other.</li>
            <li> So I read the other reviews where they talk about how it slides around.  </li>
            <li> but like other reviewers, just hold one side with other foot.</li>
            <li> No matter how small or big</li>
            <li> It just feels like a very rough brush for your feet.</li>
            <li> The feeling is a little weird at first, but now that my feet have gotten used to it</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Beats taking a scrub brush down to foot.</li>
            <li> It is heavy and, if the suction cups don&#x27;t attach to the shower floor (for example, if there is anti-slip coating), you can stand on one wing while scrubbing the other foot.</li>
            <li> other big bulky foot scrubbs are worse....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this !  this is exactly what i needed to keep my feet smooth and dry cracked skin free !</li>
            <li> Really like this.  Feet becoming much smoother.  Easy to use, rinse, hang to dry in shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, sticks to tub floor &amp; feels good.</li>
            <li> great foot shower scrubber&lt;br /&gt;comes with foot gel</li>
            <li> just what we needed and quick shipping</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best gift for anyone pregnant--keep your feet pretty without having to . . . figure out how to get to them.  I had one that I bought 15 years ago and just recently replaced it with a new one.  There was quite a gap when I couldn&#x27;t get a new one.  Amazing that the old one lasted so long.  I tied a long ribbon to it so I could let it hang off the floor when not in use, so it dried well between showers, I think that&#x27;s why it lasted so long.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, but it tickles!</li>
            <li> Bought for 95-year-old mom. Great for those hard-to-reach toes.</li>
            <li> The suction cups don&#x27;t work very well, so it&#x27;s always sliding around and hard to use.</li>
            <li> This was part of a gift given to my sister.  It&#x27;s the second time I&#x27;ve given this product to someone, and the response has been the same - they all loved it.  I have one myself, and I am very pleased.  I would not hesitate to give this again.</li>
            <li> I was swayed by all the good reviews, it&#x27;s one of those &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; disappointments again! Being pregnant, I thought it would be great not to have to bend down to clean my feet, however the brush doesn&#x27;t do a very good job and I feel quite awkward using it, having to stand on the wing with the other foot to stabilize the brush. I went back to using my cheap foot wand after trying really hard to like this brush for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> GREATEST INVENTION EVER!!! Myself, my husband and my daughter all LOVE IT. This will be so awesome in the summer when my feet get filthy from gardening. The brushes are soft but firm enough to scrub. It suctions very well to the bottom of the tub and it rinses easily and dries quickly. EVERY HOME SHOULD OWN ONE!!!!</li>
            <li> This foot scrubber is wonderful for my feet.  My bath fitter shower floor has those non slip indentations built in and even though it suctions to the shower floor it does slip.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the link for a video of the product in use: https://www.joyus.com/beauty/1-2388/get-a-foot-massage-every-time-you-shower-hosted-by-zoe-ruderman (looks like you&#x27;ll have to cut and pate address to use it).  Just watching this video was very relaxing!  I&#x27;ll be purchasing one in the very near future and be keeping it in mind for gift giving!  I&#x27;ll update review then.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning and getting rid of dry skin. Plus it&#x27;s easy to clean feet.</li>
            <li> Thank You!!!  Everything was great....exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how well this product really works. My feet where bad, really bad. After two weeks of using it daily all the rough dry skin is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE !!!! We use them at our vacation house in south Florida where people don&#x27;t like to wear shoes and these would perfect in the showers!!</li>
            <li> A GREAT ITEM FOR MEN AND WOMEN, CLEANS YOUR FEET AND LEAVE THEM SOLF LIKE A BABY.</li>
            <li> Makes my feet tickle when using it, keeping my feet soft too.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the construction.  The suction cups are so strong that I store it on my shower wall</li>
            <li> I have seriously dry feet (thanks, Mom!). Scratchy, calloused, alligator feet, that crack like California in a high fault area. Seriously rough. I don&#x27;t wear sandals, because they are so bad (even in summer). The cracks are painful, and the ridges I develop on the edge of my feet make my tile floors that much more slippery for me.  When I get a pedicure, I pay extra for them to break out the cheese grater and file the rough patches off. I have several pumice stones, a PedEgg, have used various emulsions and creams, etc., including a heavy duty one from my podiatrist. My feet have beat them all.  I wondered how on earth a scrub brush can do what they could not, but was desperate to try again.  I have severe arthritis and mobility issues, plus a general lack of limber-ness ( I know, not a word). The reviews of this scrubber ,and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to bend to use it (other than pick it up), convinced me to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet are SOOOOO smooth! It&#x27;s crazy that this scrubber can make such a difference, but it does. It didn&#x27;t happen over night, but within a few days, I could feel a difference. After a couple weeks, my husband told me my feet are like butter, lol. And I am not putting any moisturizer on them, for the sake of science. Just squirt a little soap on it, and scrub my feet while I shower. I won&#x27;t be doing any foot modeling, but I can wear sandals, etc. without shame, now. That is HUGE! I haven&#x27;t even felt the need for a professional pedicure since I started using this scrubber. And I guarantee, the &amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; will not be coming out the next time I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has suction cups, that hold it on the walls of my shower just fine, but cannot grip my textured shower floor. However, the side flaps are wide enough to stand on with one foot, while scrubbing the other. That is a very small price to pay for soft feet. I rinse it thoroughly and hang on the shower wall after every use (and no one else in the house is allowed to use it!), It dries completely, and has no mold or mildew issues.t!), It dries completely, and has no mold or mildew issues.</li>
            <li> Not good for sensitive feet, it feels like you are using a floor scrub brush.  It is well made.  It stays in place in the shower on a tiled floor.  Easy to use and rinses well.</li>
            <li> My niece liked it when I gave it to her for her birthday (it was on her wish list) but she didn&#x27;t rave about it. For me, it would just clutter up my shower space, putting me at risk for a broken hip. Also, my feet never get so filthy that I can&#x27;t clean my tootsies with a scrubbie, so to me it&#x27;s mindless consumerism.</li>
            <li> I go barefoot all the time, and my feet get dirty easily.  I go barefoot all the time and this actually gets the bottoms of my feet clean!</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m a guy through and through, I wear original old spice deodorant, I use a shaving mug and when I&#x27;m hunting water fowl or pheasants I don&#x27;t cry when I have to ring a few necks.&lt;br /&gt;However, this device may sound &amp;#34;Foofy&amp;#34;, but in all seriousness, it&#x27;s just the perfect thing to complete your cleansing rituals.&lt;br /&gt;You just move this around, with your feet, press it down to hold it, squirt on your favorite shower gel or liquid soap and lets the suds fly with those piggies.&lt;br /&gt;Sock lint is a thing of the past, and lets face it guys, girls don&#x27;t like our stinky feet, so get &#x27;em clean.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product!  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The foot scrubber does a wonderful job.  I have no trouble sticking it to the bottom of my tub for use, then sticking it to the wall of the tub to drain and dry between uses.  It cleans between my toes with a little maneuvering, and leaves my feet soft and smooth.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and seems to be well made. In the shower, I found it works best to wet the brushes, turn off the water, squirt on the soap and use it. With the shower running, the soap is washed away too quickly. Extreme care needs to be taken though because your feet are going to be very soapy, slippery. But the scrubber is great for removing gardening dirt from sides and bottom of feet. I would have given this 4.5 stars for no top scrubbing band, but that is remedied with a back brush. Overall, my feet seem a little softer with this regular invigorating brushing.</li>
            <li> I really love using this, it feels so good.  The brushes are just right, not too soft or too hard.  It stays put for me in my one-piece shower, no problem.  The soap that came with it is great, I can see the fungus on my toenail slowly getting better. It is very sturdy and well made.  Also a real plus that it is made in the USA.  Highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> Love it. Really cleans feet and makes them feel better. I hope barefoot a lot so it is something good  for me.</li>
            <li> This foot scrubber does NOT stick to the small tiles in a shower.  Since the description did not say that, I bought it and now it is in the trash.  Could not get it to stick to the shower floor, and it is very hard to hold still with your other foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It probably would work much better in a tub/shower combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it is quite pricey and a total waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I was a bit leery about the price, but have found that it is completely worth it. It is heavy, stays in place, and REALLY does the job. I have reached the age where my balance and flexibility are not quite up to par, and I can now really keep my feet clean. Truth be told, I think it does a better job than I ever did!</li>
            <li> You have to get used to this as my feet are too sensitive, I still cannot use it. My wife thinks it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> bulky but gets the job done</li>
            <li> love this scrubber - purchased one for my sister as well - wonderful for those of us with arthritis no being able to bend so easily.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son,he likes it. He has nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy product. We love it. You just have to make sure you are careful when you are learning how to use it. Now we have it down and really like it. The bristles are sturdy and I have put a loop in the ribbon that holds it so I can hang it in the shower to dry. Works great. Product is made from exceptional material, not just cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> This purchase was not for me, it was for my boyfriend.  He wanted something to scrub between his toes.  He does not stop talking about how much he loves it.  Best purchase ever&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I returned it because I  didn&#x27;t feel that it gave me the same effect that was shown on TV. There was no soothing sensation felt on my feet  whatsoever. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> is great but no cord included??</li>
            <li> This is a great product it feels like going to the spa. Your feel refresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Really love this in my shower! It just plain feels good!</li>
            <li> Due to artificial joints I have difficulty reaching and washing my feet.  The Shower Foot Scrubber is exactly what I needed.  I was concerned about the stiffness of the bristles, but they&#x27;re fine....neither too soft nor too scratchy.  My feet feel clean and good after using the scrubber.  I&#x27;ve been using a generic baby shampoo/wash as the soap.  The scrubber rinses easily, dries quickly, and rests behind the grab bar on the shower wall between uses.  I would/will purchase another one of these should something happen to this one.  Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> too large and cumbersome .</li>
            <li> Works great does and really good job on my feet... I have back problems and can&#x27;t reach them easily.  I have tried some and feel like the Goldilocks and the 3 Bears... some are too soft and some are too hard... but this one is just right for me!!!!  I am a barefoot gal all year long and my feet get really dirty!!!  Sooo really love how sturdy the brushes are... just be careful when you have one soapy foot to not slip... I keep thinking I should buy and extra and keep it back for when this one wears out... but I think that will be a long time from now!!!</li>
            <li> This makes washing my feet fun and pleasurable!  Came on time and well packaged.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do anything. Not worth it, especially for the cost. Get the exercise and bend over in the shower...</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister amd she was very pleased.</li>
            <li> The Foot Scrubber feels heavenly and I enjoy using it very much. The drawback for me, is that the instructions clearly say to make sure the suctions cups are firmly stuck down before using the scrubber. However, the bottom of my tub has a slight texture (like most tubs today) so the suction cups do not adhere. I am not elderly or concerned about falling, but if I did have any stability issues this would not be an appropriate product, unless I knew I could use it while sitting.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THE &amp;#34;SHOWER FOOT SCRUBBER</li>
            <li> This works great, but won&#x27;t stick to my textured shower floor, so I have to jam it up against the wall.</li>
            <li> Shower Foot Scrubber is great. At first glance looks like mud scrubber. This scrubber really works. Works on heels of your foot, around  the toes, around toenail. Lotion used for scrubbing big plus.</li>
            <li> A great help in any shower.</li>
            <li> almost killed me.  did not adhere to tub and slipped when I tried to use.  Returned it.  Thanks for handling all of that for me</li>
            <li> ▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄★☆☆Super Fast Shipping &amp; Great Price☆☆★▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀</li>
            <li> Too fat to bend over?  Will keep your feet clean with ease.</li>
            <li> feels invigorating and it takes a few times to get used to the feeling. if feet are heavily callused, it probably wont work but otherwise, a good clean and massage for average feet.</li>
            <li> The scrubby part is awesome, could be a little stiffer for a man&#x27;s foot, but good quality, i docked 1 star because the suction cups are too small if you have a tub with any sort of texture on the bottom.  we ended up sticking it on one of the tub surround ledges, but for a smooth tub, it would be a 5 star item</li>
            <li> I wish this had drain holes under the bristles, which would prevent mold or mildew, plus when I received it the retrieval rope was not included.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of getting used to with the bristles, especially if you have sensitive soles. The suction cups on the underside will not adhere to small tile floors in showers and will need step on one side to hold as you scrub your other foot. This area could be larger to help hold it still as it moves around some. It does a decent job of scrubbing your feet without bending over and built of quality long-lasting materials. I would still recommend this for anyone who could benefit from not having to bend over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: my first one developed mildew, so I bought the imitation one that was cheaper and realized there&#x27;s good reason it was cheaper. Returned it and bought this one again. Works very well and hanging it up after use and rinishing to prevent mildewing. Totally satisfied even though pricey. BTW, I soaked the old one in white vinegar and pressure washed clean; have a spare now.</li>
            <li> the boxes appeared open and the rope was gone, I got a refund. that brings the product satisfaction to 0,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but to get something that appeared some one opened before packaging well one thing I will not order again, and I can still use it but it will not stay probably the soap does not allow it to stick to the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get a pedicure or just get a srubb brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the other big bulky foot scrubbs are worse....</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs - it&#x27;s great to be able to give my feet a real thorough scrubbing without bending over or balancing on one foot in the shower.  I love the feel of the bristles and a good soapy lather is great - good for the circulation and refreshing for my feet.&lt;br /&gt;There are suction cups on the bottom of the scrubber, but it is necessary to stabilize it by using one foot to stand on a flap to keep it secured to the shower or tub floor.</li>
            <li> The plastic is so hard it did not conform to my shower floor.  Exhausting.  Whats the point it the unit moves when you try to clean your feet?  I&#x27;d pass on this if I were you.</li>
            <li> It should last forever! I would never have imagined how heavily constructed this is! The wings and suction cups help hold it to the tub as it cleans your feet.</li>
            <li> Ooohhh so ticklish on my toes! I purchased one for me and one for my spouse (we take showers), and we both really like it. The green bristles on the sides are a lot longer and stiffer, but I found if I turn my foot sideways and curl my toes down, it cleans my nails, like a nail scrubber. At first I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the unbearable tickle against my feet. However, after a couple days, now it feels great. The liquid soap is nice, lots of suds and smells good. It is heavy and, if the suction cups don&#x27;t attach to the shower floor (for example, if there is anti-slip coating), you can stand on one wing while scrubbing the other foot. It has a hole on the top in case you want to hang it (I attached a long plastic Panduit so I can hang it off my shower fixture that turns the water on/off.)</li>
            <li> This makes my feet feel so good!  I feel like I&#x27;m getting pampered every day.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Worth every penny. If it doesn&#x27;t suction to your floor, no worries. It doesn&#x27;t on our shower floor but I stand on a wing on the side.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and I absolutely love it.  LIke many of the prior reviewers my feet have never felt so clean.  It works well to keep your feet feeling smooth.  It seems very sturdy and it feels like it will hold up to repeated use.  The feeling is a little weird at first, but now that my feet have gotten used to it I have no problems.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as publicized.  It just feels like a very rough brush for your feet.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how clean it gets my feet. I walk around barefoot all day.</li>
            <li> l love the product, no more bending down to scrub my feet.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to give your tootsies a daily scrub.  If your feet have been in a tub or shower for a few minutes, thus softening the skin, the scrubber probably gently exfoliates.  But its purpose to clean the foot succeeds:  the soles and sides of your feet get a scrub with firm nylon bristles.  .The harder you scrub, the more you need to use the side &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; to hold the scrubber in place under your feet.  For this, you either need to sit or balance yourself while standing.  But a mild cleaning can be done by just running your foot back and forth, since the scrubber is heavy enough to remain in place for a light cleaning.  I haven&#x27;t used the soap that comes with the scrubber, but any bath gel can be used. With daily use over the last four mornings, the bottoms of my feet are a lot cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Very nice brush, and the gel smells so fresh and revitalising. Exactly what you need at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Everyone from DH to the 5yo loves this.  It feels nice, gets the feet clean, and does exfoliate some.  It doesn&#x27;t stick terribly well once the gel/soap is added with vigorous scrubbing, but stepping on one flap solves that problem.  It sticks on the wall just fine for storage.  Have noticed less stinky feet in the house as they are getting cleaner during showers, which was our main intention in purchasing.  Would absolutely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is quite nice as well, with tea tree oil to help control bacteria and deodorize as well.</li>
            <li> love this! use it all the time!</li>
            <li> I was searching for something that would help clean my feet since they are incredibly dry! After going through this one and the other one I chose this one even tho it had fewer reviews then the others.  The price was kinda high, but the other ones were to (except the $10 one, but it was cheap plastic), so I picked this one becasue of how it looked.  No regrets now! The others ones were plastic and could only be used one way.  This one is hardedned rubber all the way around, and you can scrub your foot with it anyway you please!  A slight draw back was the suction cups.  If you have a textured bottom tub or shower, it can slip, but with the design you can also stand on one of the rubber pads and it works just fine.  If it is a slick bottom tub, it will stick just fine.  It may slip every once in a awhile, but thats with most things.  If you are looking for a foot scrubber for the shower...choose this one! I dont know if you can even break it!</li>
            <li> feels great on your feet.  The only downer is getting it to stay stuck on my shower.  I&#x27;ll figure it out eventually.  My husband even uses this which is really annoying - get your own!  LOL!</li>
            <li> Works well, just remember to step on one of the flaps while you scrub the other.</li>
            <li> All that is promised is delivered in this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrubber is easy to use and the hang to dry feature is appriciated by all the family</li>
            <li> This foot scrubber is great, it stays in place and gets my feet squeaky clean</li>
            <li> Does the job in a flash</li>
            <li> The product I received is great but the paperwork clearly states that a rope to pull it up with was included and it was not.  I would prefer to get what I paid for.</li>
            <li> This is a truly useful product for the summer. Solid and well made. Not cheapy cheapy.&lt;br /&gt;Am I the only one that gets sludgy piggies wearing flip flops all day? Well, I know my kids&#x27; do, too. It&#x27;s super easy to throw this down in the tub, splash with water, drizzle some soap, and get-a-scrubbin. You can&#x27;t go to bed with your feet all disgustin!</li>
            <li> In some ways, I feel like I could have just removed an industrial sweeper head and added some suction to my shower floor, because that&#x27;s kind of what this is like, but the product has been great and I have actually noticed a huge improvement with my rough feet.</li>
            <li> It tickles!  That was my first response, but I learned to not be gentle as I placed my foot in the scrubber bristles.  It does a great job.  I wear open sandals in warm weather to work in the yard and my feet do get dirty.</li>
            <li> The Shower Foot  Scrubber is very good and easy to use and cleans your foot very well while you are in a safe secure standing position.</li>
            <li> It is nice. Just a tad disappointed.</li>
            <li> Use it daily. Feet are already smoother!</li>
            <li> So I read the other reviews where they talk about how it slides around.  Sure a little bit, but here&#x27;s the thing.  it&#x27;s go the blue wings on the side, so with one foot I stand on the wing and scrub the other foot.  Lather, rinse, repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the bottom bristles are of a good nail brush consistency and it feels wonderful.  I spend a lot of time barefoot and a good scrub is appreciated.  The sides are even better.  A little stiffer, but not hard on my feet at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like curling my toes and running them up and down the bristles.  I&#x27;m not sure my feet have ever been this clean for so long.  Ahhhhhhhhhh.</li>
            <li> I now feel that I am getting my feet clean without having to stand on one leg each time I scrub a foot.  Easy to use. Just don&#x27;t forget to stand on one of the &#x27;ear flaps&#x27; to hold it as you scrub.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Far superior than the \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; versions we have. May buy another as a gift.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Doesn&#x27;t stay in one position very well, but works.</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than I thought it would.  Plan on taking some effort to clean your feet.  Product feels well built and to last for a while.  MADE IN THE USA!  good plus.  Suction cups don&#x27;t hold, must use your other foot to hold steady.  Not for someone older who may have trouble balancing.  Does clean feet nicely however.  Wife uses it also and likes it.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my dad as a gift as it&#x27;s hard for him to bend over in the shower. He loves it, and he also loves the foot gel that comes with it.</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife and she loves it</li>
            <li> This foot scrubber was exactly what I needed.  I was recuperating from total knee replacement and could not reach my feet to scrub them.  This was the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Had back surgery and can no longer been over, so this is great for me!</li>
            <li> Great Product. Feel great on your feet. Saw results in a few days.</li>
            <li> Works nicely.  Provides a good scrubbing that is difficult otherwise to perform in a shower.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I needed something like this. Beats taking a scrub brush down to foot. These should be in every shower! My feet are so happy!</li>
            <li> I really great method of scrubbing feet really well with a nice med hard brush system...  I use it every day</li>
            <li> Feels good...getting rid of dry skin....</li>
            <li> I have had rough, dry heals for years. This has helped tremendously!! I highly recommend the product to everyone!</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for his smelly toes. Doesn&#x27;t stick to the shower floor that well but like other reviewers, just hold one side with other foot. I get a kick out of it because it tickles his toes and he laughs a lot... Works great! No more corn chip smell for me.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this thing.  But it relies upon suction cups to stick to your flat surface, and even then it&#x27;s not 100% solid in place, which means you are not getting a really good scrub.  So it&#x27;s akward to use, and honestly, it could be a slipping hazard!</li>
            <li> I hated this product.  Used it once and wouldn&#x27;t stay still.  Sent it back.</li>
            <li> Awsome!! is all I&#x27;m saying</li>
            <li> Where has this thing been all my life?!! 😍I absolutely recommend this for everyone!! No matter how small or big your feet are this foot scrubber is the best!! Not to mention I bought a separate second bottle of the gel foot scrubber soap. I love that too!</li>
            <li> This is one of my best purchases ever.  I love my foot scrubber.  I love the way my feet feel after a shower, so much that I skipped my pedicure.</li>
