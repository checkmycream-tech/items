            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough, for smoothing down the flyaways while I have my hair pulled back, but otherwise is kind of sticky, especially in humidity.</li>
            <li>but I find that it dries my hair considerably.  </li>
            <li>This product is light but has a firm hold and helps my hair curl!  </li>

            <li> The formula is really sticky, hard and crunchy....</li>
            <li> Using this for setting &amp;#34;beachy waves&amp;#34; on my medium long hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like it as my dry hair gets curlier after I spray.  </li>
            <li> I read the bottle and it seems like a firm hairspray, not a flat iron spray.</li>

            <li> and you are looking for a little flexible hold, it will give you that.</li>
            <li> so I thougth the hold would be a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I finally found it through Twisted Scissors.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for at least 3 years</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;organics&amp;#34; should not be in the name, it&#x27;s really smelly chemical crap.  </li>
            <li> Besides all of the actual wearability of the spray, I have never seen a nozzle get clogged so badly and so often in all my 36 years.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong if you buy this!</li>
            <li> Works well, but I hate using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Using this for setting &amp;#34;beachy waves&amp;#34; on my medium long hair.  It wears well throughout the day and isn&#x27;t too sticky.</li>
            <li> After searching EVERYWHERE for this product (it is truly the best available) I finally found it through Twisted Scissors. FAST shipper. Will order from them again.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Had been using for the past several years but now I can&#x27;t afford it anymore.  The price has skyrocketed. It cost 5 times what it used to. What&#x27;s up with that. Boo!</li>
            <li> This was order upon suggestion from a friend.  I am not too excited about the product, no fault of yours.</li>
            <li> First off, this is not organic, so if you are looking for an organic spray, move on. It&#x27;s light enough, for smoothing down the flyaways while I have my hair pulled back, but otherwise is kind of sticky, especially in humidity. I have thick but very fine hair, so it is hard to find a good spray for me, but this is not it. Besides all of the actual wearability of the spray, I have never seen a nozzle get clogged so badly and so often in all my 36 years. It&#x27;s good enough that I will finish the bottle, but I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I swear by this hairspray.  If you want something that won&#x27;t weight your hair down but hold your hair I HIGHLY recommend this product.  If you need to spray your hair two days in a row without washing, no problem.  I have been using this for at least 3 years and I have never had flakes build up.  I will forever use this as my hairspray and always recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> This hairspray gives you super hold but I find that it dries my hair considerably.  Like it but don&#x27;t live it !</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;organics&amp;#34; should not be in the name, it&#x27;s really smelly chemical crap.  Works well, but I hate using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Natalie</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray! I used to get it from a local salon owner, (we call it hair crack, its so addicting), but I have found I get a better cost through Amazon. :)&lt;br /&gt;Love, love love!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a light weight hairspray, no alcohol and a great hold, this is the hairspray that should be purchased by all women.  Highly recommend...</li>
            <li> it does exactly what is promised.</li>
            <li> Getting root lift with a flat iron is they only good thing I can do with this product. I got it because I read that it was a great flat iron spray. The formula is really sticky, hard and crunchy.... 3 things I hate in a hair spray. I read the bottle and it seems like a firm hairspray, not a flat iron spray. I can use it at the root, a spay and a curl out with the flat iron does give good lift. I will not repurchase this item.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for.  I will order again and recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Excellent spray gel go  my naturally curly hair. Scrunch and go.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is absolutely fabulous.  My hair is wavy/curly and most hair sprays weigh down the curls and make my hair feel gummy and look fuzzy..  This product is light but has a firm hold and helps my hair curl!  I&#x27;ve never used anything like it as my dry hair gets curlier after I spray.  It also provides shine.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> This hairspray works so well for fine hair.  It does an amazing job of holding my style without weighing the hair down.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smelling, lovely flexible hold product. Not designed for course hair. If your hair is straight or very straightend and you are looking for a little flexible hold, it will give you that. It is labled vapor gel so I thougth the hold would be a little stronger. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I bought this on another&#x27;s positive review. I have always liked Phyto products and I like natural products as well. I really liked this spray for hold and it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up on my hair. I have used many hairsprays over the years and there are only two that I use, this one and Aveda.</li>
            <li> Gives more body to hair.</li>
            <li> I spray this on my hair prior to curling with my hair wand.  It really helps hold and protect curl!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  The spray is very fine and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  Holds great!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray! It&#x27;s the perfect hold! It also works well as a thermol spray as well.  I will keep buying it for sure.</li>
            <li> The only spray I use! Can&#x27;t go wrong if you buy this! So happy I found a place to buy I bulk.</li>
