            <li>Arrived very quickly after order was placed</li>
            <li>The Boosta Spray works well for my hair which is fine and needs volume.</li>
            <li>fine voluminizing spray</li>
            <li>I only use this spray to sort of &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; my hair after using putty to style it, and it works great.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and for me seems sort of like coconuts.  </li>

            <li>I have very fine hair, although there is quite a bit of it, so it tends to lay flat</li>

            <li>My hair has a lot of body on its own, but I like to use the Boosta Spray to add a little volume to my roots.</li>
            <li>I have fine/limp hair and this product really adds volume.</li>
            <li>The most I do when it is really a mess is spray and use the hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>lately I am wearing more layers in an attempt to get it to do something!  </li>
            <li>My hair is still smooth where I spray it, you can still run your fingers through it, it just gives the roots a little &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I use it for special occasions only due to that fact.</li>
            <li>This might be a little pricey for some, but if you have flat, fine hair, it&#x27;s a must-have.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but I feel like it weighs my hair down.  I like the blow and set lotion much better!</li>
            <li> I only use this spray to sort of &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; my hair after using putty to style it, and it works great. It holds, while leaving some movement. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> This might be a little pricey for some, but if you have flat, fine hair, it&#x27;s a must-have. I worked in salon for a few years and this was one of their go-to products for volume. It smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, doesn&#x27;t cause build up. I use this daily. Shake your hair out, spritz 2-3 times close to your scalp, rub into roots, and blow-dry. Activated through heat, make sure you blow-dry!</li>
            <li> It was nothing special. Worked about the same as less expensive drugstore volumizers. Left hair dry and brittle feeling and a little difficult to style.</li>
            <li> I spray this in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet and then blow dry it. When done, I have nice volume. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Used this for years...love it! I have fine/limp hair and this product really adds volume.</li>
            <li> I love the Unite product line. I use the Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner for my wavy/frizzy hair and it works wonders!! My hair has a lot of body on its own, but I like to use the Boosta Spray to add a little volume to my roots. I like how it is not sticky or gritty, like other products. My hair is still smooth where I spray it, you can still run your fingers through it, it just gives the roots a little &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve love this product, wonderful product to use on clean hair.  This is my third bottle and it won&#x27;t be my last one.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, well worth the money.  I went to a salon and got 10 inches of my hair cut off to donate.  The stylist recommended this product for volume and it&#x27;s awesome.  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It keeps my hair where it should be plus I can sleep all night without it falling the next day.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Like coconut. Works awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Who knew that you could get volume out of a spray bottle!!! Only down side is them smell. 😁</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I can&#x27;t live without it. So happy I discovered it!</li>
            <li> I finally found something that gives my thin hair volume!!!!! Love it!  Only suggestion, make it smell better.  It currently smells like glass cleaner~  :p&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE--- I purchased this in March of this year and paid 23.00. This product now costs 49.00!  Are u kidding me?! A 26 dollar increase in under a year!!!  GREED is what I think!  Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Love it and it smells divine</li>
            <li> Awesome hair product.  My fine flyaway hair is full and behaving since using this product. Arrived very quickly after order was placed</li>

            <li> Perfection, i use it everyday and more!!  It works perfect on my hair, long or short.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for two years.&lt;br /&gt;Meets my expections.&lt;br /&gt;I love all UNITE products.</li>

            <li> fine voluminizing spray</li>
            <li> Went to beauty shop on vacation in January and was introduced to this product.My hair is short and upon waking up in morning it is smashed down. Now I don&#x27;t have to wash and fix daily I just spray and arrange.  The most I do when it is really a mess is spray and use the hair dryer.  I can go for at least 4 days and my hair looks great!!</li>
            <li> I love the way this spray gives great volume and the coconut scent is delicious. It&#x27;s great when I use the other Unite products with it.</li>
            <li> A salon in Colorado used ths on my hair for the first time. I love it. Unfortunately, there is not a salon where I live that carries this product. Im glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine naturally curly hair. I try not to wash it more than 3 times weekly. On the 1st day of use my hair looked great. The next morning it looked and felt so greasy, I had to wash it. I use it for special occasions only due to that fact.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, although there is quite a bit of it, so it tends to lay flat no matter what I do.  lately I am wearing more layers in an attempt to get it to do something!
