            <li>This is the best Coconut Water that I have tasted thus far.  </li>
            <li>After seeing comments by Montel Williams about this brand and product,  I decided to research the different brands &amp; felt this was the best one to try.  </li>
            <li>So many people were buying the coconut milk I decided to try coconut water instead.</li>
            <li>and it tastes FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I will order more because I feel like it hydrates me so much better than just water</li>
            <li>It actually tastes like coconut,others I have tried do not taste very good.</li>
            <li>It mixes easily, though there is often a bit of tasty goo at the bottom of the glass.</li>
            <li>i love that it&#x27;s  slightly sweet.</li>
            <li>My first order I believe was not fully to the top and was rein busted but</li>
            <li>I did add a small amount of stevia which made this the best tasting coconut water I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Also it lasts about 8 years if kept in a cool place.</li>
            <li>No matter how much you mix it, most of it settles at the bottom.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t disolve very well, doesn&#x27;t have a strong flavor</li>
            <li>so I started experimenting with making my own infused water using various fresh fruits and using stevia as a sweetener.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a good product, the cost is not worth it for me to buy again.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s ok definitely a must have for dehydration when not feeling well.</li>
            <li>It mixes well with smoothies and I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>However, when I mixed it up and added some sweetener to it it became my new favorite beverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not the real coconut water taste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had coconut milk straight from a coconut</li>
            <li>I started looking for other healthy things I could add to water</li>
            <li>great - a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Coconut has always been one of my favorite flavors but only if it was coated with sugar or mixed into something that contained a sweetener.</li>
            <li>She likes this and will get more in the future although this does go a long way.</li>
            <li>This is great mixed into my various fruit juice concoctions, and I&#x27;ve also added it to my Greek yogurt (not sure if I get the full benefit of it, probably should find out).</li>
            <li>and I found it to really help to balance the electrolytes/hydration and helped to calm my stomach down.  </li>
            <li>I had pretty low expectations for the taste and was only doing it because the cost seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li>Saved on plastic waste and I can add as much or little as I want for good coconut water taste</li>
            <li>Plus, this was not a bland watered down version and had a (to my tastebuds) rich coconut flavor.</li>
            <li>and I came across the Activz Organic Coconut Water Whole Food Powder and decided to try it as an alternative to the commercial coconut waters.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised to the taste &amp; wanted to note that it needs to be stirred well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not fond of coconut water, but have been battling dehydration since fighting off two rounds of pneumonia last spring, thus my acupuncturist wants me to drink coconut water.</li>
            <li>Ummmm....the bottle was not even half full.</li>
            <li>The only real negative is that when used in a blender it produces a thick foam at the top of the smoothie which does not taste good and needs to be removed.</li>
            <li>and it was only a little over half full!!!</li>
            <li>bottle which is a bit cheaper compared to the cost of commercial coconut waters sold in most stores (at least here in Los Angeles).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more because I&#x27;m seriously addicted</li>
            <li>By the way,we live in desert climate and although we have air conditioning,  the hot weather is hard on the body.</li>

            <li> The quantity is small only 7.9 oz which makes this is a super expensive product...while it came highly recommended wish I had paid attention to the cost per ounce!</li>
            <li> The container is much smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> However it does contain  Maltodextrin which is not a natural product.  </li>

            <li> Very small container</li>
            <li> Not a good product</li>
            <li> However, I like the ease of the powder and have started to put the coconut powder in my son&#x27;s sports drinks to cut down on all of the artificial and unnecessary ingredients in sports drinks.</li>
            <li> very expensive  for a small container.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible taste&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just my third day in trying this, seems to help my energy level.</li>
            <li> My wife adds this coconut water powder to her smoothies. It adds sweetness and antioxidants to the smoothies. She likes this and will get more in the future although this does go a long way. The Amazon description was very clear and accurate. The Amazon customer reviews were helpful. It was well packaged and arrived on schedule.</li>
            <li> Just start taking it, so don&#x27;t know the results except I know it is good for me.</li>
            <li> My first order I believe was not fully to the top and was rein busted but&lt;br /&gt;the Organic Water is energize and taste good.  I&#x27;m trying it again check&lt;br /&gt;with then.</li>
            <li> I do like this product, however, it does take some time to dissolve in the water.  So some patience is required while waiting to drink it down.  The taste is very good.</li>
            <li> My favorite Coconut water!  Also it lasts about 8 years if kept in a cool place. I get energy from it, also Great taste!</li>
            <li> Not the real coconut water taste.</li>
            <li> Coconut Water? I dont know about that....I simply do not understand the flavor.</li>
            <li> Coconut has always been one of my favorite flavors but only if it was coated with sugar or mixed into something that contained a sweetener. I&#x27;ve had coconut milk straight from a coconut and it was not something I&#x27;d go back for seconds on. The commercial coconut waters taste bland to me and although I&#x27;ll drink them it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;health&amp;#34; reasons and not because I like the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had to increase my water intake recently but I&#x27;m not a fan of plain water so I started experimenting with making my own infused water using various fresh fruits and using stevia as a sweetener. I started looking for other healthy things I could add to water and I came across the Activz Organic Coconut Water Whole Food Powder and decided to try it as an alternative to the commercial coconut waters. I had pretty low expectations for the taste and was only doing it because the cost seemed reasonable. However, when I mixed it up and added some sweetener to it it became my new favorite beverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label says 32 servings with each serving mixed with 4 ounces of water. I generally go through at least three 16 ounce bottles of water a day so this makes eight 16 ounce bottles. At $21 per container that comes out to be about $2.62 per 16 oz. bottle which is a bit cheaper compared to the cost of commercial coconut waters sold in most stores (at least here in Los Angeles). Plus, this was not a bland watered down version and had a (to my tastebuds) rich coconut flavor. I did add a small amount of stevia which made this the best tasting coconut water I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> After seeing comments by Montel Williams about this brand and product,  I decided to research the different brands &amp; felt this was the best one to try.  I deal with chronic fatigue, hypoglycemia &amp; stomach problems and I found it to really help to balance the electrolytes/hydration and helped to calm my stomach down.  I have also noticed a difference in helping that over- all sluggishness. Pleasantly surprised to the taste &amp; wanted to note that it needs to be stirred well. I also like to combine w/my greens powder too. Just bought my 2nd container.  By the way,we live in desert climate and although we have air conditioning,  the hot weather is hard on the body. My husband has now starting using this too, especially after he&#x27;s been outside exercising or working in the yard and needs to be revived. Works great!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t disolve very well, doesn&#x27;t have a strong flavor</li>
            <li> OMG this stuff is amazing!! I am a Plexus ambassador and we started a challenge with coconut milk and Slim to increase fat burning. So many people were buying the coconut milk I decided to try coconut water instead. I found this and was intrigued. When I got it in I put 2 teaspoons in my water and my packet of Plexus Slim and it tastes FANTASTIC! I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the taste of coconut water by itself and this is no different. I tried it without the Slim and it has the eh flavor so I guess you can say it&#x27;s just like coconut water. I&#x27;m ordering more because I&#x27;m seriously addicted now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, my ambassador number is 242780 if you wanted to try for yourself. ;)</li>
            <li> Terrible taste&lt;br /&gt;Not thing like other coconut water&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy the powder</li>
            <li> I take this sometimes put in my water. very expensive  for a small container. won&#x27;t buy this on amazon again.</li>
            <li> Great for my workouts.</li>
            <li> Very good glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> This is the best Coconut Water that I have tasted thus far.  Try it.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Would never buy again. Does not dissolve in water. No matter how much you mix it, most of it settles at the bottom. Not a good product</li>
            <li> The container is much smaller than I expected but I guess that doesn&#x27;t matter. I bought the powder to replace liquid coconut water for my smoothie. The result isn&#x27;t as good, however I think it is a healthier option. The only real negative is that when used in a blender it produces a thick foam at the top of the smoothie which does not taste good and needs to be removed. I&#x27;m unsure if I will buy the product again.</li>
            <li> Ummmm....the bottle was not even half full. I&#x27;d like a refund.</li>
            <li> I mix this in my smoothies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fond of coconut water, but have been battling dehydration since fighting off two rounds of pneumonia last spring, thus my acupuncturist wants me to drink coconut water. This is great mixed into my various fruit juice concoctions, and I&#x27;ve also added it to my Greek yogurt (not sure if I get the full benefit of it, probably should find out). It mixes easily, though there is often a bit of tasty goo at the bottom of the glass. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I prefer flavored coconut water so this product is not for me. However, I like the ease of the powder and have started to put the coconut powder in my son&#x27;s sports drinks to cut down on all of the artificial and unnecessary ingredients in sports drinks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok definitely a must have for dehydration when not feeling well. The size is small but you need 2 tip for 1 cup of water. Will I buy again yes but I wouldn&#x27;t use dayle</li>
            <li> The very best coconut for mixing with water I have found.</li>
            <li> the product is fine but the amount you get is shocking. Very small container and it was only a little over half full!!!</li>
            <li> It actually tastes like coconut,others I have tried do not taste very good.</li>
            <li> I saw Montel Williams talking about this with Dr. Oz and decided to purchase it. I love it! It mixes well with smoothies and I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> The taste and quality is good!  However it does contain  Maltodextrin which is not a natural product.  The quantity is small only 7.9 oz which makes this is a super expensive product...while it came highly recommended wish I had paid attention to the cost per ounce!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey and that&#x27;s why I took off one star.  I went thru one container in a week.  I will order more because I feel like it hydrates me so much better than just water</li>
            <li> This is great for after or during a workout, quite a bit cheaper but taste very good and it puts the elecrolytes back into the body</li>
            <li> Note enough powder to justify the price. Although it&#x27;s a good product, the cost is not worth it for me to buy again.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy bottles of coconut water but got this instead and glad I did! Saved on plastic waste and I can add as much or little as I want for good coconut water taste</li>
            <li> great - a little goes a long way! i love that it&#x27;s  slightly sweet.</li>
