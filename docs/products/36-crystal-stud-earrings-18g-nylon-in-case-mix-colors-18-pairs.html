            <li>is great to me.</li>
            <li>All in all these types of earrings are great.</li>

            <li>I think the quality is good too.</li>
            <li>Nice variety of colors.</li>
            <li>I also love that I have a good amount of color options.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive ears but these babies felt awesome like they were not there.</li>
            <li>Fits my 5year old neice perfectly.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t want it to LOOK cheap!  </li>
            <li>Do like the bullet shaped backs, and you sure get plenty of those.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It received 2 stars cuz the earrings are cute... lost 3 for no backs</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got a ton more.</li>
            <li>For most people like me who buy them because they are the only things we can wear, they are the greatest thing ever.</li>
            <li>You have to think that if they are nylon they are a bit more easy to break.</li>
            <li>Sure, I know it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>Sure, they look kinda cheap in the container, but they look fine on.  </li>
            <li>but now it is not that easy.</li>
            <li>and I was told because there is no metal I was fine to wear them.</li>
            <li>Cheap Cheap Cheap - didn&#x27;t even include the backs and some earrings</li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve been a good fit for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive ears too....</li>
            <li>I was a huge lover of these, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever order them again since they&#x27;re so inconsistent.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>These fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>I used to purchase really cheap plastic studs in bulk, but they&#x27;re just...</li>
            <li>Eventually, I toss them because they&#x27;re cheap</li>
            <li>Colors are kind of pretty, but way too many clear stones.  </li>
            <li>But it hasn&#x27;t been too much of a problem for me -- I&#x27;ve always been able to get the backs on after taking them off.</li>
            <li>If you have any type of metal the electricity goes straight to that and will burn what ever it is touching.</li>
            <li>So I went to buy more of these since I loved them so much, but I received an EMPTY box.</li>
            <li>Over all, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>They are tiny and very easy to lose.</li>
            <li>Also, the posts are nice and long, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>THey are pretty and sparkly.</li>
            <li>Like to see more solid colors.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I was OK with that because I have multiple ear piercings...</li>
            <li>I fully expect to repurchase more of these in the future.   </li>
            <li>It is a very big deal to be able to wear earrings if you have to when you have surgery.</li>
            <li>but if the pierced ear hole is not wide then it should be fine.</li>
            <li>I have become severely allergic to pretty much everything.</li>
            <li>I have one daughter that can&#x27;t wear even the stainless steel earrings because they break her out.</li>
            <li>So I have hardly no options.</li>
            <li>Like some others have mentioned, the little back pieces tend to kind of... shrink?</li>
            <li>These provide a care-free option -- just plastic studs to keep my piercings open and clean (no nasty green stuff from leaving them in too long like with normal silver earrings!)</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any irritations so far!</li>
            <li>I can wear gold but only 14k or higher and not just plated.</li>
            <li>I usually buy these so that i have like 60 pairs or more</li>
            <li>But these actually look like real earrings, and they&#x27;re the correct gauge.  </li>
            <li>When I was young, I could wear anything</li>
            <li>The case it comes in is very small, miniature and compact so can be easily used for travel if you need to change colors.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome. Almost feels like there are no earrings in my ears. I have sensitive ears but these babies felt awesome like they were not there. THey are pretty and sparkly.</li>
            <li> The plastic made my ears get infected.</li>
            <li> Backs were a little hard to put on and sometimes came off while sleeping. Good product considering price paid for it.</li>
            <li> I have one daughter that can&#x27;t wear even the stainless steel earrings because they break her out. These she CAN wear!!! Easy to use and clean. NO Metal anywhere, great for people with allergies!!</li>
            <li> Ordered these and they came with NO BACKS!! Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Stem is to big,  hurt my ears. Unable to wear them.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of colors.</li>
            <li> The earrings themselves were great!!! Cant go wrong with nylon stems.  BUT THERE WERE NO BACKS!!!!REALLY??? How hard would have it to have put on those plastic backs?</li>
            <li> Stones have a great shine and stud is made of plastic which is great for allergic reactions to metals.  They are tiny and very easy to lose.</li>
            <li> Cheap Cheap Cheap - didn&#x27;t even include the backs and some earrings were missing all together. Would&#x27;ve been a good fit for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive ears too....</li>
            <li> Arrived just as they said, nylon studs with silicone backs!</li>
            <li> Hmmmm.....not that impressive.  Sure, I know it&#x27;s cheap but I don&#x27;t want it to LOOK cheap!  Do not care for the plastic stems on earrings; they are difficult for me to insert in my earlobes.  Do like the bullet shaped backs, and you sure get plenty of those.  Colors are kind of pretty, but way too many clear stones.  Like to see more solid colors.</li>
            <li> The earrings are quite small but still pretty...&lt;br /&gt;I was OK with that because I have multiple ear piercings... however I didn&#x27;t get a single back!! Grrrr. THAT, I was NOT OK with because I ended up having to use metal backs from earrings I was taking out due to &#x27;ear&#x27;itation!&lt;br /&gt;It received 2 stars cuz the earrings are cute... lost 3 for no backs n my &#x27;ear&#x27;itation!</li>
            <li> I like them except the studs are a little too long. Haven&#x27;t had any irritations so far!</li>
            <li> I wanted some inexpensive earrings for my 8-year-old, who just recently got her ears pierced.  These fit the bill.  The posts are nylon, so I don&#x27;t need to worry about metal sensitivity.  The backs are silicone, and you can snug them up against the ear.  Plus, unlike metal backs, you don&#x27;t need to worry about them getting loosened and falling out.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Fits my 5year old neice perfectly. She seems not to loose this one like her other earrings. May be a little small for adults but if the pierced ear hole is not wide then it should be fine. I think the quality is good too. Does not look tacky and is shiny. The case it comes in is very small, miniature and compact so can be easily used for travel if you need to change colors. Though mine does not latch close anymore. Stems are as described and not too long. Looks like some form of plastic. Over all, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love these. I often go a long time without changing my earrings, so I&#x27;m always worried about my piercings closing up if I don&#x27;t keep studs in my piercings. These provide a care-free option -- just plastic studs to keep my piercings open and clean (no nasty green stuff from leaving them in too long like with normal silver earrings!) I also love that I have a good amount of color options. Also, the posts are nice and long, which is a plus. Sure, they look kinda cheap in the container, but they look fine on.  I used to purchase really cheap plastic studs in bulk, but they&#x27;re just... blank little plastic things, and they were gauged slightly larger than normal earrings, so they were a bit troublesome to get in. But these actually look like real earrings, and they&#x27;re the correct gauge.  Like some others have mentioned, the little back pieces tend to kind of... shrink? after wearing them for a long time. But it hasn&#x27;t been too much of a problem for me -- I&#x27;ve always been able to get the backs on after taking them off. I&#x27;ve been wearing a couple pairs at a time and cleaning them periodically. Eventually, I toss them because they&#x27;re cheap and I&#x27;ve got a ton more. I fully expect to repurchase more of these in the future.   UPDATE: So I went to buy more of these since I loved them so much, but I received an EMPTY box. Like, literally just the plastic case with earring backs BUT NO EARRINGS inside -- not even the white piece that holds the earrings. And it appears a lot of other reviewers have received this item with missing pieces as well. I was a huge lover of these, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever order them again since they&#x27;re so inconsistent.</li>
            <li> I have seen many bad ratings for these types of earrings and I wanted to help the people who need them and the people who make them. I have 8 holes between both ears. I have become severely allergic to pretty much everything. When I was young, I could wear anything but now it is not that easy. I can wear gold but only 14k or higher and not just plated. This was too expensive and then I found these earrings.These Nylon earrings have been a life saver in a way to me. Yes sometimes they break and yes sometimes the stone falls out but to be able to wear earrings with out hurting or getting bad infections is great to me. I usually buy these so that i have like 60 pairs or more so then if something does happen, i have plenty. I do sleep in mine so that is extra stress on them. The earring backing does turn hard after so long but it is usable it is not like you have to throw them away. I will wear mine for months and months with no problems. The best was i was even able to wear these nylon earrings in surgery!! I had to have my thyroid removed and had 3 holes that i couldnt take the earring out or it would close. I showed the nurses and everyone what they looked like and I was told because there is no metal I was fine to wear them. If you have metal on, the operating table they told me has a electrical current that goes through you and the table. If you have any type of metal the electricity goes straight to that and will burn what ever it is touching. It is a very big deal to be able to wear earrings if you have to when you have surgery. All in all these types of earrings are great. You have to think that if they are nylon they are a bit more easy to break. For most people like me who buy them because they are the only things we can wear, they are the greatest thing ever. We now have choices for people who are allergic to almost everything. I am even allergic to medical grade metal that they use for hip replacements or screws and plates also allergic to donor bone. So I have hardly no options. It stinks and at least when i put these in all in the same color, they look really nice.</li>
            <li> Best earrings ever. We are so allergic to the studs and these give us no issues.</li>
            <li> I got this item and it did not include any of the backs. The description claimed the backs came with it and I got nothing. Total waste of money.</li>
