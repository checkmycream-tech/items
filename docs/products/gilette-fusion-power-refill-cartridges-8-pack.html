            <li>These blades are the greatest invention ever to be made!</li>

            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>what I was using, so I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li>Great deal.  </li>
            <li>These blades work great</li>
            <li>, my skin feels great every morning.</li>
            <li>Love em!!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>If you want to try a good product that is close to Fusion, try Dorco blades.  </li>
            <li>Really good experience with these razors</li>
            <li>price was too good to pass.</li>
            <li>the plaid is very nice last with me for very good time, with this price i got 8 of them it&#x60;s the best deal i saw......</li>
            <li>I bought these blades thinking I was getting a great deal (8) blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt; look forward to buying more!</li>
            <li>5 years ago it works amazing and</li>
            <li>I love it nice cheap price for 8 pack of razors  and nice close</li>
            <li>I love all the blades and you get a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li>most gillette products do...</li>
            <li>Gillette&#x27;s Fusion razors are truly a better way to shave.  </li>
            <li>She said it felt like it was taking off many layers if skin with the hair.</li>
            <li>Most bang for your buck pack.</li>
            <li>I got the Fusion ProGlide Power from a program run by Gilette and boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>Great dealer to work with, and blades arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>These work just fine with my Gillette Fusion Power vibrato shaving stick.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a smooth shave</li>
            <li>These cut so smooth that I might even buy a fusion car...</li>
            <li>These are a great blade, they seem to last longer</li>
            <li>These blades, while a bit pricier than most replacement cartridges, are well worth it.</li>
            <li>These are not the genuine Gillette brand.</li>
            <li>got it for cheap dirt price i always wanted.</li>
            <li>Bought two of these more reasonable than going to store!</li>
            <li>For a product that takes forever to look at in the stores due to the locked glass this was a great deal.</li>
            <li>I will recommend it with my friends, Worth for the money</li>
            <li>Love these blades, super sharp and always leave me razor burn free.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my boyfriend at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>These were VERY reasonable for the price.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Most stores only have the 12 pack</li>
            <li>but the shave is great and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>The refill blades are the exact same as the ones in the store but you get more for your money.  </li>
            <li>Overall I recommend these blades and you cannot find a better deal than on amazon.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Gillette Fusion blades since they first came on the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they are as good as the ones I&#x27;ve bought at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>It is the real deal</li>
            <li>These blades are NOT the real Fusion Power Blades.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The difference between these and the real ones is like day and night.</li>
            <li>They last, give you a very close and comfortable shave (particularly if you use the power function) and have the added bonus of a straight edge blade on the back of the cartridge to get the clean lines we&#x27;re all looking for.</li>
            <li>Out of soo many cheap products, this is the best cheapest product that not only lasts long but also feels amazing to the touch of skin minus all that dry and bloody aftershave...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It shaves so smooth and I can&#x27;t imagine myself using any other one out there.</li>
            <li>Perhaps they had &amp;#34;fallen off a truck.&amp;#34; The return address of the shipment was some warehouse in New Jersey.</li>
            <li>The blade quality is poor, and the shave is not as smooth as with the genuine blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not waste your money on them!</li>
            <li>they seem less smooth.</li>
            <li>What I received was pure, simple Fusion blades.</li>
            <li>Purchasing them through Amazon.com certainly is quite a lot cheaper then getting them from a local store.  </li>
            <li>However, this makes no significant difference when shaving - they work, they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li>the cartridges are good&amp;#62; I HAVE NOT USED THEM SO FAR.</li>
            <li>There was no issue with the razor itself, as my old blades - did not rattle.</li>
            <li>Not sure why it is so much cheaper, but it is really the same as the other ones that charge more.</li>
            <li>The only noticeable difference is that the store bought ones have a small white strip of some kind of &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; agent beneath the blade and</li>
            <li>This is not the first time that I buy Fusion Power blades, but this product was really in poor quality this time, however, it seems to be original.</li>
            <li>This new &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; set of razors are so noisy that I needed to go to the next room to shave so as not to wake the lady who works the midnight shift.</li>

            <li> Usually when Amazon has these types of products at such a reduced price, I&#x27;m a bit leary about the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, a bit pricey in comparison to other replacements</li>
            <li> I do not know how they sell this national brand product so much less than anyone else.</li>
            <li> but they are very expensive so finding this deal was exciting</li>
            <li> They are not genuine gilette blades.</li>
            <li> However, they came to me in plain box packaging instead of official Gillette boxes.  </li>
            <li> could be a poor copy.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the description ...should be ....1 pack / 8 cartridges instead of 8 packs.</li>
            <li> That makes me wary of the source.  </li>
            <li> They are not for the faint of heart.  </li>
            <li> The product works but ill never buy from this person again.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> You will be sorry.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the cartridges are good&amp;#62; I HAVE NOT USED THEM SO FAR. they are probably will work as well as they are designed</li>
            <li> These work just fine with my Gillette Fusion Power vibrato shaving stick. The only noticeable difference is that the store bought ones have a small white strip of some kind of &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; agent beneath the blade and these don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s just all orange. However, this makes no significant difference when shaving - they work, they&#x27;re cheap. WIN.</li>
            <li> I do not know how they sell this national brand product so much less than anyone else. It is the real deal Thanks!</li>
            <li> They are not genuine gilette blades. The blade quality is poor, and the shave is not as smooth as with the genuine blades. The skin also burns after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money on them!</li>
            <li> I love all the blades and you get a good clean shave.  Highly recommend.  If you are looking for a smooth shave this is the blade for you.</li>
            <li> I use Fusion blades on a routine basis.  Usually when Amazon has these types of products at such a reduced price, I&#x27;m a bit leary about the purchase.  These blades are NOT the real Fusion Power Blades.  These are a well duplicated evil twin!  These blades perform poorly at best.  I&#x27;d stay away from these if I were you.  If you want to try a good product that is close to Fusion, try Dorco blades.  They have a 6 blade head that performs great for the money.  But remember, they are not Fusion blades either.  Hope this helped...</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my boyfriend at a very reasonable price. I am used to the package being in english however it seems to be in a chinese or japanese writing....not that it will affect the quality of the product as I can&#x27;t find any distiguishing differences. I hope that they work as well as anticipated...most gillette products do...he loves the fusion line of razors</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t go dull really fast like many razors, took a while for them dull a little bit. Overall 5/5 stars!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t buy this for locally to the same price locally. Most stores only have the 12 pack but this price per unit beat all. Never thought there would be a day when blades cost $2.85 a piece but the shave is great and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> What I received was pure, simple Fusion blades. Completely disappointed. Also the invoice was making reference to &amp;#34;Power Fusion&amp;#34;. And that was all.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Gilette Fusion power refill cartridges on amazon.com because it is a lot cheaper than purchasing them from CVS/Walgreens.  The refill blades are the exact same as the ones in the store but you get more for your money.  I like these blades because they cut close and leave a film of lotion after each stroke.  I shave about 4-5 times a week and have to replace the blade after about 3-4 weeks. Overall I recommend these blades and you cannot find a better deal than on amazon.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  Gillette&#x27;s Fusion razors are truly a better way to shave.  It&#x27;s like an electric razor on a stick.</li>
            <li> i do have this one for long time even can&#x60;t remember probably 5 years ago it works amazing and the plaid is very nice last with me for very good time, with this price i got 8 of them it&#x60;s the best deal i saw......</li>
            <li> Not sure why it is so much cheaper, but it is really the same as the other ones that charge more. Just get this one. In my case (SF-CA) delivery was within 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> This is not the first time that I buy Fusion Power blades, but this product was really in poor quality this time, however, it seems to be original.</li>
            <li> These cut so smooth that I might even buy a fusion car...LOL These are a great blade, they seem to last longer&lt;br /&gt;than what I was using, so I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Great deal.  will deffinately buy again.  These blades work great but they are very expensive so finding this deal was exciting</li>
            <li> I love it nice cheap price for 8 pack of razors  and nice close shaves!&lt;br /&gt; look forward to buying more!</li>
            <li> It is very good Quality even if the label was in Korean.I will recommend it with my friends, Worth for the money</li>
            <li> These were VERY reasonable for the price.  Check out this seller when comparing price.  FUSION is Fusion, so the blades work the same as they would if you bought them at your local Drugstore.  Very satisfied and happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This may be the Asian version with Chinese characters all over the product, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the quality of them. The item was just as described for a fraction of the price of buying those with English writing on the package.</li>
            <li> These blades are truly Gillette ones.  However, they came to me in plain box packaging instead of official Gillette boxes.  That makes me wary of the source.  Perhaps they had &amp;#34;fallen off a truck.&amp;#34; The return address of the shipment was some warehouse in New Jersey.</li>
            <li> I run them across my face, and the hair disappears!  What else can you ask for?  Just don&#x27;t let your wife shave her legs with these.  They are not for the faint of heart.  She said it felt like it was taking off many layers if skin with the hair.</li>
            <li> Best shave yet! Most bang for your buck pack. Really good experience with these razors, my skin feels great every morning.</li>
            <li> I got the Fusion ProGlide Power from a program run by Gilette and boy am I glad I did. These blades, while a bit pricier than most replacement cartridges, are well worth it. They last, give you a very close and comfortable shave (particularly if you use the power function) and have the added bonus of a straight edge blade on the back of the cartridge to get the clean lines we&#x27;re all looking for. Like I said, a bit pricey in comparison to other replacements but you won&#x27;t regret your purchase. A+</li>
            <li> This razor is the best one in the world. It shaves so smooth and I can&#x27;t imagine myself using any other one out there. I will definitely stay with this product for life.</li>
            <li> For a product that takes forever to look at in the stores due to the locked glass this was a great deal. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these more reasonable than going to store! These blades are the greatest invention ever to be made!</li>
            <li> I bought these blades thinking I was getting a great deal (8) blades. Well, I got only (4) blades instead . The product works but ill never buy from this person again.</li>
            <li> Blades not very sharp, not to usual Fusion standards. I&#x27;ve already used 6 of 8 blades.&lt;br /&gt;Also, each cartridge rattled in the Power razor. There was no issue with the razor itself, as my old blades - did not rattle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they are as good as the ones I&#x27;ve bought at Walgreens. they seem less smooth. could be a poor copy.</li>

            <li> This new &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; set of razors are so noisy that I needed to go to the next room to shave so as not to wake the lady who works the midnight shift. I&#x27;ve gone back to the version without power and all&#x27;s well.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the description ...should be ....1 pack / 8 cartridges instead of 8 packs. I was negativly surpirsed when I receive it.</li>
            <li> What could I saw. Expensive yes but it cuts well. I like the blades. I have used this about six months now. Blades last for seven shaves with no pulling as long as you use a shaving cream.</li>
            <li> These are not the genuine Gillette brand. The difference between these and the real ones is like day and night. Do not order these. You will be sorry. They cut your face. I am returning them.</li>
            <li> got it for cheap dirt price i always wanted. even though i have some refills left, i had to buy it. price was too good to pass.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion blades since they first came on the market.  Purchasing them through Amazon.com certainly is quite a lot cheaper then getting them from a local store.  Great dealer to work with, and blades arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> Love these blades, super sharp and always leave me razor burn free. I used to get razor burn all over my neck, until i got these blades!! Love em!!</li>
