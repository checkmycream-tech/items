    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have had men blurt out that I&#x27;m beautiful</li>
            <li>a great deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this stuff and have seen good results.</li>
            <li>I have to say Liquid Trust is an incredible tool in most cases if used with good intentions.  </li>
            <li>But, honestly, I tend to think</li>
            <li>/&gt;Outfits like these are the reason to doubt an honest buying from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I have my own business and had plenty of opportunity to try it out to see if it would increase trust in clients and my own office staff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To each his own though.  </li>
            <li>Even alcohol is more effective than OXT in lowering defensive distrust.</li>
            <li>It helps them feel safe and connected.  </li>
            <li>Magic, often, if you know how to look for it.</li>
            <li>The studies were designed to help understand the role that OXT plays in pleasure, attachment, generosity and trust (see papers by Paul Zak for more info).</li>
            <li>And my kids behave better when I wear it also.</li>
            <li>but it makes my life easier on many days.</li>
            <li>So if you do purchase it make sure it&#x27;s for someone you dislike.</li>
            <li>was not in a hurry to make a snap judgment, however I found that it did not attract men or women sexually, but it did increase trust</li>
            <li>Ok he  still ask &amp;#34;what</li>
            <li>does not contorl more my cellphone(who</li>
            <li>.I can say that he trust me more and  hugs me more :).</li>
            <li>I had experience with this product before and love it.</li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s just enough effect to make it a really, really great placebo.</li>
            <li>I remember you could buy two of the one ounce for around $100 and receive another free.  </li>
            <li>Trust is just as important in those type clean relations.  </li>
            <li>I found men to be much more interested in visiting and maybe a fishing trip or whatever  --- basketball  </li>
            <li>The effect has been very good for work and personal relationships, it helped to open me up and be more outgoing.</li>
            <li>however I did find that many more women were friendly and very open, even on a first time meeting.  </li>
            <li>A much cheaper, scented pheramone that is around 7.00 works much better (pure instinct) scented oils.  </li>
            <li>It works well to help them calm and cope with stress.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>For me, I don&#x27;t care which, because it seems like fun.</li>
            <li>There is really no scent though which I guess is good.</li>
            <li>every review here that is anything other than a one star is probably someone from the company trying to make it seem their product is good....</li>
            <li>I will tell you right now, smells like alcohol ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trust is the first and most important first impression no matter whether the relationship is business or personal.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>First, the facts.</li>
            <li>Of course I didn&#x27;t buy that deal the first time.  </li>
            <li>A woman will not be interested in a man unless she trusts him.  </li>
            <li>I am married</li>
            <li>sure what happened what happened between old product and new.</li>
            <li>Try putting pure alcohol in an atomizer and spray it on.  </li>
            <li>My money&#x27;s on, that is pure toliet water inside this fancey bottle .</li>
            <li>Maybe these reactions are unusual, but that&#x27;s what happened to me.  </li>
            <li>The real test will be on a job interview.</li>
            <li>Placebo or real effect?</li>
            <li>This stuff works is really all I have to say.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as a sex attractant, but if you need someone to trust you, it works very well.</li>
            <li>This is a very debatable genre of products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>tested the stuff a variety of ways, and cannot say I really noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even using much more that I should have still provided no real effect.  </li>
            <li>it has really helped me .My</li>
            <li>Boyfriend is very jealous.</li>
            <li>but he is very sceptical.</li>
            <li>; do you really go to meet your friends&amp;#34; etc.</li>
            <li>Most wanted to stay around a little longer and visit more and open up more about conversations about any subject.  </li>
            <li>so I was not interested in attracting women for a sexual reason</li>
            <li>I get less hassle and sell more product on days I wear it, no lie.</li>
            <li>If you’re looking for a way for people to like you and trust you more, I’d suggest you try to be less of an a******.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>ran out of it this year and bought a new bottle (2014).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New</li>
            <li>First, it smells like rubbing alcohol, which it probably is, just put in a nice expensive bottle.</li>
            <li>and I notice a definite positive change in there behavior and sense of well being.  </li>
            <li>I tried it once so far</li>
            <li>Liquit Trust come in this classy bottle, has no auroma</li>
            <li>Ladies and gentlmen, do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I am a girl who works in retail with a lot of grumpy old men.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle several years ago - it really really worked.</li>
            <li>You won’t experience any effects from the oxytocin yourself, either, since it doesn’t readily absorb through skin and wouldn’t cross the blood-brain barrier even if it did.</li>
            <li>complete bs, DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
            <li>Oxytocin (OXT) is used to stimulate abortions and speed up labor, and it lasts only a few minutes in the body (see Wikepedia for verification and more info).</li>
            <li>Any normal man will like that interaction even if he isn&#x27;t just out to get anything and everything from women, which incidentally is not very moral in my book.  </li>
            <li>Bizarrely, the other chemicals included in the bottle will almost instantly kill the target, so the product is essentially useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And honestly, as far as social settings.</li>
            <li>He said people did seem to treat him a little better (he&#x27;s new and having some trouble).  </li>
            <li>You can barely detect any odor at all.  </li>
            <li>Since oxytocin is not a pheromone, LT only works when injected directly into target&#x27;s bloodstream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed nothing better or worse.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it provides much more than a &#x27;false&#x27; sense of protection.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a great review I found elsewhere: &amp;#34;“Liquid Trust” is a tiny, expensive bottle of body spray that contains oxytocin, designed to make other people trust you when they smell you.</li>
            <li>The thing that works about them is the social confidence one gets.</li>

            <li> The thing that works about them is the social confidence one gets.</li>

            <li> I have used Liquid Trust for over ten years or at least as long as I became aware of their existence.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps one day a pharmaceutical company will come up with a way to deliver a constant dosage of OXT to people who have trust-related disorders, but we&#x27;re a long way from that.</li>
            <li> (the old bottle had a slight flower scent).  </li>
            <li> Hard to say if it really works.</li>
            <li> Product was smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Trust is built by reading the other person&#x27;s facial expression, and by being physiologically relaxed.</li>
            <li> I suspect, if they are long haired yippie bippies who haven&#x27;t showered in two weeks, it might just be difficult to get any woman to trust them especially if the body odor is much stronger than the Liquid Trust.f</li>

            <li> I sprayed some on my middle-school aged child before he went to school.  </li>
            <li> My boss is rather distant, but on days I wear Liquid Trust he includes me in conversations and jokes that he doesn&#x27;t on days</li>
            <li> , I became ill with bronchitis which is RARE for me.  </li>
            <li> It doesn’t work in this way, since oxytocin is not very volatile</li>
            <li> Bottle was empty when delivered.</li>
            <li> Sports minded men always need to find other men who share in sports minded activities.  </li>
            <li> Due to the nature of my work where i communicate with 1000ds of people every day i can tell that it works....</li>
            <li> The nasal spray cited in the research papers only increases trust and generosity in the person who sprays it up their nose shortly before playing a money exchange game.</li>
            <li> I think some research needs to be done on possible negative effects.  </li>
            <li> This is really not worth the bottle it&#x27;s packaged in.  </li>
            <li> Just think the effect it has on other people!</li>
            <li> I sprayed a little on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> Was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> but I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> and I am surprised that some others have found the Liquid Trust to be useless.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> It says it is odorless but not true!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of less expensive ways to achieve  the same results.  </li>
            <li> The FDA would come down hard on anyone offering nonprescription OXT, which is why this company tells you to spray it on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Really expected some dramatic responses when I used this in a close group setting (coffee) but not even a beat of difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell when it wears off, but it seems some people do respond to it.  </li>
            <li> Guys, if you&#x27;re having a hard time picking up women, dont try pharemones, work on your personality and self-confidece.</li>
            <li> Subtle</li>
            <li> bottle absolutely smelled terrible, like animal urine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too expensive but a friend of mine swears by it</li>
            <li> I bought it for an \\&quot;honest\\&quot; purpose and it certainly failed to deliver any of the claims it was marketed for</li>
            <li> questionable as of the valuable of product as advertised..</li>
            <li> Like bad BO</li>
            <li> It stinks!</li>
            <li> But the effect on my mood was the worst.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too expensive but a friend of mine swears by it so I buy and use it.As they say hope springs eternal. Hard to say if it really works.I would try to find the same type of thing a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Did not do a thing. Was a waste of my money. Would not recommend to anyone at all. Should be taken off of site.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a little on my clothes.  Soon afterwards, I felt depressed.  The mood didn&#x27;t leave me for several days.  Also, that evening, I had some abdominal cramps similar to period cramps.  But the effect on my mood was the worst.  I think some research needs to be done on possible negative effects.  Maybe these reactions are unusual, but that&#x27;s what happened to me.  So beware.</li>
            <li> Liquid trust has worked well for our family.  I found out about oxytocin through the brain research done on bonding, attatchment with babies.  Our chilren were adopted as preschoolers. It works well to help them calm and cope with stress.  It helps them feel safe and connected.  They ask for liquid trust every day and I notice a definite positive change in there behavior and sense of well being.  It is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of less expensive ways to achieve  the same results.  Try putting pure alcohol in an atomizer and spray it on.  This is junk and does not work!</li>
            <li> I sprayed some on my middle-school aged child before he went to school.  He said people did seem to treat him a little better (he&#x27;s new and having some trouble).  You can barely detect any odor at all.  It&#x27;s hard to tell when it wears off, but it seems some people do respond to it.  I tried it once so far and my day went well.  The real test will be on a job interview.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Liquit Trust come in this classy bottle, has no auroma but I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> What can I say? The thing that works about them is the social confidence one gets. Placebo or real effect? For me, I don&#x27;t care which, because it seems like fun. But, honestly, I tend to think, there&#x27;s just enough effect to make it a really, really great placebo. Liquid Trust works as well as any of them, IMO. Magic, often, if you know how to look for it.</li>
            <li> I agree with all of the above. This is robbery of not only our money, but, also our time and effort .&lt;br /&gt;Now, to return it and the aggravation of doing it, plus the cost of shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Outfits like these are the reason to doubt an honest buying from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I think all products should be tested by Amazon before allowing them to be sold here to protect their clients (US).</li>
            <li> This stuff works is really all I have to say. When you spray it on yourself, and smell it, it gives you a euphoric feeling and frankly it gives you confidence. Just think the effect it has on other people! The effect has been very good for work and personal relationships, it helped to open me up and be more outgoing.</li>
            <li> Ladies and gentlmen, do not waste your money on this product. First, it smells like rubbing alcohol, which it probably is, just put in a nice expensive bottle. And honestly, as far as social settings. I&#x27;ve noticed nothing better or worse. Guys, if you&#x27;re having a hard time picking up women, dont try pharemones, work on your personality and self-confidece.</li>
            <li> Really expected some dramatic responses when I used this in a close group setting (coffee) but not even a beat of difference. There is really no scent though which I guess is good. Save your bucks though.</li>
            <li> First, the facts. Oxytocin (OXT) is used to stimulate abortions and speed up labor, and it lasts only a few minutes in the body (see Wikepedia for verification and more info). The nasal spray cited in the research papers only increases trust and generosity in the person who sprays it up their nose shortly before playing a money exchange game. Then it wears off. The FDA would come down hard on anyone offering nonprescription OXT, which is why this company tells you to spray it on your clothes. Trust is built by reading the other person&#x27;s facial expression, and by being physiologically relaxed. Even alcohol is more effective than OXT in lowering defensive distrust. The studies were designed to help understand the role that OXT plays in pleasure, attachment, generosity and trust (see papers by Paul Zak for more info). And don&#x27;t believe word-of-mouth \\&quot;evidence;\\&quot; placebo accounts for 25-75% of all subjective improvements in health. So why do people continue to buy ineffective products like this? Read Newberg&#x27;s [[ASIN:0743274970 Why We Believe What We Believe: Uncovering Our Biological Need for Meaning, Spirituality, and Truth]] or the belief books by Michael Shermer. Perhaps one day a pharmaceutical company will come up with a way to deliver a constant dosage of OXT to people who have trust-related disorders, but we&#x27;re a long way from that.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff and have seen good results. It doesn&#x27;t work as a sex attractant, but if you need someone to trust you, it works very well. I am a girl who works in retail with a lot of grumpy old men. I have had men blurt out that I&#x27;m beautiful (and I&#x27;m not), and hang out at the counter for several minutes telling me either their life story or everything that happened to them that day. My boss is rather distant, but on days I wear Liquid Trust he includes me in conversations and jokes that he doesn&#x27;t on days I don&#x27;t wear Liquid Trust. Women customers run their mouths too. I get less hassle and sell more product on days I wear it, no lie. And my kids behave better when I wear it also. It isn&#x27;t a cure-all but it makes my life easier on many days. I have had a 1 oz bottle for two years and I see no degradation of the ingredients. I am pricing my second bottle which is why I am at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle several years ago - it really really worked. Strangers would hug you, people tell you their secrets, everything.&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of it this year and bought a new bottle (2014).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New bottle absolutely smelled terrible, like animal urine. (the old bottle had a slight flower scent).  Didn&#x27;t work, gave me headaches.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what happened what happened between old product and new.</li>
            <li> This is a very debatable genre of products.&lt;br /&gt;I tested the stuff a variety of ways, and cannot say I really noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Who know&#x27;s and is anyone&#x27;s guess.  I have bought 2 bottles of this so called \\&quot;Trust\\&quot; Pheramone and I don&#x27;t think it provides much more than a &#x27;false&#x27; sense of protection.  I believe while you have it on, your confidence is stronger simply believing that you have something helping you.  I didn&#x27;t notice any diffence in the way people treated or responded to me.  Even using much more that I should have still provided no real effect.  A much cheaper, scented pheramone that is around 7.00 works much better (pure instinct) scented oils.  This is really not worth the bottle it&#x27;s packaged in.  I did by the way, do extensive research on this pheramone \\&quot;oxytocin\\&quot; before my purchase as I do not have money to toss away on such items.  I bought it for an \\&quot;honest\\&quot; purpose and it certainly failed to deliver any of the claims it was marketed for and I can only add that while it is unscented, it did have a slight chemical odor of some kind that I immediately responded to with negative respiratory effects and the next day of excessive use, I became ill with bronchitis which is RARE for me.  My dogs had the same respiratory reaction.  Not a product I ever plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> Alright so a friend bought this product for me as a gift. Hince, im untrusting. Anyways this is total bs. My money&#x27;s on, that is pure toliet water inside this fancey bottle . So if you do purchase it make sure it&#x27;s for someone you dislike. Then, tell them to spray it all over, including their face! Dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference.  In fact, I would like to have my money back.</li>
            <li> Subtle but I find it works well.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a great review I found elsewhere: &amp;#34;“Liquid Trust” is a tiny, expensive bottle of body spray that contains oxytocin, designed to make other people trust you when they smell you. It doesn’t work in this way, since oxytocin is not very volatile (i.e. it doesn’t go from liquid to gaseous phase and disperse in the air.) You won’t experience any effects from the oxytocin yourself, either, since it doesn’t readily absorb through skin and wouldn’t cross the blood-brain barrier even if it did. If you’re looking for a way for people to like you and trust you more, I’d suggest you try to be less of an a******.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have used Liquid Trust for over ten years or at least as long as I became aware of their existence.  I remember you could buy two of the one ounce for around $100 and receive another free.  Of course I didn&#x27;t buy that deal the first time.  I just bought one bottle and I have my own business and had plenty of opportunity to try it out to see if it would increase trust in clients and my own office staff.&lt;br /&gt;I was not in a hurry to make a snap judgment, however I found that it did not attract men or women sexually, but it did increase trust a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the clients already knew me and this gave a distinctive increase in the trust level and I could feel that trust.  Most wanted to stay around a little longer and visit more and open up more about conversations about any subject.  A woman will not be interested in a man unless she trusts him.  I am married so I was not interested in attracting women for a sexual reason however I did find that many more women were friendly and very open, even on a first time meeting.  Any normal man will like that interaction even if he isn&#x27;t just out to get anything and everything from women, which incidentally is not very moral in my book.  To each his own though.  We all answer for our mistakes so user beware in some cases.&lt;br /&gt;Trust is the first and most important first impression no matter whether the relationship is business or personal.  I found men to be much more interested in visiting and maybe a fishing trip or whatever  --- basketball  --- hike ---  canoeing.  Sports minded men always need to find other men who share in sports minded activities.  Trust is just as important in those type clean relations.  I have to say Liquid Trust is an incredible tool in most cases if used with good intentions.  It&#x27;s easier to trust someone who isn&#x27;t always looking at a woman&#x27;s crotch or breasts.&lt;br /&gt;No, I don&#x27;t work for the company and I am surprised that some others have found the Liquid Trust to be useless.  I suspect, if they are long haired yippie bippies who haven&#x27;t showered in two weeks, it might just be difficult to get any woman to trust them especially if the body odor is much stronger than the Liquid Trust.f they are long haired yippie bippies who haven&#x27;t showered in two weeks, it might just be difficult to get any woman to trust them especially if the body odor is much stronger than the Liquid Trust.</li>
            <li> Did nothing that it said it would. Waste of time and money. It also came with a description of the different scent products and how to wear them but it did not list the stuff I bought.</li>
            <li> it has really helped me .My Boyfriend is very jealous.Henever trust me.I have done everything...but he is very sceptical. Now i use liquid trust .just 2-3 spray before meeting.And he talks with me without be nervos.Ok he  still ask &amp;#34;what have you done all day&amp;#34; do you really go to meet your friends&amp;#34; etc. But he trust on my answers, he listen me. does not contorl more my cellphone(who has call me/who has i call) .I can say that he trust me more and  hugs me more :).</li>
            <li> It says it is odorless but not true! It stinks! Like bad BO</li>
            <li> I had experience with this product before and love it. Due to the nature of my work where i communicate with 1000ds of people every day i can tell that it works....</li>
            <li> Bottle was empty when delivered.</li>
            <li> Since oxytocin is not a pheromone, LT only works when injected directly into target&#x27;s bloodstream.  Bizarrely, the other chemicals included in the bottle will almost instantly kill the target, so the product is essentially useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, It did do what it promised: Mother and I have never been closer.  But I could have just used Windex and saved a bundle.</li>
            <li> Product was smaller than expected. questionable as of the valuable of product as advertised.. Not sure if I would buy again.</li>
            <li> every review here that is anything other than a one star is probably someone from the company trying to make it seem their product is good.... I will tell you right now, smells like alcohol ... in fact, the smell may confuse a POLICE OFFICER AT A SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT.... into thinking that you were drinking.... that is probably what it is, alcohol.... complete bs, DO NOT BUY THIS. No results, it repels.</li>
