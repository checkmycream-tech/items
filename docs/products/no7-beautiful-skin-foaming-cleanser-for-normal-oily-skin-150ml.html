            <li> Made my face breakout and I don&#x27;t see any real difference.</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin that is a little sensitive.  This cleanser takes off what little makeup I do wear and cleans my skin of oil and grime without stripping it.  My skin is so soft!  No redness, no greasy skin, and no breakouts either.  Light smell and it foams up great.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Dries out your face like you would not believe.  I will not buy this again nor would I ever recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so clean and soft!</li>
            <li> Took some getting use to but this gentle foaming cleanser is wonderful. No harshness and delightful clean smell. I have sensitive skin that was prone to breakouts. So far this product has cleansed my face and no breakouts. Just one pump is all I need to wash my face. Love this entire line of products that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter who lives in Las Vegas.  She loves it and it is perfect for her skin type.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> About this. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything. I think it honestly makes me break out more. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST cleanser I&#x27;ve ever had. Better than neutrogena, better than oil of okay, better than Clinique!!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 3 weeks. My skin looks amazing. My acne is GONE. I use this in combination with the No7 intense day and night cream. And it didn&#x27;t break the bank!!!</li>
            <li> I never break out but apparently Boots didn&#x27;t get the memo. After using this product, it dried out my skin so badly I broke out. Terrible! Would not recommend for anyone with combo skin.</li>
            <li> I like the product. The only issue is that it came without a cap.</li>
            <li> Liked the product did a great job getting my makeup off my face... Would refer to a friend</li>
            <li> I purchased this cleanser at Target. It removes my make up and leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft, never dry or irritated. Price is good and lasts a long time not like other foams that don&#x27;t seem to last.</li>
            <li> Light, non-greasy and thoroughly cleansing!  Deserves 10 stars but 5 stars are the maximum allowed.</li>
