            <li>/&gt;Still I knew if it was half as wonderful as it was then it would still be wonderful now.  </li>
            <li>It does smell nicely of roses, though.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a rose scented perfume.</li>
            <li>Tea Rose eau de toilette lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>si l&#x27;équilibre entre le thé vert et la rose était parfait.</li>
            <li>On sent plus le thé vert qui prend le dessus sur la rose et je recherchais vraiment un parfum rosé.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of Turkish or Indian &amp;#34;attar,&amp;#34; though to be truthful, it is a combination of rose attar and rose water.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a rose smell more prononced (?)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on too strong and fades nicely throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The shipping speed was outstanding.</li>

            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume ever.</li>
            <li>perfect perfume at a low price.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for unadulterated rose</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong fragrance, so just one spray (on my clothes) is more than sufficient for the day.  </li>
            <li>I would go really light with this perfume because it is potent and likes to linger.</li>
            <li>It came very quick and was exaclty what she wanted.  </li>
            <li>Have used Tea Rose for a number of  years and I always get positive reactions from people I see.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a scent that is easily over done, you do NOT need to bathe in this for the scent of roses to stay near you all ( or most of )</li>
            <li>Most PERFUMES don&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours on me.  </li>
            <li>what I described ( even though I described it perfectly as &amp;#34; a mid summer afternoon in the rose gardens at Ritter Park&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion the perfume smells like fresh roses and is useful for giving your bedding a romantic rose smell.</li>
            <li>She loves the smell of fresh cut roses and it&#x27;s why she loves this perfume.</li>
            <li>I would have give 5 stars if the balance between the green tea and the rose was better.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of old roses and this one fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>as she brushed passed (and more than one brush was intentional</li>
            <li>and everyone thought they were real roses (until they touched them of course)!</li>
            <li>I got this as a smaller size for travel, it´s my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I was more than pleasantly surprised when my order arrived and it was EXACTLY as it was back then.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a rose, it stays with you all day, and it&#x27;s very subtle and light.  </li>
            <li>thought to my self &amp;#34; No perfume can remain unchanged for 20 years, even my Old Spice isn&#x27;t exactly the same.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Scent is nice but very heavy.</li>
            <li>However, the product itself was a little disappointing -- smells very nice, but wears off more quickly than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive brands, including Dior, Lauren, Joy, etc.  </li>
            <li>The notes are kinda sharp so over spraying this stuff gave me a huge headache.</li>
            <li>Personally, I would prefer it in the bottle than on me as it is a bit to intense for my taste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at all the reviews that said it was dead on because unlike other rose scented products, this one has a chemical scent.</li>
            <li>I have worn this almost exclusively for so many years-but the last couple of bottles just do not seem to have the same odor, last as long or receive the compliments I used to receive (because it is not as noticeable, I guess.</li>
            <li>My wife put one small spritz on and the smell was noticeable many hours later without being overpowering, just a hint of roses</li>
            <li>Lovely scent, A little goes a long way, but sublime!</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to spray too much!</li>
            <li>So... the last time I smelled this perfume was over 20 years ago, and even though the young woman who introduced me to it</li>

            <li> So... the last time I smelled this perfume was over 20 years ago, and even though the young woman who introduced me to it and I are no longer together, as i was browsing Amazon there it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought to my self &amp;#34; No perfume can remain unchanged for 20 years, even my Old Spice isn&#x27;t exactly the same.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still I knew if it was half as wonderful as it was then it would still be wonderful now.  I was more than pleasantly surprised when my order arrived and it was EXACTLY as it was back then.  My wife put one small spritz on and the smell was noticeable many hours later without being overpowering, just a hint of roses as she brushed passed (and more than one brush was intentional I do believe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a scent that is easily over done, you do NOT need to bathe in this for the scent of roses to stay near you all ( or most of ) the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to explain it to her before it had arrived she rolled her eyes and called it a &amp;#34;grandma&amp;#34; perfume; when she sprayed it she called it wonderful and not at all what I described ( even though I described it perfectly as &amp;#34; a mid summer afternoon in the rose gardens at Ritter Park&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item has found a permanent home in my wish list.</li>
            <li> The shipping speed was outstanding. Have been looking for the scent of roses I remember as a child and this is it. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Scent is nice but very heavy.</li>
            <li> My package arrived incredibly quickly, much earlier than the scheduled date. The product was in good shape. However, the product itself was a little disappointing -- smells very nice, but wears off more quickly than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before. It does smell nicely of roses, though.</li>
            <li> One spritz goes a long way! In my opinion the perfume smells like fresh roses and is useful for giving your bedding a romantic rose smell. I would go really light with this perfume because it is potent and likes to linger. The notes are kinda sharp so over spraying this stuff gave me a huge headache. I bought one bottle and expect it to last me a really long time. I made a dozen arts and craft roses from coffee filters...gave it one spritz and everyone thought they were real roses (until they touched them of course)! Love it!</li>
            <li> This perfume is wonderful.  It smells like a rose, it stays with you all day, and it&#x27;s very subtle and light.  I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love it, smells just like roses.</li>
            <li> My mom always loved this perfume.  It came very quick and was exaclty what she wanted.  I&#x27;ve ordered this a few times and never had a problem with breakage or spillage.  Will order again for her.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like roses. I&#x27;m surprised at all the reviews that said it was dead on because unlike other rose scented products, this one has a chemical scent. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.  She always  smells like a rose.  It suits her perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have worn this almost exclusively for so many years-but the last couple of bottles just do not seem to have the same odor, last as long or receive the compliments I used to receive (because it is not as noticeable, I guess. Not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, A little goes a long way, but sublime!</li>
            <li> I ordered another parfume/oil that was supposed to smell like roses...it didn&#x27;t at all.  This actually does smell like roses, that sweet/sour smell and it&#x27;s great.  It doesn&#x27;t go on too strong and fades nicely throughout the day. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a rose scented perfume.</li>
            <li> Most PERFUMES don&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours on me.  Tea Rose eau de toilette lasts all day.  It&#x27;s a strong fragrance, so just one spray (on my clothes) is more than sufficient for the day.  I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive brands, including Dior, Lauren, Joy, etc.  I&#x27;ll stick with Tea Rose!!!!!  Just be careful not to spray too much!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume ever. She loves the smell of fresh cut roses and it&#x27;s why she loves this perfume. The travel size is perfect to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I like the smell a lot ! I would have give 5 stars if the balance between the green tea and the rose was better. YOu smeel too much the green tea. I was looking for a rose smell more prononced (?) but anyway, I mix it with another perfume and together they&#x27;re great !  perfect perfume at a low price. Reminds me a liiiittle bit of Chanel N°19, less flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Très bon parfum ! J&#x27;aurai mit 5 étoiles si l&#x27;équilibre entre le thé vert et la rose était parfait. On sent plus le thé vert qui prend le dessus sur la rose et je recherchais vraiment un parfum rosé. Peu importe, ça reste un très bon parfum qui se mixe parfaitement. Il me fait penser su Chanel N°19 en moins fleuri.</li>
            <li> I got this as a smaller size for travel, it´s my favorite scent. I would like an even smaller size for travel.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend, she loves it!</li>
            <li> Have used Tea Rose for a number of  years and I always get positive reactions from people I see.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for unadulterated rose perfume-- here it is! It is unmixed with anything else, so might seem somewhat heavy. It reminds me of Turkish or Indian &amp;#34;attar,&amp;#34; though to be truthful, it is a combination of rose attar and rose water. Personally, I would prefer it in the bottle than on me as it is a bit to intense for my taste. However, I would like to have it in my room and sniff it once in a while.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of old roses and this one fits the bill.  It is nice and soft, with no musky undertones, which I hate.  I love it.</li>
