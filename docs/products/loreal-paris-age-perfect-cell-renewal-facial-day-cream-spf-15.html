            <li>Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Moisturizer for night.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with product results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doing  a great job on my skin!</li>
            <li>and I feel great on my skin after putting it on.</li>
            <li>Smells great but seems to leave my skin oily feeling and shiny looking.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a remarkable difference in the appearance of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Always loved L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li>Good size jar arrived promptly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth but not oily cream</li>
            <li>I do think my skin looks better, but maybe it&#x27;s wishful thinking.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth and protects my face from the sun.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and moisturized</li>
            <li>One would think a light floral or better yet no scent would be more appropriate than the bitter, acidic scent given this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>However,after it dries, I must gently wipe my face with a damp cloth because when touching your face it rolls off like peeling skin.</li>
            <li>I love all the L&#x27;Oreal products for older women.  </li>
            <li>I tried the free sample at first</li>
            <li>It is a nice moisturizer but other than that I don&#x27;t see improvement in skin surface or reduction of fine lines.</li>
            <li>Works as posted, as good as the $109 moisterizer I previously used.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I was looking for....</li>
            <li>The lid mostly unscrewed and the seal sticker was not near its match.</li>
            <li>I am very particular about a product&#x27;s scent and find this to be offensive.  </li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>I also found the consistency to be that of a much heavier night cream.  </li>
            <li>Very oily.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing this particular formula again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much older</li>
            <li>Ok but doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good as sample I received, plus billed as cell renewal but materials only admit to hi grade sunscreen :(</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little out of budget for me but still worth it.</li>
            <li>This is very moisturizing, but the  oiliness actually  makes me  look older and emphasizes my wrinkles and dark circles.  </li>

            <li> I have been using this daily for the past two weeks.  I find no matter how little of the product I have applied, my face appears oily and shiny.  This is very moisturizing, but the  oiliness actually  makes me  look older and emphasizes my wrinkles and dark circles.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a remarkable difference in the appearance of wrinkles.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this particular formula again.</li>
            <li> I do think my skin looks better, but maybe it&#x27;s wishful thinking. However,after it dries, I must gently wipe my face with a damp cloth because when touching your face it rolls off like peeling skin. I found this aso happens with Olay.</li>
            <li> I love all the L&#x27;Oreal products for older women.  I&#x27;m much older then I look!</li>
            <li> Guess the star is for shipping... Despite a sticker that was located on the bottom of the package which says &amp;#34;New,&amp;#34; the package was previously opened. The package was damaged and the product seal had been damaged. It was quite obvious that the product had been opened and returned to the package. The lid mostly unscrewed and the seal sticker was not near its match. When I tried to remove the product, the lid pulled off and the face cream spilled out everywhere. There is quite a bit of dried face cream in the lid. Please see attached pictures.</li>
            <li> Works as posted, as good as the $109 moisterizer I previously used.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I was looking for.... thank you</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth and protects my face from the sun.</li>
            <li> I tried the free sample at first and I loved it. It&#x27;s very smooth but not oily cream and I feel great on my skin after putting it on. It&#x27;s a little out of budget for me but still worth it. I&#x27;m at my 40&#x27;s and my skin is dry. I use this in the morning and L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Moisturizer for night. I didn&#x27;t feel dry or oily all day and night.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product. I HATED it... It was so greasy and it stayed greasy for up to an hour afterward. There&#x27;s no way that you could wear this under makeup! It didn&#x27;t even seem that moisturizing... As soon as I took the product off, my skin was so parched! I would never buy this product.</li>
            <li> I hate to say it but it actually works.  I have tried 1000 other products but this one actually works</li>
            <li> Ok but doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good as sample I received, plus billed as cell renewal but materials only admit to hi grade sunscreen :(</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and moisturized</li>
            <li> Always loved L&#x27;Oreal products. This works very well.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with product results. It is a nice moisturizer but other than that I don&#x27;t see improvement in skin surface or reduction of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product. Too drying for my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great but seems to leave my skin oily feeling and shiny looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doing  a great job on my skin!</li>
            <li> I suppose I would have returned it had I thought about it sooner...I am very particular about a product&#x27;s scent and find this to be offensive.  One would think a light floral or better yet no scent would be more appropriate than the bitter, acidic scent given this moisturizer.  I also found the consistency to be that of a much heavier night cream.  Very oily.  I see no reason to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good size jar arrived promptly.Face cream</li>
