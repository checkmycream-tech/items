            <li>I love the size and how easy it is to transfer froma large perfume bottle!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this since I lost my original JC Penny Sephora purchase.</li>
            <li>I was excited to use this atomizer, I didn&#x27;t want to spend $25 on a travel-sized perfume.</li>
            <li>After doing some research, the Travalo seemed a good choice as an alternate spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>The item we received does not look like the image displayed, the one we received is more feminine looking, but he decided he can deal with that and says it works very well.</li>
            <li>Easy, no-mess filling, and it sprays much nicer than my original bottle.</li>
            <li>Simply is super practical to carry in any bag.</li>
            <li>This worked very well when I first picked up it, but then after a month or two, it began leaking at the top.</li>
            <li>This is easy to fill and very portable.</li>
            <li>Everyone was pretty excited about them.</li>
            <li>$5.00 Dlls its worth it.</li>
            <li>I purchased two of these and was able to fill one faster than the other, I think more because of the perfume bottles I was transferring from than the product itself.</li>
            <li>Refilling process is so simple and easy, plus, as it is promised Zero Leaks, which is true.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a short vacation and couldn&#x27;t go without my favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month, and it&#x27;s working exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>fill up the Travalo exactly as the instructions say.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>I bought a different brand (SOHO), and it is so much better.</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s only good for a week trip somewhere and not long term solution.</li>
            <li>:)))) ,,, i bought 3 colors ( silver .. golden .. pink )</li>
            <li>so I can have two separate scents and refill from large bottles at home.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>now i have large place in my bag</li>
            <li>Iam a Flight Attendant.</li>
            <li>the whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;iam gone for about 3-4 days a week..</li>
            <li>It was very misleading though that the description says one thing</li>
            <li>It can only be filled from another atomizer through a teeny hole in the bottom.  </li>
            <li>After hastily putting a tissue on my closed eye and rolling around the bathroom floor in agony for 6 minutes I was finally able to see again.</li>
            <li>The bottle drops nothing with a very sturdy quality of product.</li>
            <li>and I got a full spray of perfume directly in my left, contact covered, mascara and eyeliner made-up EYEBALL.</li>
            <li>I really like the whole sprayer to covered by the silver, but I received a bottle that was completely transparent.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to figure out how to get product out of the main bottle without a functioning sprayer nozzle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I live in S TX and keep it in my car, we get over 100 degree temps</li>
            <li>The EXACT SAME SIZE.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is amazingly easy to refill with a filler port akin to that of butane lighters there was very little fragrance loss</li>
            <li>He previously traveled with his full size cologne, when checking his bag it was not a problem but with a carry on it was.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the older (smaller) version in opaque colours</li>
            <li>Easy to use and small enough to keep in your pocket ir purse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy who travels frequently and needed something to transport cologne, but wouldn&#x27;t be so big as to get confiscated by the TSA in a carry-on.  </li>
            <li>The hole to fill the bottle is very small, same size as the stem on the full size perfume bottle itself.</li>

            <li> I was able to get my perfume in the bottle easily without spilling but after having it in my purse for a few months my perfume evaporated :(</li>
            <li> i only use around half of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I bought the silver version and expected the one in the picture, but got something else (silver too) but had flowery markings all over the case.</li>
            <li> After losing one full size bottle to TSA who are just doing their job I decided to buy it in a smaller size to the tune of very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent, hate the way the bottle sprays.  </li>
            <li> The atomizer slipped, my hand kept going down</li>
            <li> This little bugga works well.</li>
            <li> I lined up the stems and gave it a few pumps.</li>
            <li> I have a collection of perfume, but as it is the case for everyone bringing a whole bottle of perfume is such a annoying.</li>
            <li> &amp; I got it a few months ago!</li>
            <li> I bought this atomizer because I bought some refill for an expensive perfume, and the refill was way less expensive than buying it in an atomizer bottle and paying for the designer bottle.  </li>
            <li> Or at the very least put a WARNING label on the box.</li>
            <li> Having purchased another brand that totally failed within weeks, spilling cologne all over a bag in the process, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the method to fill it, but it worked, no problem.</li>
            <li> While I pumped my perfume into the atomizer, the rubber ring at the bottom where the nozzle of your perfume goes fell out and my perfume spilled out; the product was rendered useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m carrying expensive perfume in a very expensive purse</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Refills with no leaks. Atomizes well when sprayed.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a short vacation and couldn&#x27;t go without my favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to refill and use. I bought the silver version and expected the one in the picture, but got something else (silver too) but had flowery markings all over the case. Kind of girlish but whatever. Product works and no leaks so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Simply is super practical to carry in any bag. Easy to recharge and carry your favorite perfume. An excellent gift.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this since I lost my original JC Penny Sephora purchase.I love the size and how easy it is to transfer froma large perfume bottle!</li>
            <li> Iam a Flight Attendant. my wife bought it for me for xmas one year.. i love it, i dont have to carry the whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;iam gone for about 3-4 days a week.. i only use around half of the bottle.  its so easy to refill.  and for the price. $5.00 Dlls its worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought a big bottle of perfume.  Love the scent, hate the way the bottle sprays.  After doing some research, the Travalo seemed a good choice as an alternate spray bottle.  Easy, no-mess filling, and it sprays much nicer than my original bottle.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work with my Memento Mori but it worked with my Bleu de Chanel so I was happy about that, but the spray itself isn&#x27;t the best atomizer but it does it&#x27;s job,</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it says Travalo in the description, but what I received was a Tribal Sensation.  I am still giving this 3 stars because it does seem to be working out the same.  It was very misleading though that the description says one thing and then you receive another.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these and was able to fill one faster than the other, I think more because of the perfume bottles I was transferring from than the product itself. Delivers on it&#x27;s &#x27;no leak&#x27; promise. Would purchase additional.</li>
            <li> I bought this atomizer because I bought some refill for an expensive perfume, and the refill was way less expensive than buying it in an atomizer bottle and paying for the designer bottle.  I got this particular one because of the good reviews.  However, I can&#x27;t fill it from a regular bottle. It can only be filled from another atomizer through a teeny hole in the bottom.  I am disappointed. I have been looking forward to using this and can&#x27;t.  Also, It took almost two weeks for the product to reach me.  It didn&#x27;t leave the warehouse for 5 days.</li>
            <li> Really nice if you can fill it.  It can only fill from a bottle with a sprayer, and even then, only sometimes.  Once filled, looks very nice and doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> The hole to fill the bottle is very small, same size as the stem on the full size perfume bottle itself. The EXACT SAME SIZE. I lined up the stems and gave it a few pumps. Some of the perfumed leak out, not a big deal, so I re-aligned the stems to try it again. As did that I knelt so the bottles would be eye level so I could ensure proper alignment and BOOM. The atomizer slipped, my hand kept going down and I got a full spray of perfume directly in my left, contact covered, mascara and eyeliner made-up EYEBALL. After hastily putting a tissue on my closed eye and rolling around the bathroom floor in agony for 6 minutes I was finally able to see again. I wish they could make an adaptor to hold the alignment and shield mishaps like that. Or at the very least put a WARNING label on the box. *WEAR GLOVES AND PROTECTIVE EYE WEAR WHEN USING FILLING THIS PRODUCT*</li>
            <li> Perfect travel companion for cologne.  This gets thru security at the airport and lets me carry enough cologne to get me thru any length of travel.&lt;br /&gt;It has the ingenious pump method of filling, that has worked flawlessly and has shown no sign of leakage.  I have two of these so I can have two separate scents and refill from large bottles at home.&lt;br /&gt;Love the fudge.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel easy to use and worth the price to have a refillable container for my favorite perfumes and cologne. You can take more than one scent on your travels.</li>
            <li> Loved traveling with the Travalo. It was simple to fill and the perfect size to pack for my flight. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and can be taken in carry on luggage.</li>
            <li> Just as the other veviews have accurately stated, this thing doesnt leak at all and works wonderfully. Having purchased another brand that totally failed within weeks, spilling cologne all over a bag in the process, I was skeptical. I was wrong, its perfect and a great value. You cant go wrong...</li>
            <li> ...it did NOT look like the picture as presented.  I really like the whole sprayer to covered by the silver, but I received a bottle that was completely transparent.  It works.  It just doesn&#x27;t look like the picture.</li>
            <li> My husband travels, and with the sanctioned size by the airlines this product saves us money.  He previously traveled with his full size cologne, when checking his bag it was not a problem but with a carry on it was.  After losing one full size bottle to TSA who are just doing their job I decided to buy it in a smaller size to the tune of very expensive.  The Travalo is awesome; easy to refill after every trip and works great!</li>
            <li> This little bugga works well. I was skeptical of the method to fill it, but it worked, no problem. Just what you need for travel. Get a his and hers while at it. Mark in NY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who travels frequently and needed something to transport cologne, but wouldn&#x27;t be so big as to get confiscated by the TSA in a carry-on.  I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month, and it&#x27;s working exactly as advertised.  I&#x27;ve taken it on a couple of trips and it has neither leaked nor let any cologne evaporate.&lt;br /&gt;Helpful hint...fill up the Travalo exactly as the instructions say.  I didn&#x27;t think the advertised loading process would work very well, so I tried to modify the procedure and, well, it didn&#x27;t work so great.  Then, I did just what the instructions said and it worked perfectly.  Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;So far, it&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> First impressions are good. I chose this atomizer after readin reviews about some of the cheaper ones leaking and decided to splurge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bottle of cologne that the nozzle was was clogged on and this is allowing me to use the otherwise stagnant bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazingly easy to refill with a filler port akin to that of butane lighters there was very little fragrance loss and I didn&#x27;t have to figure out how to get product out of the main bottle without a functioning sprayer nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit feels well built and I&#x27;m planning on stashing it in my messenger bag for daily use refilling when necessary. I&#x27;ll make any updates as necessary and thinkni just found stickif stuffers for my cologne and perfume wearing friends.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!! I&#x27;ve had no problems with it! I&#x27;m carrying expensive perfume in a very expensive purse so quality is a must!</li>
            <li> Exactly what i wanted. Easy to use and small enough to keep in your pocket ir purse. I got one for my boyfriend and he uses it when he flies. Complies with TFC regulations</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son for his aftershave when he travels.  The item we received does not look like the image displayed, the one we received is more feminine looking, but he decided he can deal with that and says it works very well.</li>
            <li> No leaks for me yet &amp; I got it a few months ago! Does everything it says it does. Really easy to use/refill and convenient! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Bottom-fill action worked great and item was just as described.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great hold and excellent for travel. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> bought these for stockings for christmas.  They are perfect and work just as described.  Everyone was pretty excited about them.</li>
            <li> This travel perfume atomizer is the best on the market. It&#x27;s so easy to refill and NEVER leaks! I&#x27;ve traveled it with it....and it now lives in my purse. It&#x27;s the perfect size and so convenient. Trust me...you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!!</li>
            <li> Leaked when I took it on a trip. Have to keep it in Ziploc bag.</li>
            <li> This worked very well when I first picked up it, but then after a month or two, it began leaking at the top. I use CK-1 inside (that shouldn&#x27;t matter but what the heck).  Now it just sits in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Great item! I live in S TX and keep it in my car, we get over 100 degree temps so my car is easily hotter! This item still works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I prefer the older (smaller) version in opaque colours but this is good too. Just somewhat bulky for me personally. But it works perfectly and the price is excellent</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this atomizer, I didn&#x27;t want to spend $25 on a travel-sized perfume. While I pumped my perfume into the atomizer, the rubber ring at the bottom where the nozzle of your perfume goes fell out and my perfume spilled out; the product was rendered useless. I bought a different brand (SOHO), and it is so much better. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> This is easy to fill and very portable. It holds up great in a bag and does not break or spill in any way. Perfect for someone on the go or traveling that needs a little refresher.</li>
            <li> Bottle leaked during travel a bit.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item with a silver color. I have a collection of perfume, but as it is the case for everyone bringing a whole bottle of perfume is such a annoying. So as soon as I found this item with a great idea, I ordered it. I just received it today. OMG, perfect is the word that I have to use for this product. The product quality is amazing. Refilling process is so simple and easy, plus, as it is promised Zero Leaks, which is true. I didn&#x27;t drop any. The bottle drops nothing with a very sturdy quality of product. It also look expensive with a sophisticated design. I have to use it more for an extended period of time. Yet, I can feel a lot of confidence of mine for this product. I really appreciate this merchant and think about ordering a few for gifts for my family and friends.</li>
            <li> It does the job well enough and i have not noticed any leakage. Seems to be well made. ok ok</li>
            <li> Just as described. Once again, Amazon pulls through!</li>
            <li> At first I really liked this and thought it was great.  I was able to get my perfume in the bottle easily without spilling but after having it in my purse for a few months my perfume evaporated :( maybe it&#x27;s only good for a week trip somewhere and not long term solution.</li>
            <li> i love it, it&#x27;s very easy to use .. you can keep your favourite perfume wherever you go.. it was beneficial for me to keep it in my handbag without carrying extra weight while shopping or at work ... now i have large place in my bag :)))) ,,, i bought 3 colors ( silver .. golden .. pink ) they were all nice ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m happy with this purchase , and planning to buy more for me &amp; my sisters :)</li>
