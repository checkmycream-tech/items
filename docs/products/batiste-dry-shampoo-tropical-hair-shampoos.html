    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>I can go a couple of days between shampoos and my hair looks awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I gave it a try!  </li>
            <li>AWESOME!</li>
            <li>(hmmm, very pleasant scent)</li>
            <li>This product smelled good and worked great!</li>
            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>i just thought the product was not that great.</li>
            <li>I tried and liked both products, but neither product was perfect.  </li>
            <li>, I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>You bought me a couple more days of washing my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and works!</li>
            <li>and i love the product!...</li>
            <li>This product does the job effectively - absorbs the oil</li>
            <li>which I will add some of my own tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is nice (</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for me and works really well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s your turnoff, try the \\&quot;blush\\&quot; which has a light, pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>After I use this product, I can go in the clubhouse without my hat and my hair looks pretty good!  </li>
            <li>This product works just as well as Ojon and is way more cost effective.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews for Batiste and liked the price much better.  </li>
            <li>But I have to say that instead of being greasy my hair took on more of a nice sheen than greasy look.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have very, very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>had my first can not been faulty, customer service was exceptional!  &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>but more so the fact that 1 out of every 2 bottles had a faulty nozzle.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad I took the gamble.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with it, and will be buying this and the \\&quot;blush\\&quot; one again.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>But, as many of you know, the more you wash candy-colored hair the more it fades.</li>
            <li>You can always add more later.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I suppose    its no substitute for a shower, but it&#x27;ll do :)  </li>
            <li>Overall awesome product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I just used it to test it</li>
            <li>It will irritate and aggrivate your dandruff even more.</li>
            <li>both worked...but the price of the Batiste is a much better deal (no need to spend more if you don&#x27;t need to).</li>
            <li>I bought the blush scent which isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anything working better than this.  </li>
            <li>i used it in the morning and thought it was good at first.</li>
            <li>Not only is it cheap, it works great!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not going to say the smell is the most fantastic thing ever</li>
            <li>The only flaw is that it doesn&#x27;t smell as good, a spritz of hairspray fixes that promblem though!</li>
            <li>I can easily skip a day of shampooing.  </li>
            <li>the seller was fine and everything.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and this is great for me on day two or three to cover oily roots.</li>
            <li>I found the Weave Organic Root Stimulator hair freshener that eliminates odor and freshens hair, oil free, 4 oz at $4.99 at a beauty supply store that caters to African-American clientele.  </li>
            <li>I spray it lightly in my hair and in my hands that I rub through my scalp.  </li>
            <li>- Both Batiste Original and Blush leave my hair smelling like I have a strong product in, but it does not give me the clean feeling I get from the Rockaholic.</li>
            <li>I first discovered the Very Sexy dry shampoo and loved it</li>
            <li>I bought the Batiste original to see the difference between the two</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stand the smell of the original.  </li>
            <li>This seems to do the trick and my hair looks clean for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>my new order came quickly and included a travel size of the same product and a sample of moisturizer, very nice surprise!...</li>
            <li>product was shipped quickly and i was excited to try it...</li>
            <li>My hair is bright blue, and I like to keep it that way.</li>
            <li>However, I suspect I will stay true to this one because of the smell if nothing else.</li>
            <li>I have very greasy hair if I go more than one day without showering.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad or unbearable, just not my taste.  </li>
            <li>I will say that the smell doens&#x27;t seem to linger for long and that&#x27;s nice.  :)</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple of dry shampoos and this is by far the best for me.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly, and just as described.</li>
            <li>I seem to go through them quite quickly.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly, too.</li>
            <li>This was probably because both product suggest that a natural bristle brush be used after apply, and using this kind of brush on my fine hair really doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>it smells strong at first, but that fades right</li>
            <li>: my hair is fine, straight, and oily by the end of day 2.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>then with no problem, it makes my hair soft and seems to give it volume which is a welcome surprise...would be a definite 5 star experience</li>
            <li>It does go on powdery, but the powder brushes right out.</li>
            <li>Using a dry shampoo takes some getting used to, but I am so glad I can buy this brand from Amazon!</li>
            <li>&gt; pros: Great smell (better than the other batiste dry shampoos)  ~~lasts all day  </li>
            <li>this new spray can works fine</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly on it&#x27;s own; or can blow dry.  </li>
            <li>top front, left side, right side, and top back.  </li>
            <li>the new Suave dry shampoo works pretty good but use sparingly</li>
            <li>I will admit I was hesitant at first because of how inexpensive it was</li>
            <li>This is not only cheaper, it works much better than the others.</li>
            <li>Overall, Batiste is an OK product</li>
            <li>upon my first attempt to use the product, the spray nozzle stuck in the spray position and i had to pull it up to get it to stop spraying...</li>
            <li>The Batiste Blossom smells good but somewhat messy.  </li>
            <li>i got a very prompt response stating &#x27;sounds like you need a new Batiste right away at no charge!&#x27;...</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I followed a previous reviewer&#x27;s EXCELLENT instructions:&lt;br /&gt;1. spray through roots while slightly lifting and parting the hair, let it sit in hair for 3-5 minutes&lt;</li>
            <li>Smells great, but leaves white residue on my dark hair.  </li>
            <li>After using Tresemme, which made my hair even MORE greasy and oily after application, I tried this dry shampoo again.  </li>
            <li>This is an OK dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Compared to the other dry shampoos out there, Batiste is really a great deal.  </li>
            <li>It is such a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>and I have to wash it EVERY day or it looks very oily.  </li>
            <li>(I got the Tropical) and worked really well throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Hmmmm... come to think of it, this probably says more about the mental health of my husband than it does about this product.  </li>
            <li>and I was really nervous about purchasing it, but</li>
            <li>It really does work</li>
            <li>Then you really will need to wash your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked very well on my greasy blond hair.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this!</li>
            <li>i have very oily hair that has to be shampood every day</li>
            <li>The packaging looks like it&#x27;s from the 70s, so I was really hesitant to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare it to others that are on the market, but I don&#x27;t really think I have to experiment.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my scalp which is what really needs freshening.  </li>
            <li>Best to do it at least an hour before you go out, give the smell a little time to fade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after half an hour or so, my hair gets more oily than before.</li>
            <li>I have tried the TIGI Rockaholic dry shampoo, as well as the Batiste Original and Batiste Blush.  </li>
            <li>You do have to follow the directions and make sure that you let it sit on your hair a few minutes before brushing.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t something I normally do, but I didn&#x27;t have time to shower.</li>
            <li>With the Rockaholic I feel like I really washed my hair, but with the Batiste it makes me want to go back home and was it fast.</li>
            <li>When I asked the owner of the store if she had ever tried it, she told me that she didn&#x27;t, but that they have trouble keeping it on the shelves because it&#x27;s such a popular item.  </li>
            <li>It was a VERY busy day.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what I need, it&#x27;s an almost instant fix.  </li>
            <li>It actually drove him out of the bathroom a full 15 minutes after I was done spraying it and had left.</li>
            <li>By the way, I am extremely sensitive, and neither fragrance bothered me.</li>
            <li>I tried another much cheaper product (Tresemme brand) thinking I would get the same results.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY oily hair, and about 1/2 way through the 2nd day after a washing, it starts to look stringy and greasy.  </li>
            <li>then within a few hours at school it wore off or something because my hair no longer looked clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter who has dry yet very oily hair.  </li>
            <li>the third time i tried, the nozzle came completely off and product continued to spray all over my bathroom, completely out of control....</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that I straighten daily.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a week she already has little dry patches but they had become so irritated that they just became huge and out of control.  </li>
            <li>if a tiny bit chemical, at least is isn&#x27;t repulsively floral or baby powder) but strong.</li>
            <li>My hair has been so much healthier because I only have to blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li>Apparently, I wasn&#x27;t using enough!  </li>
            <li>The first few times I used this, it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>- Rockaholic really gets rid of all the oils on my scalp, literally breaking them down.</li>
            <li>This is my first can of any brand of dry shampoo, and I&#x27;ll buy 5 cans next time to cut down on shipping costs (maybe this will last me a year since I only use it once or twice a week).  </li>

            <li> i have very oily hair that has to be shampood every day</li>
            <li> The packaging looks like it&#x27;s from the 70s, so I was really hesitant to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare it to others that are on the market, but I don&#x27;t really think I have to experiment.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my scalp which is what really needs freshening.  </li>
            <li> Best to do it at least an hour before you go out, give the smell a little time to fade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after half an hour or so, my hair gets more oily than before.</li>
            <li> I have tried the TIGI Rockaholic dry shampoo, as well as the Batiste Original and Batiste Blush.  </li>
            <li> You do have to follow the directions and make sure that you let it sit on your hair a few minutes before brushing.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t something I normally do, but I didn&#x27;t have time to shower.</li>
            <li> With the Rockaholic I feel like I really washed my hair, but with the Batiste it makes me want to go back home and was it fast.</li>
            <li> When I asked the owner of the store if she had ever tried it, she told me that she didn&#x27;t, but that they have trouble keeping it on the shelves because it&#x27;s such a popular item.  </li>
            <li> It was a VERY busy day.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I need, it&#x27;s an almost instant fix.  </li>
            <li> It actually drove him out of the bathroom a full 15 minutes after I was done spraying it and had left.</li>
            <li> By the way, I am extremely sensitive, and neither fragrance bothered me.</li>
            <li> I tried another much cheaper product (Tresemme brand) thinking I would get the same results.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY oily hair, and about 1/2 way through the 2nd day after a washing, it starts to look stringy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> then within a few hours at school it wore off or something because my hair no longer looked clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has dry yet very oily hair.  </li>
            <li> the third time i tried, the nozzle came completely off and product continued to spray all over my bathroom, completely out of control....</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I straighten daily.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a week she already has little dry patches but they had become so irritated that they just became huge and out of control.  </li>
            <li> if a tiny bit chemical, at least is isn&#x27;t repulsively floral or baby powder) but strong.</li>
            <li> My hair has been so much healthier because I only have to blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li> Apparently, I wasn&#x27;t using enough!  </li>
            <li> The first few times I used this, it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> - Rockaholic really gets rid of all the oils on my scalp, literally breaking them down.</li>
            <li> This is my first can of any brand of dry shampoo, and I&#x27;ll buy 5 cans next time to cut down on shipping costs (maybe this will last me a year since I only use it once or twice a week).  </li>
            <li> I have very greasy hair and need to wash my hair everyday but then the ends get really dry.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for after golf when I have \\&quot;hat head\\&quot; and my hair is realy looking greasy and flat.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the smell was overpowering, and I thought the results were long lasting.</li>
            <li> It works well but use a light tough; otherwise your hair will be soaking wet.  </li>
            <li> so was surprised to see my very dark hair covered in white powder, though it did brush out.  </li>
            <li> I needed to use this spray 1/2 way through that 3rd day, in addition to a morning application, but this dry shampoo cam through like a champ!</li>
            <li> so I can skip one day of washing my hair as long as I put it in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;it&#x27;s like somebody dug up their dead grandmother who was buried wearing tons of old lady perfume.  </li>
            <li> have long thick brown hair, that gets greasy fast.</li>
            <li> The trick with this seems to be to spray on enough so that you see a little white foam on your hair and then brush it through your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other name brand dry shampoo sprays, and I am not going back.  </li>
            <li> so a dry shampoo is a necessity for me.</li>
            <li> TROPICAL Batiste Dry Shampoo:  </li>
            <li> If you intend to use shine or voluminizor, they don&#x27;t seem to work well with the dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this to anyone with oily, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I never used dry shampoo before, so I bought the \\&quot;tropical Batiste Spray\\&quot; ($6) and \\&quot;Oscar blandi Pronto powder\\&quot; ($11) dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Even with my dark red hair I don&#x27;t have a problem getting the powder to shake out and</li>

            <li> can...the little bit that i got in my hair (which was dirty at the time) seemed to have made a difference, but it was hard to know for sure...</li>

            <li> It was $8.99 for the bottle, so it&#x27;s cheaper on this site although I&#x27;m not sure what it would come to after shipping.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Having been a faithful Ojon Rub Out Dry Cleanser user for two years, I eventually got tired of the price but more so the fact that 1 out of every 2 bottles had a faulty nozzle. Because I have color treated hair, I try to only wash my hair 2-3 times a week so a dry shampoo is a necessity for me. I did a little research and read the reviews for Batiste. I will admit I was hesitant at first because of how inexpensive it was but I am so glad I took the gamble. This product works just as well as Ojon and is way more cost effective. Even with my dark red hair I don&#x27;t have a problem getting the powder to shake out and the smell is manageable (I&#x27;m not going to say the smell is the most fantastic thing ever but it&#x27;s really not THAT bad).</li>
            <li> Compared to the other dry shampoos out there, Batiste is really a great deal.  It does what it is supposed to do for a relatively low price and the \\&quot;tropical\\&quot; smells like coconuts.  I am extremely pleased with it, and will be buying this and the \\&quot;blush\\&quot; one again.  I have tried other name brand dry shampoo sprays, and I am not going back.  Batiste is totally reliable, and does what I need it to do!  The only reason why you shouldn&#x27;t get this \\&quot;tropical\\&quot; version is if you don&#x27;t like the smell of coconuts.  If that&#x27;s your turnoff, try the \\&quot;blush\\&quot; which has a light, pleasant fragrance.  By the way, I am extremely sensitive, and neither fragrance bothered me.</li>
            <li> This really works.  I have very fine hair and I have to wash it EVERY day or it looks very oily.  With this shampoo I can skip a day if I need to!  I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell but it&#x27;s not bad or unbearable, just not my taste.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is getting white powder in my hairbrush when I use it but I bought a spare brush just to use with this, problem solved.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to create body for my thin, oriental-like hair (saw this as a tip somewhere), and I like it.  In addition, it helps with oily hair at my temples.  The smell of the Tropical version is not bad---just different.  This is my first can of any brand of dry shampoo, and I&#x27;ll buy 5 cans next time to cut down on shipping costs (maybe this will last me a year since I only use it once or twice a week).  Also, I have not had any problems with the nozzle clogging, etc.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product after being disappointed by the Rockaholic dry shampoo, it wouldn&#x27;t spray after a few uses. This one way outshines that product. The only flaw is that it doesn&#x27;t smell as good, a spritz of hairspray fixes that promblem though! Will definitly keep using this product!</li>
            <li> I have very greasy hair and need to wash my hair everyday but then the ends get really dry.  I first discovered the Very Sexy dry shampoo and loved it but it is like $15 for a bottle that you go through in 2 weeks.  Read the reviews for Batiste and liked the price much better.  I just got it in the mail and have used it twice, I absolutely love it!  It smells great (I got the Tropical) and worked really well throughout the day.  I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Smells great, but leaves white residue on my dark hair.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well for me as Pfffft from Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I have very, very fine hair.  My hair gets oily around my face and bangs.  If I wash my hair in the morning, by afternoon my bangs are already looking oily and stuck together.  I bought this for after golf when I have \\&quot;hat head\\&quot; and my hair is realy looking greasy and flat. After I use this product, I can go in the clubhouse without my hat and my hair looks pretty good!  This product smelled good and worked great! Plus the can is small enough so I can put it in my purse. I didn&#x27;t think the smell was overpowering, and I thought the results were long lasting.</li>
            <li> TROPICAL Batiste Dry Shampoo:  This product does the job effectively - absorbs the oil so I can skip one day of washing my hair as long as I put it in a ponytail.  Unfortunately, my husband freaked out over the smell.  It actually drove him out of the bathroom a full 15 minutes after I was done spraying it and had left. Did you catch that???  The SMELL actually drove a MAN out of the BATHROOM.  He said (and this is a quote) \\&quot;it&#x27;s like somebody dug up their dead grandmother who was buried wearing tons of old lady perfume.  Yeah, it&#x27;s nasty old lady perfume with an essence of decay.\\&quot; Hmmmm... come to think of it, this probably says more about the mental health of my husband than it does about this product.  Anyway, I used it once and threw it away due to the scent - I didn&#x27;t think I could stomach any more horrific \\&quot;smell\\&quot; comparisons from the hubby.  Personally, I didn&#x27;t think it was that bad, but that may be due to my sense of smell being destroyed by allergies. Consider yourself warned.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I need, it&#x27;s an almost instant fix.  Some people complained about the smell and I was really nervous about purchasing it, but I gave it a shot and I actually don&#x27;t mind the smell at all- I even like it a little.  I bought the Batiste original to see the difference between the two and I can&#x27;t stand the smell of the original.  Definitely go with the Tropical!  There&#x27;s no difference aside from the terrible smell.  I will say that the smell doens&#x27;t seem to linger for long and that&#x27;s nice.  :)</li>
            <li> My hair is bright blue, and I like to keep it that way. But, as many of you know, the more you wash candy-colored hair the more it fades. This stuff is great! It really does work: my hair is fine, straight, and oily by the end of day 2. I put it in on the morning of day 3 and it&#x27;s like I just stepped out of the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I followed a previous reviewer&#x27;s EXCELLENT instructions:&lt;br /&gt;1. spray through roots while slightly lifting and parting the hair, let it sit in hair for 3-5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;2. rake fingers thru hair blending it in from roots to tip&lt;br /&gt;3. take a bristle brush and comb thru to continue blending any that is left&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To which I will add some of my own tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Always start out with much less than you think you need. You can always add more later.&lt;br /&gt;5. It will only work once, maybe twice. Then you really will need to wash your hair.&lt;br /&gt;6. The smell is nice (if a tiny bit chemical, at least is isn&#x27;t repulsively floral or baby powder) but strong. Best to do it at least an hour before you go out, give the smell a little time to fade.&lt;br /&gt;7. Does not mix well with other products. If you intend to use shine or voluminizor, they don&#x27;t seem to work well with the dry shampoo. I use very few products on my hair and that seems to be the trick to making this stuff work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I haven&#x27;t tried any other dry shampoo products yet but I have one in the wings and I will be comparing them once I do. However, I suspect I will stay true to this one because of the smell if nothing else.</li>
            <li> When I first spray it on my hair, my head feels cold. At the begining, it sort of make my hair less oily feeling. But after half an hour or so, my hair gets more oily than before. And since you would spray gray powder out from the can. The powder would sit everywhere, very messy. I don&#x27;t like it at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It worked very well on my greasy blond hair. I&#x27;ve tried Oscar Blandi, which I hated, and Ojon, which worked okay, but smelled terrible. This is not only cheaper, it works much better than the others.</li>
            <li> I tried another much cheaper product (Tresemme brand) thinking I would get the same results.  WRONG!  After using Tresemme, which made my hair even MORE greasy and oily after application, I tried this dry shampoo again.  I LOVE IT!  It is such a huge difference.  I can easily skip a day of shampooing.  I have not tried two days, but I may build up to it.  Using a dry shampoo takes some getting used to, but I am so glad I can buy this brand from Amazon!</li>
            <li> the seller was fine and everything. arrived quickly, and just as described. i just thought the product was not that great. i used it in the morning and thought it was good at first. then within a few hours at school it wore off or something because my hair no longer looked clean.</li>
            <li> &gt; pros: Great smell (better than the other batiste dry shampoos)  ~~lasts all day  ~~Actually does what it should... gets rid of the greasy feeling of dirty hair    &gt; cons: White residue can take a while to brush out if you have dark hair like me. BUT it does fade, just keep brushing until its gone.  ~~can make hair feel a little dry where you apply it, but that&#x27;s the trade off for not looking like bum I suppose    its no substitute for a shower, but it&#x27;ll do :)  Overall awesome product!</li>
            <li> This is an OK dry shampoo. I have tried the TIGI Rockaholic dry shampoo, as well as the Batiste Original and Batiste Blush.  - Both Batiste Original and Blush leave my hair smelling like I have a strong product in, but it does not give me the clean feeling I get from the Rockaholic. With the Rockaholic I feel like I really washed my hair, but with the Batiste it makes me want to go back home and was it fast. Not a clean feeling.  - Rockaholic really gets rid of all the oils on my scalp, literally breaking them down. Because of this I also get a lot of volume on my roots. This did not happen with Batiste.  Overall, Batiste is an OK product but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase. (On the other hand, Rockaholic only lasted me for a month because the dispenser tends to get clogged or waste (?) some product). I&#x27;ve only had the Batiste spray for 2 weeks so I can&#x27;t evaluate it on the quality of the dispenser/packaging yet.  Hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of dry shampoos and this is by far the best for me. Not only is it cheap, it works great! I can go a couple of days between shampoos and my hair looks awesome. It actually gives it tons of volume as well. It does go on powdery, but the powder brushes right out. My hair has been so much healthier because I only have to blow dry and flat iron every couple of days versus every day.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and this is great for me on day two or three to cover oily roots.</li>
            <li> You have to try it to believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah it smells strong at first, but that fades right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long thick brown hair, that gets greasy fast. I love this stuff, I just used it to test it and it worked! Thank you Batiste You bought me a couple more days of washing my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and works!</li>
            <li> I have very greasy hair if I go more than one day without showering.  When I spray my hair with this product, it literally gets rid of the grease.  It won&#x27;t replace a shower, but it definitely helps!  I highly reccommend this!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has dry yet very oily hair.  She needs to wash her hair every day but that is supposedly bad so we decided to buy the Batiste.  After using it for a week she already has little dry patches but they had become so irritated that they just became huge and out of control.  Her hair became very dry and dull looking.  We stopped using it and have been washing her hair again with dandruff shampoo.  We have it back under control.  I do not recommend this to anyone with oily, dry hair.  It will irritate and aggrivate your dandruff even more.</li>
            <li> product was shipped quickly and i was excited to try it...upon my first attempt to use the product, the spray nozzle stuck in the spray position and i had to pull it up to get it to stop spraying...(hmmm, very pleasant scent)...i tried again, with the same result...the third time i tried, the nozzle came completely off and product continued to spray all over my bathroom, completely out of control....i had to hurry and smother the can inside a grocery bag that was in the garbage can...the little bit that i got in my hair (which was dirty at the time) seemed to have made a difference, but it was hard to know for sure...i sent an email to the the seller relaying my experience and asking what they could do for me...i got a very prompt response stating &#x27;sounds like you need a new Batiste right away at no charge!&#x27;...my new order came quickly and included a travel size of the same product and a sample of moisturizer, very nice surprise!...this new spray can works fine and i love the product!...i have very oily hair that has to be shampood every day, now i can skip a day now and then with no problem, it makes my hair soft and seems to give it volume which is a welcome surprise...would be a definite 5 star experience had my first can not been faulty, customer service was exceptional!  &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I never used dry shampoo before, so I bought the \\&quot;tropical Batiste Spray\\&quot; ($6) and \\&quot;Oscar blandi Pronto powder\\&quot; ($11) dry shampoo.  My hair would become greasy about 5 hours after washing it, so I wanted something to use while at work about halfway between my shift.  I tried and liked both products, but neither product was perfect.  I have very fine hair and when I applied either product my hair would become staticky. This was probably because both product suggest that a natural bristle brush be used after apply, and using this kind of brush on my fine hair really doesn&#x27;t work.  But I have to say that instead of being greasy my hair took on more of a nice sheen than greasy look. I would definitly recommend either product..both worked...but the price of the Batiste is a much better deal (no need to spend more if you don&#x27;t need to).</li>
            <li> The packaging looks like it&#x27;s from the 70s, so I was really hesitant to purchase this product.  I&#x27;m so happy that I gave it a try!  I have naturally curly hair that I straighten daily.  My hair was getting dried out from the constant washing and ironing so I tried washing my hair every other day.  The result, extremely greasy hair!  I tried baby powder but that didn&#x27;t work too well.  This product is perfect for me and works really well on my hair.  You do have to follow the directions and make sure that you let it sit on your hair a few minutes before brushing.  This step is key.  I have very dark hair and I didn&#x27;t see any white residue.  It took away the grease and even left my hair with a bit of volume.  I bought the blush scent which isn&#x27;t my favorite but it&#x27;s not overpowering.  Smells like baby powder.  Next time I will try the tropical scent.      It was a little hard to find in stores but I did find it a local \\&quot;beauty store\\&quot; not a chain.  It was $8.99 for the bottle, so it&#x27;s cheaper on this site although I&#x27;m not sure what it would come to after shipping.  When I asked the owner of the store if she had ever tried it, she told me that she didn&#x27;t, but that they have trouble keeping it on the shelves because it&#x27;s such a popular item.  I can believe it!      I haven&#x27;t tried other dry shampoos so I can&#x27;t compare it to others that are on the market, but I don&#x27;t really think I have to experiment.  I can&#x27;t imagine anything working better than this.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The Batiste Blossom smells good but somewhat messy.  I didn&#x27;t know it was white powder so was surprised to see my very dark hair covered in white powder, though it did brush out.  Didn&#x27;t do much for my scalp which is what really needs freshening.  Expensive for what you get.  I found the Weave Organic Root Stimulator hair freshener that eliminates odor and freshens hair, oil free, 4 oz at $4.99 at a beauty supply store that caters to African-American clientele.  It&#x27;s non-aerosol.  I spray it lightly in my hair and in my hands that I rub through my scalp.  It dries pretty quickly on it&#x27;s own; or can blow dry.  It works well but use a light tough; otherwise your hair will be soaking wet.  Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s hair powder is AWFUL and very very expensive -- do not buy!    P.S. the new Suave dry shampoo works pretty good but use sparingly otherwise will get that gunky feeling on your hair (5/6/2011)</li>
            <li> The first few times I used this, it didn&#x27;t work.  But that is because I read the review that stated it made hair stiff and then another recommending that you only use a little.  Apparently, I wasn&#x27;t using enough!  I have VERY oily hair, and about 1/2 way through the 2nd day after a washing, it starts to look stringy and greasy.  Yuck!  The trick with this seems to be to spray on enough so that you see a little white foam on your hair and then brush it through your hair.  I do 4 sections:  top front, left side, right side, and top back.  This seems to do the trick and my hair looks clean for the rest of the day. I actually went a 3rd day without washing my hair once using this spray! This isn&#x27;t something I normally do, but I didn&#x27;t have time to shower. It was a VERY busy day. I needed to use this spray 1/2 way through that 3rd day, in addition to a morning application, but this dry shampoo cam through like a champ! AWESOME! This is the only thing that works for me and I am so grateful to have found it. I have no problems with stiffness, or anything. The one drawback is that this bottle is small. I seem to go through them quite quickly. But, ordering them in packs of 6 is a way to save a little bit of money. They arrived quickly, too.</li>
