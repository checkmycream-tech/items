    <ol>
            <li>This looked like an awesome color</li>
            <li>So I learned to color hair from my best friend, Trea, who taught me well.</li>
            <li>If your not looking for a very bright color I would recommend this, but if you want to make a statement find another color.</li>
            <li>just incredibly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, and very easy to use!</li>
            <li>and i wish i purchased more at the awesome price i received it at!</li>
            <li>so I do my own color with Feria!</li>
            <li>Loved the color but 1 time with this product.</li>
            <li>good quality...doesn&#x27;t harm my hair...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use Loreal colors (or Wella, if you&#x27;re doing the beauty supply thing) unless your hair is in good</li>
            <li>This color looks nice on medium brown hair.  </li>

            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The color was very bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li>perfect for those of you who want brown and red hair!</li>

            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Chocolate Cherry for about 2 years, and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I Love it...</li>
            <li>Every one won&#x27;t get the same results, but mines was perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>I love  the color.  </li>
            <li>I followed directions to the letter and at first it really looked great!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Then the color looks really bright red.</li>
            <li>I used Chocolate Cherry back when it went by that name and loved it.</li>
            <li>After about a month the color looks very dreary and needs refreshing.</li>
            <li>Full complete grey coverage; beautiful color; many compliments received throughout the years and years I have been using this shade.</li>
            <li>I love this color so much.</li>
            <li>The dye was a little runny (had to clean up the floor and sink afterwards because of accidental drops) but it kind of helped cover my hair more quickly - I have medium length hair</li>
            <li>Because I used the tortoiseshell brown of this brand before using this color (which is a great color, but harsh, you have to WANT your hair lightened and a bit thrashed (for volume</li>
            <li>I get more compliments now than I did when I had my hair professionally colored, and it&#x27;s about 1/10 of the cost.  </li>
            <li>not only does the color look good right away, my hair is so much softer after switching to this.</li>
            <li>the color was bright pink!</li>
            <li>, right?)</li>
            <li>I used to use and love Feria True Red.</li>
            <li>I do, however, think this color is better suited for people who already have dark hair because it might darken your hair too much if your hair color is more light/medium brown or reddish/auburn.</li>
            <li>It faded very fast though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve died my hair for more than ten years</li>
            <li>and this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever been compelled to write.</li>
            <li>For the last year or so I&#x27;ve been using a 10-minute dye on the market, which I love but couldn&#x27;t find at the store.</li>
            <li>would say this is a no fail product, except that hair color depends</li>
            <li>nothing but positive.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris Feria Hair Color, 36 Dark Burgundy Brown/Chocolate Cherry Was very easy to implicate and the color is neat in my wife hair</li>
            <li>so I went through with the whole process.</li>
            <li>I used to use this color all the time and really like the shade.</li>
            <li>and *absolutely* on what you&#x27;ve got on your head and what you&#x27;ve done to it, and</li>
            <li>The whole &amp;#34;shimmering&amp;#34; thing that Feria/Loreal is hyping is for real.</li>
            <li>Inside light, its dark with a hint of red.. outside light there&#x27;s a nice red shine.</li>
            <li>Last night was the first time I used any L&#x27;Oreal Paris Feria color and so far I really like the product and results!</li>
            <li>I have been complimented on the color quite a few times, will continue to use :)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a new thing called \\&quot;color boost\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>I loved the dramatic contrast.</li>
            <li>I use the provided conditioner once every week to 10 days between coloring, and find that my hair stays very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>great, subtle, deep red color.  </li>
            <li>I picked up a bottle of Feria True Red again and it is TOTALLY different.</li>
            <li>I used this color and although it wasn&#x27;t as dark red as it is in the photo, I love how my hair came out.</li>
            <li>My hair is now clown fuchsia, not even red, and very dry/dull.</li>
            <li>It looks natural on me</li>
            <li>It was a mix of brownish red, like a real chocolate cherry, not burgundy.</li>
            <li>It made my dark brown hair a reddish brown shade which was really pretty.</li>
            <li>The red just doesn&#x27;t show naturally even though I let it saturated in my hair for1 hour</li>
            <li>This color looks like a subtle red-brown until you step in the sun or under a light.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s going to take a VERY long time to get my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend it to anyone who wants dark brown with red highlights.</li>
            <li>The color last far a long time.</li>
            <li>color was a little darker than I expected, but it was very pretty.</li>

            <li> By the way, before I used this, my hair was a medium honey blonde, but my natural color is dark brown</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair naturally, and have to color my hair once every 6-8 weeks.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been this snob about box color for 20 years, but I recently had twins, and there&#x27;s Amazon, my go-to for every single thing</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would especially recommend this color to people who have had highlights within the last year or so and had them sort of disappear under other colors.</li>
            <li> long so it&#x27;s not growing like it was.</li>
            <li> However, the red highlights only reflect when you&#x27;re under sunlight, otherwise people will think you have black hair.</li>
            <li> I added it to the other ingredients and just the tiniest drop fell onto my white sink and stained it immediately.</li>
            <li> had some grey roots, and medium brown, to cherry red, to very very black as the cauldron of</li>
            <li> hell bottom half of my long hair (dyed blue black, now there&#x27;s a color that works, but.....</li>
            <li> I intended to use this to cover my green hair (because brown dyes with red tints will cancel out green), yes that worked really well, no more green hair.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair about once every other year for years.</li>
            <li> In the sun, it looks reddish too, and extremely shiny.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Even when I was little I was pretty obsessed with hair.</li>
            <li> I mean carrot red.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after about 5 washings it has faded out and is pretty dull looking.</li>
            <li> Suggestion for those who say that it dries out their hair just use a little coconut oil along with the conditioner provided with the product.</li>
            <li> and it washes out little by little in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also it dried out my hair and damaged it some.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No messy cleanups though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is harsh on your hair, so know that.</li>
            <li> The roots usually look slightly redder than the remainder of my hair bit evens out in about a week.</li>
            <li> Just a little false advertising, like all other haisr dyes, never trust the picture on the box.</li>
            <li> This has been my &amp;#34;go-to color&amp;#34; for the past five months.</li>
            <li> It is so expensive to go to a salon</li>
            <li> A friend suggested coloring it myself, and as nervous as I was about it, I figured the worst that could happen is</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> perfect for those of you who want brown and red hair!</li>
            <li> I used Chocolate Cherry back when it went by that name and loved it. This #36 is way too red. I mean carrot red. I had bought three because I hadn&#x27;t found it locally but now I see that Loreal changed this to having way too much red in it. My hair was orange! Would not recommend it to anyone who wants dark brown with red highlights. This will give you red hair. YUK!</li>
            <li> I dyed the tips of my bleach blonde hair to get a two-toned look. The color was very bright and vibrant. I loved the dramatic contrast. Unfortunately after about 5 washings it has faded out and is pretty dull looking. If your not looking for a very bright color I would recommend this, but if you want to make a statement find another color.</li>
            <li> This is one that I keep re-ordering for my mother and sisters. Both use a variety of colors for their hair and always buy Loreal.</li>
            <li> I love this hair color and i wish i purchased more at the awesome price i received it at!</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair this color. Loved the color but 1 time with this product. The product burned my hair and it fell out!!! I have been dying my hair about once every other year for years. I DO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS!!! My hair fell out in several areas and I am still dealing with it trying to get it to grow back. It&#x27;s been about a year and the hair is finally starting to grow though its only about 1/2\\&quot; long so it&#x27;s not growing like it was. My hair is to my mid back and it&#x27;s going to take a VERY long time to get my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li> Love love love it. I get stopped by people all the time asking what is THAT color...nothing but positive. Suggestion for those who say that it dries out their hair just use a little coconut oil along with the conditioner provided with the product.</li>
            <li> This color looks nice on medium brown hair.  After about a month the color looks very dreary and needs refreshing.</li>
            <li> Last night was the first time I used any L&#x27;Oreal Paris Feria color and so far I really like the product and results! I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on the color and shininess it gave to my hair. I like the subtleness of the purple/reddish tones of 36 chocolate cherry. I do, however, think this color is better suited for people who already have dark hair because it might darken your hair too much if your hair color is more light/medium brown or reddish/auburn. The dye was a little runny (had to clean up the floor and sink afterwards because of accidental drops) but it kind of helped cover my hair more quickly - I have medium length hair but it&#x27;s pretty thick. All in all, I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Chocolate Cherry for about 2 years, and I LOVE it.  I get more compliments now than I did when I had my hair professionally colored, and it&#x27;s about 1/10 of the cost.  I have dark brown hair naturally, and have to color my hair once every 6-8 weeks.  It takes about 1/2 hour from start to finish, so that&#x27;s not really a big deal to me.  I use the provided conditioner once every week to 10 days between coloring, and find that my hair stays very soft and silky.  Great product, and very easy to use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve died my hair for more than ten years and this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever been compelled to write. I used to use and love Feria True Red. For the last year or so I&#x27;ve been using a 10-minute dye on the market, which I love but couldn&#x27;t find at the store. I picked up a bottle of Feria True Red again and it is TOTALLY different. There&#x27;s a new thing called \\&quot;color boost\\&quot;... okay. I added it to the other ingredients and just the tiniest drop fell onto my white sink and stained it immediately. I started dying and I thought someone had played a joke on me: the color was bright pink! I&#x27;ve been freaked out by colors before so I went through with the whole process. My hair is now clown fuchsia, not even red, and very dry/dull. The color is not even close to the color on the box. I will NEVER buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Perfect new color for my perfect new cut üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª</li>
            <li> great, subtle, deep red color.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments since switching to this shade.  Easy to apply and does not damage my hair.</li>
            <li> I used to use this color all the time and really like the shade. It made my dark brown hair a reddish brown shade which was really pretty. It faded very fast though. Also it dried out my hair and damaged it some.</li>
            <li> Covers well...stays constant...doesn&#x27;t fade...good quality...doesn&#x27;t harm my hair... I Love it...It doesn&#x27;t drip in your eyes or run in your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I intended to use this to cover my green hair (because brown dyes with red tints will cancel out green), yes that worked really well, no more green hair. However, the red highlights only reflect when you&#x27;re under sunlight, otherwise people will think you have black hair. The red just doesn&#x27;t show naturally even though I let it saturated in my hair for1 hour and it washes out little by little in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No messy cleanups though. Very easy to apply. Just a little false advertising, like all other haisr dyes, never trust the picture on the box.</li>
            <li> This looked like an awesome color so I bought 2 boxes for the length of my hair. I followed directions to the letter and at first it really looked great! But, it washes out with in 2 weeks leaving my hair RED!! Will not buy it ever again. I do not recommend wasting your money....</li>
            <li> Full complete grey coverage; beautiful color; many compliments received throughout the years and years I have been using this shade.</li>
            <li> This has been my &amp;#34;go-to color&amp;#34; for the past five months. The roots usually look slightly redder than the remainder of my hair bit evens out in about a week. It fades and I dye every four weeks. Inside light, its dark with a hint of red.. outside light there&#x27;s a nice red shine. I have been complimented on the color quite a few times, will continue to use :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wannabe hairdresser, and I always have been. Even when I was little I was pretty obsessed with hair. Not my hair, but everyone&#x27;s hair. So I learned to color hair from my best friend, Trea, who taught me well. I was a beauty supply store snob, and I would only use a drugstore product in dire and severe emergency (like I won a grammy and my roots were showing....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been this snob about box color for 20 years, but I recently had twins, and there&#x27;s Amazon, my go-to for every single thing I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some grey roots, and medium brown, to cherry red, to very very black as the cauldron of hell bottom half of my long hair (dyed blue black, now there&#x27;s a color that works, but.....I digress.) So I was not expecting any miracles from this color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a miracle. Because I used the tortoiseshell brown of this brand before using this color (which is a great color, but harsh, you have to WANT your hair lightened and a bit thrashed (for volume, right?) I had lighter hair when I applied this one and it came out just incredibly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is a no fail product, except that hair color depends *entirely* and *absolutely* on what you&#x27;ve got on your head and what you&#x27;ve done to it, and what shape it&#x27;s in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would especially recommend this color to people who have had highlights within the last year or so and had them sort of disappear under other colors. The whole &amp;#34;shimmering&amp;#34; thing that Feria/Loreal is hyping is for real. It is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is harsh on your hair, so know that. If you use the enclosed hydrogen peroxide (and if you switch out a 20 volume, you probably won&#x27;t get the shimmer lift that they&#x27;re talking about)  you&#x27;re hitting your hair with a 25 volume perox blow. Box/drugstore colors do their job, but it is what it is. Don&#x27;t use Loreal colors (or Wella, if you&#x27;re doing the beauty supply thing) unless your hair is in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular color, with 2 boxes for almost waist length, but fine, hair, left on about 15 min longer than suggested, and without applied heat resulted in an excellent grey coverage, and a brilliant chocolate cherry color.for almost waist length, but fine, hair, left on about 15 min longer than suggested, and without applied heat resulted in an excellent grey coverage, and a brilliant chocolate cherry color.</li>
            <li> I used to get my hair colored at a professional salon and spent a fortune each time. It was always a great color, but it faded quickly. A friend suggested coloring it myself, and as nervous as I was about it, I figured the worst that could happen is I run back to my stylist and beg her forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;The color was a little darker than I expected, but it was very pretty. It washed out to something closer to whats on the box. It looks natural on me (I&#x27;m a brunette), but it has a red shade to it. In the sun, it looks reddish too, and extremely shiny.&lt;br /&gt;And not only does the color look good right away, my hair is so much softer after switching to this.</li>
            <li> I used this color and although it wasn&#x27;t as dark red as it is in the photo, I love how my hair came out. It was a mix of brownish red, like a real chocolate cherry, not burgundy. I love this color so much. Every one won&#x27;t get the same results, but mines was perfect for me.  By the way, before I used this, my hair was a medium honey blonde, but my natural color is dark brown</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Feria Hair Color, 36 Dark Burgundy Brown/Chocolate Cherry Was very easy to implicate and the color is neat in my wife hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 years. It is so expensive to go to a salon so I do my own color with Feria! This color looks like a subtle red-brown until you step in the sun or under a light. Then the color looks really bright red. It&#x27;s very pretty and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love  the color.  Simply to use.  The color last far a long time.</li>
