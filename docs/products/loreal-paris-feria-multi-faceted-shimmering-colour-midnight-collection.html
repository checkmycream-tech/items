            <li>I LOVED this shade on me...wish I didn&#x27;t have to shell out $11+ for it...</li>
            <li>One of a kind color.</li>
            <li>my favorite color</li>
            <li>had used L&#x27;Oreal Preference for many years.</li>
            <li>Feria Multi-Faceted Shimmering DOES have more variation to it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair color.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, since now I only make my order to Feria for Amazon.</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite hair color.  </li>
            <li>They have used this product before and they love it.</li>
            <li>The results from dying it at home have always been better than I ever got from a salon.</li>
            <li>Glad that she can find it here on-line.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I have been bleaching my hair since junior high and it has never looked this good.</li>
            <li>Love this color however it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>This product turned by light brown roots organish-redish.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for somebody who is doing a root touch up with naturally light brown (or any shade of brown hair).  </li>
            <li>My hair is very shiny and has much more depth to it than I have ever had over the 100 years</li>
            <li>This color is so nice and natural in my wife&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>NICE LIGHT COLOR WITHOUT TOO MUCH RED TONES.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding this color at the store, so I am happy I can buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I first used a bleaching kit.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled and will continue to use this and continue to proclaim that I am a natural blonde.</li>
            <li>My natural color is a light brown and this product colors my hair very well.</li>
            <li>This covers more grey than the Preference</li>
            <li>are that I can color or touch up my hair in half an hour at home, have it look fantastic and feel great, for less than the tip on a salon session.  </li>
            <li>What I have now is a very light, very natural looking blonde hair color.</li>
            <li>IT MAKES THE HAIR VERY SHINY.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>The color is much darker than what is pictured.</li>
            <li>It is a color I really like.  </li>
            <li>Although the organish-redish is better then my natural brown roots with my blonde lowlights &amp; highlights</li>
            <li>I am disabled and it&#x27;s nice to have it sent to you .</li>
            <li>NEW SHADE!</li>
            <li>I have used it twice and made sure I washed the conditioner out the second time and still ended up with the same feeling in my hair and incorrect color.</li>
            <li>Unlike other brands I&#x27;ve tried, Feria gives a multidimentional color that looks more natural.</li>
            <li>This particular color is very light blonde but still covers gray on my natural shade 8 1/2-9 blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>sure you dye it a few days before.</li>
            <li>Instead it has little variations (like you would have with highlights or lowlights) which gives it a much more natural look.</li>
            <li>New packaging, new model...</li>
            <li>That really lightened my already bleach blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid hundreds of dollars to have it professionally done, and wound up in tears with the hideous results.</li>
            <li>But I was never thrilled with the results, but I stuck with it-anythings better than my mousey brown hair.</li>
            <li>I was going to try this on my natural non-colored hair before using bleach.</li>
            <li>She can not find it in any store near us.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out as much as the Preference did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Actually I don&#x27;t remember exactly why I changed except Preference was no longer covering the grey.</li>
            <li>First, I have medium-dark brown hair and it comes out just slightly darker than the picture on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I throw it away and use a little extra of my regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot less inexpensive than a salon color, but it has definite variations in shades and it sparkles naturally so it doesn&#x27;t give the all over dull and somewhat dated look of home coloring, and it doesn&#x27;t give the horrendous dried out look that salon highlights give because they are bleach.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m bummed, this color was fantastic :(</li>

            <li> My hair never looks brassy or dried out, just shiny and conditioned.</li>
            <li> I thought that it would go away after a few washes.</li>
            <li> I will start of by saying that it is difficult to do at home root touch ups for blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> When they say shimmering they mean it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I think it smells worse than the Preference did.</li>
            <li> The conditioner that comes with it smells even worse -</li>
            <li> I also leave the hair color on for approximately 50 minutes before rinsing it out.  </li>
            <li> False advertising.  </li>
            <li> Totally disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this color however it fades quickly. Purchase it monthly.&lt;br /&gt;still my favorite color</li>
            <li> I will start of by saying that it is difficult to do at home root touch ups for blonde hair.  This product turned by light brown roots organish-redish.  Although the organish-redish is better then my natural brown roots with my blonde lowlights &amp; highlights it still is not what I wanted nor was it what the box stated.  In addition, the conditioner supplied to use after the touch up made my hair feeling as though product was left behind.  I have used it twice and made sure I washed the conditioner out the second time and still ended up with the same feeling in my hair and incorrect color. I would not recommend this product for somebody who is doing a root touch up with naturally light brown (or any shade of brown hair).  If you&#x27;re trying to save money by not going to to hair saloon, I would still advise to choose another product.&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 2 star only because my hair was still lightened by the color, even though it was not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> First, I have medium-dark brown hair and it comes out just slightly darker than the picture on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used L&#x27;Oreal Preference for many years. Actually I don&#x27;t remember exactly why I changed except Preference was no longer covering the grey. This covers more grey than the Preference did but it still doesn&#x27;t cover it all. With MY hair, it&#x27;s really only noticeable to me but you know how that goes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feria Multi-Faceted Shimmering DOES have more variation to it. I have no idea how that works but my hair is not all one color. Instead it has little variations (like you would have with highlights or lowlights) which gives it a much more natural look. The variations in color helps make the grey blend in also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out as much as the Preference did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell lasts a couple days (a couple washes). I think it smells worse than the Preference did. The conditioner that comes with it smells even worse - I throw it away and use a little extra of my regular conditioner. So don&#x27;t dye your hair and then go out on a date - make sure you dye it a few days before.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair color.  I have been using this color for years.  I use a purple shampoo to help with decreasing any brassy tones.  I also leave the hair color on for approximately 50 minutes before rinsing it out.  My hair styles has complemented me on my hair color multiple times.</li>
            <li> Excellent, since now I only make my order to Feria for Amazon.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite hair color.  I swear everytime I use it, I get compliments about my hair. My hair never looks brassy or dried out, just shiny and conditioned.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair product for years and it is wonderful.  It never dries out my hair and it always turns out great.  SO SIMPLE to use.  You can&#x27;t mess it up.  It&#x27;s a lot less inexpensive than a salon color, but it has definite variations in shades and it sparkles naturally so it doesn&#x27;t give the all over dull and somewhat dated look of home coloring, and it doesn&#x27;t give the horrendous dried out look that salon highlights give because they are bleach.  This is somewhere in between salon highlights and bleach and the results are that I can color or touch up my hair in half an hour at home, have it look fantastic and feel great, for less than the tip on a salon session.  This particular color is very light blonde but still covers gray on my natural shade 8 1/2-9 blonde hair.  It is never too brassy when the color goes on.  Combined with a blonde shampoo the color lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> Use this product all the time . I am disabled and it&#x27;s nice to have it sent to you .</li>
            <li> I have used Feria 110 for years.  New packaging, new model... NEW SHADE! My hair is now orangy, not blonde.  Totally disappointed.  False advertising.  This product is NOT the same!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for a relative. They have used this product before and they love it. According to them way cheaper than the local stores such as Rite Aid, Wallgreens......</li>
            <li> FERIA DOES NOT COVER GREYS VER ELL, WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED. IT MAKES THE HAIR VERY SHINY. NICE LIGHT COLOR WITHOUT TOO MUCH RED TONES.</li>
            <li> I first used a bleaching kit. That really lightened my already bleach blonde hair. But it left my hair brassy and yellow. I thought that it would go away after a few washes. It didn&#x27;t. So I bought this color and applied it yesterday. After drying my hair I was extremely happy with the results. What I have now is a very light, very natural looking blonde hair color. When they say shimmering they mean it. My hair is very shiny and has much more depth to it than I have ever had over the 100 years I have been dying it. I have been bleaching my hair since junior high and it has never looked this good. I&#x27;ve paid hundreds of dollars to have it professionally done, and wound up in tears with the hideous results. And had to stop and pick up a box of dye on the way home from the stylists to try and fix the mess they made of my hair. I finally learned my lesson and have been &amp;#34;boxing&amp;#34; it for years. The results from dying it at home have always been better than I ever got from a salon. But I was never thrilled with the results, but I stuck with it-anythings better than my mousey brown hair. But now that I found this color I am thrilled and will continue to use this and continue to proclaim that I am a natural blonde. LOL.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this shade on me...wish I didn&#x27;t have to shell out $11+ for it...if it ever drops to a $7 membership auto ship, count me in!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color for over a year and I really like it. My natural color is a light brown and this product colors my hair very well. Unlike other brands I&#x27;ve tried, Feria gives a multidimentional color that looks more natural.</li>
            <li> but once I got it it looked reddish so I couldn&#x27;t use it - beware buying dye since when I tried to return it&lt;br /&gt;it came up as &amp;#34;hazardous waste&amp;#34; material and not returnable.  I have several of these colors now I have to throw out.</li>
            <li> I have used this color before and like the excellent coverage and color.  I will order this color from now on. I have a hard time finding this color at the store, so I am happy I can buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The color is much darker than what is pictured. I am a level 6 1/2 or 7. It took me to a level 10 1/2 or 11. It has a yellow cast to it. I was going to try this on my natural non-colored hair before using bleach. I was hopeful to get a bleach blonde color but it was not as pictured. It took me about 3-4 shades lighter but I was hopeful to get past the yellow stage.</li>
            <li> It is a color I really like.  It&#x27;s very hard to find in stores.  I&#x27;m so happy I can find it on Amazon!  Perfect for me!  Easy to apply.  One I would recommend!</li>
            <li> This color is so nice and natural in my wife&#x27;s hair.  Conditions as it colors and is non-drying.  Best product ever.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this color. She can not find it in any store near us. Glad that she can find it here on-line.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve discontinued Starlet. HOW COULD YOU, Feria?!?!? I had to go to a couple different walmarts just to find a couple boxes before they were all gone. I&#x27;m bummed, this color was fantastic :(</li>
            <li> My hair feels great and the color is phenominal.  One of a kind color.</li>
