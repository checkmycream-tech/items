            <li>If I had gone any darker I would not have been happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li>it matchs perfectly!</li>
            <li>This is great stuff!!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product does what it says, makes thinning hair look fuller.</li>
            <li>Great Hair Day is the perfect fix for me.</li>
            <li>Great coverage.</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Happy that was included.</li>
            <li>and it worked great</li>
            <li>The brush is very nice.</li>
            <li>I love Great Hair Day!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a good while</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the brunette is good, if you don&#x27;t mind darker roots..</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>So glad I tried it!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy two colors closest to your own and blend them.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush with it.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, convenient to use.</li>
            <li>review was made on my own accord.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to look in my rear view mirror on the way home and not see my glowing scalp.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly!</li>
            <li>I found it most helpful for my bangs and the area around my part.  </li>
            <li>but I still like dermmatch better.</li>
            <li>and I always am able to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I am not at all pleased with how this covers.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I looked thru many  reviews trying to get color advice.</li>
            <li>- Works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s more of a reddish light brown.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, almost fool proof.  </li>
            <li>Fills in bare spots great</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, thinning hair (I am 60).</li>
            <li>For those of us who are getting a little thinning of our hair this is the best!  </li>
            <li>I have significant gray in my hair</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li>Better to have the darker one though b c the light one really doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>it works much better as far as coverage.</li>
            <li>Great Hair Day is a product I use now and have in the past.</li>
            <li>The blonde is pretty dark also, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>This product might be great, but for my hair the light blonde was too dark.</li>
            <li>If someone else out there has strawberry blonde hair (naturally) and has found a good blonde powder, pleased, let me know, will you?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products and this is by far my favorite!!  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what dear Joan said it will do.  </li>
            <li>At first opening the container is a puzzle.  </li>
            <li>recently purchased 2 items of the brunette fill in powder which is more to my liking.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of the product, and may try the white color.</li>
            <li>I ordered the light blonde (based on other reviews) and it&#x27;s a pretty darn good match.</li>
            <li>Application is fairly easy but it helps to have somebody do the back for you if you have a helper.</li>
            <li>This product makes me look like I have a nice, full head of thick hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is awesome, I have very hard to cover gray and it totally masks it between touchups.</li>
            <li>I have a medium to medium light blonde color and purchased the Light Blonde color.</li>
            <li>I watched on QVC where they went through all the shades thanks to a review here on Amazon where someone said they recommend going a shade lighter.  </li>
            <li>it works really well to fill in my eyebrows and it stays on</li>
            <li>Product quantity makes to price VERY affordable.  </li>
            <li>that I &amp;#34;just love&amp;#34;--I guess, what I really want is to not have to take medication that makes my hair fall out,</li>
            <li>and it really hides my scalp very well.  </li>
            <li>was very dissapointed with the product and would request a courtsey refund if possible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This works as well or slightly better than the other stuff...</li>
            <li>I have mostly white hair on top that is highlighted and low lighted but even with the color I add, the product was too golden beige and it just looked like my areas of bare scalp were accented.  </li>
            <li>Went with light blonde for natural ash hair.</li>
            <li>Several years ago my hair starting thinning on top</li>
            <li>I use the light blonde and it&#x27;s perfect when I rub it in a little, but I think the dark blonde (which I&#x27;ve purchased before, is too dark for a blonde and would work better for a lighter brunette.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; color, but this is a nice product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product but the price is really high and light blonde is never available at bed bath and beyond or any special price anywhere.</li>
            <li>This product has gotten darker since the last time I ordered it (light blonde).</li>
            <li>The reviews stated the colors were actually darker, but the &amp;#34;light blonde&amp;#34; was actually too light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blonde and the light one is just a bit too light and the dark blonde</li>
            <li>It is so worth the money, and I think it will last a long time, it doesn&#x27;t take that much and it absolutely lasts until you wash it.</li>
            <li>For the thinning area on top and at the back, I prefer using one of the powders (i.e.Xfusion) that I can shake onto my scalp,  I have medium blonde hair, and, after reading other reviews, I ordered the light blonde  </li>
            <li>Very glad that I did as the regular blonde would have proved far too dark.  </li>
            <li>and I know I could go longer as far as the product goes.  </li>
            <li>Its a soft stipple brush.</li>
            <li>This is a great price and believe me, a little goes a long way, so this will last a long time!!!</li>
            <li>If you have very light blonde hair, I am not sure this would work for you.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it seems a little on the light side .</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s mostly light blonde and dark blonde at the roots and in the back.</li>
            <li>For some reason the light blonde is hard to find.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like any product is actually being distributed but suddenly, no pink scalp is peeking through.  </li>

            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten very thin through the years and this really helps to conceal the shiny spots on my scalp and also helps to make my hair look fuller than it really is.</li>
            <li> It covers thinning hair and grey until you color again.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT magic hair, but a fine powder that takes the shine off the thin spot using a tinted powder.</li>
            <li> I keep getting &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34;, and have never found one that isn&#x27;t too dark, this one included.</li>
            <li> Colors run dark.  </li>
            <li> a bit too dark</li>
            <li> Press down on the side that has the indentation......</li>
            <li> (it was less noticable then my glow in the dark gray).</li>
            <li> Scalp less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I hated seeing my pink scalp throughout the front and top.  </li>
            <li> The coloring is a little dark.</li>
            <li> but it is still a little gray looking.</li>
            <li> Maybe adding a little moisture to the product would be my suggestion.</li>
            <li> The brunette is very dark.</li>
            <li> The brush is a piece of junk (bristles fall out like crazy) but the product really covers gray and stays on until you wash it out.</li>
            <li> Yes as posted by others it does have a perfume smell but after a few wears you no longer notice it.</li>
            <li> Just throwing that out there because the few reviews I could find that dealt with color advised to go darker.</li>
            <li> So order one lighter than you might usually think you would use</li>
            <li> That being said I would be afraid that the next shade might be too dark!</li>
            <li> And it goes on very pale.</li>
            <li> so I will probably be a tough customer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product. Easy to apply, almost fool proof.  It does exactly what dear Joan said it will do.  It lasts between shampoos. I shampoo two days a week and I know I could go longer as far as the product goes.  It actually gives my root area a thicker feel.  I have baby fine, thinning hair (I am 60). This product makes me look like I have a nice, full head of thick hair.  I have a medium to medium light blonde color and purchased the Light Blonde color. Very glad that I did as the regular blonde would have proved far too dark.  I did go against the guide and video I watched on QVC where they went through all the shades thanks to a review here on Amazon where someone said they recommend going a shade lighter.  If I had gone any darker I would not have been happy with the purchase! No need for touch-ups between shampoos!</li>
            <li> This product is tedious to apply, and the results are just OK.  I found it most helpful for my bangs and the area around my part.  For the thinning area on top and at the back, I prefer using one of the powders (i.e.Xfusion) that I can shake onto my scalp,  I have medium blonde hair, and, after reading other reviews, I ordered the light blonde  It matches well.  If you have very light blonde hair, I am not sure this would work for you.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten very thin through the years and this really helps to conceal the shiny spots on my scalp and also helps to make my hair look fuller than it really is.</li>
            <li> Great coverage. Use it for in between touch ups!</li>
            <li> i use this for a brow filler and use the brush for my eyeshadow.  it works really well to fill in my eyebrows and it stays on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and does what it claims to do. The only thing is that it seems a little on the light side . I am a blonde. And it goes on very pale. That being said I would be afraid that the next shade might be too dark! Wish there was an in between! I&#x27;m sticking with this and would buy again</li>
            <li> Scalp less noticeable. Went with light blonde for natural ash hair. It performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product has gotten darker since the last time I ordered it (light blonde). Now it&#x27;s more of a reddish light brown.</li>
            <li> Great. it matchs perfectly!</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy two colors closest to your own and blend them.  My husband is brown I&#x27;m blonde.  I use both on both of us in different proportions.  Amazing stuff.  Long lasting. Product quantity makes to price VERY affordable.  At first opening the container is a puzzle.  Press down on the side that has the indentation......Nice brush with it.  Its a soft stipple brush. Application is fairly easy but it helps to have somebody do the back for you if you have a helper. I use a mirror and have no problems.  You have to have some hair left.  This is NOT magic hair, but a fine powder that takes the shine off the thin spot using a tinted powder. That said, I do think it does &amp;#34;plump up&amp;#34; the hair over that spot a bit after you comb.  I&#x27;m convinced !  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and have been very pleased with it.  It is easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find one of these that I &amp;#34;just love&amp;#34;--I guess, what I really want is to not have to take medication that makes my hair fall out, so I will probably be a tough customer. This works as well or slightly better than the other stuff...I keep getting &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34;, and have never found one that isn&#x27;t too dark, this one included. If someone else out there has strawberry blonde hair (naturally) and has found a good blonde powder, pleased, let me know, will you?</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It covers thinning hair and grey until you color again.  Colors run dark.  So order one lighter than you might usually think you would use</li>
            <li> This does what it is supposed to but I still like dermmatch better. I got the blonde but it is still a little gray looking. The brush is very nice. Happy that was included.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they quit making this product it is a life saver.  I have used it for a good while and I always am able to find it on Amazon.  For some reason the light blonde is hard to find.  Several years ago my hair starting thinning on top and it really hides my scalp very well.  Bless Joan Rivers heart for coming up with this.</li>
            <li> For those of us who are getting a little thinning of our hair this is the best!  I&#x27;m blonde and the light one is just a bit too light and the dark blonde a bit too dark so I have both and mix them. Better to have the darker one though b c the light one really doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> - I believe I did this one already also. - Works pretty good.  Takes a bit of work to get it to stick to the scalp.  If face powder, eye shadow powder type or eye brow powder type, can be found in the correct color it works much better as far as coverage. And is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to return the product and when I attempted to do so, I learned that I was beyond the time allotted to return.&lt;br /&gt;I was very dissapointed with the product and would request a courtsey refund if possible.&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased 2 items of the brunette fill in powder which is more to my liking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the type you shake onto your hair, but from the reviews I thought I&#x27;d try this.  I find it doesn&#x27;t cover as well for me.</li>
            <li> I have blond hair and I didn&#x27;t like this product because it dulled the texture and color of my hair. Maybe adding a little moisture to the product would be my suggestion.</li>
            <li> It goes on gradually. Can&#x27;t overdo. So glad I tried it! Color-Light Blonde</li>
            <li> This product might be great, but for my hair the light blonde was too dark. I have mostly white hair on top that is highlighted and low lighted but even with the color I add, the product was too golden beige and it just looked like my areas of bare scalp were accented.  I love the idea of the product, and may try the white color.</li>
            <li> As a senior, my hair is thinning, of course.  I hated seeing my pink scalp throughout the front and top.  I used this product and I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked.  It doesn&#x27;t look like any product is actually being distributed but suddenly, no pink scalp is peeking through.  It automatically makes your hair appear thicker without any evidence that you applied any product.  I would enthusiastically recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> It doesnt help with roots. And it caused me to break out on my scalp. Dont recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this product but the price is really high and light blonde is never available at bed bath and beyond or any special price anywhere.I go and I think this is done on purpose.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly! Nice product, convenient to use. I have a hard time finding the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; color, but this is a nice product.</li>
            <li> The reviews stated the colors were actually darker, but the &amp;#34;light blonde&amp;#34; was actually too light. Can&#x27;t remember if there was a med.</li>
            <li> I am not at all pleased with how this covers.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Fills in bare spots great</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Covers the cowlick and my hair looks thicker.</li>
            <li> I love Great Hair Day! I&#x27;m losing my hair in the front and it can be embarrassing at times. Great Hair Day is the perfect fix for me. The coloring is a little dark. I use the light blonde and it&#x27;s perfect when I rub it in a little, but I think the dark blonde (which I&#x27;ve purchased before, is too dark for a blonde and would work better for a lighter brunette.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review was made on my own accord. I was not asked by anyone or any company to do this review. I bought this product myself and was not given this product nor paid for this review. Great Hair Day is a product I use now and have in the past.</li>
            <li> Do not get the blonde.  It&#x27;s useless.  Doesn&#x27;t cover anything or adhere well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the brunette is good, if you don&#x27;t mind darker roots..</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this and I had no idea if I had purchased the correct shade of blonde. My hair is highlighted. I would say it&#x27;s mostly light blonde and dark blonde at the roots and in the back. I ordered the light blonde (based on other reviews) and it&#x27;s a pretty darn good match. I bought it to cover my gray in between color appointments and it works like a charm. The brush is a piece of junk (bristles fall out like crazy) but the product really covers gray and stays on until you wash it out. Try it!</li>
            <li> So this works but just a heads up I&#x27;m blonde and I went with the lightest color it did not work, but I also ordered the one for the eyebrow and that was a darker shade so I used it for the hairline and it worked great so I will reorder the darker color. Yes as posted by others it does have a perfume smell but after a few wears you no longer notice it. It does not sweat off or run when at the gym!!!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!!  I have significant gray in my hair and I go to the hairdresser about every 4-5 weeks for coloring. This product is a life saver in between. It covers gray and doesn&#x27;t come out until you wash your hair. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products and this is by far my favorite!!  This is a great price and believe me, a little goes a long way, so this will last a long time!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product does what it says, makes thinning hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> I looked thru many  reviews trying to get color advice. I have mediumish brown hair, and I ordered the brunette. The brunette is very dark. I did use it until I ordered blonde (it was less noticable then my glow in the dark gray). The blonde is pretty dark also, and it&#x27;s perfect. Just throwing that out there because the few reviews I could find that dealt with color advised to go darker. This product is awesome, I have very hard to cover gray and it totally masks it between touchups. It is so nice to look in my rear view mirror on the way home and not see my glowing scalp. It is so worth the money, and I think it will last a long time, it doesn&#x27;t take that much and it absolutely lasts until you wash it.</li>
