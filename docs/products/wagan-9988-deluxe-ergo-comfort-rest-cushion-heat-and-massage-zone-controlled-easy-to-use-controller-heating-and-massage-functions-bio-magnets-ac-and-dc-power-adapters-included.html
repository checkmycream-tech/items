            <li>WORKS WONDERFULLY!</li>
            <li>The heater and massager work great!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for home and car</li>
            <li>It does just what it is suppose to do we put it on our chair by the computer and turn it on, the message is great, and the heat is perfect.</li>
            <li>Loved it!  </li>
            <li>It made a great kid gift.  </li>
            <li>I got this item as a gift and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Then sleep great</li>
            <li>thickness of the padding itself was really nice!</li>
            <li>product and good price I got.</li>
            <li>The recipient loved this gift.</li>
            <li>Service was excellent and fast Keep Up the good work</li>
            <li>Its easy to move and works great.</li>
            <li>but, that being said, it does get warm..</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of months now and its still running strong!</li>
            <li>heat not as strong as I&#x27;d hope, but it does work, and I am not returning it!</li>
            <li>Great product for about the first month.</li>
            <li>Massage is great, when you need to warm up fast its great, but the leg heat is just too much.</li>
            <li>Feature packed multi function seat pad could be awesome if all of the features worked properly.</li>
            <li>It was ok for the money.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>That being said, I love this item.</li>
            <li>Do take warning that you shouldn&#x27;t leave this running for more than 30 minutes like the instructions say.</li>
            <li>For massage purposes, it would make perfect sense if the spinning parts are also doing the movings from up and downs or from left to right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Abosultely Love IT.  </li>
            <li>This has helped me study and keep me warm in my cool room.</li>
            <li>It came sooner than anticipated (thank you Amazon shipping) and was really easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li>The seat cushion heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>Liked it at first, but the lumps where the vibrators are located start digging into your legs and buttocks after a time.</li>
            <li>It is a good product, so far we are satisfied and enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my dad on Christmas, it seems work fine.  </li>
            <li>I think that is my error for not reading the description accurately.</li>
            <li>Super light and convenient and easy to control.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this for the glider in my nursery</li>
            <li>I was really looking for more heat..</li>
            <li>The reviews are true.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I first discovered this at my dentist&#x27;s office and enjoyed my dental cleanings so much I decided to use it for driving.</li>
            <li>I was completely relaxed and throughly enjoyed the heat and massage function.</li>
            <li>For some, this is enough, and really it is a nice thing to have around the house when we want to relax.</li>
            <li>It keeeps her warm and cozy while watching her favorite tv shows.</li>
            <li>The shipment came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to all pregnant women!</li>
            <li>I can feel it even when my car is moving, and it&#x27;s nice that there is a low and high option.</li>
            <li>NOW MY DAUGHTER WANTS ONE!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>However my wife no longer uses it as it&#x27;s too hot summer.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for something that will be as hot as a heating pad, this is not going to do it for you.</li>
            <li>It gets so hot you have to unplug the whole seat cover from</li>
            <li>I just think there is so much padding it can&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>HIGH QUALITY!</li>
            <li>I really like this heated massage cushion.  </li>
            <li>This product is very portable, as long as there is an outlet near you, it can be used in most chairs.</li>
            <li>Gets warmer pretty quickly and use the low setting for vibration, mostly the leg and lower back while I drive long trips.  </li>
            <li>I am pregnant and needed something that will help eleviate the stress in my back and hips.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to my friends  </li>
            <li>The remote was convenient and the padding was comfortable</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as a chair massage but enough for a car seat.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because the new car I got no longer has heated seats and didn&#x27;t come with that as an option..</li>
            <li>Living in New England and not having a garage means frosty car seats.  </li>
            <li>AS A GIFT FOR MY SON-IN-LAW&#x27;S BIRTHDAY TO USE IN HIS NEW (OLD!) TRUCK.  </li>
            <li>It is a really strong and big vibrating chair basically, not a kneeding one, and if you leave it on too long you&#x27;re going to start feeling the little machine in your back more than the vibrating sensation.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be working well so far.</li>
            <li>Not deep penetrating, but very relaxing.</li>
            <li>No massage action at all.</li>
            <li>I only gave 4 stars because I really wanted a massage, kneading sensation.</li>
            <li>each switch has three positions (low, off, and high.</li>
            <li>No matter what you have switch positions in the heat stays on high on the back of the legs.</li>
            <li>I was actually pleasantly surprised at how much support it gives my back, and how soft it is at the same time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>,  the weather sucks!, and this would of been for appropriate for the climate change and holiday stress.</li>
            <li>If there was a high and low option, maybe that would help, but no such luck.</li>
            <li>Frequently, I have to turn it to the low setting after 10 mins.  </li>
            <li>and I actually bought this because some people said this was so hot they had trouble with</li>
            <li>The seat cushion part is a little shorter than my last one, but it works very well.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> heat is almost nonexisted, did not like. item was sent back</li>
            <li> One of the nicer magnetic seat warmers/massagers. Except remote looks poorly made. Gave as a gift and it seems to be working well so far.</li>
            <li> It does just what it is suppose to do we put it on our chair by the computer and turn it on, the message is great, and the heat is perfect. We are thinking to order a secound one so my husband and i can both sit in comfort anywhere we wish to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad on Christmas, it seems work fine.  Not deep penetrating, but very relaxing.</li>
            <li> All it does is vibrate. There is no massaging. I found it difficult to drive w it on b/c my head was rattling so much . No massage action at all.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to my friends  Service was excellent and fast Keep Up the good work THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Feature packed multi function seat pad could be awesome if all of the features worked properly. There are three slide switches to control intensity(shoulders, lumbar, and legs/thigh backs) each switch has three positions (low, off, and high. Lastly there is a fourth slide switch w/4 positions (Off, Heat, Heat massage, and massage only) No matter what you have switch positions in the heat stays on high on the back of the legs. It gets so hot you have to unplug the whole seat cover from the lighter then nothing works of course. Massage is great, when you need to warm up fast its great, but the leg heat is just too much. Sending it back.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY SON-IN-LAW&#x27;S BIRTHDAY TO USE IN HIS NEW (OLD!) TRUCK.  HE IS OVER THE MOON ABOUT IT! NOW MY DAUGHTER WANTS ONE! AND....I&#x27;M THINKING ABOUT GETTING ONE, TOO.   THANKS FOR SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Great product for about the first month. Then it just slowly falls apart. It is already stuffed in a drawer and not being used.😓</li>
            <li> This item can be used in car and at home. It works well. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It does what it say&#x27;s it&#x27;ll do.  I just don&#x27;t like it.  It creates jerking in my body and feels uncomfortable after a bit of use.  I can&#x27;t even feel the heat it says it creates.  I&#x27;d rather have something that emulates fingers massaging on my back not this.</li>
            <li> It was ok for the money.  However, it did not hold our attention because it is not made as well as the present it.  I would not reccomend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months now and its still running strong! I love it. I have it on my couch and me and my husband take turns with it. Its easy to move and works great.</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband and he loves it. He uses it in his car and at home. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Gets warmer pretty quickly and use the low setting for vibration, mostly the leg and lower back while I drive long trips.  I first discovered this at my dentist&#x27;s office and enjoyed my dental cleanings so much I decided to use it for driving.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and needed something that will help eleviate the stress in my back and hips. I bought this item hoping for a massage like quality, but unfortunately it just vibrates. I think that is my error for not reading the description accurately. That being said, I love this item. It came sooner than anticipated (thank you Amazon shipping) and was really easy to set up and use. After using it for the first time (I added it to my lazy boy chair) I managed to fall asleep in the chair! I was completely relaxed and throughly enjoyed the heat and massage function. This product is very portable, as long as there is an outlet near you, it can be used in most chairs. I only gave 4 stars because I really wanted a massage, kneading sensation. This only vibrates. I highly recommend this to all pregnant women! If only to give your guy a break from giving you a massage!</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as a chair massage but enough for a car seat.  However my wife no longer uses it as it&#x27;s too hot summer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the new car I got no longer has heated seats and didn&#x27;t come with that as an option..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for almost a week and I actually bought this because some people said this was so hot they had trouble with and I thought, yes!! Well, no.. my heating pas gets hotter than this.. but, that being said, it does get warm.. I just think there is so much padding it can&#x27;t get hot. I was really looking for more heat.. If there was a high and low option, maybe that would help, but no such luck. When its on, that&#x27;s all she wrote.&lt;br /&gt;As for the vibrating/massage aspect.. that does work well, and as advertised. It&#x27;s strong. I can feel it even when my car is moving, and it&#x27;s nice that there is a low and high option. Do take warning that you shouldn&#x27;t leave this running for more than 30 minutes like the instructions say. If you do, its going to start to make you ache. It is a really strong and big vibrating chair basically, not a kneeding one, and if you leave it on too long you&#x27;re going to start feeling the little machine in your back more than the vibrating sensation. Or at least, I do.&lt;br /&gt;The thickness of the padding itself was really nice! I was actually pleasantly surprised at how much support it gives my back, and how soft it is at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I still gave this a 4 out of 5. heat not as strong as I&#x27;d hope, but it does work, and I am not returning it! But if you are looking for something that will be as hot as a heating pad, this is not going to do it for you.</li>
            <li> Seller does not require a signature for delivery.  Fed-ex claims package was left at front door. Package was never located.  This was suppose to be a gift for my wife.  Now I have no gift,  the weather sucks!, and this would of been for appropriate for the climate change and holiday stress.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for the glider in my nursery so I would be comfy while sitting there nursing my son to sleep.  The massage is an annoying vibrating feeling, and the heat doesn&#x27;t get that warm to really relieve muscle tension.  The remote was convenient and the padding was comfortable but I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> HIGH QUALITY! WORKS WONDERFULLY!</li>
            <li> It made a great kid gift.  Especially since modified football just started.  The shipment came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, so far we are satisfied and enjoy using it.  For massage purposes, it would make perfect sense if the spinning parts are also doing the movings from up and downs or from left to right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product and good price I got.</li>
            <li> The reviews are true. All this does is vibrate and produce heat. For some, this is enough, and really it is a nice thing to have around the house when we want to relax. But next time we will purchase a more expensive massage cushion that has moving parts to help remove knots in the back.</li>
            <li> Liked it at first, but the lumps where the vibrators are located start digging into your legs and buttocks after a time.</li>
            <li> My car doesn&#x27;t have pricey heated leather seats.  I got this item as a gift and it works great.  Living in New England and not having a garage means frosty car seats.  The seat cushion heats up very quickly.  Frequently, I have to turn it to the low setting after 10 mins.  The control on it is very basic but the product does the job.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like this heated massage cushion.  The seat cushion part is a little shorter than my last one, but it works very well.  I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> This has helped me study and keep me warm in my cool room. Helps my legs from being sore. I am student.</li>
