            <li>It hurt more then anything.</li>
            <li>Each one of us did two cartilage piercings and most of us got our triples done.</li>
            <li>Make sure to practice on a napkin or something.&lt;br /&gt;MY</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>and i made WAY more money</li>
            <li>Make sure you have safe earrings to put in after you use these earrings to pierce, they don&#x27;t come with backs.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Well besides that it&#x27;s a good buy if you don&#x27;t want to spend so much money on piercings.</li>
            <li>The gun is made up of p,astic that can easily break.</li>
            <li>, even if they aren&#x27;t made out of the best metal, these are special earrings with a sharp pointy end to be able to pierce through.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It seemed to work fine for the 1st piercings.</li>
            <li>Got this for like 6 bucks and works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap too.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cheap piercing gun to practice.</li>
            <li>earrings didn&#x27;t fit gun....</li>
            <li>earrings don&#x27;t quite fit in the gun</li>
            <li>and I originally ordered this to pierce my belly button again, but this is not what you should buy if thats what you are trying to</li>
            <li>Well it didn&#x27;t take long to come, which was great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great quality works fine did get stuck the first time but not a big problem!</li>
            <li>one of the special earrings and remove the back.&lt;br /&gt;the ball of the earring kinda goes inside the gun, with the pointy part sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;Place</li>
            <li>But its virtually painless actually... the quality is good, I paid like 8 bucks for this where at the store I pay 15 to get them done.</li>
            <li>We pierced my cartilage with it, which was exciting</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>the gun itself is very good, but when it came in it had missing pieces (mirror) and the earrings were not secured in their bags and where everywhere!!</li>
            <li>it gets stuck sometimes but if you wiggle it a bit it comes right off</li>
            <li>when you&#x27;re ready, Pull the trigger!</li>
            <li>Okay to start off I wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering this, I ordered two other piercing items at the same time, it took a while to come in the mail</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Loved it could be better but not so bad</li>
            <li>but the main problem is that it jams sometimes after the you pull the trigger</li>
            <li>and you have to try to get the earring out without taking it out of the new hole.</li>
            <li>I would suggest just getting it done professionally</li>
            <li>Needles to say if I get my ears pierced it will be professionally done.</li>
            <li>I recommend just getting it done professionally</li>
            <li>the gun is really cheaply made the piercing studs it came with are very odd sized</li>
            <li>The earring does get stuck every once in while, but if you just stay calm and work on it a little it will come out no problem.</li>
            <li>the only problem is the crappy earrings they come with come out easily, but i can usually get it back in  and then push it through the back.</li>
            <li>found that the back the earring came with fell off, so be prepared to use a different back to prevent your new piercing from falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Therefor if anyone else is a first timer and would like a little help when it comes to using this gun, here are some instructions.&lt;br /&gt;***Remember</li>
            <li>The studs are big and it would cause too much shock if used anywear other than the lubes of ears</li>
            <li>ONLY COMPLAINT is that the studs in the package are super ghetto.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too small to fit your nose lips or anything else other than your ears.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really need that little mirror, but if I needed to I could just glue it back on.</li>

            <li> it got jammed and I got to scared to pierce my second hole because of it..</li>
            <li> so I was very careful to wash my hands and use hand sanitizer before doing it on each teen.  </li>
            <li> And mines did not have a mirror and the marker was dry</li>
            <li> The marer it came with was dry and the plastic box cracked.</li>
            <li> Got stuck in my ear, studs that come with it are super cheesy and some of mine had rust on the bottom.</li>
            <li> a little tiny sting after, but nothing that would ever require any thought.</li>
            <li> then i spent on this, plus no one had issues with the metals.</li>
            <li> my kit just came in the mail today, and it&#x27;s NOT what i expected!</li>
            <li> , I have not experienced such problems.</li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions and took me a few minutes to figure out.</li>
            <li> I pierced my ear a few times with this product.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just plain junk got stuck in my Nieces</li>
            <li> I am giving it 5 stars because I got it for a steal, and it does it&#x27;s job, even if its not top of the line, I wanted it for practice.</li>
            <li> the gun very carefully with the metal part that points up, behind your ear, and</li>
            <li> The mirror fell off of the case, I read that was common</li>
            <li> For.the price, I mean I had my mom pierce my ears and at fist</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, and personally, even after reading bad reviews,I ordered it.</li>
            <li> The first time, it got terribly infected, and the rest, the machine would jam and the ear ring would not go through.</li>
            <li> Me and my friends had a bunch of people over to pierce eachothers ears because we were tired of waiting.</li>
            <li> This the broken</li>
            <li> so i was not happy with this</li>

            <li> It works but didn&#x27;t come with a mirror and DID come with a YELLOW marker. Doesn&#x27;t show up on skin. Also, the earrings and backing were not packed inside and were all over the place.</li>
            <li> the gun itself is very good, but when it came in it had missing pieces (mirror) and the earrings were not secured in their bags and where everywhere!! I have never had so many problems with amazon until I shopped here</li>
            <li> The ear rings are very cheap looking. The gun is made up of p,astic that can easily break. And mines did not have a mirror and the marker was dry</li>
            <li> Just plain junk got stuck in my Nieces ear this thing is horrid and dangerous do not trust this product</li>
            <li> PLEASE ONLY USE THIS FOR EARS. The studs are big and it would cause too much shock if used anywear other than the lubes of ears</li>
            <li> Items arrived just as described. It seemed to work fine for the 1st piercings. But then was soon unaligned. I had to work with it a lot. After about the 3rd piercing, it did not pierce all the way through, only about 1/2 way. I had to push it through the rest of the way. The studs that come with will infect your ears if you leave them in. I left them in for about two days just long enough so that when I took the stud out I could get another stud in.</li>
            <li> Great product and packaging!</li>
            <li> I ordered this ear piercing gun because my mom wanted it to pierce her pet pig&#x27;s ear however when I got it all my teenage kids wanted me to use it to pierce their cartilage on their ears.  We did and they couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!!  Saved us a good bit of money.  I work in the health care field so I was very careful to wash my hands and use hand sanitizer before doing it on each teen.  Everyone did great and was so happy with their piercing.</li>
            <li> Okay to start off I wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering this, I ordered two other piercing items at the same time, it took a while to come in the mail and I originally ordered this to pierce my belly button again, but this is not what you should buy if thats what you are trying to do.&lt;br /&gt;It works great for your, nose lip and ears though.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work for your belly button because thats a needle piercing when you get your belly button pierced the needle they use which is a 14 gauge actually takes skin out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this piercer works amazing , I have 2 cartilage and 5 ear piercings I used this gun to do all of them nd they all worked out and recovered great, it&#x27;s cheap too. I totally recommend this .&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic !!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great quality works fine did get stuck the first time but not a big problem! Loved it could be better but not so bad</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, and personally, even after reading bad reviews,I ordered it. The mirror fell off of the case, I read that was common and I don&#x27;t really need that little mirror, but if I needed to I could just glue it back on. I was looking for a cheap piercing gun to practice. We pierced my cartilage with it, which was exciting I read about the gun failing and not piercing all the way through, I have not experienced such problems. I am giving it 5 stars because I got it for a steal, and it does it&#x27;s job, even if its not top of the line, I wanted it for practice. However it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions and took me a few minutes to figure out. Therefor if anyone else is a first timer and would like a little help when it comes to using this gun, here are some instructions.&lt;br /&gt;***Remember to sterilize any earring before using it in the gun, any bacteria can cause infection&lt;br /&gt;Also, even if they aren&#x27;t made out of the best metal, these are special earrings with a sharp pointy end to be able to pierce through.&lt;br /&gt;I found that the back the earring came with fell off, so be prepared to use a different back to prevent your new piercing from falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How To Use This Gun:&lt;br /&gt;First, decide where you want this piercing, This gun isn&#x27;t meant to pierce any part of the body, so keep it at the ears.&lt;br /&gt;Mark the target with the marker.&lt;br /&gt;Hold the gun in your hands. In the back of it there will be a metal bar with a flattened end, pull that bar til you hear a click and it&#x27;s pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;Take one of the special earrings and remove the back.&lt;br /&gt;the ball of the earring kinda goes inside the gun, with the pointy part sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;Place the gun very carefully with the metal part that points up, behind your ear, and when you&#x27;re ready, Pull the trigger!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work. It hurt more then anything. I had to use my fingers to pierce my ear instead. Wouldn&#x27;t reccomend.</li>
            <li> I pierced my ear a few times with this product. The first time, it got terribly infected, and the rest, the machine would jam and the ear ring would not go through. I would suggest just getting it done professionally</li>
            <li> Me and my friends had a bunch of people over to pierce eachothers ears because we were tired of waiting. Each one of us did two cartilage piercings and most of us got our triples done. The earring does get stuck every once in while, but if you just stay calm and work on it a little it will come out no problem. It went through each time for us and none of us cracked our cartilage. Make sure to practice on a napkin or something.&lt;br /&gt;MY ONLY COMPLAINT is that the studs in the package are super ghetto. I have to wait a couple months to change them and they&#x27;re ugly ugly ugly</li>
            <li> This the broken so i was not happy with this i think u ppl need to look over your things be for sending them out</li>
            <li> This was perfect for piercing my ears. once the package arrived, i got it our and pierced my ears all in about 15 mins. which was great. it went through perfectly. it didn&#x27;t hurt at all. a little tiny sting after, but nothing that would ever require any thought. the only problem is the crappy earrings they come with come out easily, but i can usually get it back in  and then push it through the back. So very happy, and would defidently recommend.</li>
            <li> earrings didn&#x27;t fit gun....</li>
            <li> The gun works ok. I have problems getting the earring out of the gun after you&#x27;ve put it through the ear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for months and I&#x27;ve only tried to use it once and when I had my mom put it to my ear and pull the trigger it didn&#x27;t go all the way in my ear and it freaked me out. Needles to say if I get my ears pierced it will be professionally done.</li>
            <li> charged girls in the dorms $5 to get ears pierced (yes, im certified) and i made WAY more money then i spent on this, plus no one had issues with the metals. but the gold color will wash off after about a week.</li>
            <li> I did not  like this because it said that it could be used for belly button nose eye brows and lips. This can not be used for them because there was no needle sent with it.</li>
            <li> my g/f loves it she never thought she would own one</li>
            <li> Got stuck in my ear, studs that come with it are super cheesy and some of mine had rust on the bottom. The marer it came with was dry and the plastic box cracked. Don&#x27;t even try this product. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Everything has been great. The ear rings do get stuck in the gun some times and the ear rings are a bit generic, one bent while piercing an ear but over all a good product</li>
            <li> Well it didn&#x27;t take long to come, which was great. The earrings don&#x27;t irritate my ears either. Ok it&#x27;s a good gun but the main problem is that it jams sometimes after the you pull the trigger and you have to try to get the earring out without taking it out of the new hole. Well besides that it&#x27;s a good buy if you don&#x27;t want to spend so much money on piercings. Would totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> For.the price, I mean I had my mom pierce my ears and at fist I was.freaking.out! But its virtually painless actually... the quality is good, I paid like 8 bucks for this where at the store I pay 15 to get them done. Pretty.cheap., convinient and easy to use! I recommend.</li>
            <li> my kit just came in the mail today, and it&#x27;s NOT what i expected! they did NOT come with a mirror, some of the backs Don&#x27;t stay on, and it looks cheaply made!!! it feels like if i stick one in my ear, it&#x27;s going to get infected!!! and they came in 4 plastic pouches, BUT they had a hole in them so they were all over the box!!! thank god i pierced my ears before this came! and they feel like plastic!!! I would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Got this for like 6 bucks and works just fine for me. Great price for the quality</li>
            <li> earrings don&#x27;t quite fit in the gun like i think they should</li>
            <li> it got jammed and I got to scared to pierce my second hole because of it.. I recommend just getting it done professionally</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small to fit your nose lips or anything else other than your ears. Make sure you have safe earrings to put in after you use these earrings to pierce, they don&#x27;t come with backs.</li>
            <li> save your money this does not work when i got this it was broken</li>
            <li> This is great. After having used it on three seperate people, myself included, I would recommend this to others. Though, it does have a tendency to jam and I had to finish pushing the earring through with my fingers. Just have to be fast and hard.</li>
            <li> it gets stuck sometimes but if you wiggle it a bit it comes right off and it works great! i definitely recommend this !</li>
            <li> the gun is really cheaply made the piercing studs it came with are very odd sized and it took a lot of force for the stud to go through i would not recommend this to anyone instead get a piercing needle and receiving cork way easier</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I have used it so many times and it works great. The earrings are exactly adorable but they work! Totally worth it.</li>
