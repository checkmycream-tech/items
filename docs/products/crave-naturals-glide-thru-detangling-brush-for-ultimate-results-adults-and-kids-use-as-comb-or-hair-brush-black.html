            <li>I think I would have been better off with softer bristles.</li>
            <li>This brush was OK but was not the miracle worker on tangles</li>
            <li>I love this brush</li>
            <li>But, all in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and will continue to use the brush.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Great detangler, just remember to be gentle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to purchase another one just for me! :)</li>
            <li>Also wanted this brush because it&#x27;s much better for your scalp and hair than the plastic ones</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed I have more volume in my hair</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a bit more shiny.</li>
            <li>I love the brush.  </li>
            <li>okay, better than most, but even using it</li>
            <li>When I was combing her hair it felt okay</li>
            <li>I bought more for $4.00 at Sally&#x27;s Hair Supply on sale.</li>
            <li>hope they are pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this hairbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>They love it...</li>
            <li>Comes in cute colors.</li>
            <li>Further the company that sells this was awesome in it&#x27;s follow up.  </li>
            <li>Love the size, too.  </li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>; I just ordered a couple more.</li>
            <li>I love to use it  before going to bed as it feels great and really stimulates the scalp.,</li>
            <li>He tried it this morning, and he was able to brush his hair with no snags even with &amp;#34;bed-head&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>does what it says in the description, i love the shine it leaves in your hair.</li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with a good beard wax, this is the best way to painlessly and stylishly tame the wilderness on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and tangles very easily after washing, or even after having been combed through.</li>
            <li>Just buy a decent tangle remover, use a good conditioner,  and use a set of nice silk pillow cases.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really easy to clean and sanitize - love it!  </li>
            <li>This is the best brush for detangling all day long.  </li>
            <li>She has perfect long ringlets.</li>
            <li>Perfect for long hair.</li>
            <li>This brush is excellent for long curly hair.</li>
            <li>gave 3 stars because the grip on the brush is super nice</li>
            <li>This brush detangled my hair quickly and it also feels nice in my hand.</li>
            <li>My girl loves it and that dsnt come easy for her :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>one is also easy to clean! :)</li>
            <li>The best thing about this brush vs a comb, the hair loss was very little to almost none, and our curl pattern is amazing.</li>
            <li>If anyone is bothered by hair static, try lightly passing a dryer sheet over your hair before brushing.</li>
            <li>I found the product for our hair, worked best when the  hair was wet or moist with conditioner or a detangler product before and after washing.</li>
            <li>Its about 95 percent pain free which I love.</li>
            <li>I bought a detangling brush about a year ago (I think it was Goody) and loved it, but I got this one to replace it because this one has a handle and is much easier to use for me.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old insists on brushing her own hair, and this helps her to do it more effectively.</li>
            <li>I had purchased one of these to use on my my 2 year old daughter, and I started using it and loved it so much that she said that I needed to get my own!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this awesome little brush.</li>
            <li>Its ergonomic and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair tangles so easy</li>
            <li>Goes through easily.</li>
            <li>It glides through my tangled hair easily and doesnâ€™t damage or break my hair.  </li>
            <li>Just as it is advertised it glides thru my hair easily.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair that tangles and knots easily.  </li>
            <li>Detangles easily and no pulling.  </li>
            <li>It now sits at her tub for easy access.</li>
            <li>No pulling, easy to hold &amp; store.</li>
            <li>It is silky smooth to run through your hair and will allow for great results (if only I had more hair).  </li>
            <li>Gets her hair nice and detangled, which makes for a much happier mommy and daughter!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight, easy to clean, feels good on my scalp, and gets tangles out.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll just pretend it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Still a HUGE improvement upon that hour a day of my life.</li>
            <li>This brush is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever owned except an old brush that is no longer around called KaoLuna.&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy to clean...</li>
            <li>This brush raked through it well and made my unruly mop smooth and manageable in minutes.</li>
            <li>You know it is doing a great job as there is almost no hair left in the brush after using it.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t too easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I also like the light weight of the brush.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>It also gives my scalp a nice gentle massage.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s two cheap plastic pieces stuck together.</li>
            <li>Sophie will have her own Glide Thru Detangling Brush from Crave Naturals very soon.  </li>
            <li>I just gave 4 stars because the handle is not sufficient for me to have a secure hold on the brush when I am brushing.  </li>
            <li>I have to extend my fingers around part of the brush, crushing some of the bristles..  </li>
            <li>Not worth$14+ for a cheap piece of plastic,looks and feels like a dollar store buy</li>
            <li>It makes a great second brush, and I will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>I, however, gave it away to see how they would enjoy it and will be buying another one using the 25% discount they offer.</li>
            <li>The brush looks well made not too cheap looking.</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fantastic this brush is.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t fall for the advertising hype on this cheap piece of plastic,</li>
            <li>So far I have heard nothing but good things about it.  </li>
            <li>feels good on my scalp, works great through my thick hair...</li>
            <li>Works great better then the average brush</li>
            <li>Wife loved it,  she has very curly hair and it glides through like a hot knife in butter,</li>
            <li>No more struggles to get him to brush his hair, he happily does it in his own.</li>
            <li>This brush really does detangle and makes the brushing part of my day much quicker and more enjoyable!</li>
            <li>I love it very much .</li>
            <li>I would recommend, still catches a tiny bit, but for my daughter to allow me to use it is amazing!</li>
            <li>Iâ€™ll never use a different kind!  </li>
            <li>They were excited to find a brush that does not \\&quot;pull\\&quot; to get the tangles.</li>
            <li>This is great for my daughter&#x27;s long snarly hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a unique brush.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price as we all know you pay for what you get!</li>
            <li>As I had stated before, the product I had received originally did not meet my expectations..</li>
            <li>I do brush it from the bottom first and work my way up for a better experience in getting out tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this hoping it would be the answer to my prayers for my toddler&#x27;s super fine hair.</li>
            <li>cause she was so excited about it.</li>
            <li>The end result was smooth, tangle free pretty hair!</li>
            <li>This brush makes combing his hair quicker, easier, and more effective than any of the multiple types of dog brushes I&#x27;ve used on him.</li>
            <li>Plus its ALOT easier to clean because of that feature as well.</li>
            <li>When I first tried my new Crave Naturals Detangling Brush, it felt so good that I tried it on my 18 lb.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it could be anything special</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>the Detangling works good for my hair and very gentle and soft and</li>
            <li>We liked the first one so much that we bought a spare.  </li>
            <li>Wet or dry,this is a great brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great detangling brush I would recommend you use it on wet hair that has been pre-detangled.</li>
            <li>Yesterday, it took a full hour to get through her hair.</li>
            <li>The gentle boar and nylon bristles help to build volume and form curves, while the handle is shaped and faceted to give you a better grip.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get static and my hair looks really shiny.</li>
            <li>I did solve this problem somewhat by wrapping a couple really fat rubber bands around the end to give it more traction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for my granddaughter&#x27;s thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li>Brush really does eliminate tangles, love it.</li>
            <li>They love this brush as it really does get the tangles out well and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get a good enough grip on it.</li>
            <li>I mean this wasn&#x27;t the best brush</li>
            <li>The only thing that could make it better would be to add some type of texture grip around the edge and make a version to fit in my pocket!</li>
            <li>The design is interesting too as it&#x27;s not similar to most brushes.</li>
            <li>Even on their most tangled days, it performs better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li>This brush has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Saturday I purchased The Wet Brush, and THERE&#x27;S an Amazing brush!</li>
            <li>Loves this hair brush, first try my hair is smooth again and it help a lot with my frizzy hair</li>
            <li>It also pulled on my hair a bit more than my normal paddle brush.</li>
            <li>It works best on my daughter with thick straight hair, and has been successful at speeding up the process and reducing tears for my daughter with long curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It glides through knots and tangles easily and gently.  </li>
            <li>Really does detangle hair quite easily.</li>
            <li>This brush does exactly what it claims to do!  </li>
            <li>I actually bought this out of impulse, but I am so pleased!</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have used that does everything promised: no pain and the tangles just disappear!  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00N7HC44S Fantastic Hair Dresser Salon Quality Detangling / Detangler / Hair Styling Glide Through Anti Tangles Brush In Black By VAGA]] is every bit as good as Crave and is 1/3rd the price.</li>
            <li>Thus, I have awarded this brush 4 rather than 3 stars, because I&#x27;m sure it works great for someone whose secret super power is not knotting their hair.</li>
            <li>This is a very good brush for thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t understand what was special about it.</li>
            <li>It is amazing to have something actually work.</li>
            <li>it glides smoothly through hair without pulling too much.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing for anyone with the same type of hair.</li>
            <li>I actually forgotten I had purchased it while brushing my 4b type hair until I was catching some kinks &amp; snags in</li>
            <li>My mom, who has very short and straight hair, used it and loved it as well.  </li>
            <li>The handle is good grip and it works as expected.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice if it was solid.</li>
            <li>She is 8yr old and absolutely love it .</li>
            <li>received this complimentary for product testing purposes.</li>
            <li>It was so good that I ordered another one recently-in pink, for my daughter, who loves that color.</li>
            <li>Fresh out of the tub, we use this brush to work through a section at a time.</li>
            <li>But overall a nice brush.</li>
            <li>it is so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably worth it if it were priced around $1.99 to $3.99 but $15.98?  </li>
            <li>The brush is designed where it has many bristles so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as many other brushes.</li>
            <li>The Round Classic Hairbrush is one of the best and most versatile from the range and helps create both soft waves or a shapely classic blowdry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brushes like this one but this brand really is superior to the others because the bristles don&#x27;t lose their shape.</li>
            <li>You can just dive right in anywhere.</li>
            <li>It just glides right through.</li>
            <li>And, it just takes the rats right out!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Also, it caused her hair to have static, which is never does as we live in a very humid area.  </li>
            <li>When he comes out he tells me, &amp;#34;ma, this brush is &amp;#34;THE ONE&amp;#34; it really works and its not painful.</li>
            <li>My daughter has long, kind of wavy hair</li>
            <li>My child has copious amount of fine hair, and she has a very sensitive head.</li>
            <li>Great for tangles in long curly hair--if you work carefully from the ends, it doesn&#x27;t pull out as much hair as my mother brushes, and does not seem to stir up as much static electricity in heating months.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing fun about combing through a tangled pile of hair especially if you&#x27;ve had it in a top knot for two days.</li>
            <li>They both have long, fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>If it had a little more weight to it I would feel more in control of brushing my hair instead of hoping it doesn&#x27;t fly out of my hand while brushing out those hard tangles.</li>
            <li>I read the positive reviews and figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I use it on my four year old sons near waist length hair and it is pretty darn amazing.</li>
            <li>Traditional hair brushes can catch your fine hairs in between the needles/base and break or rip your hair out!</li>
            <li>The Detangling Brush has given me great results and goes through my hair softly, unlike other brushes I have tried.  </li>
            <li>not only does this brush feel good to use but its size and shape make it easy to hold when detangling wet hair.  </li>
            <li>Much easier for little hands trying to brush their own hair!</li>
            <li>Works really well!  </li>
            <li>So then remembering I had just received this brush in the mail days before I tried it out for the first time and was pleasantly surprised at how much easier my hair was becoming untangled.</li>
            <li>She said this pulled more than her regular brush.</li>
            <li>I have purchased from this company before, and I would be glad to do business with them in the future.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>If youâ€™re looking to achieve a perfectly polished salon finish, this brush really helps to tease out and hold separate strands to give you the opportunity to focus on individual sections of your hair and ensure an all round glossy look.</li>
            <li>Since we&#x27;ve received it she&#x27;s had no problems brushing her hair and actually wants to do it!</li>
            <li>My hair definitely looks better after I use it.  </li>
            <li>Please offer a higher quality brush for this price-point.</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the Crave Naturals Detangling Brush were the bristles.</li>
            <li>I usually have to tug and pull with a regular brush, but this is awesome.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a guy) that this brush is pretty close.</li>
            <li>I had a Tangle Teezer, which also works pretty well, but this one was recommended to me by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>I received this on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I only ran it through my hair 4 times and it was brushed nicely and no tangles!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>Besides the uncomfortable handle, it is an awesome brush!</li>
            <li>Same thing for much better price.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do--detangle your hair without breaking.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>It feels far too light like it&#x27;s a plastic toy.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;unique&amp;#34; cone shaped plastic bristles look exactly like the bristles on all of my brushes.  </li>
            <li>I tried it as well, and even though my hair is straight it does get tangled, so I&#x27;m ordering one for me!</li>
            <li>I cannot say exactly what &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; distinguishes this brush from others, but I can say that based on her feedback, the discomfort and pulling have been substantially reduced.  </li>
            <li>My hair is curly and dry, so tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li>It would look great in a bold red &amp; black.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a strand of hair in this brush as yet unlike the other brushes I own.</li>
            <li>With hardly any effort and with great gentleness to the hair ~ all detangling was accomplished.  </li>
            <li>It works fine right handed only.</li>
            <li>Portable, nice shape, holy cow</li>
            <li>I switched back to a good ol&#x27; giant paddle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally got my own brush ,it&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t scrape my head!!The benefit outweighs the cost .</li>
            <li>I have short, basically straight hair that I find to be one of those top 10 things I would change about myself if I could if I could.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thick hair that gets tangled VERY easily and is a bear to comb after washing.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought this brush was just another con, but it really does work.</li>
            <li>The first one was for my daughter who is bi-racial and has very kinky hair.  </li>
            <li>The old fashioned round shampoo brush that I got from Duane Reade for $5.00 was much stronger than this one, and gives a great scalp massage.</li>
            <li>I tried to use the brush as my first detangling tool, but it was really inefficient.</li>
            <li>The brush feels great, I just wish that it is either straight like a regular brush or curves the other way for right-handed use.</li>
            <li>It certainly does &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Excellent function.</li>
            <li>Great for my thick hair!</li>
            <li>My daughter loves her new Detangling brush and she uses it right after taking a shower.</li>
            <li>I received the Crave Natural Detangler Brush and tried it out on my wet tangled hair and it works like magic!  </li>
            <li>I literally find no difference between this and my regular brush for combing through the knots and tangles in my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thinning hair, and I think this brush will save it from further destruction.  </li>
            <li>Brushes right through my hair with no trouble and no tangles!</li>
            <li>I never would have thought a brush could make such a difference, not only is there little to no hair being pulled out, but I get much better coverage of my scalp with my remaining thinning fine hair, better than any brush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much, but I certainly shed just as much in the process.</li>
            <li>This brush is good for a parent to brush a child&#x27;s hair, but I have a hard time using it on myself.</li>
            <li>My toddler son has really curly hair</li>
            <li>I Have Really Curly Hair</li>
            <li>It really does glide through my hair.</li>
            <li>It has worked really well for us.  </li>
            <li>and this brush has really helped glife through her hair with ease,</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this brush.  </li>
            <li>It really helps with detangling regardless of hair type.</li>
            <li>My daughter has a very curly hair which tangles all the time, this comb helps me to untangle them without hurting her.</li>
            <li>Very ergonomic</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the brush is very ergonomic for the person who is using the brush.</li>
            <li>This really didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was ready to go get a haircut</li>
            <li>The brush has a wide barrel, if I hold the brush by the barrel, the curve seems more suited for a left-handed user.  </li>
            <li>We both have problems with our hair getting very knotted up with tangles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very prone to tangling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ergonomic and really works very well.</li>
            <li>The Wet Brush is much better.</li>
            <li>It really performs as advertised.</li>
            <li>It takes about the same amount of time to get through her hair, but the process is now pain free.</li>
            <li>It gets the tangles out of my very tangly hair without pain or damage.</li>
            <li>This brush works very well with a bit of patience.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>It would be especially gentle for a kiddo, but it probably won&#x27;t replace your regular brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is very asymmetrical.</li>
            <li>It would hurt alot and most of time I would do it with my hair wet.</li>
            <li>This thing really detangles, without hurting my scalp.</li>
            <li>It hurts my scalp and is very unforgiving.  </li>
            <li>My 10 year is very picky about how a brush feels on his head and he likes this one.</li>
            <li>I felt like it didn&#x27;t really detangle my hair.</li>
            <li>; I am absolutely elated with this purchase.</li>
            <li>it made for any type of hair so the whole family can use it..would def reccommend</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much fuller.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my tangly hair.</li>
            <li>I truly like the ergonomic handle but not the even length bristles so much.  </li>
            <li>I think this works very well.</li>
            <li>but it really does make the process much easier.  </li>
            <li>They are very durable.</li>
            <li>After posting my review here I was contacted by customer service and they were very responsive to my concerns and offered a refund for my dissatisfaction in the product.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t feel it is really that good for thick hair, because it can&#x27;t brush all the way through.</li>
            <li>But this baby here wet or really dry hair it will detangle your hair with no problem coming from a guy this a great product highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice plastic brush with plastic bristles that can get through tough tangles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it successfully with wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>I hope you live it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>I have long hair that gets tangled easily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit harder than my older version, but that might be good because they&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
            <li>Her hair usually falls off very easily but this is really helping with hair loss!</li>
            <li>It caused extreme static issues.  </li>
            <li>ordering a second one of these to keep with my \\&quot;travel\\&quot; supplies -- it&#x27;s definitely worth having two!</li>
            <li>So I bought two more of these for my other two grandchildren.  </li>
            <li>I like this more than any other brush.</li>
            <li>Would like to have a longer handle, perhaps the other model would be better for this.</li>
            <li>It certainly works better than any of my other brushes, but I guess I just have knotty hair!</li>
            <li>My gal is always seeking a brush that will handle her fine yet plentiful and long locks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ideal brush for thick long hair.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe that my Detangling hair went smooth and I do have medium long hair</li>
            <li>My 5 year old who always wake up with Medussa-like hair absolutely loves this product!</li>
            <li>Not worth this price, but still an okay brush.  </li>
            <li>Just transitioned from natural to straight and this helps keep my hair from tangling and no breakage!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it DOES feel good on the scalp and it brushes through my hair after it&#x27;s dry, but heck, my other hairbrushes do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I use this brush while blow drying my hair and it has made my hair a ton more softer and with 95% less tangle issues.</li>
            <li>This brush easily smoothed out my hair even when wet.</li>
            <li>It seems to get tangles out of my hair better than my previous brush/comb</li>
            <li>Still, it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>Both of us (male and female) are pleased with this purchase.... of 2 separate brushes.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp so brushing my hair or doing anything with it hurts!</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush</li>
            <li>I wish I could find something a little better.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WoW!!</li>
            <li>great results in less time with less of my hair in the brush.</li>
            <li>We both have super thick hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Got it for my daughter, who has fine, straight hair that always seems to be tangled up and which causes much screaming and crying when it&#x27;s time to brush it all out.  </li>
            <li>Let me start this by saying My for year old is very tender headed and has beyond curly hair.</li>
            <li>Wow it really works.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to getting this for my 7 and 9 year old girls.  </li>
            <li>Good brush; not a great brush.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, which equals frizz on our high humidity days (which is 90% of the time).  </li>
            <li>but I think it work out fine for other uses.</li>
            <li>and I feel like this brush is totally fine for other hair types.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, even my 7yr and 2yr old can use it with minimal pain.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely dry (I live in Colorado) and gets tangled up all the time which is a nightmare, this brush slides right through without ripping and tearing hair out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy with short fine hair and would only need it in the morning when my hair would be tangled.</li>
            <li>The face of the brush is slightly concave, versus most every other brush I have used that is very convex, and that seems to make up a large part of why this works so well.</li>
            <li>and I am still shopping for a new hair brush.</li>
            <li>a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone looking for a new brush to keep.</li>
            <li>Glide brush  definitely make get ready routine much easier.</li>
            <li>I was just playing with the thought of cutting it shorter to have it more manageable, even though I love the length...</li>
            <li>Brush is concave (center bristles are recessed more than the outer ones), so it combs evenly over the entire head.  </li>
            <li>Not much more to say other than this is a great product that does what it claims and does it near effortlessly.</li>
            <li>No other brush has ever been so gentle on her hair.</li>
            <li>used to use a hair pick to comb my hair after showers, but this works so much better and hurts far less!  </li>
            <li>I get the very soft wavy curls.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Especially now that the weather is hot and humid.</li>
            <li>I give this product five stars because my six year old daughter not cry!  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>This is the 2nd one I ordered - the first went to my granddaughter.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old now loves to brush his hair!</li>
            <li>I bought this brush for my child whose hair gets pretty knotted daily.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin, stick straight, long, whispy, and full of static.</li>
            <li>Hair feels smooth to the touch with much less frizz.</li>
            <li>I am able to brush my hair in the morning after I towel dry it, and this brush takes the tangles out without the pain, and without ripping out as much hair as my previous brush.</li>
            <li>Thru Detangling Brush created a core range of styling hair tools for easy everyday use delivering maximum results.</li>
            <li>in 10-minutes, that knotted mess became a smooth body of hair and without the slightest pulls/tugs.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks they have contacted me again with an offer for a NEW and Improved product to try FREE..</li>
            <li>When I use it on dry hair it tugs against the tangles and doesn&#x27;t feel right.  </li>
            <li>But I will stress that it only purely works after showers, or with wet/damp hair.</li>
            <li>I had been eyeing this brush and was a little skeptical that it was as wonderful as everyone said.</li>
            <li>my old brush didn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li>daughter has Aspergers and is EXTREMELY sensitive when I am brushing her hair.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I use it on my 4 year old daughter as well as on myself.</li>
            <li>My three year old loves this brush.</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I drop it frequently as it doesn&#x27;t have any type of grip on the handle.</li>
            <li>Now all I can say is WOW,</li>
            <li>This brush is a complete lifesaver and must have.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old has natural hair, his mini Afro which he adores</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think it would make such a difference</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 11 year old and she loves it.  </li>
            <li>Much easier than any brush i have used prior.</li>
            <li>My worries were that all the reviews were for women or young girls.</li>
            <li>manufacturer however needs to make handle longer much too short.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this brush.  </li>
            <li>I wish I  knew  about this brush  early in my life.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length 4B natural hair.</li>
            <li>I shared it with a four year old friend of mine with baby-fine hair</li>
            <li>Brushing with &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; combs or brushes caused considerable discomfort and hair pulling.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider this a negative thing, however, considering how painless and effective it is compared to getting out tangles with my regular brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much more gentle than my regular brush, especially when wet (I haven&#x27;t used my regular one since getting this in the mail!).  </li>
            <li>Glides right through dry or wet hair with absolute ease-- no pulling!</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair tangles easily and we usually have to use a detangler in her hair,</li>
            <li>The one unique thing I can see is that the center bristles are shorter than the ones around the outside.  </li>
            <li>Not as magic as many others described... and probably not perfect for thick and straight hair like mine, it is easier than normal brush to get through hair..</li>
            <li>It removes the tangles easily with a lot less breakage than my regular hair brush.  </li>
            <li>I suppose this is a decent enough brush, but far from the detangling miracle worker it&#x27;s claimed to be.</li>
            <li>I have below shoulder length VERY thick, coarse, hair, and this brush does an awesome job detangling it, both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: Over two years and many brushings through thick, cotton-like hair later and it&#x27;s still like new with all of the bristles intact.</li>
            <li>Moderately disappointing as it doesn&#x27;t do a great job on my fine hair when wet- would recommend the wet brush instead</li>
            <li>It is really a phenomenal product and a serious time saver.</li>
            <li>It is really a phenomenal product and a serious time saver.</li>
            <li>It even left a slight silky smooth feel to my hair when I was done.</li>
            <li>This brush works well on my dry hair, leaving it smooth and shiny-looking; however, I did deduct a star from my rating because 1) it does not work at all (not even a bit) on my wet hair, 2)</li>
            <li>I first bought this to test it on my daughters hair because she has very thick long hair and there are many times where she has issues with her hair getting tangled.</li>
            <li>so it will be right product for active living.  </li>
            <li>Against a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush it&#x27;s better, but still not good for my hair.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t tug on tangles, as long as you gently brush your hair, the tangles should untangle without pain.</li>
            <li>Definitely not worth the price for us, but from other review I wonder if it works better on thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I tried a bazillion brushes before but this one finally works on my thick long hair like magic!</li>
            <li>I have very, very long straight hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my husband who has very long, very curly hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has long, slightly curly-straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>in that it detangled nothing -- the bristles were simply too fragile to do much of anything.  </li>
            <li>As with a lot of things like this, I was skeptical that it would do what it promises, but it sure does!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is always hard to detangle unless I&#x27;ve used gobs of conditioner.</li>
            <li>major cons</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy/curly hair and it tangles so much after I shower and this brush just works right through my tangles.</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine hair on the longish side and wanted a brush that would detangle my hair without damaging it.  </li>
            <li>It went right through my tangled mess without a pull or a snag and not a bunch of hair on the floor.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and the bristles of this brush sort of just brush the top layer and everything underneath remains untouched.</li>
            <li>too hard of bristles to be pain free detangling, tore through hair as well.</li>
            <li>I have been growing my hair out for a year, and it&#x27;s finally starting to get down to my shoulders, but it tangles SO easily when I shampoo it and towel dry it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter if their hair is wet or dry, it works so much better than any other brush I have tried.</li>
            <li>I use huge amounts of conditioner and \\&quot;detangling\\&quot; products, and it still would take me at least 45-60 minutes to work through it all with a wide-tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I generally have to use my fingers to push my hair into the bristles, or else it doesn&#x27;t go all the way through.</li>
            <li>I have long hair not thick</li>
            <li>It works well with short, medium, long, kinky, curly, or straight hair.</li>
            <li>Asian with straight long hair.</li>
            <li>This brush definitely lives up to its claims as far as I&#x27;m concerned</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how this brush does it, but it does get through my very knotty hair even when wet.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old daughter actually begged me to brush her hair instead of fighting me on it.</li>
            <li>Ok...so this is the third brush I have bought (so far).  </li>
            <li>I have really thick, wavy, long hair, and I had to brush the top of my hair</li>
            <li>It glides easy but seems to suddenly snag a bit hard.</li>
            <li>I bought a &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; a few months ago, but I only got so-so results on my long, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>One is straight, the other curly.</li>
            <li>And doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt her as much as some of the other brushes we have tried.</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to as it&#x27;s a little prickly, but it works very, very well and serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>At first there was a little struggle brushing, but it didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>Handles a 4 year old&#x27;s long curly hair with ease.</li>
            <li>I had to use the bush face up in order to pull it through the first few times.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>The bristles of the brush are not very long and probably not meant for thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t lose as much hair because of less pulling.</li>
            <li>I have three young daughters all with different types long hair.  </li>
            <li>Takes two people to work the tangles out type and working at it for 15 - 20minutes(minimum) leaves a mess and there is so much breakage.</li>
            <li>and they are not long enough to go through my hair.</li>
            <li>The main difference and its a giant difference between every other hair brush I ever used is its one solid unit.</li>
            <li>This brush is cheaply made, it scratches my head because the bristles are very hard plastic</li>
            <li>A decent brush, but not worth fifteen dollars.</li>
            <li>Yes, I still have to start at the ends and work up to the scalp, but it goes so much faster, and with little \\&quot;tugging.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work any better than my regular brush, which is the standard oval-shaped with hard bristles that have little balls at the end.  </li>
            <li>As a 51 yr white male with thinning fine hair, aka balding, I was tired of aiding the fallout every time I brushed it.</li>
            <li>Also, there are some giant knots in my hair that might never go away because the bristles are a little too short and gentle to attack them.</li>

            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> It has longer bristles than Tangle Teezer, which is why I got it, but also seems to catch more on snarls than Tangle Teezer does.</li>
            <li> Well, their advertisement at the top of their page says &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t be fooled by impostors.&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I like this brush although it was not as magical as others&#x27; have stated.</li>
            <li> and after I wash it I have so many knots and tangles in my hair</li>
            <li> I think I would have been better off with softer bristles.</li>
            <li> This brush was OK but was not the miracle worker on tangles</li>
            <li> I love this brush</li>
            <li> But, all in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and will continue to use the brush.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Great detangler, just remember to be gentle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to purchase another one just for me! :)</li>
            <li> Also wanted this brush because it&#x27;s much better for your scalp and hair than the plastic ones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed I have more volume in my hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a bit more shiny.</li>
            <li> I love the brush.  </li>
            <li> okay, better than most, but even using it</li>
            <li> When I was combing her hair it felt okay</li>
            <li> I bought more for $4.00 at Sally&#x27;s Hair Supply on sale.</li>
            <li> hope they are pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this hairbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> They love it...</li>
            <li> Comes in cute colors.</li>
            <li> Further the company that sells this was awesome in it&#x27;s follow up.  </li>
            <li> Love the size, too.  </li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> ; I just ordered a couple more.</li>
            <li> I love to use it  before going to bed as it feels great and really stimulates the scalp.,</li>
            <li> He tried it this morning, and he was able to brush his hair with no snags even with &amp;#34;bed-head&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> does what it says in the description, i love the shine it leaves in your hair.</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with a good beard wax, this is the best way to painlessly and stylishly tame the wilderness on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and tangles very easily after washing, or even after having been combed through.</li>
            <li> Just buy a decent tangle remover, use a good conditioner,  and use a set of nice silk pillow cases.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really easy to clean and sanitize - love it!  </li>
            <li> This is the best brush for detangling all day long.  </li>
            <li> She has perfect long ringlets.</li>
            <li> Perfect for long hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent for long curly hair.</li>
            <li> gave 3 stars because the grip on the brush is super nice</li>
            <li> This brush detangled my hair quickly and it also feels nice in my hand.</li>
            <li> My girl loves it and that dsnt come easy for her :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> one is also easy to clean! :)</li>
            <li> The best thing about this brush vs a comb, the hair loss was very little to almost none, and our curl pattern is amazing.</li>
            <li> If anyone is bothered by hair static, try lightly passing a dryer sheet over your hair before brushing.</li>
            <li> I found the product for our hair, worked best when the  hair was wet or moist with conditioner or a detangler product before and after washing.</li>
            <li> Its about 95 percent pain free which I love.</li>
            <li> I bought a detangling brush about a year ago (I think it was Goody) and loved it, but I got this one to replace it because this one has a handle and is much easier to use for me.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old insists on brushing her own hair, and this helps her to do it more effectively.</li>
            <li> I had purchased one of these to use on my my 2 year old daughter, and I started using it and loved it so much that she said that I needed to get my own!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this awesome little brush.</li>
            <li> Its ergonomic and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair tangles so easy</li>
            <li> Goes through easily.</li>
            <li> It glides through my tangled hair easily and doesnâ€™t damage or break my hair.  </li>
            <li> Just as it is advertised it glides thru my hair easily.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that tangles and knots easily.  </li>
            <li> Detangles easily and no pulling.  </li>
            <li> It now sits at her tub for easy access.</li>
            <li> No pulling, easy to hold &amp; store.</li>
            <li> It is silky smooth to run through your hair and will allow for great results (if only I had more hair).  </li>
            <li> Gets her hair nice and detangled, which makes for a much happier mommy and daughter!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight, easy to clean, feels good on my scalp, and gets tangles out.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll just pretend it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Still a HUGE improvement upon that hour a day of my life.</li>
            <li> This brush is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever owned except an old brush that is no longer around called KaoLuna.&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy to clean...</li>
            <li> This brush raked through it well and made my unruly mop smooth and manageable in minutes.</li>
            <li> You know it is doing a great job as there is almost no hair left in the brush after using it.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t too easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I also like the light weight of the brush.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> It also gives my scalp a nice gentle massage.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s two cheap plastic pieces stuck together.</li>
            <li> Sophie will have her own Glide Thru Detangling Brush from Crave Naturals very soon.  </li>
            <li> I just gave 4 stars because the handle is not sufficient for me to have a secure hold on the brush when I am brushing.  </li>
            <li> I have to extend my fingers around part of the brush, crushing some of the bristles..  </li>
            <li> Not worth$14+ for a cheap piece of plastic,looks and feels like a dollar store buy</li>
            <li> It makes a great second brush, and I will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> I, however, gave it away to see how they would enjoy it and will be buying another one using the 25% discount they offer.</li>
            <li> The brush looks well made not too cheap looking.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fantastic this brush is.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t fall for the advertising hype on this cheap piece of plastic,</li>
            <li> So far I have heard nothing but good things about it.  </li>
            <li> feels good on my scalp, works great through my thick hair...</li>
            <li> Works great better then the average brush</li>
            <li> Wife loved it,  she has very curly hair and it glides through like a hot knife in butter,</li>
            <li> No more struggles to get him to brush his hair, he happily does it in his own.</li>
            <li> This brush really does detangle and makes the brushing part of my day much quicker and more enjoyable!</li>
            <li> I love it very much .</li>
            <li> I would recommend, still catches a tiny bit, but for my daughter to allow me to use it is amazing!</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ll never use a different kind!  </li>
            <li> They were excited to find a brush that does not \\&quot;pull\\&quot; to get the tangles.</li>
            <li> This is great for my daughter&#x27;s long snarly hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a unique brush.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price as we all know you pay for what you get!</li>
            <li> As I had stated before, the product I had received originally did not meet my expectations..</li>
            <li> I do brush it from the bottom first and work my way up for a better experience in getting out tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping it would be the answer to my prayers for my toddler&#x27;s super fine hair.</li>
            <li> cause she was so excited about it.</li>
            <li> The end result was smooth, tangle free pretty hair!</li>
            <li> This brush makes combing his hair quicker, easier, and more effective than any of the multiple types of dog brushes I&#x27;ve used on him.</li>
            <li> Plus its ALOT easier to clean because of that feature as well.</li>
            <li> When I first tried my new Crave Naturals Detangling Brush, it felt so good that I tried it on my 18 lb.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it could be anything special</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> the Detangling works good for my hair and very gentle and soft and</li>
            <li> We liked the first one so much that we bought a spare.  </li>
            <li> Wet or dry,this is a great brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great detangling brush I would recommend you use it on wet hair that has been pre-detangled.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, it took a full hour to get through her hair.</li>
            <li> The gentle boar and nylon bristles help to build volume and form curves, while the handle is shaped and faceted to give you a better grip.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get static and my hair looks really shiny.</li>
            <li> I did solve this problem somewhat by wrapping a couple really fat rubber bands around the end to give it more traction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for my granddaughter&#x27;s thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> Brush really does eliminate tangles, love it.</li>
            <li> They love this brush as it really does get the tangles out well and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get a good enough grip on it.</li>
            <li> I mean this wasn&#x27;t the best brush</li>
            <li> The only thing that could make it better would be to add some type of texture grip around the edge and make a version to fit in my pocket!</li>
            <li> The design is interesting too as it&#x27;s not similar to most brushes.</li>
            <li> Even on their most tangled days, it performs better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> This brush has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Saturday I purchased The Wet Brush, and THERE&#x27;S an Amazing brush!</li>
            <li> Loves this hair brush, first try my hair is smooth again and it help a lot with my frizzy hair</li>
            <li> It also pulled on my hair a bit more than my normal paddle brush.</li>
            <li> It works best on my daughter with thick straight hair, and has been successful at speeding up the process and reducing tears for my daughter with long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It glides through knots and tangles easily and gently.  </li>
            <li> Really does detangle hair quite easily.</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it claims to do!  </li>
            <li> I actually bought this out of impulse, but I am so pleased!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have used that does everything promised: no pain and the tangles just disappear!  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00N7HC44S Fantastic Hair Dresser Salon Quality Detangling / Detangler / Hair Styling Glide Through Anti Tangles Brush In Black By VAGA]] is every bit as good as Crave and is 1/3rd the price.</li>
            <li> Thus, I have awarded this brush 4 rather than 3 stars, because I&#x27;m sure it works great for someone whose secret super power is not knotting their hair.</li>
            <li> This is a very good brush for thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t understand what was special about it.</li>
            <li> It is amazing to have something actually work.</li>
            <li> it glides smoothly through hair without pulling too much.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for anyone with the same type of hair.</li>
            <li> I actually forgotten I had purchased it while brushing my 4b type hair until I was catching some kinks &amp; snags in</li>
            <li> My mom, who has very short and straight hair, used it and loved it as well.  </li>
            <li> The handle is good grip and it works as expected.</li>
            <li> Would have been nice if it was solid.</li>
            <li> She is 8yr old and absolutely love it .</li>
            <li> received this complimentary for product testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It was so good that I ordered another one recently-in pink, for my daughter, who loves that color.</li>
            <li> Fresh out of the tub, we use this brush to work through a section at a time.</li>
            <li> But overall a nice brush.</li>
            <li> it is so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably worth it if it were priced around $1.99 to $3.99 but $15.98?  </li>
            <li> The brush is designed where it has many bristles so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as many other brushes.</li>
            <li> The Round Classic Hairbrush is one of the best and most versatile from the range and helps create both soft waves or a shapely classic blowdry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brushes like this one but this brand really is superior to the others because the bristles don&#x27;t lose their shape.</li>
            <li> You can just dive right in anywhere.</li>
            <li> It just glides right through.</li>
            <li> And, it just takes the rats right out!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Also, it caused her hair to have static, which is never does as we live in a very humid area.  </li>
            <li> When he comes out he tells me, &amp;#34;ma, this brush is &amp;#34;THE ONE&amp;#34; it really works and its not painful.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, kind of wavy hair</li>
            <li> My child has copious amount of fine hair, and she has a very sensitive head.</li>
            <li> Great for tangles in long curly hair--if you work carefully from the ends, it doesn&#x27;t pull out as much hair as my mother brushes, and does not seem to stir up as much static electricity in heating months.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing fun about combing through a tangled pile of hair especially if you&#x27;ve had it in a top knot for two days.</li>
            <li> They both have long, fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li> If it had a little more weight to it I would feel more in control of brushing my hair instead of hoping it doesn&#x27;t fly out of my hand while brushing out those hard tangles.</li>
            <li> I read the positive reviews and figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I use it on my four year old sons near waist length hair and it is pretty darn amazing.</li>
            <li> Traditional hair brushes can catch your fine hairs in between the needles/base and break or rip your hair out!</li>
            <li> The Detangling Brush has given me great results and goes through my hair softly, unlike other brushes I have tried.  </li>
            <li> not only does this brush feel good to use but its size and shape make it easy to hold when detangling wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Much easier for little hands trying to brush their own hair!</li>
            <li> Works really well!  </li>
            <li> So then remembering I had just received this brush in the mail days before I tried it out for the first time and was pleasantly surprised at how much easier my hair was becoming untangled.</li>
            <li> She said this pulled more than her regular brush.</li>
            <li> I have purchased from this company before, and I would be glad to do business with them in the future.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> If youâ€™re looking to achieve a perfectly polished salon finish, this brush really helps to tease out and hold separate strands to give you the opportunity to focus on individual sections of your hair and ensure an all round glossy look.</li>
            <li> Since we&#x27;ve received it she&#x27;s had no problems brushing her hair and actually wants to do it!</li>
            <li> My hair definitely looks better after I use it.  </li>
            <li> Please offer a higher quality brush for this price-point.</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the Crave Naturals Detangling Brush were the bristles.</li>
            <li> I usually have to tug and pull with a regular brush, but this is awesome.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a guy) that this brush is pretty close.</li>
            <li> I had a Tangle Teezer, which also works pretty well, but this one was recommended to me by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I received this on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I only ran it through my hair 4 times and it was brushed nicely and no tangles!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> Besides the uncomfortable handle, it is an awesome brush!</li>
            <li> Same thing for much better price.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do--detangle your hair without breaking.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> It feels far too light like it&#x27;s a plastic toy.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;unique&amp;#34; cone shaped plastic bristles look exactly like the bristles on all of my brushes.  </li>
            <li> I tried it as well, and even though my hair is straight it does get tangled, so I&#x27;m ordering one for me!</li>
            <li> I cannot say exactly what &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; distinguishes this brush from others, but I can say that based on her feedback, the discomfort and pulling have been substantially reduced.  </li>
            <li> My hair is curly and dry, so tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li> It would look great in a bold red &amp; black.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a strand of hair in this brush as yet unlike the other brushes I own.</li>
            <li> With hardly any effort and with great gentleness to the hair ~ all detangling was accomplished.  </li>
            <li> It works fine right handed only.</li>
            <li> Portable, nice shape, holy cow</li>
            <li> I switched back to a good ol&#x27; giant paddle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally got my own brush ,it&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t scrape my head!!The benefit outweighs the cost .</li>
            <li> I have short, basically straight hair that I find to be one of those top 10 things I would change about myself if I could if I could.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thick hair that gets tangled VERY easily and is a bear to comb after washing.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought this brush was just another con, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> The first one was for my daughter who is bi-racial and has very kinky hair.  </li>
            <li> The old fashioned round shampoo brush that I got from Duane Reade for $5.00 was much stronger than this one, and gives a great scalp massage.</li>
            <li> I tried to use the brush as my first detangling tool, but it was really inefficient.</li>
            <li> The brush feels great, I just wish that it is either straight like a regular brush or curves the other way for right-handed use.</li>
            <li> It certainly does &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Excellent function.</li>
            <li> Great for my thick hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her new Detangling brush and she uses it right after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> I received the Crave Natural Detangler Brush and tried it out on my wet tangled hair and it works like magic!  </li>
            <li> I literally find no difference between this and my regular brush for combing through the knots and tangles in my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thinning hair, and I think this brush will save it from further destruction.  </li>
            <li> Brushes right through my hair with no trouble and no tangles!</li>
            <li> I never would have thought a brush could make such a difference, not only is there little to no hair being pulled out, but I get much better coverage of my scalp with my remaining thinning fine hair, better than any brush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much, but I certainly shed just as much in the process.</li>
            <li> This brush is good for a parent to brush a child&#x27;s hair, but I have a hard time using it on myself.</li>
            <li> My toddler son has really curly hair</li>
            <li> I Have Really Curly Hair</li>
            <li> It really does glide through my hair.</li>
            <li> It has worked really well for us.  </li>
            <li> and this brush has really helped glife through her hair with ease,</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this brush.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with detangling regardless of hair type.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a very curly hair which tangles all the time, this comb helps me to untangle them without hurting her.</li>
            <li> Very ergonomic</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the brush is very ergonomic for the person who is using the brush.</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was ready to go get a haircut</li>
            <li> The brush has a wide barrel, if I hold the brush by the barrel, the curve seems more suited for a left-handed user.  </li>
            <li> We both have problems with our hair getting very knotted up with tangles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very prone to tangling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ergonomic and really works very well.</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush is much better.</li>
            <li> It really performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> It takes about the same amount of time to get through her hair, but the process is now pain free.</li>
            <li> It gets the tangles out of my very tangly hair without pain or damage.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well with a bit of patience.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> It would be especially gentle for a kiddo, but it probably won&#x27;t replace your regular brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush is very asymmetrical.</li>
            <li> It would hurt alot and most of time I would do it with my hair wet.</li>
            <li> This thing really detangles, without hurting my scalp.</li>
            <li> It hurts my scalp and is very unforgiving.  </li>
            <li> My 10 year is very picky about how a brush feels on his head and he likes this one.</li>
            <li> I felt like it didn&#x27;t really detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> ; I am absolutely elated with this purchase.</li>
            <li> it made for any type of hair so the whole family can use it..would def reccommend</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much fuller.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my tangly hair.</li>
            <li> I truly like the ergonomic handle but not the even length bristles so much.  </li>
            <li> I think this works very well.</li>
            <li> but it really does make the process much easier.  </li>
            <li> They are very durable.</li>
            <li> After posting my review here I was contacted by customer service and they were very responsive to my concerns and offered a refund for my dissatisfaction in the product.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel it is really that good for thick hair, because it can&#x27;t brush all the way through.</li>
            <li> But this baby here wet or really dry hair it will detangle your hair with no problem coming from a guy this a great product highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice plastic brush with plastic bristles that can get through tough tangles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it successfully with wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I hope you live it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> I have long hair that gets tangled easily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit harder than my older version, but that might be good because they&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
            <li> Her hair usually falls off very easily but this is really helping with hair loss!</li>
            <li> It caused extreme static issues.  </li>
            <li> ordering a second one of these to keep with my \\&quot;travel\\&quot; supplies -- it&#x27;s definitely worth having two!</li>
            <li> So I bought two more of these for my other two grandchildren.  </li>
            <li> I like this more than any other brush.</li>
            <li> Would like to have a longer handle, perhaps the other model would be better for this.</li>
            <li> It certainly works better than any of my other brushes, but I guess I just have knotty hair!</li>
            <li> My gal is always seeking a brush that will handle her fine yet plentiful and long locks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ideal brush for thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that my Detangling hair went smooth and I do have medium long hair</li>
            <li> My 5 year old who always wake up with Medussa-like hair absolutely loves this product!</li>
            <li> Not worth this price, but still an okay brush.  </li>
            <li> Just transitioned from natural to straight and this helps keep my hair from tangling and no breakage!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it DOES feel good on the scalp and it brushes through my hair after it&#x27;s dry, but heck, my other hairbrushes do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I use this brush while blow drying my hair and it has made my hair a ton more softer and with 95% less tangle issues.</li>
            <li> This brush easily smoothed out my hair even when wet.</li>
            <li> It seems to get tangles out of my hair better than my previous brush/comb</li>
            <li> Still, it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> Both of us (male and female) are pleased with this purchase.... of 2 separate brushes.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp so brushing my hair or doing anything with it hurts!</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush</li>
            <li> I wish I could find something a little better.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WoW!!</li>
            <li> great results in less time with less of my hair in the brush.</li>
            <li> We both have super thick hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Got it for my daughter, who has fine, straight hair that always seems to be tangled up and which causes much screaming and crying when it&#x27;s time to brush it all out.  </li>
            <li> Let me start this by saying My for year old is very tender headed and has beyond curly hair.</li>
            <li> Wow it really works.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to getting this for my 7 and 9 year old girls.  </li>
            <li> Good brush; not a great brush.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, which equals frizz on our high humidity days (which is 90% of the time).  </li>
            <li> but I think it work out fine for other uses.</li>
            <li> and I feel like this brush is totally fine for other hair types.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, even my 7yr and 2yr old can use it with minimal pain.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry (I live in Colorado) and gets tangled up all the time which is a nightmare, this brush slides right through without ripping and tearing hair out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with short fine hair and would only need it in the morning when my hair would be tangled.</li>
            <li> The face of the brush is slightly concave, versus most every other brush I have used that is very convex, and that seems to make up a large part of why this works so well.</li>
            <li> and I am still shopping for a new hair brush.</li>
            <li> a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone looking for a new brush to keep.</li>
            <li> Glide brush  definitely make get ready routine much easier.</li>
            <li> I was just playing with the thought of cutting it shorter to have it more manageable, even though I love the length...</li>
            <li> Brush is concave (center bristles are recessed more than the outer ones), so it combs evenly over the entire head.  </li>
            <li> Not much more to say other than this is a great product that does what it claims and does it near effortlessly.</li>
            <li> No other brush has ever been so gentle on her hair.</li>
            <li> used to use a hair pick to comb my hair after showers, but this works so much better and hurts far less!  </li>
            <li> I get the very soft wavy curls.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Especially now that the weather is hot and humid.</li>
            <li> I give this product five stars because my six year old daughter not cry!  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I ordered - the first went to my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old now loves to brush his hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my child whose hair gets pretty knotted daily.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, stick straight, long, whispy, and full of static.</li>
            <li> Hair feels smooth to the touch with much less frizz.</li>
            <li> I am able to brush my hair in the morning after I towel dry it, and this brush takes the tangles out without the pain, and without ripping out as much hair as my previous brush.</li>
            <li> Thru Detangling Brush created a core range of styling hair tools for easy everyday use delivering maximum results.</li>
            <li> in 10-minutes, that knotted mess became a smooth body of hair and without the slightest pulls/tugs.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks they have contacted me again with an offer for a NEW and Improved product to try FREE..</li>
            <li> When I use it on dry hair it tugs against the tangles and doesn&#x27;t feel right.  </li>
            <li> But I will stress that it only purely works after showers, or with wet/damp hair.</li>
            <li> I had been eyeing this brush and was a little skeptical that it was as wonderful as everyone said.</li>
            <li> my old brush didn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> daughter has Aspergers and is EXTREMELY sensitive when I am brushing her hair.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I use it on my 4 year old daughter as well as on myself.</li>
            <li> My three year old loves this brush.</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I drop it frequently as it doesn&#x27;t have any type of grip on the handle.</li>
            <li> Now all I can say is WOW,</li>
            <li> This brush is a complete lifesaver and must have.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old has natural hair, his mini Afro which he adores</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think it would make such a difference</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 11 year old and she loves it.  </li>
            <li> Much easier than any brush i have used prior.</li>
            <li> My worries were that all the reviews were for women or young girls.</li>
            <li> manufacturer however needs to make handle longer much too short.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this brush.  </li>
            <li> I wish I  knew  about this brush  early in my life.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length 4B natural hair.</li>
            <li> I shared it with a four year old friend of mine with baby-fine hair</li>
            <li> Brushing with &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; combs or brushes caused considerable discomfort and hair pulling.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider this a negative thing, however, considering how painless and effective it is compared to getting out tangles with my regular brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much more gentle than my regular brush, especially when wet (I haven&#x27;t used my regular one since getting this in the mail!).  </li>
            <li> Glides right through dry or wet hair with absolute ease-- no pulling!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair tangles easily and we usually have to use a detangler in her hair,</li>
            <li> The one unique thing I can see is that the center bristles are shorter than the ones around the outside.  </li>
            <li> Not as magic as many others described... and probably not perfect for thick and straight hair like mine, it is easier than normal brush to get through hair..</li>
            <li> It removes the tangles easily with a lot less breakage than my regular hair brush.  </li>
            <li> I suppose this is a decent enough brush, but far from the detangling miracle worker it&#x27;s claimed to be.</li>
            <li> I have below shoulder length VERY thick, coarse, hair, and this brush does an awesome job detangling it, both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: Over two years and many brushings through thick, cotton-like hair later and it&#x27;s still like new with all of the bristles intact.</li>
            <li> Moderately disappointing as it doesn&#x27;t do a great job on my fine hair when wet- would recommend the wet brush instead</li>
            <li> It is really a phenomenal product and a serious time saver.</li>
            <li> It is really a phenomenal product and a serious time saver.</li>
            <li> It even left a slight silky smooth feel to my hair when I was done.</li>
            <li> This brush works well on my dry hair, leaving it smooth and shiny-looking; however, I did deduct a star from my rating because 1) it does not work at all (not even a bit) on my wet hair, 2)</li>
            <li> I first bought this to test it on my daughters hair because she has very thick long hair and there are many times where she has issues with her hair getting tangled.</li>
            <li> so it will be right product for active living.  </li>
            <li> Against a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush it&#x27;s better, but still not good for my hair.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t tug on tangles, as long as you gently brush your hair, the tangles should untangle without pain.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price for us, but from other review I wonder if it works better on thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I tried a bazillion brushes before but this one finally works on my thick long hair like magic!</li>
            <li> I have very, very long straight hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband who has very long, very curly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, slightly curly-straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> in that it detangled nothing -- the bristles were simply too fragile to do much of anything.  </li>
            <li> As with a lot of things like this, I was skeptical that it would do what it promises, but it sure does!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is always hard to detangle unless I&#x27;ve used gobs of conditioner.</li>
            <li> major cons</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy/curly hair and it tangles so much after I shower and this brush just works right through my tangles.</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine hair on the longish side and wanted a brush that would detangle my hair without damaging it.  </li>
            <li> It went right through my tangled mess without a pull or a snag and not a bunch of hair on the floor.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and the bristles of this brush sort of just brush the top layer and everything underneath remains untouched.</li>
            <li> too hard of bristles to be pain free detangling, tore through hair as well.</li>
            <li> I have been growing my hair out for a year, and it&#x27;s finally starting to get down to my shoulders, but it tangles SO easily when I shampoo it and towel dry it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if their hair is wet or dry, it works so much better than any other brush I have tried.</li>
            <li> I use huge amounts of conditioner and \\&quot;detangling\\&quot; products, and it still would take me at least 45-60 minutes to work through it all with a wide-tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I generally have to use my fingers to push my hair into the bristles, or else it doesn&#x27;t go all the way through.</li>
            <li> I have long hair not thick</li>
            <li> It works well with short, medium, long, kinky, curly, or straight hair.</li>
            <li> Asian with straight long hair.</li>
            <li> This brush definitely lives up to its claims as far as I&#x27;m concerned</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how this brush does it, but it does get through my very knotty hair even when wet.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter actually begged me to brush her hair instead of fighting me on it.</li>
            <li> Ok...so this is the third brush I have bought (so far).  </li>
            <li> I have really thick, wavy, long hair, and I had to brush the top of my hair</li>
            <li> It glides easy but seems to suddenly snag a bit hard.</li>
            <li> I bought a &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; a few months ago, but I only got so-so results on my long, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> One is straight, the other curly.</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt her as much as some of the other brushes we have tried.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to as it&#x27;s a little prickly, but it works very, very well and serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> At first there was a little struggle brushing, but it didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Handles a 4 year old&#x27;s long curly hair with ease.</li>
            <li> I had to use the bush face up in order to pull it through the first few times.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the brush are not very long and probably not meant for thicker hair.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t lose as much hair because of less pulling.</li>
            <li> I have three young daughters all with different types long hair.  </li>
            <li> Takes two people to work the tangles out type and working at it for 15 - 20minutes(minimum) leaves a mess and there is so much breakage.</li>
            <li> and they are not long enough to go through my hair.</li>
            <li> The main difference and its a giant difference between every other hair brush I ever used is its one solid unit.</li>
            <li> This brush is cheaply made, it scratches my head because the bristles are very hard plastic</li>
            <li> A decent brush, but not worth fifteen dollars.</li>
            <li> Yes, I still have to start at the ends and work up to the scalp, but it goes so much faster, and with little \\&quot;tugging.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work any better than my regular brush, which is the standard oval-shaped with hard bristles that have little balls at the end.  </li>
            <li> As a 51 yr white male with thinning fine hair, aka balding, I was tired of aiding the fallout every time I brushed it.</li>
            <li> Also, there are some giant knots in my hair that might never go away because the bristles are a little too short and gentle to attack them.</li>
            <li> but if you have thin then buy it because this doesn&#x27;t do good with thick hair</li>
            <li> Not for super thick and long hair, doesn&#x27;t penetrate very deep at all.</li>
            <li> First, I finger detangled and then applied a little more conditioner and went over the same sections with his brush.&lt;br /&gt;There were no snags, very little hair was shed unlike in the past when I used a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> First, I finger detangled and then applied a little more conditioner and went over the same sections with his brush.&lt;br /&gt;There were no snags, very little hair was shed unlike in the past when I used a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> of my girls have long, super thick hair.</li>
            <li> But then I realized that less hair was being ripped off of my head compared to a normal hair brush.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin, fine hair and it gets snarls and tangles from the air (I swear).</li>
            <li> UNfortunately I tried it first on an extra curly wig (sent by error as I ordered a straight wig -- they are sending the correct wig now).</li>
            <li> so if you brush your hair with this and aren&#x27;t paying attention, you will scratch your skull and too much brushing will make it raw.</li>
            <li> At first I was unsure because I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> Is this only to be used on DRY</li>
            <li> (why I purchased it) and dry hair and same results.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it completely stops the screaming and crying, but it definitely has lessened it!  </li>
            <li> Does not seem to pull and break hair as much as regular brush especially with wet hair,</li>
            <li> , there were only a few &amp;#34;tugs&amp;#34; as I brushed her out following the morning in the pool.&lt;br /&gt;Third, it took a TOTAL of 10-minutes to comb</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hard for my son who has straight hair, but for my curly haired son (shoulder length medium sized ringlet curls)and me</li>
            <li> Husband has super long, slightly curly, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair and this brush just glides right through it; wet or dry.</li>
            <li> BUT besides that one bad thing, this brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> It also is supposedly shaped to fit your hand; that&#x27;s a fail.</li>
            <li> When wet, only use a comb and start from the ends and go up.  </li>
            <li> She has long hair</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> brush is made out of plastic - long term will it hold up?</li>
            <li> Sending it back because I found a wet brush that does the job, before I received this in the mail.</li>
            <li> The message part just lulls him into a rest that lasts as long as I keep brushing.  </li>
            <li> (I have fairly long hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a strange shape</li>
            <li> The bristles in my old brush were bent and falling off after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have curly, kinky hair that is really long.</li>
            <li> So, I used a wide tooth comb to get thru and knots then used the brush for that final detangle.</li>
            <li> They all have long hair of varying types, so I could get comments all over the board,  </li>
            <li> I have long color treated hair and always fight tangles.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my thick long hear.  </li>
            <li> He has a standard little boy hair cut, not long at all.</li>
            <li> This brush has slightly tapered bristles that are set in the head at several different levels or tiers.</li>
            <li> And with these results on wet hair, I definitely didn&#x27;t try it on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> and I have black African American hair.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it hurts when you remove a snarl or tangle just like any other brush including the $5 Wal-Mart brushes.</li>
            <li> Very different from any other similar&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d recommend to other such dog</li>
            <li> and I like it compared to the other regular combs/brushes that we&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too soft, too short for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I usually start towards the bottom and use small strokes to get through tough tangles but most of the time I can just brush straight through with little to no issues.</li>
            <li> just pat dry.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t not use on DRY hair</li>
            <li> I tried this brush with my dry hair</li>
            <li> In 15-20 minutes, I can work through the tangles, and then either air dry or blow dry</li>
            <li> She hates to have it brushed, but grows dreadlocks when exposed to any sort of wind or active play.</li>
            <li> I found the bristles to be a little TOO stiff for my thinner, dyed, straight hair; so I use the detangling brush by Bella &amp; Bear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long hair that is all the way down my back.  </li>
            <li> This brush hardly hits a snag and when it does it&#x27;s not hard getting it out.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not long enough to even brush through my hair; I have to do small sections.</li>
            <li> and I only have average size hands.</li>
            <li> I think that I only lost two strands in it when I brushed out my entire thick, curly head of hair.</li>
            <li> Works well with both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Takes maybe a minute to brush through it all wet AND dry.</li>
            <li> The only improvement I would make is a slightly longer handle.</li>
            <li> I do notice that it goes through my long, wavy (not curly) hair somewhat easier than my other brushes</li>
            <li> This brush is like 3 dimensionally molded out of a single piece of plastic, SO, guess what?!?</li>
            <li> Works no better than Aveda flat wooden brush,  which I already owned.  </li>
            <li> I find the handle a little too short.  </li>
            <li> not quite the quality I expected, but useable.</li>
            <li> Then carefully rinse and don&#x27;t rub your hair with a towel -</li>
            <li> These bristles are firm enough to get through the hair but don&#x27;t scratch the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have tried using it with both wet</li>
            <li> It does pull a few strands out, but nothing like the regular brush I was using.</li>
            <li> I recommend The Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> When I brush through the curls it brushes nicely,not like a fluff ball at the end look.</li>
            <li> Easier to use when hair is wet.</li>
            <li> It detangles wet hair like nobody&#x27;s business; I don&#x27;t care what your hair texture is.</li>
            <li> i tried this as soon as i got it on my wet hair</li>
            <li> I also used this on wet hair in the shower</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter with straight thin hair has reaped the benefits as well.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on wet hair just because I like using a wide tooth comb for detangling when I&#x27;ve washed my hair.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the wet brush my wife uses.</li>
            <li> And then it&#x27;s not gentle -</li>
            <li> I can wash it with soap and water and place it upside down to dry.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter has hair past her waste and it&#x27;s always so tangled.  </li>
            <li> &#x27; long; but still not enough grip to hold while brushing thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Its kind of hard to explain, but, traditional brushes have a handle/base and a bunch of bristles/needles that separately connect to the base.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to any other girl.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that&#x27;s exactly why I bought this brush - to detangle my wet hair!  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get the brush thru my hair while wet!</li>
            <li> If i were to brush my hair any other time, it pulls and rips my hair like any other brush.</li>
            <li> She has not given me any trouble with brushing her hair as long as she uses this hairbrush.</li>
            <li> This helps one get started while I work on the other.</li>
            <li> years ago when I was brushing my crying long- haired daughtersâ€™ hair .  </li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical of this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed when brushing my son&#x27;s hair, there is much less breakage (compared to a regular brush) which means less pain!</li>
            <li> This is really NOT a detangling brush, unless your idea of detangling is ripping out the tangles!</li>
            <li> No better than a regular brush.  </li>
            <li> Brush is small and bristles extremely short...</li>
            <li> This may work on other hair types but not on my 4c hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the brush based on the other reviews and was not disapointed.</li>
            <li> Bristles are sharp on scalp.  </li>
            <li> Still hurts, still need to grab my hair so that it doesn&#x27;t yank at my scalp, and like other brushes if I don&#x27;t force it, it just skims OVER the knot.</li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t comb as well as other brushes.</li>
            <li> i have had other detangler brushes but they didn&#x27;t have handles.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using any other brush.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical at first and a bit hesitant to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I will look at this company again for other products because the quality of this brush and their follow up.</li>
            <li> I am amazed by this wet brush!</li>
            <li> Brushing her hair is torture for both of us, and from other reviews, I was hopefully this might solve the problem.</li>
            <li> it rips the hair and pulls it out, but not quite as much as my other brushes in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He is always complaining that other brushes hurt and pull his  hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this black brush for myself and I also bought 2 other pink brushes for my two granddaughters.  </li>
            <li> If the bristles are too long or too stiff and you have knots</li>
            <li> Also, thought the brush was black, I received pink.</li>
            <li> Not only does this brush scratch the scalp (the bristles are hard and on the sharp side), it yanks the hair out too.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the handle.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the lack of of color options.  </li>
            <li> No more pulling of long coats.</li>
            <li> She just has such thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have massively thick curly tangle-y blonde hair</li>
            <li> Also, unlike the comb, you can start from the scalp and brush down.</li>
            <li> I have to hold upside down</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reason for the 4 star is because of the handle tapers down making your hand to slid down.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike the comb, you can start from the scalp and brush down.</li>
            <li> (I usually air dry).  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with it, but to be fair, my hair dreads up worse than the haunches of an un-groomed Persian cat.</li>
            <li> Because of his curls tighten up overnight the tangles were endless; breaking his hair and all kinds of crying.</li>
            <li> less tugging involved.</li>
            <li> Less pulling and hurting for their tender heads.</li>
            <li> Thankful they had black...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdier than the Tangle Teezer and pulls out much less hair.</li>
            <li> I have heavy, thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Hence the odd shape in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Handle hard to grip with long hair.  </li>
            <li> hard to grip and go thru long hair..especially with slippery hair products on hands.</li>
            <li> It is hard to hold on to while doing the longer hair in back, and the brush is so soft that it is fairly useless for styling my hair into a ponytail.  </li>
            <li> At least 18 inches long.</li>
            <li> I used on my daughter who has tight spiral curls.</li>
            <li> We all have very long, thick hair</li>
            <li> and I hate brushing it, mostly because I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li> Grabs on to the dead hair which results in less hair in the shower/bathtub drain.  </li>
            <li> As a guy I started using it as soon as i got it, on my dry thick and wavy hair to see if it didn&#x27;t hurt or get tangled.</li>
            <li> A little on the pricey side as 16 dollars is probably twice what it should cost..</li>
            <li> Your little one will thank you.</li>
            <li> I did tangle a little bit.</li>
            <li> Also I wish the handle was longer and a little firmer.</li>
            <li> The brush&#x27;s plastic bristles are much too thin and weak to be of any use to anyone regardless of hair length or texture.  </li>
            <li> Now I have very thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> The tips of the bristles are hard on my scalp - I&#x27;ll have to adjust and be careful.</li>
            <li> Also Crave Naturals has a money back guarantee so if you are not happy which I know wont be the case.</li>
            <li> waste your money.  </li>
            <li> It would take me a few minutes to brush through it too.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a few days and I immediately tried it.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has curly hair like mine that will frizz out, but it is thin instead of thick/course.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for a few months</li>
            <li> But, it works wonders on my hair once it&#x27;s dried.  </li>
            <li> it seems a little stiff.</li>
            <li> I lose a lot of hair with this brush, but at least it doesn&#x27;t hurt me like my other brushes do.</li>
            <li> so it is not easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> The hair must be wet and bushes out in small parts if scalp is tender and hair is  thick.</li>
            <li> The first one went to my granddaughter who hated her hair brushed because of her tangles.  </li>
            <li> Their hair is long and very thick.</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer who said it was not good for wet hair.  </li>
            <li> This \\&quot;detangling brush\\&quot; is a pointless waste of money,</li>
            <li> Works but awkward to hold, especially when your hands are wet.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t just brush my hair, but have to take sections small enough for the brush which is tedious.  </li>
            <li> I have bought another brand in the past that I like</li>
            <li> I have given a past review on this brush.</li>
            <li> so if I don&#x27;t braid it there&#x27;s usually a bunch of knots to work out)</li>
            <li> My daughter has (past) waist length hair and so the purchase was made with her in mind.&lt;br /&gt;Mid-morning</li>
            <li> No more struggles with pain for him, he enjoys it.</li>
            <li> the handle/brush shape can be a bit difficult for me to hold onto (especially if my hands are damp or have product on them), and 3) it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have for those with small girls.</li>
            <li> I still usually have to work away at my tangles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting split ends as usual.</li>
            <li> not sure how it does it,</li>
            <li> It also makes it shiny, with no static electricity.  </li>
            <li> The handle is also quite small, even for a girl like me with small hands.</li>
            <li> I have very heavy hair with a baby-fine texture, and get lots of tangles.  </li>
            <li> It did make my hair very fluffy.</li>
            <li> The first time we used it we were skeptical due to the fact that it is quite painful removing knots.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed, chemically treated hair and was very skeptical of this brush, but I am so pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> If their hair is super horrible one day I spray a little detangler in.</li>
            <li> This brush has definitely made doing my hair in the morning a lot easier, as well as a lot less painful.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s so hard to manage &amp; brush.</li>
            <li> My hair is hard to manage</li>
            <li> Plastic bristles hard to get used too.  </li>
            <li> The handle of this brush is WAY too hard to hold.</li>
            <li> but the bristles are too hard on the scalp.</li>
            <li> little ones,, and by the way no tears!!</li>
            <li> My hair had begun tangling badly and all my old fixes were not working.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the brush has no substance and is slightly awkward in my hand.</li>
            <li> No tangles or struggling to get the brush thru with the least amount of pain.</li>
            <li> Brush sucks.  </li>
            <li> Not for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter she has thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> We started off slowly</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law said she can&#x27;t believe how well this brush goes through her daughters thick hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, and loves to get matted.</li>
            <li> but it kinda did its job if you have thick hair</li>
            <li> Btw I am a guy with poofy hair, really thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick to I have to brush it in sections.</li>
            <li> This brush is a must-have for anyone with a thick beard.  </li>
            <li> I have hip-length thick naturally-curly hair, and always have problems with tangling after washing.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so thick I can&#x27;t run a comb through it.</li>
            <li> This brush does not rid thick hair of tangles.</li>
            <li> I had been forced to put leave in conditioner in my hair when I wash it every other day because it was the only way to brush my hair without tearing it all out, but I hate doing that in the summer because the humidity made it feel gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this brush a try if all other brushes failed you</li>
            <li> NO more shredded hair!</li>
            <li> ~before any serious hair-brushing had been done, I handed the Glide Thru to my daughter to see how well its&#x27; promises were kept.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical until i used it.&lt;br /&gt;Works for everything- to detangle your hair, style/blow-dry &amp;&lt;br /&gt;great to straighten your hair-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to hold if you&#x27;re brushing product through your hair, but when I do that I just hold on to the brush head rather than the handle.  </li>
            <li> The handle is awful, no grip, slips right out of hand every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Also, I agree with other reviewers that the shape is awkward.</li>
            <li> This brush is a very hard plastic and the bristles are pointy</li>
            <li> My son has very long hair but finds brushing painful.</li>
            <li> and this is often tough for hairbrushes to get through.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter she has very thick hair and gets a lot of tangles.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> and that is a little awkward</li>
            <li> It prevents unnecessary pulling out of tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Thin hair</li>
            <li> My thin hair does not benefit from this quality of a brush.  </li>
            <li> The little balls on the tips of other nylon bristle brushes are terrible for curly hair, as the strands wrap around the balls and tear out.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair and unfortunately this brush is not all its hyped up to be.</li>
            <li> I hate the color pink.</li>
            <li> and I felt bad in the past using a comb on it and hurting him.  </li>
            <li> Pulled my hair and I was just not impressed with the design of the brush.</li>
            <li> I tried failed.</li>
            <li> sometimes it gets weird dust stuck on it</li>
            <li> its weird.</li>
            <li> This causes me to lose the benefit of all the bristles and I feel that over time, those bristles will lose their shape and become useless.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical when Is aw this brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its how the companies handle things when they go wrong that counts..</li>
            <li> It is useless to me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a perfect glide.</li>
            <li> I use both hands to brush my hair and beard and it feels awkward.</li>
            <li> They always get caught on the brush, so she&#x27;s afraid of the hair brush.</li>
            <li> I had contemplated cutting it to her shoulders</li>
            <li> However, the curve of the brush is awkward.  </li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re just afraid you&#x27;ll find those &amp;#34;impostors&amp;#34; and save money.</li>
            <li> Plus the handle is awkward to hold.  </li>
            <li> Very sad situation.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> So, I can&#x27;t give it a bad rating based on that.</li>
            <li> there were still tugs but not too bad</li>
            <li> and I was SHOCKED at how well it works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased for my child that gets ugly tangles, rats nests.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I really hate brushing my knots out.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush!!!</li>
            <li> I have always had a horrible time brushing both of their hair, it gets sooo tangled</li>
            <li> Terrible quality for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter has terribly tangled hair and this brush does the job!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Although this brush didn&#x27;t work for us, the customer service was excellent.</li>
            <li> This brush is great and works as stated in the description.</li>
            <li> the handle is so short I have to hold it by the body of the brush to keep it in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;The function work well for getting the knots out of my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, kind of wavy hair and she loves this brush! A little on the pricey side as 16 dollars is probably twice what it should cost..</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair and unfortunately this brush is not all its hyped up to be. The bristles are not long enough to even brush through my hair; I have to do small sections. Secondly, it hurts when you remove a snarl or tangle just like any other brush including the $5 Wal-Mart brushes. This brush is a very hard plastic and the bristles are pointy so if you brush your hair with this and aren&#x27;t paying attention, you will scratch your skull and too much brushing will make it raw. It also is supposedly shaped to fit your hand; that&#x27;s a fail. I cant hold on to it that way I have to hold the handle which is about 2&#x27;&#x27; long; but still not enough grip to hold while brushing thick curly hair. I have been using this brush for over 2 months and I am still shopping for a new hair brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush -  for sometimes use!  I don&#x27;t understand why people think they can start from the top and brush all the way to the ends of&lt;br /&gt;their hair.  That will break your hair.  When wet, only use a comb and start from the ends and go up.  To refresh your hair on your way out the door - this is perfect!!</li>
            <li> Great for tangles in long curly hair--if you work carefully from the ends, it doesn&#x27;t pull out as much hair as my mother brushes, and does not seem to stir up as much static electricity in heating months.</li>
            <li> Not for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Not for me.  Pulled my hair and I was just not impressed with the design of the brush.</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY WITH THIS UNIQUE PRODUCT.  DELIGHTED WITH THE COMPANY&#x27;S CUSTOMER RELATIONS.</li>
            <li> not quite the quality I expected, but useable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter she has thick hair. She loves it and it works great.</li>
            <li> The Crave (Glide) brush is wonderful! It went right through my tangled mess without a pull or a snag and not a bunch of hair on the floor.  Don&#x27;t hesitate.  BUY IT!</li>
            <li> not only does this brush feel good to use but its size and shape make it easy to hold when detangling wet hair.  it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause static electricity either.  easy to clean...</li>
            <li> Works we&#x27;ll to delta glue.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that tangles easily. This brush raked through it well and made my unruly mop smooth and manageable in minutes. It&#x27;s not the best detangling comb I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s great for the price.</li>
            <li> It certainly works better than any of my other brushes, but I guess I just have knotty hair!</li>
            <li> Gets the tangles out, and the design fits in the hand perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  My toddler son has really curly hair and I felt bad in the past using a comb on it and hurting him.  This brush works awesome and detangles really easily.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that&#x27;s so hard to manage &amp; brush. But with this &amp; detangler it works excellent. I recommend it to any other girl.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush!! Reduced my hair loss/breakage by 99.9% I swear.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I wanted to see if it actually does detangle like it says and lo and behold, I am very impressed with the quality and design of this actual brush. The brush is designed where it has many bristles so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as many other brushes. I first bought this to test it on my daughters hair because she has very thick long hair and there are many times where she has issues with her hair getting tangled. The first time we used it we were skeptical due to the fact that it is quite painful removing knots. We started off slowly and she did not complain. I was very happy with that. I like the fact that it is not a big brush because its fits perfectly in my hand so I can grip it good and so can my child. I am 100% extremely satisfied with this brush and I definitely recommend it 100%. Also Crave Naturals has a money back guarantee so if you are not happy which I know wont be the case. You can return it. Try it, You will love it. I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Husband has super long, slightly curly, thick hair. The hair that I would love to have. Anyhow, this brush works great for his tangles. I found the bristles to be a little TOO stiff for my thinner, dyed, straight hair; so I use the detangling brush by Bella &amp; Bear.</li>
            <li> Its ergonomic and easy to handle. UNfortunately I tried it first on an extra curly wig (sent by error as I ordered a straight wig -- they are sending the correct wig now). It could not begin to get the curls out but everything (comb or brush) I tried failed. So, I can&#x27;t give it a bad rating based on that. Just realize it has its limits but I think it work out fine for other uses.</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer who said it was not good for wet hair.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s exactly why I bought this brush - to detangle my wet hair!  I bought a &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; a few months ago, but I only got so-so results on my long, fine hair.  I thought this one may have been different.  (Did I misunderstand all the glowing reviews?  Is this only to be used on DRY hair?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it DOES feel good on the scalp and it brushes through my hair after it&#x27;s dry, but heck, my other hairbrushes do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I&#x27;m going back to doing what my stylist told me years ago:  Use a wide-tooth comb with your fingers while detangling conditioner is still in your hair.  Don&#x27;t rinse out all the conditioner.  Then carefully rinse and don&#x27;t rub your hair with a towel - just pat dry.  Comb again with a detangling COMB.  This is the only method that works for me.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that I purchased this. I read the positive reviews and figured it was worth a shot. The brush stills pulls on my daughters hair and she refuses to use it. My daughter has long, slightly curly-straight, fine hair. I&#x27;m not saying the brush is a total fail; I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and dry, so tangles very easily.  This is the best brush for detangling all day long.  It glides through knots and tangles easily and gently.  The little balls on the tips of other nylon bristle brushes are terrible for curly hair, as the strands wrap around the balls and tear out. These bristles are firm enough to get through the hair but don&#x27;t scratch the scalp.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, shoulder length hair and it works OK on it.  I can&#x27;t just brush my hair, but have to take sections small enough for the brush which is tedious.  It is probably a better tool for people with thinner hair.  I have tried using it with both wet (why I purchased it) and dry hair and same results.  The bristles of the brush are not very long and probably not meant for thicker hair.  There are many more detangling combs and brushes that work better.</li>
            <li> A blessing! It works perfectly with my hair! At first I was unsure because I have really thick hair but it helped get all the knots and tangles out ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of this brush! I have long hair not thick and I couldn&#x27;t get the brush thru my hair while wet! I do like it for a good brush out at the end of the day. It does feel great on the scalp and seems to brush away most hair products restoring my hair to a natural healthy shine!</li>
            <li> I have semi-thin hair, and I found that this brush has worked wonders on my hair. The reason why I had only given 4 stars is because it only works on my hair after a shower. If i were to brush my hair any other time, it pulls and rips my hair like any other brush. BUT besides that one bad thing, this brush is amazing. I&#x27;ve had fewer problems with my hair having knots throughout my day. I use this brush while blow drying my hair and it has made my hair a ton more softer and with 95% less tangle issues. At first I thought this brush was just another con, but it really does work. But I will stress that it only purely works after showers, or with wet/damp hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it works, it just does. This brush has slightly tapered bristles that are set in the head at several different levels or tiers. The face of the brush is slightly concave, versus most every other brush I have used that is very convex, and that seems to make up a large part of why this works so well. I use it on my four year old sons near waist length hair and it is pretty darn amazing. You don&#x27;t even have to brush it from the ends to the scalp. You can just dive right in anywhere. You know it is doing a great job as there is almost no hair left in the brush after using it. Not much more to say other than this is a great product that does what it claims and does it near effortlessly. Buy one. Your little one will thank you.</li>
            <li> for some reason while I was gritting my teeth brushing out the tangles in my beard I decided to see if Amazon might have a brush that would eliminate this gritting my teeth. Yikes that hurts! Amazon is like Google. I asked and there it was.This brush hardly hits a snag and when it does it&#x27;s not hard getting it out. I can count the brushes I have bought in my life so I am no expert but I know when something works.  My only complaint is the handle. I use both hands to brush my hair and beard and it feels awkward. It works ok in either hand but it needs to be held in a different position when switching hands. It&#x27;s supposed to look stylish, I guess. It looses a star for the handle.</li>
            <li> hurts to comb my hair when I&#x27;m trying to detangle with this and it isn&#x27;t too easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Moderately disappointing as it doesn&#x27;t do a great job on my fine hair when wet- would recommend the wet brush instead</li>
            <li> This brush works great for thinner straight hair. Which I do have. As for my children whom have curly thicker hair,it wasn&#x27;t so great. I did tangle a little bit. I did receive this brush at a discounted price for a honest review.</li>
            <li> This brush has definitely made doing my hair in the morning a lot easier, as well as a lot less painful. I generally have to use my fingers to push my hair into the bristles, or else it doesn&#x27;t go all the way through. I don&#x27;t consider this a negative thing, however, considering how painless and effective it is compared to getting out tangles with my regular brush. I&#x27;m a white male, but I can see this brush being helpful for anyone. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I Have Really Curly Hair And I Always Had Problems With Tangles . Immediately Using The Brush , It Glides Through My Hair Doesn&#x27;t Hurt Or Pull My Hair . It Also Felt Very Good On The Scalp &amp; I Notice My Hair Is Smoother . This Brush Is Amazing .</li>
            <li> Wife loved it,  she has very curly hair and it glides through like a hot knife in butter,</li>
            <li> This is by far the best detangling tool I&#x27;ve ever come across. I actually forgotten I had purchased it while brushing my 4b type hair until I was catching some kinks &amp; snags in my hair wich was not feeling nice at all. So then remembering I had just received this brush in the mail days before I tried it out for the first time and was pleasantly surprised at how much easier my hair was becoming untangled. It took the pressure and pain away that my regular brush was causing. I&#x27;m talking about feeling so good that brushing my hair was putting me to sleep like a baby. It even left a slight silky smooth feel to my hair when I was done. This brush definitely lives up to its claims as far as I&#x27;m concerned and I&#x27;m very happy ðŸ˜Œ with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how this brush does it, but it does get through my very knotty hair even when wet. It does pull a few strands out, but nothing like the regular brush I was using.</li>
            <li> The kids love this brush</li>
            <li> This brush makes it easy to detangle a child&#x27;s unruly hair in the morning!</li>
            <li> I love this detangling brush. It really does glide through my hair. I bought one to use and one to reserve because I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it. I&#x27;ve tried other brushes like this one but this brand really is superior to the others because the bristles don&#x27;t lose their shape. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> This is my second brush that I purchased.  The first one was for my daughter who is bi-racial and has very kinky hair.  It has worked really well for us.  My mom, who has very short and straight hair, used it and loved it as well.  So I bought my second one for my Mother.  It really does a great job in getting through the tangles without pain but also provides good shine and is an overall great brush for ALL hair types.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This has become a life saver, my daughter HATES her hair brushed. She has perfect long ringlets. They always get caught on the brush, so she&#x27;s afraid of the hair brush. This actually works! It is amazing to have something actually work. I would recommend, still catches a tiny bit, but for my daughter to allow me to use it is amazing!</li>
            <li> It works great definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I was a little skeptical until i used it.&lt;br /&gt;Works for everything- to detangle your hair, style/blow-dry &amp;&lt;br /&gt;great to straighten your hair- i love it! I threw out my other&lt;br /&gt;brushes &amp; combs. Very different from any other similar&lt;br /&gt;product i have tried. It&#x27;s super lightweight &amp; just a great brush!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I actually got this for my dog to brush him. But now I want one for each of us!</li>
            <li> Got this brush for my girl friend. She has been craving for one of the detangling brushes for ages and finally decided on this one. The handle is good grip and it works as expected. Her hair usually falls off very easily but this is really helping with hair loss!</li>
            <li> Works perfect. My daughter&#x27;s hair tangles so easy and this brush has really helped glife through her hair with ease, less tugging involved. I also use it on my hair and love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has type 4a hair and this brush worked great to detangle it. After applying conditioner, I sectioned the hair into 4-6 areas. First, I finger detangled and then applied a little more conditioner and went over the same sections with his brush.&lt;br /&gt;There were no snags, very little hair was shed unlike in the past when I used a wide tooth comb. Also, unlike the comb, you can start from the scalp and brush down. It is really a phenomenal product and a serious time saver. Buy it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like it. sometimes it gets weird dust stuck on it and it takes forever to take off. my old brush didn&#x27;t have that problem. its weird. don&#x27;t like the feel of it either. just my opinion.</li>
            <li> Wish the handle was longer</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it claims to do!  Detangles!  EFFORTLESSLY, it really is a great brush and great value for money!</li>
            <li> my daughter hates getting her hair combed! amazing idea purchasing another asap! this is a lifesaver</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter has hair past her waste and it&#x27;s always so tangled.  She absolutely loves this brush.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in this brush compared to a regular one.</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It&#x27;s amazing how easily it detangles those snarls and desnarls those tangles. No kidding - it&#x27;s an excellent design!  Getchoo one!  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Not for super thick and long hair, doesn&#x27;t penetrate very deep at all. I switched back to a good ol&#x27; giant paddle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 3 stars because the grip on the brush is super nice and I feel like this brush is totally fine for other hair types.</li>
            <li> This brush works great for detangling and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my niece and she loves it.  So far I have heard nothing but good things about it.  She has long hair and she is a dancer so she keeps her hair up while rehearsing so she wanted a detangler that she could use after work outs.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old who always wake up with Medussa-like hair absolutely loves this product! She has not given me any trouble with brushing her hair as long as she uses this hairbrush. Will definitely recommend to fam and friends.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I have bought another brand in the past that I like but it doesn&#x27;t have a handle like this one does. It really helps with detangling regardless of hair type. It is easy to use, even my 7yr and 2yr old can use it with minimal pain. This helps one get started while I work on the other. It works well with short, medium, long, kinky, curly, or straight hair.</li>
            <li> Crave Naturals Glide Thru Detangling Brush may not be the prettiest brush in the arsenal, but it works like a charm!  Got it for my daughter, who has fine, straight hair that always seems to be tangled up and which causes much screaming and crying when it&#x27;s time to brush it all out.  This brush works like a charm and makes hair brushing time much better.  I won&#x27;t say it completely stops the screaming and crying, but it definitely has lessened it!  Gets her hair nice and detangled, which makes for a much happier mommy and daughter!</li>
            <li> My daughter has a very curly hair which tangles all the time, this comb helps me to untangle them without hurting her. Love it.</li>
            <li> The Crave brush is wonderful !!</li>
            <li> We all loved it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt when you brush it, especially first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the functionality of this brush!  Very ergonomic no matter which hand you use and how you brush through your hair.  Works well with both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> AMAZING BRUSH!!!&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter has Aspergers and is EXTREMELY sensitive when I am brushing her hair. The slightest, &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; and she is &#x27;outta there! I had to do something to assist me and found this brush, liked the reviews and ordered it. It was here in 2-days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the brush is very ergonomic for the person who is using the brush. I didn&#x27;t drop the brush nor did it slip.&lt;br /&gt;Second, there were only a few &amp;#34;tugs&amp;#34; as I brushed her out following the morning in the pool.&lt;br /&gt;Third, it took a TOTAL of 10-minutes to comb/brush her out using this brush alone. Incredible. I attached pictures so viewers can see the before and after. No tricks...in 10-minutes, that knotted mess became a smooth body of hair and without the slightest pulls/tugs. Further, our daughter said as I was brushing, &amp;#34;This feels good!&amp;#34;. Wow. WOW! She despises having her hair brushed- I must do it while she is watching a nature program to hold her attention.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, when checking the brush when we finished, there were no hairs that had pulled out during the brushing.&lt;br /&gt;OH, and finally, finally, all knots were removed- even the stubborn knots and all within 10 minutes. Yesterday, it took a full hour to get through her hair. I had contemplated cutting it to her shoulders but she refuses...and now, I don&#x27;t think this will be necessary at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Crave Naturals for this product...coming from a mom with a child that has sensory issues, this brush is fantastic! I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> What more can i say? With the shape, it fits nicely in my hand and glides thru my hair - like buttah.  I RECEIVED THIS AT A REDUCED PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW ONCE I RECEIVED IT.GOES THRU MY HAIR LIKE &#x27;BUTTAH&#x27;!</li>
            <li> If I could give this brush ten stars I would! Great design, fits perfectly in my hand and glides through my hair after showering. No pulling or snagging. This really is genuinely a really good brush. I know I will be buying this brush again.</li>
            <li> I love my crave naturals detangling brush! This is a very nice plastic brush with plastic bristles that can get through tough tangles. I have long hair that gets tangled easily throughout the day. Especially now that the weather is hot and humid. This brush goes through my tangled hair like nothing! I usually start towards the bottom and use small strokes to get through tough tangles but most of the time I can just brush straight through with little to no issues. This brush is now being kept in my purse so I can use it throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t work for us. My child has copious amount of fine hair, and she has a very sensitive head. She said this pulled more than her regular brush. Also, it caused her hair to have static, which is never does as we live in a very humid area.  Update: I&#x27;m really impressed with the customer service of this company, even though this particular product didn&#x27;t work for me. They initiated a refund because I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, and because the item is a hygiene item, I didn&#x27;t have to bother with a return. I have purchased from this company before, and I would be glad to do business with them in the future.</li>
            <li> I am a guy and this brush is a hair-saver! I have been growing my hair out for a year, and it&#x27;s finally starting to get down to my shoulders, but it tangles SO easily when I shampoo it and towel dry it. I had been forced to put leave in conditioner in my hair when I wash it every other day because it was the only way to brush my hair without tearing it all out, but I hate doing that in the summer because the humidity made it feel gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to go get a haircut and then I decided to give this brush a try, and I am so happy with it. I am able to brush my hair in the morning after I towel dry it, and this brush takes the tangles out without the pain, and without ripping out as much hair as my previous brush. The best thing is that I don&#x27;t need to use the conditioner anymore, and I can put my cap right on and go about my day. Great brush!</li>
            <li> This one is mine, now get your own!</li>
            <li> Love this just like a tangle teaser! But love the handle!</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and I hate brushing it, mostly because I&#x27;m lazy. There&#x27;s nothing fun about combing through a tangled pile of hair especially if you&#x27;ve had it in a top knot for two days. I had a bamboo brush for awhile but I felt like I was going bald every time I brushed through it. Also the pain! This Crave Naturals Glide is an improvement. It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much, but I certainly shed just as much in the process. Also, there are some giant knots in my hair that might never go away because the bristles are a little too short and gentle to attack them. 95% of my hair can be tamed by this thing. The rest... well it&#x27;s in the back so I&#x27;ll just pretend it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I lose a lot of hair with this brush, but at least it doesn&#x27;t hurt me like my other brushes do. I wish I could find something a little better.</li>
            <li> I had bought this last year for my daughters and my dog just chewed it to pieces, so I immediately bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of my girls have long, super thick hair. One is straight, the other curly. I have always had a horrible time brushing both of their hair, it gets sooo tangled and they cry every time I brush it. Forget them brushing their own hair, never going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try this brush and I was SHOCKED at how well it works. It doesn&#x27;t matter if their hair is wet or dry, it works so much better than any other brush I have tried. If their hair is super horrible one day I spray a little detangler in. And the best part is they can brush their own hair now.</li>
            <li> I really like the bristles, they feel great on the scalp and there are no beads to get tangled in hair.  I also like the light weight of the brush.  However, the curve of the brush is awkward.  The handle part of the brush is short and tapers off at the end so it is not easy to hold.  The brush has a wide barrel, if I hold the brush by the barrel, the curve seems more suited for a left-handed user.  The brush feels great, I just wish that it is either straight like a regular brush or curves the other way for right-handed use.</li>
            <li> I bought this black brush for myself and I also bought 2 other pink brushes for my two granddaughters.  We all have very long, thick hair and they love their brushes.  My daughter-in-law said she can&#x27;t believe how well this brush goes through her daughters thick hair.  Use to have problems in the morning trying to get a brush through her hair for school.  She loves the brush, too!</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter and she seems to like it,,,I&#x27;ll have to ask her more to get more details..</li>
            <li> Wish I would have purchased it sooner. I love it. Makes my hair smooth. Goes through easily. And feels good! I actually bought this out of impulse, but I am so pleased! I would have never thought a brush could make such an impact. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is not what it says it is. It does pull hair and does not slide through with ease..</li>
            <li> Ideal brush for thick long hair. Glides right through dry or wet hair with absolute ease-- no pulling! Hair feels smooth to the touch with much less frizz. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely remarkable.  Iâ€™ll never use a different kind!  It glides through my tangled hair easily and doesnâ€™t damage or break my hair.  My only regret is that this brush wasnâ€™t around 30+ years ago when I was brushing my crying long- haired daughtersâ€™ hair .  I will definitely recommend this brush for my granddaughters!</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp so brushing my hair or doing anything with it hurts! This brush doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Awesome hairbrush. It&#x27;s very lightweight, easy to clean, feels good on my scalp, and gets tangles out. I use it on my 4 year old daughter as well as on myself. Even my husband loves it and has asked that I buy him his own.</li>
            <li> This is good item.  Hair Treatment and this has also Anti-Static Electricity treatment so it will be right product for active living.  Crave Naturals Glide Thru Detangling Brush created a core range of styling hair tools for easy everyday use delivering maximum results. The Round Classic Hairbrush is one of the best and most versatile from the range and helps create both soft waves or a shapely classic blowdry. The gentle boar and nylon bristles help to build volume and form curves, while the handle is shaped and faceted to give you a better grip. If youâ€™re looking to achieve a perfectly polished salon finish, this brush really helps to tease out and hold separate strands to give you the opportunity to focus on individual sections of your hair and ensure an all round glossy look.</li>
            <li> Excellent! My three year old loves this brush. Since we&#x27;ve received it she&#x27;s had no problems brushing her hair and actually wants to do it! It doesn&#x27;t catch any knots but detangles them very easily. She&#x27;s not even worried to have another person brush her hair if they use this brush.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this sooner. My daughter and I both have thick hair. My hair is wavy and her&#x27;s is curly. We both have problems with our hair getting very knotted up with tangles. The brush works great on both our hair. So happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have very, very long straight hair. It&#x27;s also very prone to tangling. I was pretty skeptical of this brush. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s ergonomic and really works very well. It takes some getting used to as it&#x27;s a little prickly, but it works very, very well and serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> I call this my magic brush.  My hair definitely looks better after I use it.  It also gives my scalp a nice gentle massage.  I liked it so much I bought another one for my purse.</li>
            <li> I suppose this is a decent enough brush, but far from the detangling miracle worker it&#x27;s claimed to be. The Wet Brush is much better.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for detangling my grand children&#x27;s hair. Their hair is long and very thick. The brush works great, if you start at the bottom and work your way up their heads. They were excited to find a brush that does not \\&quot;pull\\&quot; to get the tangles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not all that.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality for the price. It&#x27;s two cheap plastic pieces stuck together. Would have been nice if it was solid. Please offer a higher quality brush for this price-point. However, it does glide nicely.</li>
            <li> Works no better than Aveda flat wooden brush,  which I already owned.  Just buy a decent tangle remover, use a good conditioner,  and use a set of nice silk pillow cases.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for one of my granddaughters. She is 8yr old and absolutely love it . Glide brush  definitely make get ready routine much easier. Recommend and would buy it again. Its also great as a gift for Christmas stockings ,lol yes i m talking about Christmas in august ,its around the corner... Great product !</li>
            <li> Finally got my own brush ,it&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t scrape my head!!The benefit outweighs the cost . I appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!!! My hair is thin, stick straight, long, whispy, and full of static. This wonderful brush works even with my awful hair! I&#x27;ve used it successfully with wet and dry hair. I HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone. I tried it on Sophie Jean, my Pomeranian, and found that it instantly detangles her hair, too! Sophie will have her own Glide Thru Detangling Brush from Crave Naturals very soon.  If anyone is bothered by hair static, try lightly passing a dryer sheet over your hair before brushing.</li>
            <li> I give this product five stars because my six year old daughter not cry!  We have beautiful kinky curly hair and with that it can be very tangled after washing. I found the product for our hair, worked best when the  hair was wet or moist with conditioner or a detangler product before and after washing. Don&#x27;t not use on DRY hair it does not work! The hair must be wet and bushes out in small parts if scalp is tender and hair is  thick. You must start from the bottom and work your way up. Also I wish the handle was longer and a little firmer. I had to use the bush face up in order to pull it through the first few times. The best thing about this brush vs a comb, the hair loss was very little to almost none, and our curl pattern is amazing. It really does work!</li>
            <li> Brushes my kinky/coarse hair with ease</li>
            <li> I think that if I had thinner hair this brush would have been great. I have really thick, wavy, long hair, and I had to brush the top of my hair and then the bottom to brush through it, and it would still create knots and pull out hair. It would take me a few minutes to brush through it too. Against a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush it&#x27;s better, but still not good for my hair. Saturday I purchased The Wet Brush, and THERE&#x27;S an Amazing brush! Brushes right through my hair with no trouble and no tangles! Takes maybe a minute to brush through it all wet AND dry. I recommend The Wet Brush. It&#x27;s cheaper too.</li>
            <li> too hard of bristles to be pain free detangling, tore through hair as well.</li>
            <li> I previuosly had to use a brush for my hair and two combs for my beard. now just this one detangler, I love it. great results in less time with less of my hair in the brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is light-weight and has an ergonomic handle. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean. I&#x27;ve noticed when brushing my son&#x27;s hair, there is much less breakage (compared to a regular brush) which means less pain! The first thing I noticed about the Crave Naturals Detangling Brush were the bristles. They are different lengths to help glide through each strand. The bristles are flexible and have rounded tips to massage the scalp. This helps to increase circulation and promote hair growth. I definitely recommend anyone to give it a try!</li>
            <li> Good brush; not a great brush.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t solve all my daughter&#x27;s brushing problems like I hoped it would. Still, it does a decent job. She just has such thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and tangles very easily after washing, or even after having been combed through. This \\&quot;detangling brush\\&quot; is a pointless waste of money, in that it detangled nothing -- the bristles were simply too fragile to do much of anything.  The brush&#x27;s plastic bristles are much too thin and weak to be of any use to anyone regardless of hair length or texture.  The old fashioned round shampoo brush that I got from Duane Reade for $5.00 was much stronger than this one, and gives a great scalp massage.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful  I  would always have a problem with my hair after I would wash it because of tangles  but after using this brush I will never have to worry about  that  any longer  because this brush go though my hair like butter I love this brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary for product testing purposes. All thought and opinions are my own and are not influenced by anyone</li>
            <li> We liked the first one so much that we bought a spare.  It really performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great for my thick hair! It just glides right through. I usually have to tug and pull with a regular brush, but this is awesome. I also don&#x27;t lose as much hair because of less pulling. Wet or dry,this is a great brush.</li>
            <li> Not only does this brush scratch the scalp (the bristles are hard and on the sharp side), it yanks the hair out too. This is really NOT a detangling brush, unless your idea of detangling is ripping out the tangles!</li>
            <li> My daughters love this brush (ages 10 and 7). They claim it is easier to brush through their tangles. Less pulling and hurting for their tender heads. As for me, I&#x27;m not overly in love with it, but if they think it&#x27;s wonderful and it gets them to brush--that gets 100% support in my eyes!</li>
            <li> The handle is awful, no grip, slips right out of hand every time I use it. But it does de tangle once I get a hold of it.</li>
            <li> The screaming has stopped!!!! No longer do I hear a 20-minute chorus of &amp;#34;ouch, ouch, ouch&amp;#34; while I am combing my daughter&#x27;s hair. It takes about the same amount of time to get through her hair, but the process is now pain free. My only complaint is that the brush has no substance and is slightly awkward in my hand. I drop it frequently as it doesn&#x27;t have any type of grip on the handle. That being said, I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> As a 51 yr white male with thinning fine hair, aka balding, I was tired of aiding the fallout every time I brushed it. Now all I can say is WOW, I never would have thought a brush could make such a difference, not only is there little to no hair being pulled out, but I get much better coverage of my scalp with my remaining thinning fine hair, better than any brush I have ever used.  The only thing that could make it better would be to add some type of texture grip around the edge and make a version to fit in my pocket! Guys you will not find a better brush for your thinning hair or one that gives you better coverage. I also like the way it massages my scalp when I use it to wash my hair! Just be warned you will need to buy additional brushes if you let your wife and daughter use it, because they will keep taking it!</li>
            <li> This is my third Crave product and probably won&#x27;t be my last. I had been eyeing this brush and was a little skeptical that it was as wonderful as everyone said. A couple of weeks ago they had a sale and I got it for 20% off. It arrived in a few days and I immediately tried it. Now I have very thick, coarse hair so brushing always hurts and it gets tangled very easily. Just as it is advertised it glides thru my hair easily. No tangles or struggling to get the brush thru with the least amount of pain. I am sold and this will be my go to brush going forward. I recommend trying it out! They also provided a 25% if coupon for another product. I hope you live it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> My daughters hair gets A LOT of tangles. She also plays competitive soccer. This brush is a complete lifesaver and must have. No other brush has ever been so gentle on her hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick,curly/wavy, Asian hair and it is a PAIN when it comes to brushing my hair.I bought this brush and this is just as great as my Mason Pearson.When I brush through the curls it brushes nicely,not like a fluff ball at the end look.I get the very soft wavy curls.Janine F. from the company emailed me asking how I liked the product and also gave me great advice on improving healthy hair.</li>
            <li> The perfect hair brush will have the right combination of bristle length and stiffness. If the bristles are too long or too stiff and you have knots - I leave it too you to visualize the facial expressions as you brush. If the bristles are too short or too limber, then it will take you forever. So, it seems for me (I&#x27;m a guy) that this brush is pretty close. It certainly does &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Excellent function. Great price. Thankful they had black...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;The brush is made out of plastic - long term will it hold up? The tips of the bristles are hard on my scalp - I&#x27;ll have to adjust and be careful.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brush! I had a Tangle Teezer, which also works pretty well, but this one was recommended to me by my hairdresser. It&#x27;s sturdier than the Tangle Teezer and pulls out much less hair. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t detangle hair AT ALL. !!!</li>
            <li> I love the way the brush detangles my hair so easily!  It is just as described.  I just gave 4 stars because the handle is not sufficient for me to have a secure hold on the brush when I am brushing.  I have to extend my fingers around part of the brush, crushing some of the bristles..  This causes me to lose the benefit of all the bristles and I feel that over time, those bristles will lose their shape and become useless.  Otherwise, it is a very nice brush.</li>
            <li> No better than a regular brush.  It caused extreme static issues.  Returning it. Would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush. My 6 year old has natural hair, his mini Afro which he adores but he hates having it brushed because brushes always catch in the curls and knots and rip his hair. Well this brush just glides through, he actually asks me to brush his hair now. Brilliant product.</li>
            <li> ... judging by the packaging.  That&#x27;s neither here nor there though in terms of it&#x27;s usefulness to me.  I have short, basically straight hair that I find to be one of those top 10 things I would change about myself if I could if I could.  My hair is hard to manage so I keep it as short as possible without having a crew cut.  This comb feels great on my scalp and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It gets the tangles out of my very tangly hair without pain or damage.</li>
            <li> Works but awkward to hold, especially when your hands are wet.  Easier to use when hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thick hair that gets tangled VERY easily and is a bear to comb after washing.  I love this brush.  It&#x27;s so much more gentle than my regular brush, especially when wet (I haven&#x27;t used my regular one since getting this in the mail!).  It&#x27;s a nice change to feel like I&#x27;m not breaking and ripping hair out of my head :)</li>
            <li> great brush got it for my husband he was complaining about the one he had, also his like mine no hair on the brush and very easy to brush your hair</li>
            <li> This brush surpasses the five stars and works like you would not believe!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased for my child that gets ugly tangles, rats nests. Takes two people to work the tangles out type and working at it for 15 - 20minutes(minimum) leaves a mess and there is so much breakage. Very sad situation.&lt;br /&gt;The Glide Thru Detangling Brush came in just today. Left it in my childs room just to see what would happen. When he comes out he tells me, &amp;#34;ma, this brush is &amp;#34;THE ONE&amp;#34; it really works and its not painful. The only one that took out his tangles and he did it himself.  I am beyond impressed with this item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this brush a try if all other brushes failed you, I&#x27;m telling you, it works.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  I have wavy hair that tangles and knots easily.  This brush detangled my hair quickly and it also feels nice in my hand.</li>
            <li> This brush makes my scalp feel wonderful.  Great detangler and fits the shape of my hand perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Sending it back because I found a wet brush that does the job, before I received this in the mail. Looks good though and for those who want to know, it came undamaged and in the original box and all, the order was pretty much flawless, I just need it anymore.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I like Crave Naturals, but it&#x27;s pricey ($15) for what you get. It has longer bristles than Tangle Teezer, which is why I got it, but also seems to catch more on snarls than Tangle Teezer does. Not worth this price, but still an okay brush.  Update:  Heh. Well, their advertisement at the top of their page says &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t be fooled by impostors.&amp;#34; Nonsense. I think they&#x27;re just afraid you&#x27;ll find those &amp;#34;impostors&amp;#34; and save money. I did. This brush: [[ASIN:B00N7HC44S Fantastic Hair Dresser Salon Quality Detangling / Detangler / Hair Styling Glide Through Anti Tangles Brush In Black By VAGA]] is every bit as good as Crave and is 1/3rd the price. Save your money and buy this instead.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. I bought one for my younger sister and another for my dog. I&#x27;m told the sister loves it and makes her hair feel softer, but my experience with my dog is that this is the best thing to ever happen to his hair care. I have a goldendoodle, so he has hair that I would best describe as cotton. It&#x27;s thick, and loves to get matted. This brush makes combing his hair quicker, easier, and more effective than any of the multiple types of dog brushes I&#x27;ve used on him. I love it and I&#x27;d recommend to other such dog owners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Over two years and many brushings through thick, cotton-like hair later and it&#x27;s still like new with all of the bristles intact. I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed!</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely fantastic! I didn&#x27;t really think it would make such a difference but thought I&#x27;ll give it a whirl after reading all the good reviews. I tried a bazillion brushes before but this one finally works on my thick long hair like magic! My hair is extremely dry (I live in Colorado) and gets tangled up all the time which is a nightmare, this brush slides right through without ripping and tearing hair out! I was just playing with the thought of cutting it shorter to have it more manageable, even though I love the length... no need for that anymore! Yay!</li>
            <li> Brush is small and bristles extremely short...don&#x27;t feel it is really that good for thick hair, because it can&#x27;t brush all the way through. It seems more of a child&#x27;s size brush.  Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well with a bit of patience. It prevents unnecessary pulling out of tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 11 year old and she loves it.  She brushes her hair now and she doesn&#x27;t complain...WOW!  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> My gal is always seeking a brush that will handle her fine yet plentiful and long locks.&lt;br /&gt;She reports  &amp;#34;Gentle but incredibly thorough. Great time saver and the light weight and size make it purse friendly.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Expect she&#x27;ll order another, soon!</li>
            <li> This may work on other hair types but not on my 4c hair.  It got stuck and caused breakage even when working from the ends up to the roots with or without conditioner in my hair.  And with these results on wet hair, I definitely didn&#x27;t try it on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I don&#x27;t get static and my hair looks really shiny. I also use as a scalp massager...wonderful!!! I told my sister and she bought one for her and my two nieces.</li>
            <li> This is great for my daughter&#x27;s long snarly hair.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I ordered - the first went to my granddaughter. I like this for brushing at night to get rid of the hairspray. I don&#x27;t think it works for styling but it isn&#x27;t made for that.</li>
            <li> I have very heavy hair with a baby-fine texture, and get lots of tangles.  This brush is a miracle-worker!  Detangles easily and no pulling.  Also I bought one for my daughter and she loves it.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Great brush, have bleached blonde tangly hair and this works great, give a good shine and scalp massage. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair and this brush just glides right through it; wet or dry. Like the way the bristles are made. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this brush although it was not as magical as others&#x27; have stated.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed, chemically treated hair and was very skeptical of this brush, but I am so pleasantly surprised.  It detangles wet hair like nobody&#x27;s business; I don&#x27;t care what your hair texture is.</li>
            <li> Not worth$14+ for a cheap piece of plastic,looks and feels like a dollar store buy out.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you Amazon and the makers.</li>
            <li> I mean this wasn&#x27;t the best brush but it kinda did its job if you have thick hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to those people but if you have thin then buy it because this doesn&#x27;t do good with thick hair so that&#x27;s why I knocked some starts off</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and after I wash it I have so many knots and tangles in my hair, it sounds like I&#x27;m breaking my hair when I brush it with a regular brush.  I received the Crave Natural Detangler Brush and tried it out on my wet tangled hair and it works like magic!  I only ran it through my hair 4 times and it was brushed nicely and no tangles!  I would definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Let me start this by saying My for year old is very tender headed and has beyond curly hair. I ordered the brush based on the other reviews and was not disapointed. It glides easy but seems to suddenly snag a bit hard. Still a HUGE improvement upon that hour a day of my life. haha Much easier than any brush i have used prior. My daughter can even brush it her self now! Sorta...</li>
            <li> When I first tried my new Crave Naturals Detangling Brush, it felt so good that I tried it on my 18 lb. poodle.  He never wanted to be brushed before, but I got him to sit still so I could try it.  Now, he loves his brush.  The message part just lulls him into a rest that lasts as long as I keep brushing.  Now I have to order another one for myself.</li>
            <li> I have below shoulder length VERY thick, coarse, hair, and this brush does an awesome job detangling it, both wet and dry.  It removes the tangles easily with a lot less breakage than my regular hair brush.  I find the handle a little too short.  It is hard to hold on to while doing the longer hair in back, and the brush is so soft that it is fairly useless for styling my hair into a ponytail.  I still need to use a stiffer styling brush to finish up my &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;.  So if you just need a brush for tangles, this is terrific.  It would be especially gentle for a kiddo, but it probably won&#x27;t replace your regular brush.  It makes a great second brush, and I will continue to use it.  All in all a solid &amp;#34;like&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The best hair care purchase of my lifetime. Period. SO grateful to have found this product . . . a miracle that should be owned in every color!</li>
            <li> I have given a past review on this brush. I notice that you haven&#x27;t taken my advice and changed the picture. This brush is very asymmetrical. It works fine right handed only. It is a very good brush if you are right handed.</li>
            <li> Loves this hair brush, first try my hair is smooth again and it help a lot with my frizzy hair</li>
            <li> This product is the best it help keep, my frizzy hair maintained I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Plastic bristles hard to get used too.  I think I would have been better off with softer bristles.</li>
            <li> Hey guys I just wanted to say how great this product is. Btw I am a guy with poofy hair, really thick curly hair. At least 18 inches long. I never had a brush that can detangle my hair like this brush. Its about 95 percent pain free which I love. I really hate brushing my knots out.  It would hurt alot and most of time I would do it with my hair wet. But this baby here wet or really dry hair it will detangle your hair with no problem coming from a guy this a great product highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Brush sucks.  Just skims over hair</li>
            <li> This thing really detangles, without hurting my scalp. (I have fairly long hair so if I don&#x27;t braid it there&#x27;s usually a bunch of knots to work out)</li>
            <li> Not as magic as many others described... and probably not perfect for thick and straight hair like mine, it is easier than normal brush to get through hair..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this brush a chance, but I just don&#x27;t like it.  It hurts my scalp and is very unforgiving.  When I use it on dry hair it tugs against the tangles and doesn&#x27;t feel right.  It&#x27;s also a strange shape and I&#x27;d prefer a longer handle.  It also seems rather overpriced for a piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> Great hairbrush.  Loved the way it felt on my scalp and hair.  Felt like someone gave me a scalp massage.  It was so good that I ordered another one recently-in pink, for my daughter, who loves that color.</li>
            <li> I bought a detangling brush about a year ago (I think it was Goody) and loved it, but I got this one to replace it because this one has a handle and is much easier to use for me. The bristles are a bit harder than my older version, but that might be good because they&#x27;ll last longer. The bristles in my old brush were bent and falling off after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;This one is also easy to clean! :)</li>
            <li> This brush was OK but was not the miracle worker on tangles it&#x27;s advertised as.  It didn&#x27;t work any better than my regular brush, which is the standard oval-shaped with hard bristles that have little balls at the end.  Plus the handle is awkward to hold.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Handle hard to grip with long hair.  Bristles are sharp on scalp.  Does not seem to pull and break hair as much as regular brush especially with wet hair,</li>
            <li> Glides thorugh my hair with ease!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush for my wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Great for tangles. My hair is thick to I have to brush it in sections.</li>
            <li> Very happy with brush. My 10 year is very picky about how a brush feels on his head and he likes this one. Also, great customer service.</li>
            <li> I have curly, kinky hair that is really long. The handle of this brush is WAY too hard to hold. Forget it if you&#x27;ve got slippery conditioner all over your hands. Imagine trying to brush your hair with the pointy end of a greased football and that describes this experience. I did solve this problem somewhat by wrapping a couple really fat rubber bands around the end to give it more traction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find it satisfactory for brushing my daughter&#x27;s even kinkier, thicker hair. Fresh out of the tub, we use this brush to work through a section at a time. This brush is good for a parent to brush a child&#x27;s hair, but I have a hard time using it on myself.</li>
            <li> This brush is  good detangling brush for  this hair. Thin hair it seems a little stiff. But works great with all hair types.</li>
            <li> feels good on my scalp, works great through my thick hair...</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product!  My daughter has (past) waist length hair and so the purchase was made with her in mind.&lt;br /&gt;Mid-morning~before any serious hair-brushing had been done, I handed the Glide Thru to my daughter to see how well its&#x27; promises were kept.  She ran the brush through her hair and exclaimed &amp;#34;Whoa! What is this thing? It&#x27;s great!&amp;#34;  With hardly any effort and with great gentleness to the hair ~ all detangling was accomplished.  NO more shredded hair! And for someone with short hair, another benefit is that the brush feels kind and nicely stimulating to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Again, great product.... buy it!</li>
            <li> Just transitioned from natural to straight and this helps keep my hair from tangling and no breakage!</li>
            <li> I had purchased one of these to use on my my 2 year old daughter, and I started using it and loved it so much that she said that I needed to get my own!  I just wish I&#x27;d looked at the insert to know that I could&#x27;ve gotten a discount on ordering another one!  If I need to order another brush for her younger sister, I&#x27;ll definitely be using the promo code!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a hair pick to comb my hair after showers, but this works so much better and hurts far less!  I love this brush and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll ever use from now on!!!</li>
            <li> Love the brush, works great but, for a leftie it is backwards.  I have to hold upside down and that is a little awkward</li>
            <li> My son has very long hair but finds brushing painful. I decided to try it, and it is miraculous! No more struggles to get him to brush his hair, he happily does it in his own. No more struggles with pain for him, he enjoys it. And it leaves his fair feeling silky smooth. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it&#x27;s magical!</li>
            <li> I love it very much . I comb my hair the Detangling works good for my hair and very gentle and soft and I cannot believe that my Detangling hair went smooth and I do have medium long hair and I tried lots of hair brush and This Glide Detangling Brush really work very awesome totally very happy.</li>
            <li> Really does detangle hair quite easily.</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine hair on the longish side and wanted a brush that would detangle my hair without damaging it.  This brush works well on my dry hair, leaving it smooth and shiny-looking; however, I did deduct a star from my rating because 1) it does not work at all (not even a bit) on my wet hair, 2) the handle/brush shape can be a bit difficult for me to hold onto (especially if my hands are damp or have product on them), and 3) it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side.  But, all in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and will continue to use the brush.</li>
            <li> This does just what it says. I didn&#x27;t think it could be anything special but it is. I have heavy, thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything special. I literally find no difference between this and my regular brush for combing through the knots and tangles in my fine hair. Still hurts, still need to grab my hair so that it doesn&#x27;t yank at my scalp, and like other brushes if I don&#x27;t force it, it just skims OVER the knot.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for my granddaughter&#x27;s thick and curly hair. It breezes through the tangles and avoids tears.This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  It&#x27;s too hard for my son who has straight hair, but for my curly haired son (shoulder length medium sized ringlet curls)and me (waist length curly kinky hair), it&#x27;s wonderful.  Great detangler, just remember to be gentle.  Grabs on to the dead hair which results in less hair in the shower/bathtub drain.  It&#x27;s a little difficult to hold if you&#x27;re brushing product through your hair, but when I do that I just hold on to the brush head rather than the handle.  It&#x27;s also really easy to clean and sanitize - love it!  I&#x27;m tempted to purchase another one just for me! :)</li>
            <li> My hair had begun tangling badly and all my old fixes were not working. This worked beautifully!</li>
            <li> I had no hesitation with this product as it lives to the reviews. My worries were that all the reviews were for women or young girls. I&#x27;m a guy with short fine hair and would only need it in the morning when my hair would be tangled. Also wanted this brush because it&#x27;s much better for your scalp and hair than the plastic ones they claim.&lt;br /&gt;It has help up to the claims and hype. The design is interesting too as it&#x27;s not similar to most brushes. I would recommend this to everyone looking for a new brush to keep. As it&#x27;s an excellent one time investment for your hair. I&#x27;ve noticed I have more volume in my hair and it&#x27;s a bit more shiny. I, however, gave it away to see how they would enjoy it and will be buying another one using the 25% discount they offer.</li>
            <li> I felt like it didn&#x27;t really detangle my hair. It also pulled on my hair a bit more than my normal paddle brush. Overall, it was just a brush. Nothing special.</li>
            <li> This is a unique brush.  I can wash it with soap and water and place it upside down to dry. No water retaining. People have asked what type of brush it is because they&#x27;ve never seen it before. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Brushing my girls&#x27; hair has always been a struggle. They both have long, fine, easily tangled hair. The Crave Naturals Glide Thru Detangling Brush glides through their hair with no effort. Even on their most tangled days, it performs better than a regular brush. My 5 year old insists on brushing her own hair, and this helps her to do it more effectively. It&#x27;s a must have for those with small girls.</li>
            <li> As soon as I ordered this, we couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out! My daughter and I have been wanting one for a while. We both have super thick hair that tangles easily. As with a lot of things like this, I was skeptical that it would do what it promises, but it sure does! My 5 year old daughter actually begged me to brush her hair instead of fighting me on it. She said, &amp;#34;This is easy peasy mom! It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! And, it just takes the rats right out!&amp;#34; I am absolutely elated with this purchase. It is made well and lives up to it&#x27;s promises. Thanks!</li>
            <li> i received this product at an promotional price to give my honest opinion ..the package arrived on time and was packaged well..i tried this as soon as i got it on my wet hair and ive got to say this is the best detangling brush ive used so far..it made for any type of hair so the whole family can use it..would def reccommend</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this awesome little brush. I have thick/course curly hair that frizzes up at the drop of a hat. This brush worked wonderfully on my hair, getting rid of all the tangles without pulling my hair out and causing pain. My teenage daughter has curly hair like mine that will frizz out, but it is thin instead of thick/course. This brush worked wonders in her hair too! It is the perfect brush if you have curly hair or if you are just proned to getting tangles and don&#x27;t want your hair ripped out at the roots.  I definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> I love the brush.  It feels so good on my scalp when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a timely 2 days. In perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Actually works to de tangle hair.</li>
            <li> This brush works okay, better than most, but even using it I still usually have to work away at my tangles. I was a little disappointed with it, but to be fair, my hair dreads up worse than the haunches of an un-groomed Persian cat. Thus, I have awarded this brush 4 rather than 3 stars, because I&#x27;m sure it works great for someone whose secret super power is not knotting their hair. Also, I agree with other reviewers that the shape is awkward. Even my extra dexterous E.T. - like fingers can&#x27;t seem to find a grip on it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this brush under the impression that it would reduce the amount of split ends. I&#x27;m still getting split ends as usual. Also, thought the brush was black, I received pink. I hate the color pink.</li>
            <li> I received this at a great discount to review. I used on my daughter who has tight spiral curls. She still whined and said it hurt. When I was combing her hair it felt okay there were still tugs but not too bad I guess. The brush looks well made not too cheap looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great detangling brush I would recommend you use it on wet hair that has been pre-detangled. I tried to use the brush as my first detangling tool, but it was really inefficient. So, I used a wide tooth comb to get thru and knots then used the brush for that final detangle. That process works for me. My hair feels so much fuller. Cleaning the brush is very easy.</li>
            <li> Now this is a wonderful Detangling Brush.  Perfect for long hair. Works marvelous on my hair and my daughters too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised.  I have fine, thinning hair, and I think this brush will save it from further destruction.  I think kids would love to use this brush!</li>
            <li> Asian with straight long hair. This brush is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever owned except an old brush that is no longer around called KaoLuna.&lt;br /&gt;Reason for the 4 star is because of the handle tapers down making your hand to slid down. Besides the uncomfortable handle, it is an awesome brush!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter she has very thick hair and gets a lot of tangles. This brush has helped tremendously. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Best hair brush ever. Never pull out your hair again. I bought more for $4.00 at Sally&#x27;s Hair Supply on sale. Same thing for much better price.</li>
            <li> This brush is a must-have for anyone with a thick beard.  Used in conjunction with a good beard wax, this is the best way to painlessly and stylishly tame the wilderness on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the lack of of color options.  It would look great in a bold red &amp; black.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old now loves to brush his hair!</li>
            <li> Brush feels GREAT on scalp detangles long hair beautifully.....manufacturer however needs to make handle longer much too short.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush. Gentle on my tangly hair.</li>
            <li> The brushes I purchased are Christmas stocking stuffers (very nice ones) for my granddaughters.  I will save your site and give you their opinions after Christmas.  They all have long hair of varying types, so I could get comments all over the board,  hope they are pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this hairbrush.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do--detangle your hair without breaking.</li>
            <li> Portable, nice shape, holy cow I love this thing. I have massively thick curly tangle-y blonde hair and it just goes to work without hurting me.</li>
            <li> Brush really does eliminate tangles, love it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this is often tough for hairbrushes to get through.  The Detangling Brush has given me great results and goes through my hair softly, unlike other brushes I have tried.  No pain, no tears, just nice looking hair after all is said and done!</li>
            <li> I truly like the ergonomic handle but not the even length bristles so much.  This detangling brush may be good for straight hair right after washing but not the best on my curly hair.  This one did not seem to grip and separate my hair strands as well as the Michel Mercier detangling brush.</li>
            <li> A decent brush, but not worth fifteen dollars.</li>
            <li> Outstanding brush!!! Use it on my sheltie dogs!!! They love it... No more pulling of long coats. They need to market this product to dog lovers...</li>
            <li> Wow it really works. I am a male with shoulder length hair kinda wavy. This does the trick. Only had one hair in the brush. My others are loaded. The only improvement I would make is a slightly longer handle. It seems a tad short and I only have average size hands. I would like another 1-2 inches of handle on mine. Good product though.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is curly (not wavy, but curly) and needed a good brush but this was definitely not it as it did not get the job done for curly hair!</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush!  Love it!</li>
            <li> As a guy I started using it as soon as i got it, on my dry thick and wavy hair to see if it didn&#x27;t hurt or get tangled. Well it didn&#x27;t so it was great. However it doesn&#x27;t comb as well as other brushes. I guess I&#x27;ll recomend it to onlt be used to detangle as its suppose to be used for.</li>
            <li> I go to this to review . I think this works very well. I tried this brush with my dry hair it didn&#x27;t hurt my head when I used it. It did make my hair very fluffy. I also used this on wet hair in the shower I didn&#x27;t have any big clumps come out of my hair. I would recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> My daughter has type 4a hair and this brush worked great to detangle it. After applying conditioner, I sectioned the hair into 4-6 areas. First, I finger detangled and then applied a little more conditioner and went over the same sections with his brush.&lt;br /&gt;There were no snags, very little hair was shed unlike in the past when I used a wide tooth comb. Also, unlike the comb, you can start from the scalp and brush down. It is really a phenomenal product and a serious time saver. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I have hip-length thick naturally-curly hair, and always have problems with tangling after washing.  I use huge amounts of conditioner and \\&quot;detangling\\&quot; products, and it still would take me at least 45-60 minutes to work through it all with a wide-tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have to admit I was skeptical when Is aw this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how it does it, but it really does make the process much easier.  In 15-20 minutes, I can work through the tangles, and then either air dry or blow dry (I usually air dry).  Yes, I still have to start at the ends and work up to the scalp, but it goes so much faster, and with little \\&quot;tugging.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering a second one of these to keep with my \\&quot;travel\\&quot; supplies -- it&#x27;s definitely worth having two!</li>
            <li> i love this brush! it glides smoothly through hair without pulling too much. i have had other detangler brushes but they didn&#x27;t have handles. I love the handle! Much easier for little hands trying to brush their own hair! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for a few months and I must say that this brush works great to detangle hair. I have fine hair that is always hard to detangle unless I&#x27;ve used gobs of conditioner. This brush really does detangle and makes the brushing part of my day much quicker and more enjoyable!</li>
            <li> Nice brush for detangling. It would be nice is bristles were abit longer and sturdier. But overall a nice brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my child whose hair gets pretty knotted daily. It works pretty well and I like it compared to the other regular combs/brushes that we&#x27;ve used. I can&#x27;t say that it was &amp;#34;ouch-less&amp;#34;  and I don&#x27;t know that any brush can say that, but it definitely is a step up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was given a discounted price on this product for my Honest review*</li>
            <li> All I can say is WoW!! My daughter&#x27;s hair tangles easily and we usually have to use a detangler in her hair,, this brush is totally awesome... now she doesn&#x27;t need a detangler and this brush will actually massage her scalp making her hair even stronger and healthier. I totally recommend this for anyone who has tangles esp. little ones,, and by the way no tears!! Thank you and God bless!!</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush! My daughter has terribly tangled hair and this brush does the job! Comes in cute colors. And doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt her as much as some of the other brushes we have tried. I would highly recommend this brush</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her new Detangling brush and she uses it right after taking a shower. It now sits at her tub for easy access.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t understand what was special about it. But then I realized that less hair was being ripped off of my head compared to a normal hair brush. Also, it doesn&#x27;t tug on tangles, as long as you gently brush your hair, the tangles should untangle without pain. It also feels nice on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Ok...so this is the third brush I have bought (so far).  The first one went to my granddaughter who hated her hair brushed because of her tangles.  So I gave her this (my) brush and she loves how it doesn&#x27;t pull her hair.  I bought myself another one, hubby saw it, tried it, liked it and so I ordered another brush.  This brush is that good!  You won&#x27;t regret buying...it is so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/11/17:  So I bought two more of these for my other two grandchildren.  They love this brush as it really does get the tangles out well and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  My hubby and I are still using ours that we got awhile back.  They are very durable. I can&#x27;t imagine using any other brush.</li>
            <li> This is a very good brush for thick curly hair. My hair is so thick I can&#x27;t run a comb through it. Thought I would give this brush a try. Very satisfied and I find myself brushing my hair more often as it feels so good on my scalp. Would reorder this product. Well worth the price as we all know you pay for what you get!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to getting this for my 7 and 9 year old girls.  It is a piece of junk.  It should be called a Glide OVER brush because that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair because it is just gliding OVER the knots.  I do not recommended it.      UPDATE:  As I had stated before, the product I had received originally did not meet my expectations.. After posting my review here I was contacted by customer service and they were very responsive to my concerns and offered a refund for my dissatisfaction in the product. This is what customer service is all about.. NOT forgetting your customers... You can buy any given product anywhere for retailers are eager to get your $$.. Its how the companies handle things when they go wrong that counts.. And that my friend is how you earn my repeat business... ;-) After a few weeks they have contacted me again with an offer for a NEW and Improved product to try FREE.. Whoopi! Can&#x27;t wait to try it out.. Will post some Feedback soon~</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Helps style hair while providing a great scalp massage.  Brush is concave (center bristles are recessed more than the outer ones), so it combs evenly over the entire head.  Brushes through longer hair effortlessly and helps add body. Both of us (male and female) are pleased with this purchase.... of 2 separate brushes.</li>
            <li> So I need to find the best of everything...its kind of a habit. This brush looked cheap, but, since it had good reviews I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d give it a try...SO GLAD I DID! This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used! The main difference and its a giant difference between every other hair brush I ever used is its one solid unit. Its kind of hard to explain, but, traditional brushes have a handle/base and a bunch of bristles/needles that separately connect to the base. This brush is like 3 dimensionally molded out of a single piece of plastic, SO, guess what?!? IT DOESN&#x27;T SNAG HAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Traditional hair brushes can catch your fine hairs in between the needles/base and break or rip your hair out! This brush eliminates that issue. So loving this hair brush. Plus its ALOT easier to clean because of that feature as well. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush!!!</li>
            <li> It did not perform as described.</li>
            <li> I like this more than any other brush.</li>
            <li> This brush does not rid thick hair of tangles. It is useless to me. The bristles are too soft, too short for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Finally something that works !My girl loves it and that dsnt come easy for her :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Will order again soon.</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent for long curly hair. Never gets stuck</li>
            <li> This brush is life changing. I have thick wavy/curly hair and it tangles so much after I shower and this brush just works right through my tangles. I don&#x27;t even have to use detangler. I can not recommend it highly enough!!!</li>
            <li> MY wife is happy with this brush, says he does not mistreat the hair does not make you drop and recommends undoubtedly</li>
            <li> Amazing! I thought this wouldn&#x27;t work on my unruly, brush eating kinky-curly hair. At first there was a little struggle brushing, but it didn&#x27;t hurt. It felt like a massage! â™¡ The end result was smooth, tangle free pretty hair! Yay!</li>
            <li> This brush is cheaply made, it scratches my head because the bristles are very hard plastic and they are not long enough to go through my hair. My hair is very thick and the bristles of this brush sort of just brush the top layer and everything underneath remains untouched. It did not work for my or my daughters, this brush now belongs to the cat, it works great for him. I received this at a discount for an honest opinon, these thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical at first and a bit hesitant to buy this product. I used it and I&#x27;m impressed. It does exactly what it claims to do. I haven&#x27;t seen a strand of hair in this brush as yet unlike the other brushes I own.</li>
            <li> I actually returned these, but not because of the brush.  My thin hair does not benefit from this quality of a brush.  It is silky smooth to run through your hair and will allow for great results (if only I had more hair).  Further the company that sells this was awesome in it&#x27;s follow up.  They sent very good emails with how to use it, how to take care of your hair, and to assure satisfaction.  I will look at this company again for other products because the quality of this brush and their follow up.</li>
            <li> I like the brush but It needs a longer handle. hard to grip and go thru long hair..especially with slippery hair products on hands.</li>
            <li> I have three young daughters all with different types long hair.  The worst 20 minutes of each morning is combing hair before school.  I have been through brush after brush, comb after comb, and this one is best of the bunch thus far.  It works best on my daughter with thick straight hair, and has been successful at speeding up the process and reducing tears for my daughter with long curly hair.  My youngest daughter with straight thin hair has reaped the benefits as well.  Her hair knots at night, this has been getting threw them easier.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for our grandson-thick, course, curly red hair. Believe me when I say that we have tried everything to manage his hair. Everything we used caused his beautiful (to me) hair to turn fuzzy (think afro here). Because of his curls tighten up overnight the tangles were endless; breaking his hair and all kinds of crying. He has a standard little boy hair cut, not long at all. The next step would be to buzz cut him if we couldn&#x27;t find a comb or brush that would not hurt him.&lt;br /&gt;We used this brush immediately after his shower with no complaints. The next morning no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;We crossed our fingers and started brushing his hair starting at the bottom and worked our way up.&lt;br /&gt;NO TEARS! NO SCREAMING! This brush is amazing for anyone with the same type of hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this brush.  I have long color treated hair and always fight tangles. This brush easily smoothed out my hair even when wet. Love it!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!!!  It really works.  I&#x27;ve got long hair that is all the way down my back.  This brush glides through my hair like a dream.  It also makes it shiny, with no static electricity.  It even works at taking the frizz out.  I live in Florida, which equals frizz on our high humidity days (which is 90% of the time).  This brush is fantastic.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on wet hair just because I like using a wide tooth comb for detangling when I&#x27;ve washed my hair.  But, it works wonders on my hair once it&#x27;s dried.  Love the size, too.  Fits perfectly in my purse and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room at all.  Huge fan!</li>
            <li> I am amazed by this wet brush! I think that I only lost two strands in it when I brushed out my entire thick, curly head of hair. No pulling, easy to hold &amp; store.</li>
            <li> It seems to get tangles out of my hair better than my previous brush/comb but it&#x27;s not a perfect glide. I do brush it from the bottom first and work my way up for a better experience in getting out tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 major cons: I wish it was heavier. It feels far too light like it&#x27;s a plastic toy. If it had a little more weight to it I would feel more in control of brushing my hair instead of hoping it doesn&#x27;t fly out of my hand while brushing out those hard tangles. The handle is also quite small, even for a girl like me with small hands. I can&#x27;t get a good enough grip on it.</li>
            <li> My daughter prefers the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping it would be the answer to my prayers for my toddler&#x27;s super fine hair. She hates to have it brushed, but grows dreadlocks when exposed to any sort of wind or active play. Brushing her hair is torture for both of us, and from other reviews, I was hopefully this might solve the problem. It hasn&#x27;t. It works as well as any brush, but if lightweight and feels very cheap. Definitely not worth the price for us, but from other review I wonder if it works better on thicker hair.</li>
            <li> works well but the bristles are too hard on the scalp. I prefer the wet brush my wife uses. Does the job well though.</li>
            <li> I wish I  knew  about this brush  early in my life. I love it did class to my house so nice and I have black African American hair. It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> Handles a 4 year old&#x27;s long curly hair with ease. No tears!!</li>
            <li> love it. I have shoulder length 4B natural hair. it works</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fantastic this brush is. I have long, thin, fine hair and it gets snarls and tangles from the air (I swear). This is the first product I have used that does everything promised: no pain and the tangles just disappear!  I was so impressed I shared it with a four year old friend of mine with baby-fine hair and I had to let her have the brush cause she was so excited about it. No problem; I just ordered a couple more. Don&#x27;t want to ever do without it!</li>
            <li> this product is great for brushing out the tangles and massaging the scalp.  I love to use it  before going to bed as it feels great and really stimulates the scalp.,</li>
            <li> Good Brush, even with plastic bristles!</li>
            <li> This is a cheap piece of plastic.  The &amp;#34;unique&amp;#34; cone shaped plastic bristles look exactly like the bristles on all of my brushes.  The one unique thing I can see is that the center bristles are shorter than the ones around the outside.  I do notice that it goes through my long, wavy (not curly) hair somewhat easier than my other brushes but it doesn&#x27;t take out the tangles in the process - it simply goes over them.  I end up going back over several times before the tangles come out.  And then it&#x27;s not gentle - it rips the hair and pulls it out, but not quite as much as my other brushes in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the several things I don&#x27;t like is that it is very short and has only a stub for a handle.  Hence the odd shape in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the cost of this brush is astronomical for what you get.  It&#x27;s probably worth it if it were priced around $1.99 to $3.99 but $15.98?  Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t fall for the advertising hype on this cheap piece of plastic,</li>
            <li> Works very well on my thick long hear.  I am not used to the short handle, it often slips out of my hand while brushing.  Would like to have a longer handle, perhaps the other model would be better for this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband who has very long, very curly hair. He tried it this morning, and he was able to brush his hair with no snags even with &amp;#34;bed-head&amp;#34;. He is always complaining that other brushes hurt and pull his  hair. He loves this one already. I tried it as well, and even though my hair is straight it does get tangled, so I&#x27;m ordering one for me!</li>
            <li> Works great better then the average brush</li>
            <li> love,love the brush. does what it says in the description, i love the shine it leaves in your hair. will buy their products again. thank you</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes! I already own one, but I had to buy another one because my husband kept stealing mine! Great product and great customer service!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine hair which is inclined toward tangles and knots. Brushing with &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; combs or brushes caused considerable discomfort and hair pulling.  I cannot say exactly what &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; distinguishes this brush from others, but I can say that based on her feedback, the discomfort and pulling have been substantially reduced.  Though I thought it might be a gimmick, I was decidedly and pleasantly proven otherwise.</li>
