            <li>The pleasant surprise they put out my favorite skin product is no shock to me.&lt;br /&gt;I will admit, since I found out it&#x27;s in my home town, I&#x27;ve hooked some friends and family on it.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>Emu is an amazing oil.  </li>
            <li>Really great price, shipped fast, and works great on my skin</li>
            <li>so many good things about this stuff...give it a try and see for yourself...</li>
            <li>Pure emu oil is the best of the best from all the oils for face because it is very moisturizing, healing and relatively light.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something you can use quickly and get dressed immediately, this isn&#x27;t it, but for a more relaxing application, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>For me  Capsaicin cream (especially HP kind) is much more effective and faster acting than emu oil.</li>
            <li>Oil is amazing - takes aways the ouchies very quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin appears to be more radiant and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>This oil would be great for massage since it&#x27;s very soothing and doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin immediately.  </li>
            <li>Even the light that shows you the damage from the sun!  </li>
            <li>and my skin tone is so much more even.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love swanson&#x27;s because</li>
            <li>ANY BETTER THAN PETROLEUM JELLY AND COSTS</li>
            <li>A LOT MORE.</li>
            <li>The more refined Emu oils DID NOT help.</li>
            <li>This gives a healthy look and feel.</li>
            <li>Love this oil, would purchase again</li>
            <li>The toggle bottle top doesn&#x27;t gum up as flip spouts do.</li>
            <li>it worked pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE EXTREMELY DRY SKIN ON MY FEET AND I&#x27;VE SEARCHED FOR THE BEST PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil, it is so smooth and non greasy.</li>
            <li>It is also great on your cuticles to keep them soft and easy to push back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a plus right there because if I wasn&#x27;t before, I am comfortable it is quality, and emus are raised all over ND, so I was thrilled to make the connection.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find a brand that is less than $15 (including shipping).</li>
            <li>Great for scalp with  light enough for hair to hold style without flopping or looking</li>
            <li>and I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>its free range oil.</li>
            <li>There is no smell, the product is smooth and doesn&#x27;t separate.</li>
            <li>It made my skin smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>you will love this product right away</li>
            <li>When first poured out of the bottle it feels more like a light liquid moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I would suggest to use Capsaisin cream with Emu oil to get \\&quot;the best of both worlds\\&quot;: fast pain relief from Capsaisin and long term anti-inflammatory result from Emu oil.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this to help reduce appearance of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s too rich.  </li>
            <li>I fly a lot and emu oil stands up to very dry cabin air as a face, hand and lip moisturizer</li>
            <li>Has worked very well at healing piercings, I don&#x27;t need to use any abrasive products, this soaks in and apparently has antibacterial properties (according to a pro piercer who swore by it,) but also works great to soften skin.</li>
            <li>I just hope it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>container is perfect for travel because you have one product for skin, body and hair moisturizer (use a very small amount).</li>
            <li>This was shipped to me super fast!!</li>
            <li>My 50 year old mother with very sensitive skin loved this oil.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and feels very silky.  </li>
            <li>I would like to be able to use it on my face also, but my skin is so sensitive, it breaks out even though this is not supposed to clog pores.  </li>
            <li>pricy but worth it as over the counter oils</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li>I would say that for dry the knees, elbows and feet lanolin is a better, more effective option and less expansive.  </li>
            <li>Great product for very dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job on my dry skin and seems to promote healing of scratches and bug bites as well.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered this item I got it super fast.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I have only one very light almost invisible scar by my eye</li>
            <li>Emu oil works so well at so many different issues, give it a try!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased this brand because the one I used before increased their price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard, it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and it heals scars fast and prevents them from forming if you apply to fresh wounds or burns.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I used it for about 3-4 days consistently.</li>
            <li>This one is whitish and thick, the more refined ones are clear, and may be a good oil, but didn&#x27;t help my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever using Emu Oil.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different oils: almond, apricot, jojoba, avocado, olive, argan oil in a balm form, lanoline (</li>
            <li>If you use too much it looks super oily, so just remember less is more!</li>
            <li>than you like, put it in the microwave (top open) for 10 to 20 seconds and it will become pure liquid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only oil (Ive used many carrier oils) that really soaks into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling oily.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are so long now that they are sexy</li>
            <li>it also made it super soft.</li>
            <li>bought it because Dr. Oz said pure emu oil would help arthritic pain.</li>
            <li>pure anhydrous and in  oil form) and squalene (from olives).</li>
            <li>I am 60 and have very minute redness around my nose area from the sun.  </li>
            <li>definately can say that the oil helps a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>it was a real miracle.</li>
            <li>so I really have no comment.</li>
            <li>It would have lasted longer but it turns out my dog really loves it, too.</li>
            <li>It soaks in and leaves my skin very soft with no weird blotches I normally get with skin care products.</li>
            <li>I opened the crushed box to find it was full of ants!</li>
            <li>A friend of mine has had similar success.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this does not irritate it at all.</li>
            <li>AND WHEN I NEED MORE I WILL CONTACT YOU , JUST AS I HAVE DONE  IN THE PAST.  </li>
            <li>It is light and smooth, and a very small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and I do not expect any drastic changes in the appearance of the scar until I have been using it for a complete month.</li>
            <li>and I have never heard of anyone who uses it who has developed skin breakouts.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my elbows baby soft.  </li>
            <li>It does keep the skin on my arms and legs soft though.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been noticing that my scars are fading really fast (like after only 2-3 weeks of nightly use)</li>
            <li>I think a heavy application may make a greasy feel and may create breakouts, but not if it is applied lightly.     </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this product has not bothered it at all.</li>
            <li>that we have moved far away from.</li>
            <li>I have had adult acne all through my 20s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to early to rate this product.</li>
            <li>it really works,  makes feet real soft, just shake first and use very little.</li>
            <li>Any brand that offers 100% pure emu oil is the same as the next except for the price.</li>
            <li>I use a few drops in my body lotion as well, and it keeps my whole body soft and feeling very moisturized.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to use it daily ( I use it 2x daily ) for a whole month before deciding if it meets your expectations, because skin care products sometimes take a while to show results.        </li>
            <li>It was a little rich for me, and I didn&#x27;t like that it came from actual emus.</li>
            <li>so I rarely have dry skin whereas I used to suffer from terribly dry skin.</li>
            <li>So far, it hasn&#x27;t really helped but in its defense I havent been using it religiously for very long!</li>
            <li>My skin became very dry during my first and second pregnancies</li>
            <li>As for using Emu oil for some serious back, joint/arthritis pain, I highly doubt it, especially if you need a fast pain relief.</li>

            <li> It bends well with any other oil.</li>
            <li> I usually blend it with a bit of castor oil and massage it into my scalp especially my edges.</li>

            <li> weighed down with oil.</li>
            <li> I found out about it when I got into a car accident and my face was all beat up and my air bag burned me and gave me a black eye and a friend gave me some emu oil and told me to use it everyday and it wouldn&#x27;t scar (which was hard to believe because my face definitely looked like there was no way around it scarring).</li>

            <li> it is a 100% natural product it will harden if it gets cold.</li>
            <li> I had very severe acne for years and it left a lot of really nasty scars and uneven  skin tone</li>
            <li> Well, needless to say, I have been using it daily, and I hope to see continued thickness and fullness around my once scarce hairline.</li>
            <li> If, as I mentioned above, the product thickens if it is stored in a cold area, so maybe a thick layer on the face could cause a breakout.</li>

            <li> I agree with the other reviewer that said it solidifies when it gets cold.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is my secret weapon</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> Before they gave it to me I was using neosporin and it was making me break out really bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This emu oil is the best form of moisturiser I&#x27;ve ever used. I originally bought this to help reduce appearance of stretch marks. So far, it hasn&#x27;t really helped but in its defense I havent been using it religiously for very long! This works wonders on my dry hair (apply when wet and use very little) as well as my dry skin. If you use too much it looks super oily, so just remember less is more! It also supposedly helps with joint and muscle pain, which I have never tried using it for.. Sorry! It also is supposed to thicken hair so I have been using it on my eyelashes in replace of Careprost. Emu oil works so well at so many different issues, give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over two weeks and I love it! I have very sensitive skin, and this does not irritate it at all. I use it on my face in combination with a Retinol cream at night, and with an Aveeno face cream during the day. It is light and smooth, and a very small amount goes a long way. There is a very slight smell to it in the bottle, but once it is put on, the smell is not noticeable at all.     I use a few drops in my body lotion as well, and it keeps my whole body soft and feeling very moisturized. My skin appears to be more radiant and healthy looking. Also, I have been using it on my eye lashes and eyebrows, and it has been helping them grow faster and stronger. It is slowly making a dark surgical scar lighten, as well, but I have only been using it for less than a month and I do not expect any drastic changes in the appearance of the scar until I have been using it for a complete month. My suggestion is to use it daily ( I use it 2x daily ) for a whole month before deciding if it meets your expectations, because skin care products sometimes take a while to show results.        I will be buying this again for sure!</li>
            <li> This products was equal in quality to the one selling in the 2oz bottle (half the amount) for $32 @ Mother&#x27;s Market! I will definitely continue to purchase this product @ this price online. A great deal! LUV IT!</li>
            <li> Any brand that offers 100% pure emu oil is the same as the next except for the price. One company started to advertise it as a wrinkle cream and charged $60 for one ounce. Since then all the manufacturers started raising their prices. This is the first time I purchased this brand because the one I used before increased their price. I was very happy to find a brand that is less than $15 (including shipping). This 4 ounce product lasts a couple months because even using it from head to toe you only need to use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is a 100% natural product it will harden if it gets cold. If it feels thicker than you like, put it in the microwave (top open) for 10 to 20 seconds and it will become pure liquid. If you use it while it is thick, you are wasting the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand the review that claims that Emu oil causes facial breakouts. Entire skin line are based on emu oil and I have never heard of anyone who uses it who has developed skin breakouts. In fact, as Emu oil started being marketed in skin care lines If, as I mentioned above, the product thickens if it is stored in a cold area, so maybe a thick layer on the face could cause a breakout. I know teenagers who are fighting acne and emu oil is the only product they can use as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This container is perfect for travel because you have one product for skin, body and hair moisturizer (use a very small amount). It is also great on your cuticles to keep them soft and easy to push back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is as a 100% natural product it doesn&#x27;t have any sunscreen. Therefore, I use a different moisturizer on my face and hands during the day.</li>
            <li> Today I received what I \\&quot;thought\\&quot; was my order. I opened the crushed box to find it was full of ants! I unscrewed the cap to the product only to find crushed ants INSIDE THE CAP!!!! This is disgusting! How was the emu oil?? I don&#x27;t know because its not going on my body. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS \\&quot;COMPANY\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This oil would be great for massage since it&#x27;s very soothing and doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin immediately.  It does a nice job on my dry skin and seems to promote healing of scratches and bug bites as well.  It is fragrance free and feels very silky.  I&#x27;ve noticed it seems to help calluses on my feet and it keeps my elbows baby soft.  I would like to be able to use it on my face also, but my skin is so sensitive, it breaks out even though this is not supposed to clog pores.  Perhaps it&#x27;s too rich.  It does keep the skin on my arms and legs soft though.  If you&#x27;re looking for something you can use quickly and get dressed immediately, this isn&#x27;t it, but for a more relaxing application, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for over a year now.  I went to a \\&quot;skin party\\&quot; and everyone loved my skin.  Even the light that shows you the damage from the sun!  I am 60 and have very minute redness around my nose area from the sun.  Oh Yeah!&lt;br /&gt;I definately can say that the oil helps a whole lot.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just the best! I found out about it when I got into a car accident and my face was all beat up and my air bag burned me and gave me a black eye and a friend gave me some emu oil and told me to use it everyday and it wouldn&#x27;t scar (which was hard to believe because my face definitely looked like there was no way around it scarring). Before they gave it to me I was using neosporin and it was making me break out really bad but once I got the emu oil and started using that it did not break me out. So it doesn&#x27;t clog pores which is great! Anyways, I have only one very light almost invisible scar by my eye and that&#x27;s it. Nothing else scarred...it was a real miracle. I bought some for myself and I have been using it on my face every night and I am once again amazed at the results...I had very severe acne for years and it left a lot of really nasty scars and uneven  skin tone and I&#x27;ve been noticing that my scars are fading really fast (like after only 2-3 weeks of nightly use) and my skin tone is so much more even. And even just using it once a day has made it so I rarely have dry skin whereas I used to suffer from terribly dry skin. This stuff is just the best. It moisturizes fantastically and penetrates deep into the skin, even to your bones I&#x27;ve heard, it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and it heals scars fast and prevents them from forming if you apply to fresh wounds or burns.</li>
            <li> I had read about all the wonderful things emu oil could do, so I took a chance on finding out what it could do for my hair, specifically my hairline.  When I first got it, I used it for about 3-4 days consistently. Then forgot about it for a week or two.  Well, during one of my hair days (wash,dc,seal,and twist), I notice that the one area of my hairline seemed fuller, well, it had started to fill in!!!!  I knew it had to be the emu oil because nothing else has ever worked.  My hair seems ODDLY stronger and thicker along my hairline. Well, needless to say, I have been using it daily, and I hope to see continued thickness and fullness around my once scarce hairline.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember what I used it for so I really have no comment.</li>
            <li> My 50 year old mother with very sensitive skin loved this oil. It was a little rich for me, and I didn&#x27;t like that it came from actual emus. I gave it 4 stars because it was so hydrating for my mom and she had good results.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these bottles to add to a whipped unrefined shea butter I made for Christmas presents.  I absolutely love the stuff.  It has lightened a liver spot on my face and it is helping the red lines around my nose and all around even skin toning.  I agree with the other reviewer that said it solidifies when it gets cold.  I guess that could be a reason why the other reviewer said it made her break out.      Emu oil is virtually 100% hypo allergenic as its chemical makeup is SO close to the sebum humans create.  I think a heavy application may make a greasy feel and may create breakouts, but not if it is applied lightly.     You have to be careful what you are applying this to your skin with/to.. (essential oils, unclean skin, clogging oils) Emu oil penetrates your skin and will take whatever else you have with it into your skin.  That may be another possibility of the problem with the other reviewer.    I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  I made some of it into a serum with argon oil and jojoba oil and use it nightly when I am not using it by itself 2x daily.    Love the price too!!</li>
            <li> Really great price, shipped fast, and works great on my skin</li>
            <li> my husband uses this on his tattoos and he said it is real good and he loves it. Thank you</li>
            <li> gave it to my daughter for her baby&#x27;s scalp..he has a bit of baby dandruff...it worked pretty good.  I also tried it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is my secret weapon and I can&#x27;t be without it! It&#x27;s the only oil (Ive used many carrier oils) that really soaks into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling oily. LOVE Emu oil! Love swanson&#x27;s because its free range oil.</li>
            <li> it really works,  makes feet real soft, just shake first and use very little. you will love this product right away</li>
            <li> this product severs un countable uses been using emu oil for yrs and always a must to have on hand!</li>
            <li> I HAVE EXTREMELY DRY SKIN ON MY FEET AND I&#x27;VE SEARCHED FOR THE BEST PRODUCT.  EMU OIL HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AS THE VERY BEST MOISTURIZER.  I HAVEN&#x27;T FOUND THIS TO BE CASE.  FOR ME, THIS OIL WASN&#x27;T ANY BETTER THAN PETROLEUM JELLY AND COSTS A LOT MORE.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for moisturizing, and treating rashes and irritations. It also comes from a wonderful farm who stand by their product.</li>
            <li> I saw changes in my hairline in days. My edges had two spots gone from bad perming and braids. This product works!</li>
            <li> Helped with my psoriasis when used 2 to 4 times a day.It&#x27;s not support to according to the Psoriasis Hall of Shame, but it does. The more refined Emu oils DID NOT help. This one is whitish and thick, the more refined ones are clear, and may be a good oil, but didn&#x27;t help my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> This was shipped to me super fast!! I love this oil, it is so smooth and non greasy. I use it for my hair and skin!</li>
            <li> Oil is amazing - takes aways the ouchies very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is great.  Used daily.  No oil build up.  Great for scalp with  light enough for hair to hold style without flopping or looking weighed down with oil. Currently I mix with Jamaican Black Castor, Aloe water, tea tree oil, virgin coconut oil and jojoba  oil.  This gives a healthy look and feel.</li>
            <li> Excellent product- I use it as a moisturer it is wonderful and would recommend it to any one.</li>
            <li> The best on the market!!!</li>
            <li> This oil is great face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THE PRODUCT FOR A LONG TIME AND DO LIKE IT.  WHAT I DON&#x27;T LIKE IS THAT THE PAPER WORK YOU SEND NEVER HAS THE PRICE ON IT AND I HAVE TO WAIT  UNTIL MY VISA AT THE END OF THE MONTH TO GET THE AMOUNT DUE.  I DO NOT LIKE AUTOMATIC SENDING  AND WHEN I NEED MORE I WILL CONTACT YOU , JUST AS I HAVE DONE  IN THE PAST.  THANK YOU  VI BESLOW</li>
            <li> When I ordered this item I got it super fast. This is my first time ever using Emu Oil. It&#x27;s for a scar I have from a lazor tattoo removal. I&#x27;m hoping it will work since I tried everything else. I believe it will. Never been disappointed with Swanson.</li>
            <li> bought it because Dr. Oz said pure emu oil would help arthritic pain. It didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Did not care for this product</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this product has not bothered it at all. Has worked very well at healing piercings, I don&#x27;t need to use any abrasive products, this soaks in and apparently has antibacterial properties (according to a pro piercer who swore by it,) but also works great to soften skin. I can&#x27;t be without it in my kit. It is not greasy. It soaks in and leaves my skin very soft with no weird blotches I normally get with skin care products. If anything, it has helped some of those splotches. I have also used it on scratches.&lt;br /&gt; Best part about this product is it is a Swansons. I didn&#x27;t put two and two together when I ordered it, but it&#x27;s a product of the downtown corner store in my home town...that we have moved far away from. That&#x27;s a plus right there because if I wasn&#x27;t before, I am comfortable it is quality, and emus are raised all over ND, so I was thrilled to make the connection. The pleasant surprise they put out my favorite skin product is no shock to me.&lt;br /&gt;I will admit, since I found out it&#x27;s in my home town, I&#x27;ve hooked some friends and family on it. (And had my mom bring me some when she comes to visit.)</li>
            <li> Love this oil, would purchase again</li>
            <li> This is amazing. When first poured out of the bottle it feels more like a light liquid moisturizer. It bends well with any other oil. I usually blend it with a bit of castor oil and massage it into my scalp especially my edges. I fly a lot and emu oil stands up to very dry cabin air as a face, hand and lip moisturizer and i wear it under my make-up. Also you can&#x27;t beat the price !</li>
            <li> Emu is an amazing oil.  I use in with my moisturizer on my face neck and chest. Even good for a burn or cut.&lt;br /&gt;Its pricy but worth it as over the counter oils are more expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is that its gets very thick and white  in a cool area but liquifies upon a dollup in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of emu oil for years and this is an excellent, scent-free oil at a very reasonable price. The toggle bottle top doesn&#x27;t gum up as flip spouts do. I&#x27;d run out of emu oil, and after a few days of use, it&#x27;s already softened up my cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I have had adult acne all through my 20s. I used this for a week and I saw a huge difference. A friend of mine has had similar success. Swanson&#x27;s is a great brand! There is no smell, the product is smooth and doesn&#x27;t separate. I love this stuff! The bottle lasts for a very long time and I was applying it every night. It would have lasted longer but it turns out my dog really loves it, too.</li>
            <li> My skin became very dry during my first and second pregnancies so I purchased the 100% Emu Oil. I used it daily on my belly and the rest of my body. Not only did it help treat my dry skin it also made it super soft. It&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to early to rate this product. I only had it for a week but I&#x27;m looking forward to see what it will do. I heard so many great things about the Emu oil. I just hope it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> This Emu Oil is a great product. It made my skin smooth and supple. Will heal skin rashes too.</li>
            <li> Great product for very dry and sensitive skin. I have tried many different oils: almond, apricot, jojoba, avocado, olive, argan oil in a balm form, lanoline (pure anhydrous and in  oil form) and squalene (from olives). Pure emu oil is the best of the best from all the oils for face because it is very moisturizing, healing and relatively light. It feels like using serum and moisturizer in one.   I would say that for dry the knees, elbows and feet lanolin is a better, more effective option and less expansive.  As for using Emu oil for some serious back, joint/arthritis pain, I highly doubt it, especially if you need a fast pain relief. For me  Capsaicin cream (especially HP kind) is much more effective and faster acting than emu oil. It would take a good week to feel any noticeable difference with Emu oil. I would suggest to use Capsaisin cream with Emu oil to get \\&quot;the best of both worlds\\&quot;: fast pain relief from Capsaisin and long term anti-inflammatory result from Emu oil.</li>
            <li> so many good things about this stuff...give it a try and see for yourself...it deos everything it claims to i healed faster definitly a benefit</li>
            <li> I use this for eyelash growth and it did just that. My eyelashes are so long now that they are sexy</li>
