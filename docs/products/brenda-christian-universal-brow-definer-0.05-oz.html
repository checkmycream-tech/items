            <li>Have never come across a more perfect and universal pencil for all!</li>

            <li>I completely love this pencil.</li>
            <li>Will always buy this unless something else better comes along.</li>
            <li>The color self-matches to your hair color, as if by magic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li>Now it is available online!</li>
            <li>The color stays on from day through night, and is easy to remove with soap and water...or a pillowcase :-)  </li>
            <li>Fabulous for those of us who have very light or almost no eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It was  everything I expected it to be and very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, does not rub off, But love the color that matches so well..&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This product does what it say &amp; is superb to all other pencils ive tried.</li>
            <li>No rubbing off to easily.</li>
            <li>You must feather it on, and that part is easy.  </li>
            <li>Also I get a lot of compliments on the shape of my eyebrows because the pencil is easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it is an easy add-on to get free shipping when I don&#x27;t quite meet the minimum charge to qualify.  </li>
            <li>I am light to med skin tone, depends on time of year,</li>
            <li>Aging has intensified the outer sparsity of my brows, so using an eyebrow pencil isn&#x27;t something I was overly familiar with until this time in life.  </li>
            <li>This pencil was recommended to me by a friend and the first time I used it I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that works for me and its the perfect color for my blond, almost non-exsistent brows-it looks natural!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I need to fill in, as I don&#x27;t have full eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It looks good initially, but wears off as teh day goes on.  </li>
            <li>At best you&#x27;re lucky if u get a dull rounded end.</li>
            <li>Add a little powder and your good to go!</li>
            <li>Love this brow definer and it looks very natural with my hair coloring.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brow pencil and the sharpener that goes with it!!!  </li>
            <li>I am a solid customer of this product and can tell you, you will LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this brow pencil, but the color does not match my eyebrows exactly</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think a exact match exists!  </li>
            <li>This eyebrow pencil glides on smoothly and easily blends to create natural looking polished eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I am blonde and have naturally very light eyebrows,  so light people have asked me why I don&#x27;t have eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned with light ash blone hair &amp; this is still way too dark!</li>
            <li>I really see how important brows are and how they frame our eyes, our face.</li>
            <li>This was well worth the money, and I use it every time I put on makeup.    </li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow pencil because it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>No more trying the new and best on the market.</li>
            <li>it is not a color, it is always the right color.</li>
            <li>It would be so much easier if I had a brush specially for this purpose.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and skimpy dark eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I am a very pale blond and it works great.</li>
            <li>and I bought my first one there upon checking out and paying for the service.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it exactly matches my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that both matches my color and fills in without looking &#x60;drawn on&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>First, let me say that I have never heard of anything like this before.</li>
            <li>Also, despite have tried many different types of sharpeners</li>
            <li>and I used to only be able to get in at the salon.  </li>
            <li>Easy to sharp in and not breaking easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair, and this matches up perfect for my coloring.&lt;br /&gt;I would usually use a blonde eyebrow pencil , but have a hard time finding the right color.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that its a universal shade and can match any color eyebrows depending on how much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li>This certainly does not match every brow color.</li>
            <li>I guess I could say as a con that it does not always go on smoothly; that is, it skips occasionally.</li>
            <li>I have very sparse eyebrows</li>
            <li>I do really like the brow liner.</li>
            <li>I have to use tissue to try to lighten it, but often wipe off too much.</li>
            <li>It really matches what ever your hair color is.</li>
            <li>(Thanks to this pencil.)  </li>
            <li>You really will like it.</li>
            <li>, brush eyebrows with an eyebrow bush to blend the color and subdue the lines and your ready to go.</li>
            <li>lasts a long time and lasts all day, I am blonde with sparse eyebrows, looks very natural and good.</li>
            <li>For years I tried to find an eyebrow pencil that made it easy for me to have natural looking eyebrows that you could actually see.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and lasts all day long even after a grueling workout at the gym</li>
            <li>, it looks more like a dark brown color on me.  </li>
            <li>My complexion/features are very fair, so my usual problem is that cosmetics are too dark and severe for me.</li>
            <li>Just make quick short &#x27;hairs&#x27; with the pencil</li>
            <li>At 1st I was doubtful about this product, but after reading so many great reviews I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Looks natural!!</li>
            <li>But this really looks like my natural brow color.</li>
            <li>I have brown hair, with a blonde golden weave.</li>
            <li>However a word of caution, this is made to fill in existings hairs,if you are one of those who likes to make up MOST of your brow this might nt work for you but, &amp; looks grey/taupe against just plain skin w/ no hairs.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural and it stays on well.  </li>
            <li>My friends say it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I was sold my first by an esthetician in Los Angeles and have never looked back.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how it actually matches your hair color exactly</li>
            <li>Looks so natural whatever color your brown are!  </li>
            <li>Not to dark, not to light.  </li>
            <li>not sure I&#x27;m in love, but I def like the color and the way it goes on.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I powder over it to smooth out the color and often use a little spiral brush to even out the texture and shape.  </li>
            <li>Natural, natural, natural...</li>
            <li>Brings a natural fullness to my brows.</li>
            <li>I always use either this one or Estee Lauder&#x27;s Automatic Brow Pencil in Soft Brown.</li>
            <li>ThIs &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; color eye-brow pencil fills in my thinning brows so naturally.  </li>
            <li>I have a natural arch</li>
            <li>My eyebrows look natural.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this pencil to anyone looking for a natural looking application without the worry of matching hair color.</li>
            <li>Since I really hate that &amp;#34;drawn on with permanent marker&amp;#34; look, this is just perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Took a couple of tries to find the right pressure for application</li>
            <li>No other brow pencil compares to this one when it comes to naturally shaping them.</li>
            <li>Like no other, you can&#x27;t see pencil marks once applied, CORRECTLY!  </li>
            <li>the wood in this pencil is so coarse &amp; rough that you&#x27;re lucky if you can expose any of the pencil.</li>
            <li>Just really didn&#x27;t like it at all, the color was not natural at all.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;universal&#x27; parlays the benefit of it - that the color tends to blend in with your natural eyebrow hair color.  </li>
            <li>No regrets what&#x27;s so ever.</li>
            <li>I have tried dark brown products as well, but it still doesn&#x27;t match exactly either</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that using the pencil tip doesn&#x27;t result in as natural a look as using it laid flat against the brow.  </li>
            <li>I have lost much of my brows due to my age.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got silvery natural color hair and it&#x27;s been hard to get a complimentary brow pencil.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this from Planet Beauty, local to me, and now see if they should stop selling it can buy here, or directly from Brenda Christian site.</li>
            <li>At 66, my eyebrows are now four different colors --grey, brown, white and blonde and very patchy.  </li>

            <li> They are the best I have ever found and the only ones I now buy.</li>
            <li> Have never come across a more perfect and universal pencil for all!</li>
            <li> I want to be able to draw on brows that look natural.&lt;br /&gt;MM</li>
            <li> Love this pencil.</li>
            <li> I completely love this pencil.</li>
            <li> Will always buy this unless something else better comes along.</li>
            <li> The color self-matches to your hair color, as if by magic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li> Now it is available online!</li>
            <li> The color stays on from day through night, and is easy to remove with soap and water...or a pillowcase :-)  </li>
            <li> Fabulous for those of us who have very light or almost no eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It was  everything I expected it to be and very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, does not rub off, But love the color that matches so well..&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This product does what it say &amp; is superb to all other pencils ive tried.</li>
            <li> No rubbing off to easily.</li>
            <li> You must feather it on, and that part is easy.  </li>
            <li> Also I get a lot of compliments on the shape of my eyebrows because the pencil is easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it is an easy add-on to get free shipping when I don&#x27;t quite meet the minimum charge to qualify.  </li>
            <li> I am light to med skin tone, depends on time of year,</li>
            <li> Aging has intensified the outer sparsity of my brows, so using an eyebrow pencil isn&#x27;t something I was overly familiar with until this time in life.  </li>
            <li> This pencil was recommended to me by a friend and the first time I used it I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that works for me and its the perfect color for my blond, almost non-exsistent brows-it looks natural!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I need to fill in, as I don&#x27;t have full eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It looks good initially, but wears off as teh day goes on.  </li>
            <li> At best you&#x27;re lucky if u get a dull rounded end.</li>
            <li> Add a little powder and your good to go!</li>
            <li> Love this brow definer and it looks very natural with my hair coloring.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brow pencil and the sharpener that goes with it!!!  </li>
            <li> I am a solid customer of this product and can tell you, you will LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this brow pencil, but the color does not match my eyebrows exactly</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think a exact match exists!  </li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil glides on smoothly and easily blends to create natural looking polished eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I am blonde and have naturally very light eyebrows,  so light people have asked me why I don&#x27;t have eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned with light ash blone hair &amp; this is still way too dark!</li>
            <li> I really see how important brows are and how they frame our eyes, our face.</li>
            <li> This was well worth the money, and I use it every time I put on makeup.    </li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow pencil because it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> No more trying the new and best on the market.</li>
            <li> it is not a color, it is always the right color.</li>
            <li> It would be so much easier if I had a brush specially for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and skimpy dark eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I am a very pale blond and it works great.</li>
            <li> and I bought my first one there upon checking out and paying for the service.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it exactly matches my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that both matches my color and fills in without looking &#x60;drawn on&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I have never heard of anything like this before.</li>
            <li> Also, despite have tried many different types of sharpeners</li>
            <li> and I used to only be able to get in at the salon.  </li>
            <li> Easy to sharp in and not breaking easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair, and this matches up perfect for my coloring.&lt;br /&gt;I would usually use a blonde eyebrow pencil , but have a hard time finding the right color.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that its a universal shade and can match any color eyebrows depending on how much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> This certainly does not match every brow color.</li>
            <li> I guess I could say as a con that it does not always go on smoothly; that is, it skips occasionally.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyebrows</li>
            <li> I do really like the brow liner.</li>
            <li> I have to use tissue to try to lighten it, but often wipe off too much.</li>
            <li> It really matches what ever your hair color is.</li>
            <li> (Thanks to this pencil.)  </li>
            <li> You really will like it.</li>
            <li> , brush eyebrows with an eyebrow bush to blend the color and subdue the lines and your ready to go.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time and lasts all day, I am blonde with sparse eyebrows, looks very natural and good.</li>
            <li> For years I tried to find an eyebrow pencil that made it easy for me to have natural looking eyebrows that you could actually see.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and lasts all day long even after a grueling workout at the gym</li>
            <li> , it looks more like a dark brown color on me.  </li>
            <li> My complexion/features are very fair, so my usual problem is that cosmetics are too dark and severe for me.</li>
            <li> Just make quick short &#x27;hairs&#x27; with the pencil</li>
            <li> At 1st I was doubtful about this product, but after reading so many great reviews I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Looks natural!!</li>
            <li> But this really looks like my natural brow color.</li>
            <li> I have brown hair, with a blonde golden weave.</li>
            <li> However a word of caution, this is made to fill in existings hairs,if you are one of those who likes to make up MOST of your brow this might nt work for you but, &amp; looks grey/taupe against just plain skin w/ no hairs.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural and it stays on well.  </li>
            <li> My friends say it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I was sold my first by an esthetician in Los Angeles and have never looked back.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how it actually matches your hair color exactly</li>
            <li> Looks so natural whatever color your brown are!  </li>
            <li> Not to dark, not to light.  </li>
            <li> not sure I&#x27;m in love, but I def like the color and the way it goes on.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I powder over it to smooth out the color and often use a little spiral brush to even out the texture and shape.  </li>
            <li> Natural, natural, natural...</li>
            <li> Brings a natural fullness to my brows.</li>
            <li> I always use either this one or Estee Lauder&#x27;s Automatic Brow Pencil in Soft Brown.</li>
            <li> ThIs &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; color eye-brow pencil fills in my thinning brows so naturally.  </li>
            <li> I have a natural arch</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look natural.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this pencil to anyone looking for a natural looking application without the worry of matching hair color.</li>
            <li> Since I really hate that &amp;#34;drawn on with permanent marker&amp;#34; look, this is just perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Took a couple of tries to find the right pressure for application</li>
            <li> No other brow pencil compares to this one when it comes to naturally shaping them.</li>
            <li> Like no other, you can&#x27;t see pencil marks once applied, CORRECTLY!  </li>
            <li> the wood in this pencil is so coarse &amp; rough that you&#x27;re lucky if you can expose any of the pencil.</li>
            <li> Just really didn&#x27;t like it at all, the color was not natural at all.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;universal&#x27; parlays the benefit of it - that the color tends to blend in with your natural eyebrow hair color.  </li>
            <li> No regrets what&#x27;s so ever.</li>
            <li> I have tried dark brown products as well, but it still doesn&#x27;t match exactly either</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using the pencil tip doesn&#x27;t result in as natural a look as using it laid flat against the brow.  </li>
            <li> I have lost much of my brows due to my age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got silvery natural color hair and it&#x27;s been hard to get a complimentary brow pencil.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this from Planet Beauty, local to me, and now see if they should stop selling it can buy here, or directly from Brenda Christian site.</li>
            <li> At 66, my eyebrows are now four different colors --grey, brown, white and blonde and very patchy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55, and although my natural brow color (when younger) was a dark brown, they are now getting lighter with the occasional gray hair.  </li>
            <li> I have strawberry blonde hair and very light blonde eyebrows and finding a brow color even remotely close was difficult.  </li>
            <li> From the previous reviews I bought it think it would look natural and not harsh and dark.  </li>
            <li> They last so long!</li>
            <li> It last a VERY, VERY long time</li>
            <li> use short strokes to apply it to my brows, then use a small, soft baby toothbrush to blend and position the individual hairs.  </li>
            <li> I Have been looking for an eyebrow definer for a long time.  </li>
            <li> also lasts for a Long time..</li>
            <li> Only pencil I use since attending a beauty show at the Jacob Javitts Center in NYC over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> I began using this when I was a brunette, about 20 years ago, and I use it today with hair that&#x27;s turned grey.  </li>
            <li> And it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s close to 1/2 way done due to constant sharpening that does not even work coz</li>
            <li> And it lasts for a very long time....</li>
            <li> It also seem&#x27;d to be dry</li>
            <li> This is the only brow pencil I can use which doesn&#x27;t set off my eczema and make me look like Cruella Daville with dark brows.</li>
            <li> It is also long lasting and mine usually last at least a year or longer.</li>
            <li> Everyday I see the before and after, makes such a difference, and is NOT noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Five years ago I lost my hair and eyebrows from chemo but the upside was being introduced to this product by the cancer center make up artist.  </li>
            <li> Eyebrows are the center piece of the face - so to speak - So it goes without saying that you need a quality product to help define them.  </li>
            <li> but if I jave to manually sharpen an eyebrow pencil I&#x27;d like it to be sharp enough to draw or at least come close mimicing actual eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> I first learned about it when I went to have my eyebrows shaped professionally (in an extremely expensive and upscale salon at the Jersey shore).  </li>
            <li> I echo other comments ...</li>
            <li> It worked just as well as my pencils have in the past ordered through Brenda Christian,</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews from Amazon as well as other websites.</li>
            <li> But this occurs no more or less than the vast majority of cosmetic pencils I have tried, so</li>
            <li> and now that I&#x27;m a dark brunette the pencil works just as well.</li>
            <li> Some were too dark, some would just smudge if I accidentally touch it, some didn&#x27;t blend in to the hair that is there.</li>
            <li> WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li> At least those last for close to a year!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are odd.</li>
            <li> It takes less than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> It is a slightly orangey brown.</li>
            <li> After applying, I can see it needs to be a little lighter, but I have no brush.</li>
            <li> Will order a few to give as gift to my sisters.</li>
            <li> I am Asian and the color of my eyebrows are blackish, but black colored brow products tends to be too dark and makes it look kinda fake.  </li>
            <li> No more mixing powders when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> so getting a color that looks natural had been very difficult until I found this one.</li>
            <li> If you have a hard time finding brow color that works for you, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 4yrs now at least.</li>
            <li> I have bought at least four or five pencils of this product over the years.</li>
            <li> Not a good match for everyone as claimed.</li>
            <li> I just applied it for everyday use and didn&#x27;t go crazy.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t look fake or over done!</li>
            <li> A friend with coloring lighter than mine loves this, so I was skeptical it would work for me, but it worked!  </li>
            <li> it , You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> Terrible!!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You have an excellent product. The best bow pen I have ever used. My friends like it to since I introduced them to it.</li>
            <li> Very good eyebrow pencil and color.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this brow pencil by a stylist.  I have a very fair complexion with reddish hair so getting a color that looks natural had been very difficult until I found this one. It looks great on all kinds of skin tones. This pencil color actually changes according to your coloring.  My daughter who has a more medium complexion with light brown hair also uses it and it looks great on her.  It looks very natural and it stays on well.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Love this....I have used this for many years just can&#x27;t find it in stores.  I have fair skin and skimpy dark eyebrows.  This works great in filling in my brows.  My friend has light brows and this works great on hers as well.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I recently lost the second one I had purchased, and am now in need of getting another one.  With no hesitations whatsoever, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 4yrs now at least. Brings a natural fullness to my brows. I have NO idea how it matches my brow hairs so perfectly, even when I might change coloring of my hair... I really see how important brows are and how they frame our eyes, our face. I am light to med skin tone, depends on time of year, etc...have hazel eyes, blond to med brown high-lights and low-lights... My eyes pop when I use this brow fill in, no matter what season. Everyday I see the before and after, makes such a difference, and is NOT noticeable.  I have purchased this from Planet Beauty, local to me, and now see if they should stop selling it can buy here, or directly from Brenda Christian site. I want to try her lip gloss next... Going to buy 2 this time so I can have a back up... It does not smudge nor wear off till I take it off. One of my fav products, must have!!!! Thank you Brenda !</li>
            <li> Love this brow pencil.  It was  everything I expected it to be and very happy with my purchase.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the best brow pencil ever made.  I have strawberry blonde hair and very light blonde eyebrows and finding a brow color even remotely close was difficult.  Five years ago I lost my hair and eyebrows from chemo but the upside was being introduced to this product by the cancer center make up artist.  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but the color is consistent and perfect every time, even if my color is lighter or darker.  My friends used it when we went on a girls&#x27; weekend and each got the color she needed from the same pencil.  I am a customer for life!!</li>
            <li> I Have been looking for an eyebrow definer for a long time.  I need to fill in, as I don&#x27;t have full eyebrows.  the Universal is perfect.  I can&#x27;t believe how the color blends in. Ordered my second one.</li>
            <li> Natural, natural, natural...that is the beauty of this eyebrow pencil...it is not a color, it is always the right color. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I try to find pros and cons to every item I review, but I couldn&#x27;t think of any cons with this brow liner/definer.    It matches my eyebrows, just like it claims to do with every color of eyebrow! My complexion/features are very fair, so my usual problem is that cosmetics are too dark and severe for me. But this really looks like my natural brow color. I haven&#x27;t tested it on anyone else, however, so I can&#x27;t speak for those with darker features.    I guess I could say as a con that it does not always go on smoothly; that is, it skips occasionally. But this occurs no more or less than the vast majority of cosmetic pencils I have tried, so I didn&#x27;t think it was fair to deduct stars for it.     I wish this was semi-permanent, since the color works so well for me.    This was well worth the money, and I use it every time I put on makeup.    Great product!</li>
            <li> I have brown hair, with a blonde golden weave. I&#x27;m fair, and this matches up perfect for my coloring.&lt;br /&gt;I would usually use a blonde eyebrow pencil , but have a hard time finding the right color. So I thought I would give this a try. I love it. It goes on smooth, does not rub off, But love the color that matches so well..&lt;br /&gt;This also lasts for a Long time..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it , You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this pencil for years it is genius.  lasts a long time and lasts all day, I am blonde with sparse eyebrows, looks very natural and good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got silvery natural color hair and it&#x27;s been hard to get a complimentary brow pencil. This one is perfect!</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil can be used on most any eyebrow. I used it when I was a blond and now that I&#x27;m a dark brunette the pencil works just as well. And it lasts for a very long time....years! And I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this brow definer several times over the years.  It last a VERY, VERY long time and I find it to truly be &#x27;universal&#x27;.  I first learned about it when I went to have my eyebrows shaped professionally (in an extremely expensive and upscale salon at the Jersey shore).  They use it there on everyone and I bought my first one there upon checking out and paying for the service.  Now I purchase on Amazon as the price is great and it is an easy add-on to get free shipping when I don&#x27;t quite meet the minimum charge to qualify.  I always use either this one or Estee Lauder&#x27;s Automatic Brow Pencil in Soft Brown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55, and although my natural brow color (when younger) was a dark brown, they are now getting lighter with the occasional gray hair.  I echo other comments ... I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it exactly matches my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use short strokes to apply it to my brows, then use a small, soft baby toothbrush to blend and position the individual hairs.  Works like a charm every time.  Since I really hate that &amp;#34;drawn on with permanent marker&amp;#34; look, this is just perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are odd. There&#x27;s one diagonal line on both sides that are sparse. This pencil fills them in perfectly. If you want glamorous eyebrows, you can achieve that with this pencil as well. I just applied it for everyday use and didn&#x27;t go crazy. My eyebrows are medium brown with a hint of red and I was scared this pencil wouldn&#x27;t blend. With the right pressure, it will blend in perfectly. Took a couple of tries to find the right pressure for application but now it&#x27;s a breeze. It takes less than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> Simply the best and only brow pencil that matches perfectly to all brow colors and goes on beautifully. I was sold my first by an esthetician in Los Angeles and have never looked back. 5 or 6 years ago, maybe 10, actually, is when I purchased it and it took me from my 40&#x27;s into my 50&#x27;s, soon it will be 60&#x27;s. I almost ran out once and I literally had heart palpitations imagining life without Brenda Christian&#x27;s brow definer. And it lasts.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> ThIs &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; color eye-brow pencil fills in my thinning brows so naturally.  I have a natural arch so I have a shape to follow.  The color stays on, even after swimming.  My daughters, 45, 41, and 32 compliment me on my make-up, and they would be truthful if I looked &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34; .  You will like this brow pencil.</li>
            <li> Beat on the market.....</li>
            <li> Finally an eyebrow pencil that does what it says it will do.  Please don&#x27;t stop making it !  You&#x27;re the greatest !</li>
            <li> This is definitely the BEST eyebrow product ever!  I have very sparse eyebrows and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that both matches my color and fills in without looking &#x60;drawn on&#x27;.  I highly recommend this brow pencil and the sharpener that goes with it!!!  I buy them two at time, so I always have a back up.  I also gave one to my friend going through chemo for breast cancer.  She&#x27;s now a survivor and a fan of Brenda Christian Brow Definer.</li>
            <li> So happy I took a chance on this product.  Color blends with my eyebrows and doesn&#x27;t make them look drawn on.  Just wish it had a spoolie or brush on the opposite end...</li>
            <li> I saw this brow definer in a paper catalog and felt I could do better price wise, which I did via Amazon.  The &#x27;universal&#x27; parlays the benefit of it - that the color tends to blend in with your natural eyebrow hair color.  I&#x27;ve found that using the pencil tip doesn&#x27;t result in as natural a look as using it laid flat against the brow.  Perhaps this is the way it&#x27;s done anyway ...  Aging has intensified the outer sparsity of my brows, so using an eyebrow pencil isn&#x27;t something I was overly familiar with until this time in life.  I&#x27;m extremely happy to have found a product that blends in so well, just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!!  Can be used with any skin and hair color!!  Looks natural!!</li>
            <li> I have used these pencils for years. They are the best I have ever found and the only ones I now buy. No more trying the new and best on the market. These are the best. They last and I do use them every day. I started using them when I was about 40. The color adapts to your coloring. If you want a great eyebrow pencil this is it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brow pencil, works with any skin tone! Really! And it doesn&#x27;t look fake or over done! So glad I bought it! This is my second pencil... They last so long!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years!  Have never come across a more perfect and universal pencil for all!</li>
            <li> I do really like the brow liner. However, I wish there had been a brow brush with it. After applying, I can see it needs to be a little lighter, but I have no brush. I looked in stores but can&#x27;t find one. I have to use tissue to try to lighten it, but often wipe off too much. It would be so much easier if I had a brush specially for this purpose. I have lost much of my brows due to my age. I want to be able to draw on brows that look natural.&lt;br /&gt;MM</li>
            <li> Love this pencil. Amazing that can be blend with any kind of hair brow color. It is amazing how this works.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! Every time it runs low I buy another one. I am blonde and have naturally very light eyebrows,  so light people have asked me why I don&#x27;t have eyebrows. For years I tried to find an eyebrow pencil that made it easy for me to have natural looking eyebrows that you could actually see. Some were too dark, some would just smudge if I accidentally touch it, some didn&#x27;t blend in to the hair that is there. This pencil was recommended to me by a friend and the first time I used it I fell in love with it. I&#x27;ve never used another eyebrow pencil again and never will.</li>
            <li> Love this brow definer and it looks very natural with my hair coloring.  Hightly recommend!</li>
            <li> It great. Perfect color for everyone.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for those of us who have very light or almost no eyebrows.  It really matches what ever your hair color is.</li>
            <li> I completely love this pencil. No regrets what&#x27;s so ever. My eyebrows look natural.  Will order a few to give as gift to my sisters. Will definitely keep buying.</li>
            <li> Good price, good product, I  would be lost without this brow liner. Love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect color. Perfect flow of color. No rubbing off to easily. Great product. Easy to sharp in and not breaking easy</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses my account to purchase these pencils. My sister who is a makeup artist for Bravo TV turned her on to this brand because she said she has tried EVERYTHING else and this is the best.</li>
            <li> Received the pencil in record time.  It worked just as well as my pencils have in the past ordered through Brenda Christian,</li>
            <li> This product does what it say &amp; is superb to all other pencils ive tried. However a word of caution, this is made to fill in existings hairs,if you are one of those who likes to make up MOST of your brow this might nt work for you but, &amp; looks grey/taupe against just plain skin w/ no hairs.</li>
            <li> Only pencil I use since attending a beauty show at the Jacob Javitts Center in NYC over 10 years ago. I order online and receive excellent and prompt service.</li>
            <li> Will always buy this unless something else better comes along.</li>
            <li> Excellent color no matter what color  your brows are!  Been using this for over 20 years!  Add a little powder and your good to go!</li>
            <li> This is a UNIVERSAL COLOR brow liner!  Like no other, you can&#x27;t see pencil marks once applied, CORRECTLY!  You must feather it on, and that part is easy.  The color self-matches to your hair color, as if by magic.  The color stays on from day through night, and is easy to remove with soap and water...or a pillowcase :-)  I began using this when I was a brunette, about 20 years ago, and I use it today with hair that&#x27;s turned grey.  :-(  I kid you not!  Not a day passes without someone complimenting me on my eyebrows!  Can you imagine?  Strangers, coming up to me, saying, I have the most beautiful eyebrows!  (Thanks to this pencil.)  One pencil lasts me about a year with proper sharpening, and I only sharpen it occasionally.  I am a solid customer of this product and can tell you, you will LOVE IT!  Hint:  If you&#x27;re ordering one, order two, and pack one of them in your makeup kit for travel...as the shipping should be the same for two?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I was really excited to try this brow pencil, but the color does not match my eyebrows exactly, it looks more like a dark brown color on me.  I am Asian and the color of my eyebrows are blackish, but black colored brow products tends to be too dark and makes it look kinda fake.  I have tried dark brown products as well, but it still doesn&#x27;t match exactly either, I don&#x27;t think a exact match exists!  I will still use this pencil since it is convenient to carry around in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing browpwncil I have ever had. I have no idea how it actually matches your hair color exactly but all I know is this is my pencil for life. And it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li> This is the only brow pencil I can use which doesn&#x27;t set off my eczema and make me look like Cruella Daville with dark brows. At 66, my eyebrows are now four different colors --grey, brown, white and blonde and very patchy.  This pencil both fills in the gaps (I stipple) and colors the various hairs.  My friends say it looks very natural. I powder over it to smooth out the color and often use a little spiral brush to even out the texture and shape.  This product has good \\&quot;cling\\&quot; and will stay on throughout.  Lasts for several hours; not all day, but the all day brow products set off my allergies.  If I want it to last longer, I spray my spiral brow brush with Aubrey&#x27;s hairspray and then brush my brows after I have used the pencil.  You can also buy commercial brow spray.  This also sets the brows to stay in shape.  But I don&#x27;t do this all of the time.  I also use this pencil as an eyeliner sometimes; it&#x27;s very nice to take on trips to reduce number of items carried along. You can sterilize it just by sharpening; it holds a nice point and is a good texture.  No flaking.  I used to purchase this from another online retailer, but I have Amazon Prime and it is nice to just \\&quot;click\\&quot; and have no mailing costs. Try this!  You really will like it. I have bought at least four or five pencils of this product over the years.</li>
            <li> From the previous reviews I bought it think it would look natural and not harsh and dark.  I have blonde hair.  Didn&#x27;t look any different than a brown pencil.</li>
            <li> Excellent brow pencil.  Wish it had a brush attached!</li>
            <li> Looks so natural whatever color your brown are!  Lasts forever too.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  Not to dark, not to light.  Just perfect.  Goes on smoothly and lasts all day long even after a grueling workout at the gym</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I have never heard of anything like this before. I bought this based on reviews from Amazon as well as other websites. So, I just took a chance and bought it. I am very glad I did. Eyebrows are the center piece of the face - so to speak - So it goes without saying that you need a quality product to help define them.  This product does just that. It goes on so smooth and it matches my eyebrows perfectly. I use this to outline and fill in. I also use a bit of a powder product for definition. I will continue to get this product.</li>
            <li> Not a good match for everyone as claimed. I am fair skinned with light ash blone hair &amp; this is still way too dark! Also, despite have tried many different types of sharpeners the wood in this pencil is so coarse &amp; rough that you&#x27;re lucky if you can expose any of the pencil. At best you&#x27;re lucky if u get a dull rounded end. Idk about anyone else but if I jave to manually sharpen an eyebrow pencil I&#x27;d like it to be sharp enough to draw or at least come close mimicing actual eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil glides on smoothly and easily blends to create natural looking polished eyebrows. I love the fact that its a universal shade and can match any color eyebrows depending on how much pressure is applied. Once applied, the pencil has good staying power without the need of a brow setting gel. I would recommend this pencil to anyone looking for a natural looking application without the worry of matching hair color.</li>
            <li> Just really didn&#x27;t like it at all, the color was not natural at all.  It also seem&#x27;d to be dry</li>
            <li> This certainly does not match every brow color. It is a slightly orangey brown.</li>
            <li> I like this pencil…not sure I&#x27;m in love, but I def like the color and the way it goes on. I&#x27;m still on the search for my soulmate eyebrow pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If you know of a better one, let me know! Thx!)</li>
            <li> The color is perfect. I am a very pale blond and it works great. I would buy this again and again</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow pencil because it looks so natural. Also I get a lot of compliments on the shape of my eyebrows because the pencil is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that works for me and its the perfect color for my blond, almost non-exsistent brows-it looks natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years!! I love it! No matter what your skin tone this pencil will match your brows perfectly!</li>
            <li> Terrible!!!!!! I would always have to sharpen the pencil! I suggest buying it from actual Brenda Christian site! At least those last for close to a year! This one I just bought, I haven&#x27;t had for 2 mos and it&#x27;s close to 1/2 way done due to constant sharpening that does not even work coz the pencil keeps breaking off!!!!!! RIP OFF!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it does! If you have a hard time finding brow color that works for you, give this a try. A friend with coloring lighter than mine loves this, so I was skeptical it would work for me, but it worked!  Just make quick short &#x27;hairs&#x27; with the pencil, brush eyebrows with an eyebrow bush to blend the color and subdue the lines and your ready to go.</li>
            <li> It looks good initially, but wears off as teh day goes on.  I have had longer lasting products.  Probably wont&#x27; buy again since it&#x27;s pricey.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow pecil I&#x27;ve ever used.  My aesthetician firstgave me this pencil a number of years ago and I used to only be able to get in at the salon.  Now it is available online! No matter your haircolor, this pencil &amp;#34;adjusts&amp;#34; to the best natural color for the user. It is also long lasting and mine usually last at least a year or longer.</li>
            <li> At 1st I was doubtful about this product, but after reading so many great reviews I decided to try it. WOW! It does perfectly match my brow and hair color. No more mixing powders when I&#x27;m in a hurry. I&#x27;m even going to buy a 2nd one to keep in my bag for tochups. It also stays put until I wash it off. I just train my brows in place with petroleum jelly or chapstick. I am a believer!</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyebrow pencil for my scanty eyebrows for about 7 years now.  No other brow pencil compares to this one when it comes to naturally shaping them. Well worth the money!</li>
