            <li>Hauschka and was most impressed with this cleansing cream.</li>

            <li>Good price on Amazon</li>

            <li>I saw a lot of good reviews on Amazon and decided to order the cleansing cream.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff -it smells a bit like dough or bread, doesn&#x27;t tighten skin, and it just feels great.</li>
            <li>Dr. Hauschka makes great products and I love ever one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>My skin stays happy and healthy when</li>
            <li>I do feel good that I&#x27;m not damaging my skin&#x27;s own protective layer, though, instead of rubbing it off.    </li>
            <li>Just the best product out there for great cleansing and not harsh!</li>

            <li>This is some kind of wonder product.</li>
            <li>I have tried Dr. H products before and have really liked them, and I think that this cream is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works with my own skin PH and have used this for years.</li>

            <li>Love this product-</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>This has worked for me and the tube lasts me more than 3 months.  </li>
            <li>I had been using Obagi Nu Derm (too many chemicals).</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products they make.  </li>
            <li>Gentle exfoliation stimulates my skin, great makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love their biodynamic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever looked this healthy.</li>
            <li>As she instructed, I filled a basin with really warm water and added the Lavender Bath Essence to it, then soaked a facecloth in it and held that to my face for a bit.  </li>
            <li>This is a paste and once you get over that, you will fall in love with it.</li>
            <li>My acne is under better control with the help of this magic cream.    </li>
            <li>dr. h products are simply the best.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I USE THIS CLEANSER MORE LIKE A SCRUB..AND</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite face washes besides the Dr. H cleansing milk.</li>
            <li>love this product....</li>
            <li>This my favorite cleanser ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy, smells wonderful and is a great, gentle exfoliator that actually makes me look forward to washing my face.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also holistic, which makes me feel better about using it on my skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent cleaning without any red skin.</li>
            <li>Most of his products are applied with a press and roll technique.</li>
            <li>Its the best cleanser, it leaves your skin clean, soft and the smell is relaxing.</li>
            <li>but so far so good!</li>
            <li>The texture is not creamy but more of a fine paste.</li>
            <li>Am so glad Amazon is now making it available.</li>
            <li>I used this cleansing cream in the shower and after worth it feels really nice...</li>
            <li>Not as impressed as I was with Dr Hauschka&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li>Excellent for acne prone skin along with the other products as listed in the kit for &amp;#34;impure skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love how my face feels after I use it, though I&#x27;m always worried about the lack of clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll list it&#x27;s attributes to make it easy for your purchasing decision:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is the latter, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>After I used it up, being a cheap college student, I didn&#x27;t pay the ~$23</li>
            <li>I just make a mixture with warm water and then press it gently into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I switched to Dr. Hauschka cleansing cream, toner, daily oil, and the rhythmic night conditioner and my skin looks great.  </li>
            <li>it is not abrasive and helps to keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I Enjoy this Dr. Hauschka Cleansing Cream.</li>
            <li>Cleanser isn&#x27;t harsh &amp; very effective!  </li>
            <li>Face feels fresh and clean!  </li>
            <li>Good for mild and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products, and especially the cleansing cream, are absolutely amazing!  </li>
            <li>The Cleansing Cream is so mild and leaves skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It may be better for someone who has more tolerance for breakouts and clogs than I do, or a young girl or a guy who doesn&#x27;t wear any makeup.</li>
            <li>I use it in the mornings when my face is mostly clean anyway, and I don&#x27;t need to use a harsher cleanser.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clean my pores</li>
            <li>Face didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li>I tried out the Clarifying Toner, and loved it so much that I had to buy the whole routine.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these products are fabulous for me!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s whole line.  </li>
            <li>You have to give it a full 30 days.  </li>
            <li>It is my absolute favorite out of everything I have tried.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I use this product in addition to the cleansing milk and my skin feels like I just had a facial at Mist in Santa Fe (run and operated by my talented niece).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad cleanser, just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I was able to use this despite having used something else that had basically tortured my skin by \\&quot;burning\\&quot; it,yet the cleansing cream actually seemed to make it better.    </li>
            <li>Now that I have formed new habits, I love using his products.</li>
            <li>My skin looks pretty good, and I&#x27;ve only just started using this.</li>
            <li>With a hot washcloth to open facial pores, this cleansing cream does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>At first it seems like your skin may not be getting clean, but that is just because the moisture is not being stripped from your skin.</li>
            <li>While searching online for exfoliant recommendations, I came across quite a few people commenting about how great this cream is.  </li>
            <li>They are top of the line for all natural skin care.  </li>
            <li>The idea of this product is that the herbs in it &#x27;stimulate&#x27; the skin&#x27;s own cleansing process, so I guess it would be a different feeling.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural as well.  </li>
            <li>All of Hauschka is pricey, but at this stage, transformation is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I have loved all the other Dr. Hauschka products I&#x27;ve tried, but not this one.</li>
            <li>If you really want that clean feeling, and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time cleansing your face, this isn&#x27;t for you.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild formula with a soft exfoliater.  </li>
            <li>it gets makeup off well but is gentle and if you don&#x27;t like feeling clogged by lotion at night, this is a good way to clean without feeling dried out.  </li>
            <li>My wife is like it very much in two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I broke out pretty extensively, in a way I haven&#x27;t in many months.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I will definitely try more products from Dr. Hauschka</li>
            <li>say, you&#x27;d have to be pretty open-minded to try this, but you might be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I began buying it more recently on a regular basis and people think I look 25.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>That was my second favorite item in the sample kit.</li>
            <li>(but I can&#x27;t afford that much of it!)</li>
            <li>..NICE AND GENTLE!</li>
            <li>AT FIRST IT GIVES A GREASY FEELING</li>
            <li>And yes, it is supposed to be an off white (tan) color :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m male and love Dr. Hauschka.  </li>
            <li>You can try it in one of the sample kits first.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite facial cleanser in the world, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
            <li>It is more like a scrub and indeed has a lot of herbs and essential oils.</li>
            <li>If u have dry or normal skin will be ok not for oily congested skin!</li>
            <li>I have used Dr. Hauschka products on and off for 20 years with positive results.</li>
            <li>Their ingredients are completely pure, with no synthetics to worry about.  </li>
            <li>I have oil skin with large pores and his products worked wonders.</li>
            <li>my pores don&#x27;t recommend who has large pores like me</li>
            <li>If you do, you will certainly have irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 and starting to see fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes and smoothes your face without being unnecessarily abrasive, and is great even for every day use.</li>
            <li>Really</li>
            <li>as for uses, I don&#x27;t use this as a primary cleanser, and definitely not as an exfoliating scrub as the description might imply.</li>
            <li>Really cleans the pores out and smoothes skin out.</li>
            <li>I bumped into a Hauschka saleswoman stocking her shelves at a Whole Foods and she explained how to care for my skin with the product line.</li>
            <li>Gentle and nourishing.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I have a combination type skin with T section being really oily.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>No so much.</li>
            <li>It really cleanse your face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had an exfoliator that has been this gentle and cleaned</li>
            <li>I bought it at a yoga retreat in the late 90&#x27;s and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any other cleanser on top of this.  </li>
            <li>So I ordered the Cleansing Milk, Cleansing Cream, Facial Toner, Normalizing Day Oil, Daily Moisturizing Cream and the Lavender Oil from Amazon since it was a better deal than at WF.</li>
            <li>This has to be our 20th Dr. Hauschka product and we just keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>After rinsing it off, my skin is incredibly smooth and soft and actually a bit tighter.</li>
            <li>My skin feels better after I use it, which is saying a lot, since some cleansers (and especially exfoliants) leave it red and</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and almost everything makes me break out, but this actually helps my face stay smooth and clear!</li>
            <li>nothing harsh but seemingly wonderfully to exfoliate the face (but not sure the cleansing agent works?!)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>price is high compare to the amount use every time and the size of the tube</li>
            <li>For bumpy areas, spend a little more time pressing and rolling the cream.  </li>
            <li>I use half a pea size in the morning (face still pretty clean) and a pea size of Dr. H&#x27;s cleansing cream at night.  </li>
            <li>(I dab a couple spots on my forehead, cheeks, jaw, temples and chin then wet my hands and lightly rub)</li>
            <li>Using these two products together helps to remove all dirt from the face yet it is gentle to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I get several sample boxes each month and rarely buy full-size items from them, but this is one of the exceptions.</li>
            <li>Her skin is improving daily, hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy and clear in several years.</li>
            <li>The Dr. Hauschka line has a whole philosophy that&#x27;s akin to homeopathic medicine, and I&#x27;m not sure I believe any of it, but something about their products agrees with my skin, so maybe there&#x27;s more to it than meets the eye.</li>
            <li>The instructions recommend using their Cleansing Milk, but I&#x27;ve been using my normal cleanser.  </li>
            <li>When you use this Cream, you massage and roll it into your skin, instead of just rubbing in circles as you normally would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once my skin became more balanced and less stripped of its natural oils</li>
            <li>My face actually broke out and felt oily when I first started.  </li>
            <li>I definitely agree with recommendation to use cleansing cream morning and night, and use cleansing milk first to remove makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a regular cleanser in that you need to wash your face first to remove any makeup.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why, because I&#x27;ve heard that in principle the cleanser you use is much less important than the serum or cream.  </li>
            <li>It is way too soft to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>smell is not \\&quot;an old lady smell\\&quot;, it&#x27;s just geranium oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after reading on the Haushka website that mature skin like mine</li>
            <li>I will admit to doing some soft circling motions too.</li>
            <li>this is natural cosmetics&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is gentle enough but clears all the flaking that comes with the Retin A.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>Think it was old.</li>
            <li>The scrub is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li>This cleansing cream does contain slight exfoliants - something to consider if you have super sensitive skin (which I do).</li>
            <li>wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleansing Cream is a very gentle exfoliating cream, and if you use it as they suggest (about once a week, and not rubbing into the skin, but rather gently pressing into the skin), it is just enough to lift out any impurities while not stripping the skin like other exfoliating cleansers can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The entire Dr. Hauschka line isn&#x27;t realistic for me, as there is no SPF.</li>
            <li>My face is basically oil free for most of the day (that&#x27;s saying alot) and the clogged pores are very faint and faded.</li>
            <li>This came very dry and granulted with a funny smell.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend the entire protocol.</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, with peri-oral dermatitis, generally at the touch of a product.</li>
            <li>so I used normal facial cleansing foam</li>
            <li>He said it was a big one for a normal cleansing cream or face scrubs.</li>
            <li>It is too mild and does not effectively clean out my pores.</li>
            <li>As with all if Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products, most who are not satisfied are not following directions properly.</li>
            <li>I believe this full sized tube will last me quite a while since a little sample tube of it lasted me about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only use this on my 63 year old face.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for about two weeks, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement so far.</li>
            <li>If you have problem skin and have been looking for a natural cleansing solution, look no further!  </li>
            <li>It feels so natural especially using the wave technique.</li>
            <li>You have to commit to trying everything for a few weeks, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Slightly exfoliating, with fresh-pressed almonds; soft, moist, nourishing, gently cleansing.</li>
            <li>I usually mix this with a tiny touch of the Cleansing Milk and it leaves my skin feeling clean, moisturized, and pampered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I also have very sensitive skin that flares up easily (right now, I&#x27;ve been dealing with a bad dermatitis for the last four months), and this Cream is gentle and leaves my skin looking soft and clear.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> All of his products, while pricey work great!</li>
            <li> but it does make the skin look great!!  </li>
            <li> but I probably don&#x27;t do it perfect.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever.</li>

            <li> Always excellent results, always the highest quality, the best way to understand this product is to use it.</li>
            <li> My daughters read about it, we somehow acquired a sample and since then have been placing orders to keep ourselves well stocked because now we are all three, happy converts!</li>
            <li> An exquisite line of awesome products.</li>

            <li> and her skin is beautiful and flawless.</li>
            <li> When I am in a hurry I do anyways (don&#x27;t always have time for a 10 min spa treatment) but still have great results.</li>
            <li> It is a great twice-weekly scrub to keep your face glowing.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great, feels great</li>
            <li> Great products all around.</li>

            <li> Amazing skin reveals itself!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s this nice exfoliating scrub, and I&#x27;m supposed to press it on my face for five minutes!</li>
            <li> The cleansing cream is OKAY at its best.</li>
            <li> Hauschka and was most impressed with this cleansing cream.</li>
            <li> I have had great results with the toner and clarifying oil in the am in combo with my Retinol and Honest cleansers at night.</li>
            <li> Good price on Amazon</li>
            <li> skin thinks it hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of good reviews on Amazon and decided to order the cleansing cream.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff -it smells a bit like dough or bread, doesn&#x27;t tighten skin, and it just feels great.</li>
            <li> Dr. Hauschka makes great products and I love ever one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> My skin stays happy and healthy when</li>
            <li> I do feel good that I&#x27;m not damaging my skin&#x27;s own protective layer, though, instead of rubbing it off.    </li>
            <li> Just the best product out there for great cleansing and not harsh!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> Lovely!</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  </li>
            <li> Love Dr. Hauschka products!  </li>
            <li> it was amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice texture.</li>
            <li> This is some kind of wonder product.</li>
            <li> I have tried Dr. H products before and have really liked them, and I think that this cream is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works with my own skin PH and have used this for years.</li>
            <li> I will always buy these products, they are amazing, my skin has never looked better</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works great on combination skin, helps keep clear and bright.  </li>
            <li> Love this product-</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> This has worked for me and the tube lasts me more than 3 months.  </li>
            <li> I had been using Obagi Nu Derm (too many chemicals).</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products they make.  </li>
            <li> Gentle exfoliation stimulates my skin, great makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love their biodynamic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever looked this healthy.</li>
            <li> As she instructed, I filled a basin with really warm water and added the Lavender Bath Essence to it, then soaked a facecloth in it and held that to my face for a bit.  </li>
            <li> This is a paste and once you get over that, you will fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> My acne is under better control with the help of this magic cream.    </li>
            <li> dr. h products are simply the best.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel of this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I USE THIS CLEANSER MORE LIKE A SCRUB..AND</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite face washes besides the Dr. H cleansing milk.</li>
            <li> love this product....</li>
            <li> This my favorite cleanser ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy, smells wonderful and is a great, gentle exfoliator that actually makes me look forward to washing my face.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also holistic, which makes me feel better about using it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning without any red skin.</li>
            <li> Most of his products are applied with a press and roll technique.</li>
            <li> Its the best cleanser, it leaves your skin clean, soft and the smell is relaxing.</li>
            <li> but so far so good!</li>
            <li> The texture is not creamy but more of a fine paste.</li>
            <li> Am so glad Amazon is now making it available.</li>
            <li> I used this cleansing cream in the shower and after worth it feels really nice...</li>
            <li> Not as impressed as I was with Dr Hauschka&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> Excellent for acne prone skin along with the other products as listed in the kit for &amp;#34;impure skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love how my face feels after I use it, though I&#x27;m always worried about the lack of clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll list it&#x27;s attributes to make it easy for your purchasing decision:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is the latter, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> After I used it up, being a cheap college student, I didn&#x27;t pay the ~$23</li>
            <li> I just make a mixture with warm water and then press it gently into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I switched to Dr. Hauschka cleansing cream, toner, daily oil, and the rhythmic night conditioner and my skin looks great.  </li>
            <li> it is not abrasive and helps to keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I Enjoy this Dr. Hauschka Cleansing Cream.</li>
            <li> Cleanser isn&#x27;t harsh &amp; very effective!  </li>
            <li> Face feels fresh and clean!  </li>
            <li> Good for mild and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products, and especially the cleansing cream, are absolutely amazing!  </li>
            <li> The Cleansing Cream is so mild and leaves skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It may be better for someone who has more tolerance for breakouts and clogs than I do, or a young girl or a guy who doesn&#x27;t wear any makeup.</li>
            <li> I use it in the mornings when my face is mostly clean anyway, and I don&#x27;t need to use a harsher cleanser.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clean my pores</li>
            <li> Face didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li> I tried out the Clarifying Toner, and loved it so much that I had to buy the whole routine.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these products are fabulous for me!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s whole line.  </li>
            <li> You have to give it a full 30 days.  </li>
            <li> It is my absolute favorite out of everything I have tried.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use this product in addition to the cleansing milk and my skin feels like I just had a facial at Mist in Santa Fe (run and operated by my talented niece).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad cleanser, just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this despite having used something else that had basically tortured my skin by \\&quot;burning\\&quot; it,yet the cleansing cream actually seemed to make it better.    </li>
            <li> Now that I have formed new habits, I love using his products.</li>
            <li> My skin looks pretty good, and I&#x27;ve only just started using this.</li>
            <li> With a hot washcloth to open facial pores, this cleansing cream does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li> At first it seems like your skin may not be getting clean, but that is just because the moisture is not being stripped from your skin.</li>
            <li> While searching online for exfoliant recommendations, I came across quite a few people commenting about how great this cream is.  </li>
            <li> They are top of the line for all natural skin care.  </li>
            <li> The idea of this product is that the herbs in it &#x27;stimulate&#x27; the skin&#x27;s own cleansing process, so I guess it would be a different feeling.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural as well.  </li>
            <li> All of Hauschka is pricey, but at this stage, transformation is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I have loved all the other Dr. Hauschka products I&#x27;ve tried, but not this one.</li>
            <li> If you really want that clean feeling, and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time cleansing your face, this isn&#x27;t for you.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild formula with a soft exfoliater.  </li>
            <li> it gets makeup off well but is gentle and if you don&#x27;t like feeling clogged by lotion at night, this is a good way to clean without feeling dried out.  </li>
            <li> My wife is like it very much in two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I broke out pretty extensively, in a way I haven&#x27;t in many months.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I will definitely try more products from Dr. Hauschka</li>
            <li> say, you&#x27;d have to be pretty open-minded to try this, but you might be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I began buying it more recently on a regular basis and people think I look 25.  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> That was my second favorite item in the sample kit.</li>
            <li> (but I can&#x27;t afford that much of it!)</li>
            <li> ..NICE AND GENTLE!</li>
            <li> AT FIRST IT GIVES A GREASY FEELING</li>
            <li> And yes, it is supposed to be an off white (tan) color :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male and love Dr. Hauschka.  </li>
            <li> You can try it in one of the sample kits first.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial cleanser in the world, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
            <li> It is more like a scrub and indeed has a lot of herbs and essential oils.</li>
            <li> If u have dry or normal skin will be ok not for oily congested skin!</li>
            <li> I have used Dr. Hauschka products on and off for 20 years with positive results.</li>
            <li> Their ingredients are completely pure, with no synthetics to worry about.  </li>
            <li> I have oil skin with large pores and his products worked wonders.</li>
            <li> my pores don&#x27;t recommend who has large pores like me</li>
            <li> If you do, you will certainly have irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 and starting to see fine lines.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes and smoothes your face without being unnecessarily abrasive, and is great even for every day use.</li>
            <li> Really</li>
            <li> as for uses, I don&#x27;t use this as a primary cleanser, and definitely not as an exfoliating scrub as the description might imply.</li>
            <li> Really cleans the pores out and smoothes skin out.</li>
            <li> I bumped into a Hauschka saleswoman stocking her shelves at a Whole Foods and she explained how to care for my skin with the product line.</li>
            <li> Gentle and nourishing.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I have a combination type skin with T section being really oily.</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> No so much.</li>
            <li> It really cleanse your face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had an exfoliator that has been this gentle and cleaned</li>
            <li> I bought it at a yoga retreat in the late 90&#x27;s and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other cleanser on top of this.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered the Cleansing Milk, Cleansing Cream, Facial Toner, Normalizing Day Oil, Daily Moisturizing Cream and the Lavender Oil from Amazon since it was a better deal than at WF.</li>
            <li> This has to be our 20th Dr. Hauschka product and we just keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> After rinsing it off, my skin is incredibly smooth and soft and actually a bit tighter.</li>
            <li> My skin feels better after I use it, which is saying a lot, since some cleansers (and especially exfoliants) leave it red and</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and almost everything makes me break out, but this actually helps my face stay smooth and clear!</li>
            <li> nothing harsh but seemingly wonderfully to exfoliate the face (but not sure the cleansing agent works?!)</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> price is high compare to the amount use every time and the size of the tube</li>
            <li> For bumpy areas, spend a little more time pressing and rolling the cream.  </li>
            <li> I use half a pea size in the morning (face still pretty clean) and a pea size of Dr. H&#x27;s cleansing cream at night.  </li>
            <li> (I dab a couple spots on my forehead, cheeks, jaw, temples and chin then wet my hands and lightly rub)</li>
            <li> Using these two products together helps to remove all dirt from the face yet it is gentle to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I get several sample boxes each month and rarely buy full-size items from them, but this is one of the exceptions.</li>
            <li> Her skin is improving daily, hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy and clear in several years.</li>
            <li> The Dr. Hauschka line has a whole philosophy that&#x27;s akin to homeopathic medicine, and I&#x27;m not sure I believe any of it, but something about their products agrees with my skin, so maybe there&#x27;s more to it than meets the eye.</li>
            <li> The instructions recommend using their Cleansing Milk, but I&#x27;ve been using my normal cleanser.  </li>
            <li> When you use this Cream, you massage and roll it into your skin, instead of just rubbing in circles as you normally would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once my skin became more balanced and less stripped of its natural oils</li>
            <li> My face actually broke out and felt oily when I first started.  </li>
            <li> I definitely agree with recommendation to use cleansing cream morning and night, and use cleansing milk first to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a regular cleanser in that you need to wash your face first to remove any makeup.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why, because I&#x27;ve heard that in principle the cleanser you use is much less important than the serum or cream.  </li>
            <li> It is way too soft to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> smell is not \\&quot;an old lady smell\\&quot;, it&#x27;s just geranium oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after reading on the Haushka website that mature skin like mine</li>
            <li> I will admit to doing some soft circling motions too.</li>
            <li> this is natural cosmetics&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is gentle enough but clears all the flaking that comes with the Retin A.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> Think it was old.</li>
            <li> The scrub is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> This cleansing cream does contain slight exfoliants - something to consider if you have super sensitive skin (which I do).</li>
            <li> wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleansing Cream is a very gentle exfoliating cream, and if you use it as they suggest (about once a week, and not rubbing into the skin, but rather gently pressing into the skin), it is just enough to lift out any impurities while not stripping the skin like other exfoliating cleansers can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The entire Dr. Hauschka line isn&#x27;t realistic for me, as there is no SPF.</li>
            <li> My face is basically oil free for most of the day (that&#x27;s saying alot) and the clogged pores are very faint and faded.</li>
            <li> This came very dry and granulted with a funny smell.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend the entire protocol.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, with peri-oral dermatitis, generally at the touch of a product.</li>
            <li> so I used normal facial cleansing foam</li>
            <li> He said it was a big one for a normal cleansing cream or face scrubs.</li>
            <li> It is too mild and does not effectively clean out my pores.</li>
            <li> As with all if Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products, most who are not satisfied are not following directions properly.</li>
            <li> I believe this full sized tube will last me quite a while since a little sample tube of it lasted me about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only use this on my 63 year old face.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for about two weeks, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement so far.</li>
            <li> If you have problem skin and have been looking for a natural cleansing solution, look no further!  </li>
            <li> It feels so natural especially using the wave technique.</li>
            <li> You have to commit to trying everything for a few weeks, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Slightly exfoliating, with fresh-pressed almonds; soft, moist, nourishing, gently cleansing.</li>
            <li> I usually mix this with a tiny touch of the Cleansing Milk and it leaves my skin feeling clean, moisturized, and pampered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin that flares up easily (right now, I&#x27;ve been dealing with a bad dermatitis for the last four months), and this Cream is gentle and leaves my skin looking soft and clear.  </li>
            <li> But the grains are finer and less gritty than others I used in the past, and it makes my face feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> this brand was strongly recommended by my cousin, for closed acne&lt;br /&gt;well, it seems to work on my jaw, but i was using several other stuff on this, so actually i am not sure which one should take the credit</li>
            <li> He has a certain application technique which feel uncomfortable at first, but you adapt.</li>
            <li> BUT THEN ONCE YOU SPLASH COLD WATER AND DRY IT, IT FEELS AMAZING..</li>
            <li> I just paid A LOT for clogged pores, an unpleasant off-rose aroma, and a very user-UNfriendly, heavy metal tube of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love it, but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the oiliness that people talked about but tried it and realized that oil attracts oil and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and ready for the day!</li>
            <li> My skin immediately went back to looking dull and older.  </li>
            <li> and i felt something is strange</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I used it years ago and thought it too strange and too fussy; but I bought it again this week, and my 55+</li>
            <li> long for,</li>
            <li> As soon as I use them up, I&#x27;m going back to the other products.  </li>
            <li> this one smells very different from other face washer, like medicine</li>
            <li> Then pat dry.</li>
            <li> Then, you rinse the toxins and product off your face and PAT dry.</li>
            <li> I had dry skin.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 59) should be treated with the Regenerating Serum and Cream, I plunked down the big bucks for those items.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this leaves your skin slightly oily, actually, but clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although they are a little pricey, these products are the only ones that cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li> Soft on your delicate face.</li>
            <li> But this definitely left my skin heavy and unclean.</li>
            <li> After a few days, I noticed smaller pores.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful with this one</li>
            <li> and I have to be careful about the cleansing products I use.</li>
            <li> Your face will be glowing in just a few short days!</li>
            <li> had a few white eruptions on the line of my lips and tried to squeeze them out with no luck.</li>
            <li> Really, do not rub this.</li>
            <li> And my daughter, who is 25 and battling some acne, is now using the other products, too.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll use it till it finishes, altering with other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> When you rinse, just use water to rinse, no washcloth, the creme will come right off but what is left behind is a thin layer of oil to nourish your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I&#x27;ve been using this for several years, and even though it&#x27;s not cheap, I&#x27;ve never even tried switching.  </li>
            <li> The oils in it leave a slight film on your face.</li>
            <li> If your skin dries out, use less.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed my skin is breaking out less.</li>
            <li> If you find this a bit drying, use a bit less, and start using it with the lavendar bath.</li>
            <li> (as described above)&lt;br /&gt;-Effective in cleaning out black heads from medium--large pores</li>
            <li> I like having 2 cleansers at any time, one that&#x27;s &#x27;stronger&#x27; for heavy make-up days, and one that&#x27;s gentler for moisturizing and toning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use this stuff everyday</li>
            <li> It cleans without harsh scrubbing.</li>
            <li> During the fall, my skin gets really dry and flaky, which is made worse because of the Retin-A cream I use each night.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how you aren&#x27;t supposed to rub or scrub it....</li>
            <li> I know I need to rob this cleansing cream avoiding touch my eye, but once I applied it on my foreahead and tried to rinse it off, the small particles in the cream got in my eye and did not want to come out.</li>
            <li> Hardly.</li>
            <li> it manages to get rid of blackheads and dull complexion, despite the fact that it&#x27;s a rather oily</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;cream\\&quot; has the strangest consistency ever; you are not supposed to rub it around but just press it onto your skin - which isn&#x27;t hard once your hands are covered with it.</li>
            <li> However, at least from my experience, I doesn&#x27;t leave the cleanness feeling after I use it.</li>
            <li> Thick like clay.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and I&#x27;ve tried to convince myself that other products work just as well, but this is the one my heart (and skin)</li>
            <li> and I think its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> After my skin cleared up, I tried to switch to something less expensive, but my skin wouldn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have any nasty chemicals or toxins - pregnant women and anyone concerned about these issues might want to consider using this formula.</li>
            <li> Not good for my combination oily skin.</li>
            <li> Give it a try and be open minded with how to use it, this video might help: [...]  </li>
            <li> The consistency is a wheat germ meal with an awful old lady smell.</li>
            <li> The other thing that&#x27;s a bit annoying is the press and roll.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It definitely didn&#x27;t take my makeup off at night, and works something awful with the Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with Dr. Hauschka</li>
            <li> It is also too expensive for the results.</li>
            <li> Smells awful to me.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>

            <li> I get several sample boxes each month and rarely buy full-size items from them, but this is one of the exceptions. I have very sensitive skin and almost everything makes me break out, but this actually helps my face stay smooth and clear! It moisturizes and smoothes your face without being unnecessarily abrasive, and is great even for every day use. Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> The texture is not creamy but more of a fine paste. It cleans the skin but I prefer the creamy texture in a product.</li>
            <li> Love this product- it leaves my skin so supple after each wash. I am not sure how you aren&#x27;t supposed to rub or scrub it.... When I am in a hurry I do anyways (don&#x27;t always have time for a 10 min spa treatment) but still have great results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s whole line.  They are top of the line for all natural skin care.  Their ingredients are completely pure, with no synthetics to worry about.  But the best part is that it makes your skin look and feel wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleansing Cream is a very gentle exfoliating cream, and if you use it as they suggest (about once a week, and not rubbing into the skin, but rather gently pressing into the skin), it is just enough to lift out any impurities while not stripping the skin like other exfoliating cleansers can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+  Thank goodness for Dr. Hauschka. &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Smells awful to me. Like spoiled champagne. I still trying to use it but makes me gag a bit.</li>
            <li> Like the Cleansing Milk, I&#x27;ve been using this product about two years. It is a great twice-weekly scrub to keep your face glowing. It&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I tried out the Clarifying Toner, and loved it so much that I had to buy the whole routine. The Cleansing Cream is not the star of the line for me. I love how my face feels after I use it, though I&#x27;m always worried about the lack of clean feeling. The idea of this product is that the herbs in it &#x27;stimulate&#x27; the skin&#x27;s own cleansing process, so I guess it would be a different feeling. My skin looks pretty good, and I&#x27;ve only just started using this. I&#x27;ll update later, of course. The other thing that&#x27;s a bit annoying is the press and roll. It&#x27;s this nice exfoliating scrub, and I&#x27;m supposed to press it on my face for five minutes! I do feel good that I&#x27;m not damaging my skin&#x27;s own protective layer, though, instead of rubbing it off.    SO. This is not a traditional cleanser, and not a &#x27;miracle&#x27; product either. If you really want that clean feeling, and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time cleansing your face, this isn&#x27;t for you.    -Daughter of Katy C. Ameglio</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every cleanser out there but I always keep coming back to Dr. Hauschka. Its the best cleanser, it leaves your skin clean, soft and the smell is relaxing. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would find a product line that works...it seems as if I had tried everything and even after using a product with no consequence, all of a sudden my skin seemed to reject it! I finally found Dr. Hauschka. The Cleansing Cream is so mild and leaves skin feeling clean and smooth.  I was able to use this despite having used something else that had basically tortured my skin by \\&quot;burning\\&quot; it,yet the cleansing cream actually seemed to make it better.    I recommend this with no doubt.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be an exfoliator? Hardly. It&#x27;s also not a cream. The consistency is a wheat germ meal with an awful old lady smell. It is way too soft to exfoliate. Its sort of chunky but not gritty at all. The oils in it leave a slight film on your face. It&#x27;s not a bad cleanser, just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. Way too expensive in my opinion. I watched the youtube video on the \\&quot;correct\\&quot; way to press/roll and I think its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m the abnormal reviewer who doesn&#x27;t like this cleanser. It made my skin clogged and break out. I have loved all the other Dr. Hauschka products I&#x27;ve tried, but not this one. It definitely didn&#x27;t take my makeup off at night, and works something awful with the Clairsonic. I tried to use it in the am only, and not as a makeup remover/skin cleanser. Still no luck. I broke out pretty extensively, in a way I haven&#x27;t in many months. The entire Dr. Hauschka line isn&#x27;t realistic for me, as there is no SPF. I have had great results with the toner and clarifying oil in the am in combo with my Retinol and Honest cleansers at night. But this definitely left my skin heavy and unclean. It may be better for someone who has more tolerance for breakouts and clogs than I do, or a young girl or a guy who doesn&#x27;t wear any makeup. Otherwise, his line is really very wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It makes my skin so soft and smooth. It also made my pores smaller. I will definitely try more products from Dr. Hauschka</li>
            <li> I use half a pea size in the morning (face still pretty clean) and a pea size of Dr. H&#x27;s cleansing cream at night.  After a few days, I noticed smaller pores.  Blackheads are almost non-existent.    For bumpy areas, spend a little more time pressing and rolling the cream.  If your skin dries out, use less.  This has worked for me and the tube lasts me more than 3 months.  I don&#x27;t use any other cleanser on top of this.  This alone has been the best cleanser + exfoliant for my skin (oily combination).</li>
            <li> I am in my thirties and I started to get acne again.  After trying numerous products, I found the Dr. Hauschka line and gave it a shot. Although they are a little pricey, these products are the only ones that cleared up my skin. My skin looks great, feels great and I get tons of complements. The scrub is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.  (I also use the Normalizing Day Oil and Clarifying Toner.) After my skin cleared up, I tried to switch to something less expensive, but my skin wouldn&#x27;t have it. It breaks out again anytime I change my routine. So Dr. Haushka, it looks like you will be getting my business from now on!</li>
            <li> I gave this give 5 stars because it has totally changed my skin.  You have to give it a full 30 days.  My face actually broke out and felt oily when I first started.  I had been using Obagi Nu Derm (too many chemicals). Once my skin became more balanced and less stripped of its natural oils it was amazing.  I&#x27;m 36 and starting to see fine lines.  I use this with the toner, regenerating day cream and the rhythmic toner? At night.  The results are glowing, beautiful skin!</li>
            <li> Been using this system, these facial products, exclusively for over 30 years.  Am so glad Amazon is now making it available.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by Dr Hauschka</li>
            <li> All of his products, while pricey work great! I have oil skin with large pores and his products worked wonders. I love them!</li>
            <li> Ahhhh, Hauschka.  This is one of my favorite products they make.  Gentle exfoliation stimulates my skin, great makeup remover.  Face feels fresh and clean!  From my experience-helps reduce blackheads, blocked pores, reduces scar tissue and inflammation..Love, love, love their biodynamic ingredients.</li>
            <li> The cleansing cream is OKAY at its best.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff -it smells a bit like dough or bread, doesn&#x27;t tighten skin, and it just feels great. Really pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as for uses, I don&#x27;t use this as a primary cleanser, and definitely not as an exfoliating scrub as the description might imply. I use it in the mornings when my face is mostly clean anyway, and I don&#x27;t need to use a harsher cleanser. I like having 2 cleansers at any time, one that&#x27;s &#x27;stronger&#x27; for heavy make-up days, and one that&#x27;s gentler for moisturizing and toning. This one is the latter, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> this is a paste. it is not a traditional cleanser. but it works well.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not a traditional exfoliant, but it works well as that, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s been copied by jurlique in their \\&quot;daily exfoliating cream\\&quot; but without the anthyllis vulneraria extract,&lt;br /&gt;and it just isn&#x27;t the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the smell is not \\&quot;an old lady smell\\&quot;, it&#x27;s just geranium oil.&lt;br /&gt;i happen to like it.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s used in a lot of aveda products.&lt;br /&gt;some people find it relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you want a facial cleanser that foams up and scrubs your skin and leaves it stripped,&lt;br /&gt;this isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this leaves your skin slightly oily, actually, but clean.&lt;br /&gt;somehow it manages to get rid of blackheads and dull complexion, despite the fact that it&#x27;s a rather oily paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;d say, you&#x27;d have to be pretty open-minded to try this, but you might be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Not as impressed as I was with Dr Hauschka&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> If u have dry or normal skin will be ok not for oily congested skin! It didn&#x27;t clean my pores well I used a week and i felt something is strange so I used normal facial cleansing foam omg I checked my pores alllll clogged!!!! Didn&#x27;t give me break out just it doesn&#x27;t wash well dirt my pores don&#x27;t recommend who has large pores like me</li>
            <li> Glowing skin&lt;br /&gt;Gentle cleansing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have definitely noticed a difference since I started using this. I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever looked this healthy.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fantastic. I have been using this product on and off since I was 22 (15 years ago).  I bought it at a yoga retreat in the late 90&#x27;s and loved it.  I began buying it more recently on a regular basis and people think I look 25.  Could be all that yoga too ;)  but it does make the skin look great!!  Really cleans the pores out and smoothes skin out.</li>
            <li> I bumped into a Hauschka saleswoman stocking her shelves at a Whole Foods and she explained how to care for my skin with the product line. So I ordered the Cleansing Milk, Cleansing Cream, Facial Toner, Normalizing Day Oil, Daily Moisturizing Cream and the Lavender Oil from Amazon since it was a better deal than at WF. As she instructed, I filled a basin with really warm water and added the Lavender Bath Essence to it, then soaked a facecloth in it and held that to my face for a bit.  Then cleaned with the cream in the morning, the milk at night.  At night, per her instructions, I only applied the Facial Toner and patted that in. In the morning, I applied the toner, then squirted a bit of Moisturizing Cream into palm and mixed that with 2 drops of the Normalizing Oil.  Within a week, people were complimenting me on my skin. I could see that it looked brighter, healthier, younger. But after reading on the Haushka website that mature skin like mine (I&#x27;m 59) should be treated with the Regenerating Serum and Cream, I plunked down the big bucks for those items.  My skin immediately went back to looking dull and older.  The serum leaves the skin feeling sticky; the cream reeks of mocha and doesn&#x27;t seem to add any moisture.  As soon as I use them up, I&#x27;m going back to the other products.  And my daughter, who is 25 and battling some acne, is now using the other products, too.  Her skin is improving daily, hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy and clear in several years.</li>
            <li> This is a paste and once you get over that, you will fall in love with it. I use an inch of the cream in the a.m. and the milk in the p.m. You just squeeze out what you need for your face and just press and roll the cream around . I will admit to doing some soft circling motions too. When you rinse, just use water to rinse, no washcloth, the creme will come right off but what is left behind is a thin layer of oil to nourish your skin. Then pat dry. Your skin will thank you lots. Great products all around.</li>
            <li> I am a 21 y.o male. I have suffered from moderate acne for years and I have oily skin. I also have pores that are always clogged, especially on my nose, and they are noticeable.    I tried to sample kit from Dr.Hauschka and was most impressed with this cleansing cream. After I used it up, being a cheap college student, I didn&#x27;t pay the ~$23 for this 1.7oz box and tried something else. Nothing I tried could do what this does. I try and use it like you&#x27;re supposed to but I probably don&#x27;t do it perfect. This stuff works wonders. My face is basically oil free for most of the day (that&#x27;s saying alot) and the clogged pores are very faint and faded. My acne is under better control with the help of this magic cream.    I don&#x27;t even use this stuff everyday and I have noticed a difference. Give it a try and be open minded with how to use it, this video might help: [...]  If you&#x27;re going to get anything to go with it, try their toner. That was my second favorite item in the sample kit.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever. And I have used ALOT of stuff. Nice texture. Soft on your delicate face. Lasts a long time. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My wife is like it very much in two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- it is perfectly suited to her&lt;br /&gt;- this is natural cosmetics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in germany quality</li>
            <li> Dr. Hauschka makes great products and I love ever one I&#x27;ve used.  I have sensitive skin and these products are fabulous for me!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I&#x27;ve been using this for several years, and even though it&#x27;s not cheap, I&#x27;ve never even tried switching.  Don&#x27;t know why, because I&#x27;ve heard that in principle the cleanser you use is much less important than the serum or cream.  But the grains are finer and less gritty than others I used in the past, and it makes my face feel smooth.  The Dr. Hauschka line has a whole philosophy that&#x27;s akin to homeopathic medicine, and I&#x27;m not sure I believe any of it, but something about their products agrees with my skin, so maybe there&#x27;s more to it than meets the eye.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this cleansing cream?  It is my absolute favorite out of everything I have tried. I would recommend this to a friend :D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like silk applied to your hands. The perfect hand moisturizer. I&#x27;m obsessed with Dr. Hauschka (but I can&#x27;t afford that much of it!)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this daily but weekly I&#x27;ll use it with my Moore Lavender Bath and Cleansing Milk as an exfoliator. It smells great and makes my skin feel and look dewy. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, with peri-oral dermatitis, generally at the touch of a product. I have to be careful with this one but so far so good!</li>
            <li> I use Retin A and I have to be careful about the cleansing products I use. This is gentle enough but clears all the flaking that comes with the Retin A.</li>
            <li> The only product I&#x27;ve used to cleanse my face for over 30 years. Slightly exfoliating, with fresh-pressed almonds; soft, moist, nourishing, gently cleansing. Lovely! One tube lasts about 6 months.</li>
            <li> Gentle and nourishing. I always feel refreshed never drying</li>
            <li> I just received this product and have used it 4 times.  It&#x27;s very mild formula with a soft exfoliater.  It leaves my skin so soft.  I really like it.  I will update results later.</li>
            <li> I just paid A LOT for clogged pores, an unpleasant off-rose aroma, and a very user-UNfriendly, heavy metal tube of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love it, but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Only use this on my 63 year old face. Good price on Amazon</li>
            <li> I gradually changed over to Dr. Hauschka products after recommendations from friends.  I started with normalizing day oil. You have to commit to trying everything for a few weeks, but it is worth it. Same with the cleansing cream. At first it seems like your skin may not be getting clean, but that is just because the moisture is not being stripped from your skin. I definitely agree with recommendation to use cleansing cream morning and night, and use cleansing milk first to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> dr. h products are simply the best.  used for 25 years</li>
            <li> With a hot washcloth to open facial pores, this cleansing cream does an excellent job.  I have used Dr. Hauschka products on and off for 20 years with positive results. They might seem pricey, however one gets months out of a tube.</li>
            <li> allergic reaction, returned product.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this cleanser.  I just make a mixture with warm water and then press it gently into my skin.  It cleans without harsh scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Amazon is one of the cheapest places i have found this stuff. My GF loves this stuff for her face.</li>
            <li> Anything Dr. Huaschka has my vote and this cleansing cream is foundational.  My skin stays happy and healthy when&lt;br /&gt;emply the Hauschka principles  and the Earth gets a lift as well with its biodynamic processes.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS CLEANSER MORE LIKE A SCRUB..AND ITS GREAT..NICE AND GENTLE! AT FIRST IT GIVES A GREASY FEELING BUT THEN ONCE YOU SPLASH COLD WATER AND DRY IT, IT FEELS AMAZING..ITS GREAT FOR ALL SKIN TYPES. THE BEST PART..IT DID NOT BREAK ME OUT!!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for my skin. I read a lot of great reviews but it did nothing to help. I tried it for 4 months with no luck. I know everyone is different so this may work for you.</li>
            <li> I had problem skin - oily in spots, breakouts, etc.  At 35 I was exasperated and didn&#x27;t want to use acne meds meant for teen skin.  I switched to Dr. Hauschka cleansing cream, toner, daily oil, and the rhythmic night conditioner and my skin looks great.  I don&#x27;t get breakouts anymore!  I love that it is natural as well.  The products smell great, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Excellent for acne prone skin along with the other products as listed in the kit for &amp;#34;impure skin&amp;#34;. Following this regimen, my teenage son had no acne. My daughter stopped taking antibiotics for acne (Don&#x27;t ever do that, from what I have found out, it trashes your immune system). and her skin is beautiful and flawless. Highly, highly recommend the entire protocol.</li>
            <li> nothing harsh but seemingly wonderfully to exfoliate the face (but not sure the cleansing agent works?!) price is high compare to the amount use every time and the size of the tube</li>
            <li> This has to be our 20th Dr. Hauschka product and we just keep coming back for more. Always excellent results, always the highest quality, the best way to understand this product is to use it. My daughters read about it, we somehow acquired a sample and since then have been placing orders to keep ourselves well stocked because now we are all three, happy converts! An exquisite line of awesome products.</li>
            <li> I use this on my dry/sensitive/acne-prone skin. I use it as part of a 3 part cleansing &amp; I like that its non-drying and exfoliates my skin. I follow this with my regular cleanser and I have noticed my skin is breaking out less. You only need a pea sized amount so this isn&#x27;t over priced at all. And yes, it is supposed to be an off white (tan) color :)</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for about two weeks, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement so far. I have a combination type skin with T section being really oily. I know I need to rob this cleansing cream avoiding touch my eye, but once I applied it on my foreahead and tried to rinse it off, the small particles in the cream got in my eye and did not want to come out. I tried eye drop and even make myself cry hoping the tears can wash it out but no help. So I had to go to see my eye doctor to get the particle out. He said it was a big one for a normal cleansing cream or face scrubs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male and love Dr. Hauschka.  I use the cleansing cream, clarifying toner, daily eye cream, quince day cream and recently the rejuvenation serum.  Takes an extra 5 minutes in the morning.  Great products with results.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite face washes besides the Dr. H cleansing milk.</li>
            <li> If you have problem skin and have been looking for a natural cleansing solution, look no further!  Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products, and especially the cleansing cream, are absolutely amazing!  Your face will be glowing in just a few short days!</li>
            <li> love this product....it is not abrasive and helps to keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> This is some kind of wonder product. I used it years ago and thought it too strange and too fussy; but I bought it again this week, and my 55+ skin thinks it hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years. I am using the normalizing day oil and clarifying toner as well. This \\&quot;cream\\&quot; has the strangest consistency ever; you are not supposed to rub it around but just press it onto your skin - which isn&#x27;t hard once your hands are covered with it. After rinsing it off, my skin is incredibly smooth and soft and actually a bit tighter. This is hands-down my best investment in years. You can try it in one of the sample kits first. All of Hauschka is pricey, but at this stage, transformation is totally worth it. One last benefit - it doesn&#x27;t have any nasty chemicals or toxins - pregnant women and anyone concerned about these issues might want to consider using this formula.</li>
            <li> I used this cleansing cream in the shower and after worth it feels really nice...&lt;br /&gt;I had a few white eruptions on the line of my lips and tried to squeeze them out with no luck. I finally decided I will have to have a facial to remove them... Then, after using this cream maybe three times, I noticed they were gone!!! Yeah!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a week, and I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I Enjoy this Dr. Hauschka Cleansing Cream. It feels so natural especially using the wave technique. Smells great!</li>
            <li> This my favorite cleanser ever. I was skeptical about the oiliness that people talked about but tried it and realized that oil attracts oil and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and ready for the day!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cleansing cream, as all Dr. Hauschka products. A must for your morning/night regiment.  Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> No so much. This came very dry and granulted with a funny smell. Think it was old.</li>
            <li> If you find this a bit drying, use a bit less, and start using it with the lavendar bath. Amazing skin reveals itself!</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  It really cleanse your face.</li>
            <li> Use it every day.  Perfect.  Men can use it for shaving. I use it for cleaning...it gets makeup off well but is gentle and if you don&#x27;t like feeling clogged by lotion at night, this is a good way to clean without feeling dried out.  Yay Haushcka.</li>
            <li> Love Dr. Hauschka products!  I noticed a night and day difference in my skin using this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  Thick like clay. Face didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li> During the fall, my skin gets really dry and flaky, which is made worse because of the Retin-A cream I use each night.  While searching online for exfoliant recommendations, I came across quite a few people commenting about how great this cream is.  I have tried Dr. H products before and have really liked them, and I think that this cream is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a regular cleanser in that you need to wash your face first to remove any makeup.  The instructions recommend using their Cleansing Milk, but I&#x27;ve been using my normal cleanser.  When you use this Cream, you massage and roll it into your skin, instead of just rubbing in circles as you normally would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin that flares up easily (right now, I&#x27;ve been dealing with a bad dermatitis for the last four months), and this Cream is gentle and leaves my skin looking soft and clear.  My skin feels better after I use it, which is saying a lot, since some cleansers (and especially exfoliants) leave it red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial cleanser in the world, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. It&#x27;s creamy, smells wonderful and is a great, gentle exfoliator that actually makes me look forward to washing my face. It is expensive and I&#x27;ve tried to convince myself that other products work just as well, but this is the one my heart (and skin) long for, so I watch for sales and give it a place of honor on my Wishlist.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of good reviews on Amazon and decided to order the cleansing cream. It is more like a scrub and indeed has a lot of herbs and essential oils. However, at least from my experience, I doesn&#x27;t leave the cleanness feeling after I use it. I think I&#x27;ll use it till it finishes, altering with other products.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Works great on combination skin, helps keep clear and bright.  And not drying at all!  Also actually takes makeup off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had an exfoliator that has been this gentle and cleaned this well at the same time. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I&#x27;ll list it&#x27;s attributes to make it easy for your purchasing decision:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Gentle (as described above)&lt;br /&gt;-Effective in cleaning out black heads from medium--large pores&lt;br /&gt;-Smells great&lt;br /&gt;-A little bit goes a very long way. (I dab a couple spots on my forehead, cheeks, jaw, temples and chin then wet my hands and lightly rub) I believe this full sized tube will last me quite a while since a little sample tube of it lasted me about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention that it smells great? lol. Yes I did, but it&#x27;s also holistic, which makes me feel better about using it on my skin. Fantastic product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use this product in addition to the cleansing milk and my skin feels like I just had a facial at Mist in Santa Fe (run and operated by my talented niece). Using these two products together helps to remove all dirt from the face yet it is gentle to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The best cleansing cream I ever used! Works with my own skin PH and have used this for years. Nothing else compares.</li>
            <li> this brand was strongly recommended by my cousin, for closed acne&lt;br /&gt;well, it seems to work on my jaw, but i was using several other stuff on this, so actually i am not sure which one should take the credit&lt;br /&gt;and this one smells very different from other face washer, like medicine</li>
            <li> I will always buy these products, they are amazing, my skin has never looked better I get compliments on it all the time</li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning without any red skin.</li>
            <li> Good for mild and sensitive skin. Not good for my combination oily skin. It is too mild and does not effectively clean out my pores. It is also too expensive for the results.</li>
            <li> Just the best product out there for great cleansing and not harsh! A little pricey but worth it! TRY IT</li>
            <li> This product feels amazing. As with all if Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products, most who are not satisfied are not following directions properly. DO NOT RUB THIS ON YOUR SKIN!!! If you do, you will certainly have irritated skin. He has a certain application technique which feel uncomfortable at first, but you adapt. Now that I have formed new habits, I love using his products. Both myself and those around me see a skin difference. FYI there are Youtube videos showing how to apply which helped me. Really, do not rub this. Most of his products are applied with a press and roll technique. The product gets pushed into the pours and pushes the toxins out. Then, you rinse the toxins and product off your face and PAT dry. Never rub your face.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dr. Hauschka products for years. This cleansing cream does contain slight exfoliants - something to consider if you have super sensitive skin (which I do). I usually mix this with a tiny touch of the Cleansing Milk and it leaves my skin feeling clean, moisturized, and pampered. I use just the Cleansing Milk at night to remove makeup and help moisturize before bed.</li>
            <li> Cleanser isn&#x27;t harsh &amp; very effective!  I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin since using the Dr. Hauschka cleansing &amp; moisturizing products.  I had dry skin. I&#x27;ve been using this line for almost 30 days &amp; I can already see an improvement in my skin. Products are normalizing my skin.</li>
