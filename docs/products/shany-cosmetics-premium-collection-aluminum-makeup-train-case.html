            <li>Bought it as a Christmas gift for the wife and she loved it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift for my friend thinking that because it was a Shany product it would be good quality because I have bought from them before.</li>
            <li>think this was a good buy.</li>
            <li>But the quality is good.</li>
            <li>If you have a fair amount of cosmetics, it is a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li>Good quality</li>
            <li>I had bought one like this at a garage sale, and loved how it worked for my tools, but it got stolen and wanted to replace it.</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>so I can see this case falling apart if you don&#x27;t take good care of it.</li>
            <li>It is a nice case and has great sizing options with removable dividers</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality.</li>

            <li>I think this is a good gift for any makeup lover on your shopping list.</li>
            <li>It is perfect to storage all the accesories and makeup, it can fit all products that you need to store</li>

            <li>I love every product from this company!</li>
            <li>When I first started getting into make up, this case was perfect, I have since outgrown it and now have a 6 drawer cabinet from IKEA to house all my Make up...</li>
            <li>Its in my closet now, but It was a perfect case for me when I first started liking Make up.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I really love this case!</li>
            <li>The case has a great look to it and stores easily under the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I have a large quantity of makeup and this is an excellent storage solution.</li>

            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This case is amazing.</li>
            <li>For the price it is amazing.</li>
            <li>The adjustable dividers in the drawers are nice too-</li>
            <li>Although, if you are like me and fill this case up.. it could get kind of heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came in a nice box</li>
            <li>It keeps everything neat and tidy.  </li>
            <li>Really nice case but</li>
            <li>It folds out nicely.</li>
            <li>I must admit, it \\&quot;looks\\&quot; nice, but once you get your hands on it the truth is revealed.</li>
            <li>These cases are a good value - lots of room, cosmetically sleek and able to keep all of your makeup together in one place.</li>
            <li>The dividers are something that seems to me would be a no brainer for this kind of case</li>
            <li>It also looks really nice.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it&#x27;s perfect size; I love the adjustable trays/dividers and it definitely is worth the price!</li>
            <li>Excellent, my GF love it very much when she got it.</li>
            <li>it was sooooo worth it!!!</li>
            <li>This case is great if you get the right one!  </li>
            <li>All my makeup fit it in nicely!  </li>
            <li>A very useful makeup case to own!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend that you do not buy this product if you are looking for a good sturdy, completed make up train case.</li>
            <li>Great price and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it looks very professional.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy, very good quality.</li>
            <li>I also love the color of the makeup case because it&#x27;s very professional looking and matches my room! :D</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it could come in handy at some point.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price, it&#x27;s a great organizer and helped declutter my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Its perfect to keep all the makeup clear and organized.</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s amazing how many don&#x27;t have them.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, the case looks beautiful.  </li>
            <li>It is made of good material and it is in good size and reasonable weight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and looks great.  </li>
            <li>so you have the perfect size compartments and its so light weight, It really is made for convenience.</li>
            <li>Be nice if I could lift the top up for a bit more room</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed for oranizing and storing my makeup, great quality and size.  </li>
            <li>pretty great.</li>
            <li>I was impressed that I was able to fit so much in it.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.   </li>
            <li>but it was very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>THIS CASE IS MADE OF VERY CHEAP MATERIAL.</li>
            <li>It opens and closes very smoothly and has dividers to customize the tray sizes.</li>
            <li>This train case is easy to use for travel and storage, it fits nicely on any vanity table.  </li>
            <li>If fit all of my makeup and it looks cute on a dresser!</li>
            <li>The dividers for the top sections are removable and very cheap.</li>
            <li>This is huge!</li>
            <li>This case is huge!</li>
            <li>This case is huge for the price!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
            <li>You can reposition the dividers in the top compartments and make them any size.  </li>
            <li>I would have paid more but am glad I didn&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li>I know that once my makeup collection grows I will need a bigger train case, but for now it fits my makeup perfectly with some room to spare.</li>
            <li>Also I love that there is a strap that comes with it too.</li>
            <li>Holds everything, with room for more.</li>
            <li>It is good for about 20-40 buck I think, but not 80 buck worth in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my grand daughter for her graduation.</li>
            <li>It is better than it looks in the Picture.</li>
            <li>I wish I could lift the expandable trays out so that I can access the bottom part of the case better.</li>
            <li>The top tray blocks about a 1/3 of the bottom one</li>
            <li>the case itself is ok.</li>
            <li>- I use it to hold and organize all the beauty products I have that I do not use on a daily basis and it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>But like I said, I have had this case for many years now, and nothing is falling apart...</li>
            <li>In addition, the trays in the top are plastic(not</li>
            <li>and Ive had many makeup cases.</li>
            <li>You are able to fill each drawer to the top and there is no problem closing it.</li>
            <li>i was not as pleased as i hope i will be.</li>
            <li>I am going to end up returning this item, and spending more on something better quality.</li>
            <li>Of course you cannot ask more for this price.</li>
            <li>It okay.</li>
            <li>I really love this case.      </li>
            <li>There are adjustable compartments, which works great for those who have a need to really organize/customize.</li>
            <li>the case was a lot bigger than i thought it would be but the perfect size for me since i have a lot of make up.</li>
            <li>I  am able to carry it into a customer&#x27;s house and have most everything I need to do my job.</li>
            <li>space and much more durable than caboodle</li>
            <li>do not have any more to say.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t come with as many dividers as the picture shows and the  pull out drawers are wobbly</li>
            <li>the service is TOPS :)</li>
            <li>I have gone through a million makeup cases in my time and this is the best one and the longest lasting!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ok now.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Most of the make up cases I found online were either $100 or more.</li>
            <li>I love that the interior is made out of plastic (not cloth like others)</li>
            <li>The case isn&#x27;t the most sturdiest</li>
            <li>Had it been designed better, I would have given it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>and she love it.</li>
            <li>I love the spaces being adjustable.</li>
            <li>I really love this one</li>
            <li>The top compartments are adjustable.</li>
            <li>I looked all over the internet, mostly on ebay, to find a storage solution for my vaping (e cigarette) supplies.</li>
            <li>The fact that it locks makes it an even better storage solution for vaping (keeps it childproof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>girls love it.  </li>
            <li>Locks are kinda crappy though, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have to lock your stuff to make sure it won&#x27;t be gone through.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this case and it does hold a TON of makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for almost 3 years, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the compartments and that you can change the size of each of them accordingly.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I most definitly recommend this case to anyone.</li>
            <li>I wish it came in more colors</li>
            <li>im pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>So cheap I am kicking myself for not buying one years ago!</li>
            <li>I recommend this make up box for those girls who love make up  </li>
            <li>I love the space that this make up</li>
            <li>has I love it</li>
            <li>but it makes everything so much more organized.</li>
            <li>Both daughters love it.</li>
            <li>Even then, just toss your money in the trash or burn it, you&#x27;ll probably get more in return</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>I do believe it&#x27;s perfect for at-home or personal travel use.</li>
            <li>a makeup queen).....she fell in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>i love this make up box</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also comes with a set of keys to lock the top if you need to  and a strap to carry makeup box.</li>
            <li>I can see why many people are satisfied with the product however</li>
            <li>This box is able to hold all of my make up.</li>
            <li>What i like most is that there is removable trays unlike some makeup cases.</li>
            <li>so I am able to store more of my makeup in it.</li>
            <li>This is a great train case, it holds a lot of products and it is very durable.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this case</li>
            <li>Plus I love the feel and look of the case.</li>
            <li>it was such a great find!!!</li>
            <li>I love everything about it.</li>
            <li>I love that it has the side compartments with adjustable dividers</li>
            <li>I love how roomy this train case is.</li>
            <li>I love this case.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>i was soooooo pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this case.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous make up box!</li>
            <li>love my case.  </li>
            <li>I love this case.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Shany products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable and has more room in it than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>INCLUDING my airbrush machine!!  :-)</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I love having all my makeup in one spot.  </li>
            <li>That would have made this case the ultimate perfect.</li>
            <li>i own a good amount of makeup and didn&#x27;t have anything to really organize all of my products nor protect them.</li>
            <li>It looks good on the picture right?  </li>
            <li>i love the silver color just a nice clean cut box.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter who is 20 years old and she loved it!</li>
            <li>It looks professional and is of good quality!</li>
            <li>The 2 top trays will hold material or tools 2 1/2 \\&quot; high, which it very nice to have.</li>
            <li>case is worth buying!!</li>
            <li>And its tiers are lined with a plastic that is easy to wipe, better than the cardboard I have now.  </li>
            <li>Super nice case.</li>
            <li>It was just the right size for everything I had makeup wise and it all fit.</li>
            <li>Its a lot bigger than shown in the picture, which was a pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that the dividers are removable and/or can be customized to fit your needs.</li>
            <li>Look carefully at the dimensions - might be perfect if you have a ton of makeup.  </li>
            <li>I also got creative and put some Velcro&#x27;s on the available space of the lid where I anchor my brushes, mirror.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for a professional.  </li>
            <li>Box itself is nice, just not the right size.</li>
            <li>Other than than it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, well made, easy to customize, has a lock and a carrying strap.  </li>
            <li>Its alright, I prefer fabric cases with wheels for easy travel and strangth.</li>
            <li>The case seems like it can brake easily.</li>
            <li>It can store alot of your makeup and it easy to handle and travel with.</li>
            <li>Great product very sturdy and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The material is strong and easy to carry.  </li>
            <li>cheap cheap cheap!</li>
            <li>You can pack all your brushes, and makeup in here for easy travel.</li>
            <li>Return was easy and was promptly sent a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Holds a lot of items and the bottom has a divider which is easily removed.</li>
            <li>I needed an easy solution for the 150 eyeshadows, 35 blushes, 12 mascaras, etc etc etc that I have in my collection</li>
            <li>It comes with keys to lock it, and a strap for easy carrying.</li>
            <li>Feels strong.</li>
            <li>this case is well built, sturdy and strong material.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>and she was very pleased with just how large this case is.</li>
            <li>(I liked the simplicity of the first nail polish case I saw).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for traveling and all the little compartments make it super easy to stay organized!</li>
            <li>Perfect for small makeup collections; a great starter train case for those new to makeup.</li>
            <li>I find that for the price this case will do just fine for now until my makeup collection expands and no longer</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this case comes with keys,although I&#x27;m pretty sure most of them do-even the cheapest ones?</li>
            <li>The trays seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li>And it does still close and lock fine.</li>
            <li>Its fine now, but I wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li>you can fit all the essentials in it quite easily.</li>
            <li>it is very sturdy and is HUGE!!</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and I love that I can move the slides around and change the size of each compartment to accommodate which makeup I put in each spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
            <li>I like simple things, so I ordered the silver one and I love love love it!</li>
            <li>Huge.  </li>
            <li>It is a huge box.</li>
            <li>This is a huge makeup train case</li>
            <li>The case is huge.  </li>
            <li>So the locking component was a huge factor.  </li>
            <li>This box is huge, has alot of room with adjustable compartments.  </li>
            <li>I bought this case hoping it would accommodate  all my make up and be easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Only thing is not so great for travel.</li>
            <li>Because of the weight and bulk, the case doesn&#x27;t seem to close securely.  </li>
            <li>it was cheap and 2)</li>
            <li>The dividers are poorly-cut cardboard covered in cheap foam, which was peeling off when I got it.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s lots of sizes available.</li>
            <li>I might sound picky, but</li>
            <li>I put all my makeup, accessories, brush, sponge and I have free space in the bottom too.</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED MY MAKEUP CASE TODAY, AND WAS VERY EXCITED AT FIRST UNTIL I OPENED THE PACKAGE!</li>
            <li>THE COMPARTMENTS ARE MADE OF CARDBOARD LIKE MATERIAL AND WRAPPED WITH SOME SORT OF CHEAP STYROFOAM WHICH WAS ALREADY PEELING OFF(VERY FLIMSY).</li>
            <li>Light weight&lt;br</li>
            <li>The slots are removable which means you can fit in a ton of stuff-</li>
            <li>Liked it so much</li>
            <li>that won&#x27;t fit well in this box.  </li>
            <li>Though it is heavy, it is a perfect place to put all of your makeup products (eyeshadow, blush, etc...), along with accessories (brushes).  </li>
            <li>I thought it would not feel cheap.</li>
            <li>it comes with removable  plastic parts that you can adjust to fit whatever you need it to hld.</li>
            <li>It is a great case for people who are just starting to keep make up around.</li>
            <li>everything will fit.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t comfortably fit in my bathroom and it looks rediculous to have it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>The latches with key locks are a great feature.</li>
            <li>My make-up brushes don&#x27;t easily fit in the case because of this-</li>
            <li>While this does not hold ALL of my makeup, as I&#x27;m a makeup Artist, this is a FANTASTIC on-the-go case.....</li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>This fit all my nail items in it</li>
            <li>But overall I&#x27;m extremely happy with my case</li>
            <li>Good size and love the cross body strap.</li>
            <li>It also a great gift for makeup starters who wants to get into the whole collecting idea.</li>
            <li>All in all this case worked out excellently and I will be using it for much longer than the short while that I needed it to move.</li>
            <li>so I need a way to transport to and from easily and have all of my make up accessible but easily accessible.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do a ton of travel with my makeup right now, hopefully that will change as I find more work as a Make-up Artist in my area.</li>
            <li>Its just the right amount of space I need to fit all my Makeup!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I held out until I found this case to buy, the price was right.</li>
            <li>I would def recommend this to anyone looking for a higher quality makeup case!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>The box  also comes with an adjustable strap that I have found very useful.</li>
            <li>I love my new make up case!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very sturdy and feels very strong.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very sturdy and feels very strong.</li>
            <li>Super spacious and holds all of my makeup, such a great buy.</li>
            <li>, it is very, very roomy and easy to organize so that everything has a place and is easy to access.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure, but either way it was aligning perfectly before hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I have placed my cosmetics in the case, and I have to say I like it a lot more than when I received it at first purchase.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy it at first, but Im glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>:) I must add, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>First up I should state that I love makeup, and I have lots and lots of it.</li>
            <li>not everyone is rich to afford \\&quot;sephora\\&quot; ...</li>
            <li>It worth the money!</li>
            <li>Take it from a Avid fisherman, its a great box and strong enough where u can sit on it too !!  </li>
            <li>After looking thru many many many different sizes, colors, styles, brands &amp; types - I settled on this makeup case for my daughter&#x27;s Sweet 16.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to clean and the dividers are useful for organizing your makeup.</li>
            <li>the inside isn&#x27;t cloth so it can be wiped clean.</li>
            <li>and i thought this would be a great starter case at a first glance i noticed right away that this case is far from being 24\\&quot; in!</li>
            <li>fits(which is pretty much the case now,lol)however, all of my basics and then some fit quite nicely.</li>
            <li>Not worth the money, I don&#x27;t have anything good to say about this product!</li>
            <li>love it and would easily recommend this product to any one that has many different combination makeup and cleansers all there</li>
            <li>She does special makeup features and needed the case to keep all her supplies in one place.</li>
            <li>wow how big it is and sturdy, good job with this product i love it!</li>
            <li>love it for travel, carries a decent amount of products!</li>
            <li>Was very happy with this box for the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li>Money well spent, it&#x27;s a great storage case for make up, works well and is sturdy.  </li>
            <li>but a good size and enough space.</li>
            <li>I really need to stop buying more makeup...</li>
            <li>This Shany Makeup Case is the largest I was able to find at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very spacious although I wish the shelves/trays had more room.</li>
            <li>I know it will make a good present for her.</li>
            <li>I frequently travel and am the kind of person that likes to carry a lot of stuff</li>
            <li>I feel like the quality could be better and more durable, but I&#x27;ll just be sure to not be to rough with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this make up box holds my make up very well and also has room for more.</li>
            <li>This is a good case because its roomy enough for all of my makeup, plus it comes with dividers which you can use to customize the shelf spaces.</li>
            <li>Over all not bad.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for traveling especially when I don&#x27;t want to take my large makeup case.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it has great storage capacity &amp; arrangement options.</li>
            <li>The case is pretty big but its a good thing because then you could fit all your makeup in there.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>It did get here quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>but when you need to grab something quick, this won&#x27;t help you at all and overtime will frustrate you.  </li>
            <li>Super choice.</li>
            <li>my husband tried to super glue it did not work.</li>
            <li>I demand that the store (ETRAVIS Inc) who sold me the product, or Amazon.com give me an adequate response, take responsibility for it</li>
            <li>Super durable.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to finally purchase a new makeup case at a great price.</li>
            <li>Also, the price is GREAT, especially considering the arm and leg Sephora charges for something similar but uglier. :)</li>
            <li>And the locks are pretty cheap, feels like I am going to break it every time I lock it.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for - tons of adjustable storage space to fit what I need.</li>
            <li>This ones good for the use of one person who is not a professional.</li>
            <li>I was able to move them around as needed (on top drawers that is, bottom were not easy to move because top drawer got in the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love my new traincase.</li>
            <li>i will be postinga a picture of the box full of my makeup to give an idea of how much makeup it can fit.</li>
            <li>The only thing that keeps me from giving this item 5 stars is that the strap feels cheaply made and at one point, snapped and thank goodness, I had a grip on the handle!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, a nice product from Shany!</li>
            <li>The case is large but not too large, LOTS of storage, and your able to adjust the shelves to meet your needs.</li>
            <li>I love my new shany makeup case, plenty of room for all my products and I love that they give u spacers to use to fit different sizes of makeup in it.</li>
            <li>The exterior is very nice and clean looking, way more classy and attractive than some of the crazy animal print cases (which are better for younger girls).</li>
            <li>You can fit so much in it and organize your make up.</li>
            <li>If i got anything smaller, i wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit all my make-up in there.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>This case is an okay choice as far as quality goes.</li>
            <li>The outside looks nice, but opening it</li>
            <li>Swear, it&#x27;s ruined hundreds of dollars worth of my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The advert said it was worth $80.</li>
            <li>way bigger than i expected, but a welcome size!  </li>
            <li>totally worth the $ after seeing the size and quality.</li>
            <li>If it was bigger I&#x27;d like it, but it is really nice.</li>
            <li>The entire inside is coated with a felt like material, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the size of the case when she opened it because it was bigger than I thought it would be, which was great.</li>
            <li>I have alot more that couldn&#x27;t fit in the case though, such has my elf 100 eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>Liked the product overall.  </li>
            <li>If i got anything smaller, i wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit all my make-up in there</li>
            <li>You can also add your own personal touch to the case with stickers or color.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Well worth the forty bucks or so.</li>
            <li>Love the carrying strap, has a lot of room and you can adjust the sizes of all the compartments to fit your make up of different sizes and brushes.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, it&#x27;s light, holds all of my make-up and seems to be pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li>However it did arrive quickly and is exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>Also, there is a huuuge gap between the top tray and the top of the case, so you can&#x27;t jostle this thing at all or the makeup will get mixed up (but I&#x27;ve never had a cosmetic case before, so maybe this is normal?).   </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have the SHANY logo on the inside of the lid like the picture, so I assume it&#x27;s not the right product.</li>
            <li>I love this train case its very sturdy, you can rearrange only the top compartments, i wish you could rearrange the very bottom of the case,&#x27;There are 4 medium sized compartments.</li>
            <li>It is however a very large box.</li>
            <li>Again, it is very large.</li>
            <li>I carry the case to the sink and find all my facial needs are available and easy to find.</li>
            <li>There are definitely better boxes out there that can take some serious damage, but this one seems to be good for someone who is NOT taking it from place to place for professional use, but rather for someone who is using it daily just keeping it in the house &amp; I would imagine it would be good for transporting make-up on vacations from time to time.</li>
            <li>It is quite large, and I was able to store 80% of \\&quot;my stuff\\&quot; in one concise place.</li>
            <li>If it was just a little bit more well made I&#x27;d be satisfied.</li>
            <li>The box seems a little smaller in the picture, but its real good.</li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product for the price I paid and it arrived super fast!</li>
            <li>It is worth paying an extra $30.00 for the Sephora case and get a case with better quality.</li>
            <li>This is nice but really quite big.</li>
            <li>Super fast arrival, I am excited to use my new product.</li>
            <li>Very Thanks</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Overall a decent case, doesnt open quite as smoothly as I would like but for the money it&#x60;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed for my onsite make up applications.</li>
            <li>I am glad I will never have to buy another box or bag for makeup because it is so big.</li>
            <li>, this case is pretty functional.</li>
            <li>about the only redeeming factor with this case is that 1)</li>
            <li>Most of the room is at the top of case, and the shelves aren&#x27;t really deep enough to stand anything up without it just falling over.  </li>
            <li>exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Although it is my first make case like this</li>
            <li>sure makes a different!!!</li>
            <li>Overall I like it because I can have a lot of cosmetics in one place, but I am not as satisfied as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li>This was for my sister and its her first case.  </li>
            <li>After taking the case apart and spending some time with a hot glue gun, its in working order.  </li>
            <li>Only one drawback: the bottom portion dividers cannot be adjusted like the dividers in the top fold out drawers.</li>
            <li>and this is exactly it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase a smaller case.</li>
            <li>Perfect size, not too big not too small.</li>
            <li>Those were all good things to me, larger so I can hold more stuff, heavy because its sturdy, and roomy to prevent overcrowding.</li>
            <li>Although this train is big I did find a way to fill it up :)</li>
            <li>This case is surprisingly big which I love that about it.</li>
            <li>It has dividers on the top shelves that you can adjust to your makeup items; however, the middle ones are not adjustable.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a way to organize and store your vaping supplies, I highly recommend the Shany makeup case!!</li>
            <li>The reason there are so many mixed reviews on this is that some people are receiving one that has foam lined trays inside.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s holding all my makeup pretty well.</li>
            <li>This case was bigger than I thought that it was going to be and can fit just about everything inside of it!</li>
            <li>It has lots of room, very sturdy and I compare it to the one from Sephora but this is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and ETRAVIS Inc. for being so dependable!</li>
            <li>I have a pretty rigorous routine at night and morning.</li>
            <li>I knew from the first moment I opened it</li>
            <li>A tackle box from a local sporting goods store would serve you better.</li>
            <li>I love the quality of the case and the fact that its big!</li>
            <li>I would spend the extra coins to buy something more sturdy.</li>
            <li>With this makeup box, all my make up will be organized and I know exactly where to find my blushes, eye shadow, mascara and etc.</li>
            <li>totally wroth it! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I bought this because I finally found a case that holds all of my makeup.</li>
            <li>There are many compartments to seperate the different categories!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Shany really thought this one through!</li>
            <li>but you can get a pretty sufficient amount of makeup in it.</li>
            <li>It was pretty durable and is sure to last!</li>
            <li>So fast!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>She said it is Large enough for all her makeup and has many compartments.  </li>
            <li>is professional looking, and is worth the money!</li>
            <li>it was bigger than i expected but it was great.</li>
            <li>The compartments in the upper rows can be easily changed, but the top row blocks your ability to change the size of the  middle row.</li>
            <li>the fact that it has keys to it makes it even better because i have a sister that likes to borrow my makeup and doesn&#x27;t really bring them back.</li>
            <li>However, you can only really adjust the top level.</li>
            <li>I have a large Sephora train case that is higher quality than this one.</li>
            <li>The hinges and in general the case is cheaply built.</li>
            <li>It can become heavy when it&#x27;s filled, but perhaps I just have too much stuff :)</li>
            <li>I am pretty much a hoarder of makeup</li>
            <li>at first i thought i would not have enought make up to fill it up, but i find myself having too much.  </li>
            <li>This is a good case maybe to just sit around your house and just grab things to put into a small travel kit.</li>
            <li>The case is incredibly well made and durable-it seriously looks like a professional case.</li>
            <li>I love this box so much, my friends sometimes make fun of me because they think that it looks like I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist, but I don&#x27;t use it as my daily makeup container</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really big and strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been building a large collection of makeup.  </li>
            <li>Also if you have a large item, you have to manipulate it to get it out of the shelve, because of the bottom of the shelve over it.  </li>
            <li>It is large which can put a lot of staff in.</li>
            <li>Large and roomy.</li>
            <li>However it is too large for  my needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought two large caboodle train cases in my life time and the one i bought maybe 5 years ago is falling apart (the selves are made from cardboard).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite large.  </li>
            <li>Being a lover of makeup, I know that the right accessories (which this product comes with), are crucial to getting the \\&quot;right look.\\&quot;  And having the right look is desirable.</li>
            <li>, only small things fit up top can&#x27;t even fit brushes.</li>
            <li>The dividers are a bit tricky to adjust (especially on the 2nd shelf) but they are bendable so they are easy to adjust with light force.</li>
            <li>I have not used the strap or key because I don&#x27;t need to but by appearance they look fine.</li>
            <li>I bought this not having very high expectations but needing something because I was moving and needed a case to put all of my make up in.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the aluminum which makes it feel cheap.</li>
            <li>I filled the trays with my everyday products and filled the bottom storage with things I don&#x27;t use as often.</li>
            <li>The dividers are very flimsy and the construction overall is cheap.</li>
            <li>and i am soooooo glad i spent the money on it</li>
            <li>But, as I mentioned, you can&#x27;t readily access all of the parts of the case well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t close smoothly - the small racks inside does not move exactly with the cover, and falls on the bottom when you close and there is nothing that cushions the free fall</li>
            <li>I did get delivery really fast</li>
            <li>Thankfully Amazon&#x27;s return policy is fabulous and I will get my money back.</li>
            <li>The trays are very flimsey</li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>I did not pay that amount of money for such cheap quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really roomy and fits a ton of stuff.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really know what to compare it to.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>She has so much makeup and no place to keep it neat.</li>
            <li>I was really nervous before receiving the product, because I thought that it might not be like it was described and shown on the pictures.</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s quality is very iffy...</li>
            <li>Lots of room and very durable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a MAC user and in each of the four trays that fold out I can fit about 10 eyeshadows across and 2 deep and in two layers; so that&#x27;s 40 MAC eyeshadows per tray.  </li>
            <li>I have had this case for over a year and it is holding up very well.</li>
            <li>I travel locally so much.</li>
            <li>its smaller than I thought....kind of light....</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t about to spend that much.</li>
            <li>and it fared very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and boxed well.</li>
            <li>If you use the shoulder strap, the whole thing tips over.</li>
            <li>very well protected.</li>
            <li>Very roomy and can accommodate all my cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I really needed a place to put and organize all of my makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an indestructible case, so don&#x27;t abuse it, but it&#x27;s quite sturdy and I have everything I need to get ready in there.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money as any others at or near this price range</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend this much.</li>
            <li>This method works very effectively!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very roomy</li>
            <li>as a student, I don&#x27;t have much room&lt;</li>
            <li>the makeup case is really sturdy and can hold every product you might have.</li>
            <li>the makeup case is really sturdy and can hold every product you might have.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a cheap plastic box made of totally inferior meaterial.  </li>
            <li>I like that you can adjust the size of the compartments and the bottom bit is very roomy.</li>
            <li>ready, no searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides that it&#x27;s so spacious, and it even has enough room to fit my bh cosmetics 120 pallet.</li>
            <li>It doesnt feel horribly cheap but enough to make me regret buying it.</li>
            <li>It was better than expected.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I really do like it.</li>
            <li>Too much space for put the paint nails</li>
            <li>When I purchased this I didn&#x27;t realize how much room that I have to work with.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this!</li>
            <li>thanks again.</li>
            <li>Not to mention reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the shoulder strap, so I can&#x27;t really comment on that.</li>
            <li>so it saves me time getting ready</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, item is just as advertised.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really organize things it all gets piled  in the bottom</li>
            <li>I really wish I would have spent more money and get something a lot nicer.</li>
            <li>It is lovely and classy, and has enough compartments to organize all of my makeup.</li>
            <li>The case was a nice size and visually apealing with how big it was</li>
            <li>The tray sizes are able to be completely customized and even come with extra separators.</li>
            <li>The other design flaw is that there is a large space between the top drawer (which has no cover) and the top of the case when it&#x27;s closed.  </li>
            <li>Its great or it and with enough slots for both large and small fishing gear.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, because there is so much space, I was able to place my make-up brush case and some other items on top.  </li>
            <li>I recently needed to buy a new train case to fit my large makeup collection</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it.</li>
            <li>LOL, but this little case held a lot of Make up for a long time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine if you just start to buy yourself some makeup, I don&#x27;t wear it every day, only on the weekends, and even then I wasn&#x27;t able to fit everything inside and to see what you have you almost have to remove everything out, don&#x27;t waste your money, go for something larger if you have a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li>I received it the day after I ordered it with one day shipping, and as soon as I opened it I was pleasantly surprised at how large it was!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not a professional who needs a super sturdy and well constructed case, then this is for you!</li>
            <li>i went ahead and kept it because the hassle of returning such a large item wasn&#x27;t worth it on top of the fact i had just spent hours organizing it.</li>
            <li>Only one thing made me feel better is the case is large enough.</li>
            <li>It carried all of my make up and has cute little compartments that are removable if something is too big to fit.</li>
            <li>This case is really big, very roomy, and also very pretty.</li>
            <li>I have to buy a second box because it is full.</li>
            <li>First one I received was cracked near the hinge.</li>
            <li>So - what happens is that if you pack the case, or lie it down somehow, all of the make-up in the top drawer comes out.  </li>
            <li>It is kinf of flimsy and I am glad I didnt pay full price, I only paid about half.</li>
            <li>something maybe a new starter makeup artist, or makeup lover, would use to begin their collection!</li>
            <li>the black handle on top was all stratched up, and</li>
            <li>but I wish it closed easily.  </li>
            <li>I am beyond satisfied with this product especially because the price is low!</li>
            <li>For $50 not only should the product have been quality checked before it left, but it should be made better as well.</li>
            <li>It took me two bottles of super glue to put all the foam back on the dividers and trays.  </li>
            <li>I have tons of makeup...and haven&#x27;t been able to find a case big enough to hold it all.....</li>
            <li>The only problem is that  I have seen makeup cases which were more affordable and were quality equal to this case.</li>
            <li>Big enough to fit even my largest brushes and plenty of room for everything else I need (which is a lot)!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been searching for a decent priced train case for a while.</li>
            <li>The lower main part is divided into four parts and the size can&#x27;t be changes.</li>
            <li>I use this at home mainly for storage</li>
            <li>There is a lot of room between the shelves and the bottom area, so large items can fit, standing straight up; plus the bottom area has several different padded areas for additional organization.</li>
            <li>but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me I would so far recommend this!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks very professional and sleek!</li>
            <li>It is very professional looking!</li>
            <li>pay for a highly price product</li>
            <li>I really highly recommend this box .</li>
            <li>and I just couldnt commit to those high prices.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>; high.</li>
            <li>Has loads of compartments to store makeup and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i wondered why one side was more &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; than the other one of the plastic sides that connects with the metal was completely cracked to the bottom.</li>
            <li>I do wish that it was a little bit more affordable.</li>
            <li>It is a lot bigger than you expect and is made very durable!!</li>
            <li>So there are many little serums and jars.  </li>
            <li>For fifty dollars I was expecting something a little more sturdy.</li>
            <li>It took a very long time for me to find a makeup case that allowed me to store all of my makeup in an organized, yet easily accessible way.  </li>
            <li>This case is very cheaply made and I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
            <li>the small iron pieces around the exterior look more like decorative than providing real support.</li>
            <li>The handle on top doesnt seem like its going to last very long.  </li>
            <li>I just think if they had allowed it to open fully away from each other it would be much easier and much better.  </li>
            <li>The cost of this makeup case is ridiculous good, I know makeup (train) or case can be really expensive and this is a pretty amazing deal.</li>
            <li>Right now I have nail polish on the three of the shelves, and then tons of eye shadow on the fourth shelf.</li>
            <li>if you take them out be resigned to the fact that they are not going back in (i might not be doing it right</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like how you can&#x27;t move the second shelves&#x27; little plastic divider because the top shelves are in the way so those shelves are pretty set unless you use force.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough but still very portable.</li>
            <li>You can definitely fit all your travel makeup/brushes and other essentials (shampoo, conditioner, face lotion, etc.).</li>
            <li>Bought it for my daughter to organize her airbrushing tanning and makeup supplies as she begins her new airbrushing business.  </li>
            <li>but I am assuming it is because its new.</li>
            <li>I live this makeup case.</li>
            <li>The shelves don&#x27;t slide very easily, and I had to glue a lot of the lining back down.  </li>
            <li>To keep the bottom clean (e-juice bottles tend to get sticky), I&#x27;ve placed them in empty medicine bottles.</li>
            <li>It was big enough to fit all my makeup.</li>
            <li>This case looks very professional.  </li>
            <li>Exellent Product, I am recommended, the product is totaly big, I am very very confort with the product,</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I opened it.</li>
            <li>Right now, she definitely wanted to lock her things up to keep them away from her 8 yr old sister who thinks all things are hers regardless of ownership.  </li>
            <li>some metal parts got into each others&#x27; ways and you have to adjust it&#x27;s positions carefully so they can pass each other nicely.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time and money!</li>
            <li>Im glad I bought it, but in the future I will definitely be looking to spend another $20-$30 to upgrade &amp; then use this one as a back up.</li>
            <li>Actually, I have one of these smaller Sephora cases for my \\&quot;normal\\&quot; make-up and overall, the quality of the Sephora case it better than Shany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone in need of a pretty big makeup case.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more sturdy than other train cases I looked at for around the same price.</li>
            <li>Looks like a professional one that can cost over alot of money!</li>
            <li>You definitely cant fit large eyeshadow palettes in this case such as the naked palettes or BH cosmetic palettes.</li>
            <li>This is big enough to hold all of my makeup plus face-wash, makeup remover, moisturizer and all of my nail polish and a full size bottle of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>This box came quickly and arrived on the expected day.  </li>
            <li>This is a heavy duty, strong case.</li>
            <li>I have a slight problem with mine closing/aligning just right at the moment because I left it open and had a room full of people getting ready for an event-</li>
            <li>If you look at the first member photo, where you can see the bottom padded area, that is exactly what my case looks like, except of course that it is primarily black, not silver.</li>
            <li>one side is really stiff and doesn&#x27;t close easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to see how long this product last being that its made from plastic and not cardboard!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it for my film makeup kit, and I originally bought a black one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little heavy which is good</li>
            <li>Whatever glue they use clearly does not work.  </li>
            <li>it was clearly that someone else before me opened the box.</li>
            <li>Also, the case is completely customizable, with dividers everywhere that you can move around.</li>
            <li>The item I received was not 24x10x10 as advertised, but 14x10.5x8.5 far from what i thought i was ordering.</li>
            <li>it was a welcomed surprised.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised at its size.</li>
            <li>It looks smaller in the photo than it really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can keep 3-4 different regimes all there and ready to change with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It offers plenty of ways to organize your make up from what I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this case.</li>
            <li>My 10 year-old-daughter has been in dance classes and competition since she was 3-1/2 years old.  </li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It fits all my makeup and I have a ton of makeup I buy so much makeup on a regular basis</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is the bottom area - I&#x27;d like to be able to adjust the sections at the bottom, but it&#x27;s not really that big of an issue.</li>
            <li>Fast service from vendor and the case totally met my expectations.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s heavy which is good, it&#x27;s not cheap material.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s held up VERY well to a little bit of beating, and the drawers still slide up and out just as well as when I first opened it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decently priced for the size, has a lot of dividers and is surprisingly deep.</li>
            <li>But to big is better than to small.  </li>
            <li>It is a small peice of wood covered in this foam like material, attached together by a cheap glue.</li>
            <li>First off this is not a silver case, this is a pink case with silver out lining.  </li>
            <li>My case was made of extremely poor materials, was missing keys, and most importantly, it had NO brand insignia printed on the inside of the case.</li>
            <li>This train case is huge and very heavy.  </li>
            <li>the box &amp; its inner tiers open &amp; close smoothly, but need to be done slowly (not in a weird slow way tho,</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift several years ago now, and it is still in almost new condition.</li>
            <li>If that doesn&#x27;t sound too bad, opening it takes more effort.</li>
            <li>So much bigger that her old one!</li>
            <li>I am not  professional makeup artist, just a regular consumer who has a large selection of makeup products.</li>
            <li>On the downside, the underneath compartments are hard to reach into, the divider in the bottom that is removable...very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t fit to create four egual compartments in the bottom.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to tell from the pictures but the interior is some cheap foam material.</li>
            <li>Also giving it only 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know how much force it really took to cause the alignment to be off a little.</li>
            <li>If I were a professional makeup artist and not an individual looking for storage...</li>
            <li>I recommend it for personal use instead of professional use.</li>
            <li>but it is not easily closed.  </li>
            <li>exactly as pictured, except roomier and larger than expected.</li>
            <li>I was very excited for this to arrive and when it did it was broken.  </li>
            <li>The dividers in the second shelf are hard to get in and out, but besides that it is a very sturdy and I would reccomend it to anyone that wants some organization to their make-up madness!</li>
            <li>It also leaves my makeup very accessable and organized, unlike some other makeup cases I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the outer material and hinges feel cheap.</li>
            <li>I love this kit for my freelance makeup jobs or just for personal use, its big enough to pack the really needed items yet small enough to carry, seems a little on the un even side when folded out</li>
            <li>If you play around with it long enough you&#x27;ll be able to, but it really shouldn&#x27;t be that difficult.  </li>
            <li>and the interior are poorly made, the interior are glued on and it can be ripped easily.</li>
            <li>Claw hammer fits in the nice deep lower section, as well as my Porter cable 12 Volt cordless drill and other tools, in just the lower compartment, which is approximately 4\\&quot; deep..</li>
            <li>everyday amd putting it in the bathroom and putting this case into my closet with all my other makeup to take out and use for special occasions</li>
            <li>The size of the entire piece is just right - not too big to need wheels &amp; not too small so it can handle lots of items.  </li>
            <li>A little expensive for what it is, inside top compartments aren&#x27;t very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I agree with some of the other reviews that the metal sliding hinges seem to be cheaply made and if one isn&#x27;t careful especially when closing the case, they seem like they could snap in half.</li>

            <li> , it is a gorgeous train case.</li>
            <li> For the price and size, I&#x27;d say this is still a good product.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a Christmas gift for the wife and she loved it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my friend thinking that because it was a Shany product it would be good quality because I have bought from them before.</li>
            <li> think this was a good buy.</li>
            <li> But the quality is good.</li>
            <li> If you have a fair amount of cosmetics, it is a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Good quality</li>
            <li> I had bought one like this at a garage sale, and loved how it worked for my tools, but it got stolen and wanted to replace it.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  </li>
            <li> so I can see this case falling apart if you don&#x27;t take good care of it.</li>
            <li> It is a nice case and has great sizing options with removable dividers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality.</li>

            <li> She loved it</li>
            <li> Loved the adjustable dividers.</li>
            <li> Good sized.</li>

            <li> I think this is a good gift for any makeup lover on your shopping list.</li>
            <li> It is perfect to storage all the accesories and makeup, it can fit all products that you need to store</li>

            <li> It came in a nice box</li>
            <li> It keeps everything neat and tidy.  </li>
            <li> Really nice case but</li>
            <li> It folds out nicely.</li>
            <li> I must admit, it \\&quot;looks\\&quot; nice, but once you get your hands on it the truth is revealed.</li>
            <li> These cases are a good value - lots of room, cosmetically sleek and able to keep all of your makeup together in one place.</li>
            <li> The dividers are something that seems to me would be a no brainer for this kind of case</li>
            <li> It also looks really nice.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it&#x27;s perfect size; I love the adjustable trays/dividers and it definitely is worth the price!</li>
            <li> Excellent, my GF love it very much when she got it.</li>
            <li> it was sooooo worth it!!!</li>
            <li> This case is great if you get the right one!  </li>
            <li> All my makeup fit it in nicely!  </li>
            <li> A very useful makeup case to own!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend that you do not buy this product if you are looking for a good sturdy, completed make up train case.</li>
            <li> Great price and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it looks very professional.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy, very good quality.</li>
            <li> I also love the color of the makeup case because it&#x27;s very professional looking and matches my room! :D</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it could come in handy at some point.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price, it&#x27;s a great organizer and helped declutter my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Its perfect to keep all the makeup clear and organized.</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s amazing how many don&#x27;t have them.</li>
            <li> On a positive note, the case looks beautiful.  </li>
            <li> It is made of good material and it is in good size and reasonable weight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and looks great.  </li>
            <li> so you have the perfect size compartments and its so light weight, It really is made for convenience.</li>
            <li> Be nice if I could lift the top up for a bit more room</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed for oranizing and storing my makeup, great quality and size.  </li>
            <li> pretty great.</li>
            <li> I was impressed that I was able to fit so much in it.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.   </li>
            <li> but it was very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> THIS CASE IS MADE OF VERY CHEAP MATERIAL.</li>
            <li> It opens and closes very smoothly and has dividers to customize the tray sizes.</li>
            <li> This train case is easy to use for travel and storage, it fits nicely on any vanity table.  </li>
            <li> If fit all of my makeup and it looks cute on a dresser!</li>
            <li> The dividers for the top sections are removable and very cheap.</li>
            <li> This is huge!</li>
            <li> This case is huge!</li>
            <li> This case is huge for the price!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
            <li> You can reposition the dividers in the top compartments and make them any size.  </li>
            <li> I would have paid more but am glad I didn&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li> I know that once my makeup collection grows I will need a bigger train case, but for now it fits my makeup perfectly with some room to spare.</li>
            <li> Also I love that there is a strap that comes with it too.</li>
            <li> Holds everything, with room for more.</li>
            <li> It is good for about 20-40 buck I think, but not 80 buck worth in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my grand daughter for her graduation.</li>
            <li> It is better than it looks in the Picture.</li>
            <li> I wish I could lift the expandable trays out so that I can access the bottom part of the case better.</li>
            <li> The top tray blocks about a 1/3 of the bottom one</li>
            <li> the case itself is ok.</li>
            <li> - I use it to hold and organize all the beauty products I have that I do not use on a daily basis and it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> But like I said, I have had this case for many years now, and nothing is falling apart...</li>
            <li> In addition, the trays in the top are plastic(not</li>
            <li> and Ive had many makeup cases.</li>
            <li> You are able to fill each drawer to the top and there is no problem closing it.</li>
            <li> i was not as pleased as i hope i will be.</li>
            <li> I am going to end up returning this item, and spending more on something better quality.</li>
            <li> Of course you cannot ask more for this price.</li>
            <li> It okay.</li>
            <li> I really love this case.      </li>
            <li> There are adjustable compartments, which works great for those who have a need to really organize/customize.</li>
            <li> the case was a lot bigger than i thought it would be but the perfect size for me since i have a lot of make up.</li>
            <li> I  am able to carry it into a customer&#x27;s house and have most everything I need to do my job.</li>
            <li> space and much more durable than caboodle</li>
            <li> do not have any more to say.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t come with as many dividers as the picture shows and the  pull out drawers are wobbly</li>
            <li> the service is TOPS :)</li>
            <li> I have gone through a million makeup cases in my time and this is the best one and the longest lasting!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ok now.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Most of the make up cases I found online were either $100 or more.</li>
            <li> I love that the interior is made out of plastic (not cloth like others)</li>
            <li> The case isn&#x27;t the most sturdiest</li>
            <li> Had it been designed better, I would have given it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> and she love it.</li>
            <li> I love the spaces being adjustable.</li>
            <li> I really love this one</li>
            <li> The top compartments are adjustable.</li>
            <li> I looked all over the internet, mostly on ebay, to find a storage solution for my vaping (e cigarette) supplies.</li>
            <li> The fact that it locks makes it an even better storage solution for vaping (keeps it childproof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> girls love it.  </li>
            <li> Locks are kinda crappy though, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have to lock your stuff to make sure it won&#x27;t be gone through.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this case and it does hold a TON of makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost 3 years, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the compartments and that you can change the size of each of them accordingly.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I most definitly recommend this case to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in more colors</li>
            <li> im pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> So cheap I am kicking myself for not buying one years ago!</li>
            <li> I recommend this make up box for those girls who love make up  </li>
            <li> I love the space that this make up</li>
            <li> has I love it</li>
            <li> but it makes everything so much more organized.</li>
            <li> Both daughters love it.</li>
            <li> Even then, just toss your money in the trash or burn it, you&#x27;ll probably get more in return</li>
            <li> its okay.</li>
            <li> I do believe it&#x27;s perfect for at-home or personal travel use.</li>
            <li> a makeup queen).....she fell in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> i love this make up box</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also comes with a set of keys to lock the top if you need to  and a strap to carry makeup box.</li>
            <li> I can see why many people are satisfied with the product however</li>
            <li> This box is able to hold all of my make up.</li>
            <li> What i like most is that there is removable trays unlike some makeup cases.</li>
            <li> so I am able to store more of my makeup in it.</li>
            <li> This is a great train case, it holds a lot of products and it is very durable.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this case</li>
            <li> Plus I love the feel and look of the case.</li>
            <li> it was such a great find!!!</li>
            <li> I love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I love that it has the side compartments with adjustable dividers</li>
            <li> I love how roomy this train case is.</li>
            <li> I love this case.</li>

            <li> love my case.  </li>
            <li> I love this case.</li>

            <li> INCLUDING my airbrush machine!!  :-)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I love having all my makeup in one spot.  </li>
            <li> That would have made this case the ultimate perfect.</li>
            <li> i own a good amount of makeup and didn&#x27;t have anything to really organize all of my products nor protect them.</li>
            <li> It looks good on the picture right?  </li>
            <li> i love the silver color just a nice clean cut box.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is 20 years old and she loved it!</li>
            <li> It looks professional and is of good quality!</li>
            <li> The 2 top trays will hold material or tools 2 1/2 \\&quot; high, which it very nice to have.</li>
            <li> case is worth buying!!</li>
            <li> And its tiers are lined with a plastic that is easy to wipe, better than the cardboard I have now.  </li>
            <li> Super nice case.</li>
            <li> It was just the right size for everything I had makeup wise and it all fit.</li>
            <li> Its a lot bigger than shown in the picture, which was a pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that the dividers are removable and/or can be customized to fit your needs.</li>
            <li> Look carefully at the dimensions - might be perfect if you have a ton of makeup.  </li>
            <li> I also got creative and put some Velcro&#x27;s on the available space of the lid where I anchor my brushes, mirror.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a professional.  </li>
            <li> Box itself is nice, just not the right size.</li>
            <li> Other than than it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, well made, easy to customize, has a lock and a carrying strap.  </li>
            <li> Its alright, I prefer fabric cases with wheels for easy travel and strangth.</li>
            <li> The case seems like it can brake easily.</li>
            <li> It can store alot of your makeup and it easy to handle and travel with.</li>
            <li> Great product very sturdy and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The material is strong and easy to carry.  </li>
            <li> cheap cheap cheap!</li>
            <li> You can pack all your brushes, and makeup in here for easy travel.</li>
            <li> Return was easy and was promptly sent a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holds a lot of items and the bottom has a divider which is easily removed.</li>
            <li> I needed an easy solution for the 150 eyeshadows, 35 blushes, 12 mascaras, etc etc etc that I have in my collection</li>
            <li> It comes with keys to lock it, and a strap for easy carrying.</li>
            <li> Feels strong.</li>
            <li> this case is well built, sturdy and strong material.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> and she was very pleased with just how large this case is.</li>
            <li> (I liked the simplicity of the first nail polish case I saw).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling and all the little compartments make it super easy to stay organized!</li>
            <li> Perfect for small makeup collections; a great starter train case for those new to makeup.</li>
            <li> I find that for the price this case will do just fine for now until my makeup collection expands and no longer</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this case comes with keys,although I&#x27;m pretty sure most of them do-even the cheapest ones?</li>
            <li> The trays seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li> And it does still close and lock fine.</li>
            <li> Its fine now, but I wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> you can fit all the essentials in it quite easily.</li>
            <li> it is very sturdy and is HUGE!!</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and I love that I can move the slides around and change the size of each compartment to accommodate which makeup I put in each spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
            <li> I like simple things, so I ordered the silver one and I love love love it!</li>
            <li> Huge.  </li>
            <li> It is a huge box.</li>
            <li> This is a huge makeup train case</li>
            <li> The case is huge.  </li>
            <li> So the locking component was a huge factor.  </li>
            <li> This box is huge, has alot of room with adjustable compartments.  </li>
            <li> I bought this case hoping it would accommodate  all my make up and be easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is not so great for travel.</li>
            <li> Because of the weight and bulk, the case doesn&#x27;t seem to close securely.  </li>
            <li> it was cheap and 2)</li>
            <li> The dividers are poorly-cut cardboard covered in cheap foam, which was peeling off when I got it.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s lots of sizes available.</li>
            <li> I might sound picky, but</li>
            <li> I put all my makeup, accessories, brush, sponge and I have free space in the bottom too.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED MY MAKEUP CASE TODAY, AND WAS VERY EXCITED AT FIRST UNTIL I OPENED THE PACKAGE!</li>
            <li> THE COMPARTMENTS ARE MADE OF CARDBOARD LIKE MATERIAL AND WRAPPED WITH SOME SORT OF CHEAP STYROFOAM WHICH WAS ALREADY PEELING OFF(VERY FLIMSY).</li>
            <li> Light weight&lt;br</li>
            <li> The slots are removable which means you can fit in a ton of stuff-</li>
            <li> Liked it so much</li>
            <li> that won&#x27;t fit well in this box.  </li>
            <li> Though it is heavy, it is a perfect place to put all of your makeup products (eyeshadow, blush, etc...), along with accessories (brushes).  </li>
            <li> I thought it would not feel cheap.</li>
            <li> it comes with removable  plastic parts that you can adjust to fit whatever you need it to hld.</li>
            <li> It is a great case for people who are just starting to keep make up around.</li>
            <li> everything will fit.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t comfortably fit in my bathroom and it looks rediculous to have it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> The latches with key locks are a great feature.</li>
            <li> My make-up brushes don&#x27;t easily fit in the case because of this-</li>
            <li> While this does not hold ALL of my makeup, as I&#x27;m a makeup Artist, this is a FANTASTIC on-the-go case.....</li>
            <li> Light.</li>
            <li> This fit all my nail items in it</li>
            <li> But overall I&#x27;m extremely happy with my case</li>
            <li> Good size and love the cross body strap.</li>
            <li> It also a great gift for makeup starters who wants to get into the whole collecting idea.</li>
            <li> All in all this case worked out excellently and I will be using it for much longer than the short while that I needed it to move.</li>
            <li> so I need a way to transport to and from easily and have all of my make up accessible but easily accessible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do a ton of travel with my makeup right now, hopefully that will change as I find more work as a Make-up Artist in my area.</li>
            <li> Its just the right amount of space I need to fit all my Makeup!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I held out until I found this case to buy, the price was right.</li>
            <li> I would def recommend this to anyone looking for a higher quality makeup case!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> The box  also comes with an adjustable strap that I have found very useful.</li>
            <li> I love my new make up case!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very sturdy and feels very strong.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very sturdy and feels very strong.</li>
            <li> Super spacious and holds all of my makeup, such a great buy.</li>
            <li> , it is very, very roomy and easy to organize so that everything has a place and is easy to access.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but either way it was aligning perfectly before hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I have placed my cosmetics in the case, and I have to say I like it a lot more than when I received it at first purchase.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy it at first, but Im glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love this so much!</li>
            <li> :) I must add, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> First up I should state that I love makeup, and I have lots and lots of it.</li>
            <li> not everyone is rich to afford \\&quot;sephora\\&quot; ...</li>
            <li> It worth the money!</li>
            <li> Take it from a Avid fisherman, its a great box and strong enough where u can sit on it too !!  </li>
            <li> After looking thru many many many different sizes, colors, styles, brands &amp; types - I settled on this makeup case for my daughter&#x27;s Sweet 16.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to clean and the dividers are useful for organizing your makeup.</li>
            <li> the inside isn&#x27;t cloth so it can be wiped clean.</li>
            <li> and i thought this would be a great starter case at a first glance i noticed right away that this case is far from being 24\\&quot; in!</li>
            <li> fits(which is pretty much the case now,lol)however, all of my basics and then some fit quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, I don&#x27;t have anything good to say about this product!</li>
            <li> love it and would easily recommend this product to any one that has many different combination makeup and cleansers all there</li>
            <li> She does special makeup features and needed the case to keep all her supplies in one place.</li>
            <li> wow how big it is and sturdy, good job with this product i love it!</li>
            <li> love it for travel, carries a decent amount of products!</li>
            <li> Was very happy with this box for the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Money well spent, it&#x27;s a great storage case for make up, works well and is sturdy.  </li>
            <li> but a good size and enough space.</li>
            <li> I really need to stop buying more makeup...</li>
            <li> This Shany Makeup Case is the largest I was able to find at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very spacious although I wish the shelves/trays had more room.</li>
            <li> I know it will make a good present for her.</li>
            <li> I frequently travel and am the kind of person that likes to carry a lot of stuff</li>
            <li> I feel like the quality could be better and more durable, but I&#x27;ll just be sure to not be to rough with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this make up box holds my make up very well and also has room for more.</li>
            <li> This is a good case because its roomy enough for all of my makeup, plus it comes with dividers which you can use to customize the shelf spaces.</li>
            <li> Over all not bad.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for traveling especially when I don&#x27;t want to take my large makeup case.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it has great storage capacity &amp; arrangement options.</li>
            <li> The case is pretty big but its a good thing because then you could fit all your makeup in there.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> It did get here quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> but when you need to grab something quick, this won&#x27;t help you at all and overtime will frustrate you.  </li>
            <li> Super choice.</li>
            <li> my husband tried to super glue it did not work.</li>
            <li> I demand that the store (ETRAVIS Inc) who sold me the product, or Amazon.com give me an adequate response, take responsibility for it</li>
            <li> Super durable.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally purchase a new makeup case at a great price.</li>
            <li> Also, the price is GREAT, especially considering the arm and leg Sephora charges for something similar but uglier. :)</li>
            <li> And the locks are pretty cheap, feels like I am going to break it every time I lock it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for - tons of adjustable storage space to fit what I need.</li>
            <li> This ones good for the use of one person who is not a professional.</li>
            <li> I was able to move them around as needed (on top drawers that is, bottom were not easy to move because top drawer got in the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love my new traincase.</li>
            <li> i will be postinga a picture of the box full of my makeup to give an idea of how much makeup it can fit.</li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps me from giving this item 5 stars is that the strap feels cheaply made and at one point, snapped and thank goodness, I had a grip on the handle!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, a nice product from Shany!</li>
            <li> The case is large but not too large, LOTS of storage, and your able to adjust the shelves to meet your needs.</li>
            <li> I love my new shany makeup case, plenty of room for all my products and I love that they give u spacers to use to fit different sizes of makeup in it.</li>
            <li> The exterior is very nice and clean looking, way more classy and attractive than some of the crazy animal print cases (which are better for younger girls).</li>
            <li> You can fit so much in it and organize your make up.</li>
            <li> If i got anything smaller, i wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit all my make-up in there.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> This case is an okay choice as far as quality goes.</li>
            <li> The outside looks nice, but opening it</li>
            <li> Swear, it&#x27;s ruined hundreds of dollars worth of my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The advert said it was worth $80.</li>
            <li> way bigger than i expected, but a welcome size!  </li>
            <li> totally worth the $ after seeing the size and quality.</li>
            <li> If it was bigger I&#x27;d like it, but it is really nice.</li>
            <li> The entire inside is coated with a felt like material, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the size of the case when she opened it because it was bigger than I thought it would be, which was great.</li>
            <li> I have alot more that couldn&#x27;t fit in the case though, such has my elf 100 eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> Liked the product overall.  </li>
            <li> If i got anything smaller, i wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit all my make-up in there</li>
            <li> You can also add your own personal touch to the case with stickers or color.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Well worth the forty bucks or so.</li>
            <li> Love the carrying strap, has a lot of room and you can adjust the sizes of all the compartments to fit your make up of different sizes and brushes.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, it&#x27;s light, holds all of my make-up and seems to be pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> However it did arrive quickly and is exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> Also, there is a huuuge gap between the top tray and the top of the case, so you can&#x27;t jostle this thing at all or the makeup will get mixed up (but I&#x27;ve never had a cosmetic case before, so maybe this is normal?).   </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have the SHANY logo on the inside of the lid like the picture, so I assume it&#x27;s not the right product.</li>
            <li> I love this train case its very sturdy, you can rearrange only the top compartments, i wish you could rearrange the very bottom of the case,&#x27;There are 4 medium sized compartments.</li>
            <li> It is however a very large box.</li>
            <li> Again, it is very large.</li>
            <li> I carry the case to the sink and find all my facial needs are available and easy to find.</li>
            <li> There are definitely better boxes out there that can take some serious damage, but this one seems to be good for someone who is NOT taking it from place to place for professional use, but rather for someone who is using it daily just keeping it in the house &amp; I would imagine it would be good for transporting make-up on vacations from time to time.</li>
            <li> It is quite large, and I was able to store 80% of \\&quot;my stuff\\&quot; in one concise place.</li>
            <li> If it was just a little bit more well made I&#x27;d be satisfied.</li>
            <li> The box seems a little smaller in the picture, but its real good.</li>
            <li> Would certainly recommend!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product for the price I paid and it arrived super fast!</li>
            <li> It is worth paying an extra $30.00 for the Sephora case and get a case with better quality.</li>
            <li> This is nice but really quite big.</li>
            <li> Super fast arrival, I am excited to use my new product.</li>
            <li> Very Thanks</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent case, doesnt open quite as smoothly as I would like but for the money it&#x60;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed for my onsite make up applications.</li>
            <li> I am glad I will never have to buy another box or bag for makeup because it is so big.</li>
            <li> , this case is pretty functional.</li>
            <li> about the only redeeming factor with this case is that 1)</li>
            <li> Most of the room is at the top of case, and the shelves aren&#x27;t really deep enough to stand anything up without it just falling over.  </li>
            <li> exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Although it is my first make case like this</li>
            <li> sure makes a different!!!</li>
            <li> Overall I like it because I can have a lot of cosmetics in one place, but I am not as satisfied as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li> This was for my sister and its her first case.  </li>
            <li> After taking the case apart and spending some time with a hot glue gun, its in working order.  </li>
            <li> Only one drawback: the bottom portion dividers cannot be adjusted like the dividers in the top fold out drawers.</li>
            <li> and this is exactly it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase a smaller case.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, not too big not too small.</li>
            <li> Those were all good things to me, larger so I can hold more stuff, heavy because its sturdy, and roomy to prevent overcrowding.</li>
            <li> Although this train is big I did find a way to fill it up :)</li>
            <li> This case is surprisingly big which I love that about it.</li>
            <li> It has dividers on the top shelves that you can adjust to your makeup items; however, the middle ones are not adjustable.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a way to organize and store your vaping supplies, I highly recommend the Shany makeup case!!</li>
            <li> The reason there are so many mixed reviews on this is that some people are receiving one that has foam lined trays inside.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s holding all my makeup pretty well.</li>
            <li> This case was bigger than I thought that it was going to be and can fit just about everything inside of it!</li>
            <li> It has lots of room, very sturdy and I compare it to the one from Sephora but this is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon and ETRAVIS Inc. for being so dependable!</li>
            <li> I have a pretty rigorous routine at night and morning.</li>
            <li> I knew from the first moment I opened it</li>
            <li> A tackle box from a local sporting goods store would serve you better.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the case and the fact that its big!</li>
            <li> I would spend the extra coins to buy something more sturdy.</li>
            <li> With this makeup box, all my make up will be organized and I know exactly where to find my blushes, eye shadow, mascara and etc.</li>
            <li> totally wroth it! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I bought this because I finally found a case that holds all of my makeup.</li>
            <li> There are many compartments to seperate the different categories!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Shany really thought this one through!</li>
            <li> but you can get a pretty sufficient amount of makeup in it.</li>
            <li> It was pretty durable and is sure to last!</li>
            <li> So fast!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> She said it is Large enough for all her makeup and has many compartments.  </li>
            <li> is professional looking, and is worth the money!</li>
            <li> it was bigger than i expected but it was great.</li>
            <li> The compartments in the upper rows can be easily changed, but the top row blocks your ability to change the size of the  middle row.</li>
            <li> the fact that it has keys to it makes it even better because i have a sister that likes to borrow my makeup and doesn&#x27;t really bring them back.</li>
            <li> However, you can only really adjust the top level.</li>
            <li> I have a large Sephora train case that is higher quality than this one.</li>
            <li> The hinges and in general the case is cheaply built.</li>
            <li> It can become heavy when it&#x27;s filled, but perhaps I just have too much stuff :)</li>
            <li> I am pretty much a hoarder of makeup</li>
            <li> at first i thought i would not have enought make up to fill it up, but i find myself having too much.  </li>
            <li> This is a good case maybe to just sit around your house and just grab things to put into a small travel kit.</li>
            <li> The case is incredibly well made and durable-it seriously looks like a professional case.</li>
            <li> I love this box so much, my friends sometimes make fun of me because they think that it looks like I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist, but I don&#x27;t use it as my daily makeup container</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really big and strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been building a large collection of makeup.  </li>
            <li> Also if you have a large item, you have to manipulate it to get it out of the shelve, because of the bottom of the shelve over it.  </li>
            <li> It is large which can put a lot of staff in.</li>
            <li> Large and roomy.</li>
            <li> However it is too large for  my needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two large caboodle train cases in my life time and the one i bought maybe 5 years ago is falling apart (the selves are made from cardboard).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite large.  </li>
            <li> Being a lover of makeup, I know that the right accessories (which this product comes with), are crucial to getting the \\&quot;right look.\\&quot;  And having the right look is desirable.</li>
            <li> , only small things fit up top can&#x27;t even fit brushes.</li>
            <li> The dividers are a bit tricky to adjust (especially on the 2nd shelf) but they are bendable so they are easy to adjust with light force.</li>
            <li> I have not used the strap or key because I don&#x27;t need to but by appearance they look fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this not having very high expectations but needing something because I was moving and needed a case to put all of my make up in.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the aluminum which makes it feel cheap.</li>
            <li> I filled the trays with my everyday products and filled the bottom storage with things I don&#x27;t use as often.</li>
            <li> The dividers are very flimsy and the construction overall is cheap.</li>
            <li> and i am soooooo glad i spent the money on it</li>
            <li> But, as I mentioned, you can&#x27;t readily access all of the parts of the case well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t close smoothly - the small racks inside does not move exactly with the cover, and falls on the bottom when you close and there is nothing that cushions the free fall</li>
            <li> I did get delivery really fast</li>
            <li> Thankfully Amazon&#x27;s return policy is fabulous and I will get my money back.</li>
            <li> The trays are very flimsey</li>
            <li> Thanks,</li>
            <li> I did not pay that amount of money for such cheap quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really roomy and fits a ton of stuff.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really know what to compare it to.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> She has so much makeup and no place to keep it neat.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous before receiving the product, because I thought that it might not be like it was described and shown on the pictures.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s quality is very iffy...</li>
            <li> Lots of room and very durable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a MAC user and in each of the four trays that fold out I can fit about 10 eyeshadows across and 2 deep and in two layers; so that&#x27;s 40 MAC eyeshadows per tray.  </li>
            <li> I have had this case for over a year and it is holding up very well.</li>
            <li> I travel locally so much.</li>
            <li> its smaller than I thought....kind of light....</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t about to spend that much.</li>
            <li> and it fared very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and boxed well.</li>
            <li> If you use the shoulder strap, the whole thing tips over.</li>
            <li> very well protected.</li>
            <li> Very roomy and can accommodate all my cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I really needed a place to put and organize all of my makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an indestructible case, so don&#x27;t abuse it, but it&#x27;s quite sturdy and I have everything I need to get ready in there.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money as any others at or near this price range</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend this much.</li>
            <li> This method works very effectively!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very roomy</li>
            <li> as a student, I don&#x27;t have much room&lt;</li>
            <li> the makeup case is really sturdy and can hold every product you might have.</li>
            <li> the makeup case is really sturdy and can hold every product you might have.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a cheap plastic box made of totally inferior meaterial.  </li>
            <li> I like that you can adjust the size of the compartments and the bottom bit is very roomy.</li>
            <li> ready, no searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides that it&#x27;s so spacious, and it even has enough room to fit my bh cosmetics 120 pallet.</li>
            <li> It doesnt feel horribly cheap but enough to make me regret buying it.</li>
            <li> It was better than expected.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I really do like it.</li>
            <li> Too much space for put the paint nails</li>
            <li> When I purchased this I didn&#x27;t realize how much room that I have to work with.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this!</li>
            <li> thanks again.</li>
            <li> Not to mention reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the shoulder strap, so I can&#x27;t really comment on that.</li>
            <li> so it saves me time getting ready</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item is just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really organize things it all gets piled  in the bottom</li>
            <li> I really wish I would have spent more money and get something a lot nicer.</li>
            <li> It is lovely and classy, and has enough compartments to organize all of my makeup.</li>
            <li> The case was a nice size and visually apealing with how big it was</li>
            <li> The tray sizes are able to be completely customized and even come with extra separators.</li>
            <li> The other design flaw is that there is a large space between the top drawer (which has no cover) and the top of the case when it&#x27;s closed.  </li>
            <li> Its great or it and with enough slots for both large and small fishing gear.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, because there is so much space, I was able to place my make-up brush case and some other items on top.  </li>
            <li> I recently needed to buy a new train case to fit my large makeup collection</li>
            <li> Other than that I love it.</li>
            <li> LOL, but this little case held a lot of Make up for a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine if you just start to buy yourself some makeup, I don&#x27;t wear it every day, only on the weekends, and even then I wasn&#x27;t able to fit everything inside and to see what you have you almost have to remove everything out, don&#x27;t waste your money, go for something larger if you have a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> I received it the day after I ordered it with one day shipping, and as soon as I opened it I was pleasantly surprised at how large it was!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a professional who needs a super sturdy and well constructed case, then this is for you!</li>
            <li> i went ahead and kept it because the hassle of returning such a large item wasn&#x27;t worth it on top of the fact i had just spent hours organizing it.</li>
            <li> Only one thing made me feel better is the case is large enough.</li>
            <li> It carried all of my make up and has cute little compartments that are removable if something is too big to fit.</li>
            <li> This case is really big, very roomy, and also very pretty.</li>
            <li> I have to buy a second box because it is full.</li>
            <li> First one I received was cracked near the hinge.</li>
            <li> So - what happens is that if you pack the case, or lie it down somehow, all of the make-up in the top drawer comes out.  </li>
            <li> It is kinf of flimsy and I am glad I didnt pay full price, I only paid about half.</li>
            <li> something maybe a new starter makeup artist, or makeup lover, would use to begin their collection!</li>
            <li> the black handle on top was all stratched up, and</li>
            <li> but I wish it closed easily.  </li>
            <li> I am beyond satisfied with this product especially because the price is low!</li>
            <li> For $50 not only should the product have been quality checked before it left, but it should be made better as well.</li>
            <li> It took me two bottles of super glue to put all the foam back on the dividers and trays.  </li>
            <li> I have tons of makeup...and haven&#x27;t been able to find a case big enough to hold it all.....</li>
            <li> The only problem is that  I have seen makeup cases which were more affordable and were quality equal to this case.</li>
            <li> Big enough to fit even my largest brushes and plenty of room for everything else I need (which is a lot)!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been searching for a decent priced train case for a while.</li>
            <li> The lower main part is divided into four parts and the size can&#x27;t be changes.</li>
            <li> I use this at home mainly for storage</li>
            <li> There is a lot of room between the shelves and the bottom area, so large items can fit, standing straight up; plus the bottom area has several different padded areas for additional organization.</li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me I would so far recommend this!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks very professional and sleek!</li>
            <li> It is very professional looking!</li>
            <li> pay for a highly price product</li>
            <li> I really highly recommend this box .</li>
            <li> and I just couldnt commit to those high prices.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> ; high.</li>
            <li> Has loads of compartments to store makeup and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i wondered why one side was more &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; than the other one of the plastic sides that connects with the metal was completely cracked to the bottom.</li>
            <li> I do wish that it was a little bit more affordable.</li>
            <li> It is a lot bigger than you expect and is made very durable!!</li>
            <li> So there are many little serums and jars.  </li>
            <li> For fifty dollars I was expecting something a little more sturdy.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time for me to find a makeup case that allowed me to store all of my makeup in an organized, yet easily accessible way.  </li>
            <li> This case is very cheaply made and I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
            <li> the small iron pieces around the exterior look more like decorative than providing real support.</li>
            <li> The handle on top doesnt seem like its going to last very long.  </li>
            <li> I just think if they had allowed it to open fully away from each other it would be much easier and much better.  </li>
            <li> The cost of this makeup case is ridiculous good, I know makeup (train) or case can be really expensive and this is a pretty amazing deal.</li>
            <li> Right now I have nail polish on the three of the shelves, and then tons of eye shadow on the fourth shelf.</li>
            <li> if you take them out be resigned to the fact that they are not going back in (i might not be doing it right</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how you can&#x27;t move the second shelves&#x27; little plastic divider because the top shelves are in the way so those shelves are pretty set unless you use force.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough but still very portable.</li>
            <li> You can definitely fit all your travel makeup/brushes and other essentials (shampoo, conditioner, face lotion, etc.).</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter to organize her airbrushing tanning and makeup supplies as she begins her new airbrushing business.  </li>
            <li> but I am assuming it is because its new.</li>
            <li> I live this makeup case.</li>
            <li> The shelves don&#x27;t slide very easily, and I had to glue a lot of the lining back down.  </li>
            <li> To keep the bottom clean (e-juice bottles tend to get sticky), I&#x27;ve placed them in empty medicine bottles.</li>
            <li> It was big enough to fit all my makeup.</li>
            <li> This case looks very professional.  </li>
            <li> Exellent Product, I am recommended, the product is totaly big, I am very very confort with the product,</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I opened it.</li>
            <li> Right now, she definitely wanted to lock her things up to keep them away from her 8 yr old sister who thinks all things are hers regardless of ownership.  </li>
            <li> some metal parts got into each others&#x27; ways and you have to adjust it&#x27;s positions carefully so they can pass each other nicely.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and money!</li>
            <li> Im glad I bought it, but in the future I will definitely be looking to spend another $20-$30 to upgrade &amp; then use this one as a back up.</li>
            <li> Actually, I have one of these smaller Sephora cases for my \\&quot;normal\\&quot; make-up and overall, the quality of the Sephora case it better than Shany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone in need of a pretty big makeup case.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more sturdy than other train cases I looked at for around the same price.</li>
            <li> Looks like a professional one that can cost over alot of money!</li>
            <li> You definitely cant fit large eyeshadow palettes in this case such as the naked palettes or BH cosmetic palettes.</li>
            <li> This is big enough to hold all of my makeup plus face-wash, makeup remover, moisturizer and all of my nail polish and a full size bottle of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> This box came quickly and arrived on the expected day.  </li>
            <li> This is a heavy duty, strong case.</li>
            <li> I have a slight problem with mine closing/aligning just right at the moment because I left it open and had a room full of people getting ready for an event-</li>
            <li> If you look at the first member photo, where you can see the bottom padded area, that is exactly what my case looks like, except of course that it is primarily black, not silver.</li>
            <li> one side is really stiff and doesn&#x27;t close easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to see how long this product last being that its made from plastic and not cardboard!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for my film makeup kit, and I originally bought a black one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little heavy which is good</li>
            <li> Whatever glue they use clearly does not work.  </li>
            <li> it was clearly that someone else before me opened the box.</li>
            <li> Also, the case is completely customizable, with dividers everywhere that you can move around.</li>
            <li> The item I received was not 24x10x10 as advertised, but 14x10.5x8.5 far from what i thought i was ordering.</li>
            <li> it was a welcomed surprised.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised at its size.</li>
            <li> It looks smaller in the photo than it really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can keep 3-4 different regimes all there and ready to change with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It offers plenty of ways to organize your make up from what I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this case.</li>
            <li> My 10 year-old-daughter has been in dance classes and competition since she was 3-1/2 years old.  </li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It fits all my makeup and I have a ton of makeup I buy so much makeup on a regular basis</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is the bottom area - I&#x27;d like to be able to adjust the sections at the bottom, but it&#x27;s not really that big of an issue.</li>
            <li> Fast service from vendor and the case totally met my expectations.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s heavy which is good, it&#x27;s not cheap material.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s held up VERY well to a little bit of beating, and the drawers still slide up and out just as well as when I first opened it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decently priced for the size, has a lot of dividers and is surprisingly deep.</li>
            <li> But to big is better than to small.  </li>
            <li> It is a small peice of wood covered in this foam like material, attached together by a cheap glue.</li>
            <li> First off this is not a silver case, this is a pink case with silver out lining.  </li>
            <li> My case was made of extremely poor materials, was missing keys, and most importantly, it had NO brand insignia printed on the inside of the case.</li>
            <li> This train case is huge and very heavy.  </li>
            <li> the box &amp; its inner tiers open &amp; close smoothly, but need to be done slowly (not in a weird slow way tho,</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift several years ago now, and it is still in almost new condition.</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t sound too bad, opening it takes more effort.</li>
            <li> So much bigger that her old one!</li>
            <li> I am not  professional makeup artist, just a regular consumer who has a large selection of makeup products.</li>
            <li> On the downside, the underneath compartments are hard to reach into, the divider in the bottom that is removable...very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t fit to create four egual compartments in the bottom.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell from the pictures but the interior is some cheap foam material.</li>
            <li> Also giving it only 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know how much force it really took to cause the alignment to be off a little.</li>
            <li> If I were a professional makeup artist and not an individual looking for storage...</li>
            <li> I recommend it for personal use instead of professional use.</li>
            <li> but it is not easily closed.  </li>
            <li> exactly as pictured, except roomier and larger than expected.</li>
            <li> I was very excited for this to arrive and when it did it was broken.  </li>
            <li> The dividers in the second shelf are hard to get in and out, but besides that it is a very sturdy and I would reccomend it to anyone that wants some organization to their make-up madness!</li>
            <li> It also leaves my makeup very accessable and organized, unlike some other makeup cases I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the outer material and hinges feel cheap.</li>
            <li> I love this kit for my freelance makeup jobs or just for personal use, its big enough to pack the really needed items yet small enough to carry, seems a little on the un even side when folded out</li>
            <li> If you play around with it long enough you&#x27;ll be able to, but it really shouldn&#x27;t be that difficult.  </li>
            <li> and the interior are poorly made, the interior are glued on and it can be ripped easily.</li>
            <li> Claw hammer fits in the nice deep lower section, as well as my Porter cable 12 Volt cordless drill and other tools, in just the lower compartment, which is approximately 4\\&quot; deep..</li>
            <li> everyday amd putting it in the bathroom and putting this case into my closet with all my other makeup to take out and use for special occasions</li>
            <li> The size of the entire piece is just right - not too big to need wheels &amp; not too small so it can handle lots of items.  </li>
            <li> A little expensive for what it is, inside top compartments aren&#x27;t very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviews that the metal sliding hinges seem to be cheaply made and if one isn&#x27;t careful especially when closing the case, they seem like they could snap in half.</li>
            <li> Because the case only opens up as much as shown in the pictures, the second level is still slightly covered by the first level making it hard to remove the slots (which I still haven&#x27;t figured out how).</li>
            <li> For how expensive it is, I am nervous that the stiff side will break at some point because it doesn&#x27;t seem to fit exactly right.  </li>
            <li> I will be getting another one hopefully soon to replace my other 10 year old train case.</li>
            <li> but like another reviewer stated that should probably be fixed in the description but other than that</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed since i had read such good reviews for this product and was eagerly awaiting its arrival.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few months now, and it seems to be a high quality item.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it can actually fit, but it was messing with the way I wanted my set up to look, so I just took it out, but overall, the case is big and sturdy and comes with a strap and keys.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not professional enough.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of different brushes, glitters, gels and other equipment, but it&#x27;s big enough to storage all my stuff.</li>
            <li> If only the accordion style \\&quot;spines\\&quot; had closed properly.  </li>
            <li> Its not the sturdiest, but if its opened &amp; closed properly and with care, it will last.</li>
            <li> I also like that this case is a bit larger than other similarly priced make-up cases</li>
            <li> Last year I bought two other brand smaller cases for my two daughters.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s gathered over the past 2 years of high school, cheerleading &amp; dances.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t close properly, a point made in an earlier review, which I&#x27;d hoped was a rare problem.  </li>
            <li> It has plenty of room for screw drivers and pliers and parts in the 4 trays that fold open and closed when opening and closing the box.</li>
            <li> I got this and spent the entire evening organizing my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> (yuck)there were a couple of grey hairs in one of the compartments.</li>
            <li> I spent an entire day looking at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> I organize my makeup after so long...</li>
            <li> This is a bit larger than I expected</li>
            <li> It arrived with a cracked hinge, but when I ordered this as a replacement the shelves were of such poor quality I decided to keep the first one.</li>
            <li> Fully loaded, the hinges are very wobbly and in general the case materials are thin and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The inside trays are lined with foam which wasn&#x27;t stuck to the trays properly and the foam on the dividers are not even sticky enough in order for them to stay down.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t put the big divider in just the right place the smaller dividers are basically useless.  </li>
            <li> Fits hair spray and hair gel bottles (I took the divider in the bottom compartment out), large mirror, blush, lipstick, eyelashes, and all the other small things.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that, although the sections in the drawers are adjustable, the middle row is almost impossible to adjust because you can&#x27;t lift up the divider easily.  </li>
            <li> The foam lining was already pealing off and the drawers that fold open were a mess to get open and close.</li>
            <li> The little brand tag on the outside of the box was even attached crooked.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews, and I don&#x27;t know if I was given a different case than they were, but I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems anyone else has mentioned.</li>
            <li> I ordered two within a couple weeks of each other, so they were shipped from different companies.  </li>
            <li> One is a cosmetology  student and the other travels back and forth from college with it.</li>
            <li> the size of it was bigger than i expected it to be which is a plus!</li>
            <li> Before ordering this product, I read ALL the reviews &amp; I read reviews on like every single other caboodle make-up box similar to this style &amp; in this price range, &amp; in the end</li>
            <li> I am pleased enough ..not bad at all.....</li>
            <li> &amp; I imagine that will be difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Now Sephora makes only smaller make-up cases that can not fit all of the performance make-up I have.</li>
            <li> so far it has held up even broke but not sure for how long.</li>
            <li> The only reason I rated 4 instead of 5 is I do have trouble getting mine to close properly....</li>
            <li> Very roomy, it is a little hard to open</li>
            <li> but clearly that is a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> and everything is loose.</li>
            <li> It weights probably less than a plastic one, meaning it&#x27;s really not solid</li>
            <li> he mail, the outside box was sturdy but the small box the actual makeup case was in fell apart immediately!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see the case lasting past this time next year.</li>
            <li> I received this broken and when I sent it back, the immediately contacted me and sent me a new one.  </li>
            <li> I travel to different dance competitions and I needed something to store all of the make-up and hair products instead of having everything scattered in little plastic bags in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> I personalize it with a little note and her name on the outside.</li>
            <li> but it is a little bigger in person .</li>
            <li> I was looking for a makeup case that was a little bigger than the the cases I had found online.</li>
            <li> but this was a huge disappointment and a waist of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a member of a few different subscription makeup services, so</li>
            <li> and it is sturdy when closed up.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my college aged daughter.</li>
            <li> WHEN I TRIED CLOSING THE CASE, I HAD TO PUSH THE COMPARTMENTS TOWARDS THE CENTER.</li>
            <li> ALSO, THE CASE WASN&#x27;T FLUSH WHEN I CLOSED IT, I HAD TO ADJUST THE DOORS TO CLOSE EVENLY.</li>
            <li> i was sent a PINK case when the one i ordered should have been silver - like the one pictured.</li>
            <li> No as expected.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, looks like it will last forever!!!&lt;br /&gt;Lots</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Got it for a gift, it was supposed to be silver and received a pink one, so be careful where you order if you don&#x27;t want a pink case.</li>
            <li> Seeing the price, I was expecting something cheap and flimsy - man was I wrong!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bigger than i expected because it looks so small in the picture.</li>
            <li> so this box will be moved around, open &amp; closed, taken out &amp; put away &amp; taken out again quite a few times a day!</li>
            <li> I returned it because of the closure issue, but other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cosmetic case on the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> When I received this I thought it was about the size of the other train case I have bought from caboodles.</li>
            <li> So, I looked for other types of train cases.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure on the overall sturdiness</li>
            <li> Other then that</li>
            <li> the make up cases on Amazon and even some other websites to compare.</li>
            <li> it holds all of my mascara, and eye shadow sponge brushes, and blush brushes, and all of my other makeup accessories</li>
            <li> One side is but the other isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Also, the foam pieces that are moveable to adjust the size of the compartments within each tier do not fit tightly, so sometimes when I open the box they are falling out of place.</li>
            <li> the only thing i would like to change is that it is VERY hard to get the dividers in the second row.</li>
            <li> I know of at least one other reviewer who had the same problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This case is hard to open and close.  </li>
            <li> However,not only are the dividers made of cheap plastic, but it is especially difficult to move the ones on the second tier around.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the squeaky noise it makes when i try to close it  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m already outgrowing it, but for someone who has an average amount i would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would have a complaint about is that the compartments are non adjustable.  </li>
            <li> I first was shocked how big it is</li>
            <li> This make up case should sell for less.</li>
            <li> Now there are millions of black dots all over everything.  </li>
            <li> The foam along the &#x27;drawers&#x27; was falling off in a half a dozen locations.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a black strap.</li>
            <li> The bottom shelves does not open fully, so the make up may be a little difficult to remove from the bottom 2nd shelves.</li>
            <li> and I have gotten over the little inconveniences.  </li>
            <li> and I have gotten over the little inconveniences.  </li>
            <li> The shelve supports are so weak that they aren&#x27;t going to last.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this case for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> You can also adjust the size of some of the storage spaces because it comes with little spacers.</li>
            <li> Its a little too &amp;#34;aluminum&amp;#34; and flimsy for my liking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this case for a little over a year now and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> The compartment dividers are made of cardboard covered with some foam material that is already peeling off and the trays are flimsy and difficult to get open and closed.</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of a proper makeup case because I had all my makeup stored in individual bags.</li>
            <li> It is also heavy and durable.</li>
            <li> For the size of the case, there is a lot of wasted space.</li>
            <li> i guess, it&#x27;s not cheap material.</li>
            <li> They are also difficult to adjust since the trays don&#x27;t fold completely out of the way.  </li>
            <li> Also I received the case with one rubber tip missing on the bottom of the case to prevent it from scratching my floors.</li>
            <li> The upper compartments do not slide properly when you open the case, and it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> When I received this box I was ecstatic but only to find one of the pegs on the bottom was broken.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> yes but not smoothly</li>
            <li> This train case is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> Please dont waste your time with this purchase unless you just won the lottery and you have money to burn.</li>
            <li> But is heavy.</li>
            <li> It does not fit on my dresser.  </li>
            <li> To give some prospective, it took up half the space of my small rolling luggage.</li>
            <li> The bottom has a rubbery divider that divides the bottom into four and it seems removable, but not easily.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife and was a little concerned about the size; I thought it would be too small.</li>
            <li> so every time it just hits the grid, quite hard and makes annoying sound.  </li>
            <li> ---the only bad thing I can see that might be a problem in the future is that the tier compartments are lineswith foam instead of plastic</li>
            <li> so not sure.</li>
            <li> Avoid this product at all costs unless it is for a small child to put play make-up in.  </li>
            <li> Not love it.  </li>
            <li> It looks small from the picture</li>
            <li> It looks small it the pictures</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite heavy with all the things in it, but at least it&#x27;s not made of plastic and won&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am so sick and irritated of Amazon pedaling knock off items as the real thing.</li>
            <li> I have my case jam-packed so its very heavy.  </li>
            <li> This box was a little shaky &amp; the hinges didn&#x27;t line up ie</li>
            <li> The dividers, in the lower trays and compartments, are hard to adjust.</li>
            <li> but it is hard to get to because of the way the trays are constructed.</li>
            <li> its kinda hard to close it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to explain does it close</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s hard to lose.</li>
            <li> Hard, durable, goo materials.</li>
            <li> The ones on the lower tray are hard to get in and out of place.</li>
            <li> Hard to describe stuff</li>
            <li> Hardware is not very strong/smooth, but OTOH, it was not that expensive.  </li>
            <li> The&lt;br /&gt;Dividers are awful and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Ignore all the negative reviews</li>
            <li> Storage options found online that are made specifically for vaping are not effective (in my opinion) because they were not enclosed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one I got the entire interior was unsticking, it was all scratched up and dirty.  </li>
            <li> I was forced to return it.</li>
            <li> the support of the steps, within the case, this badly broken, so the steps are uneven when fully deployed.</li>
            <li> Consdering that I ordered this to replace an old SHOEBOX, it says a lot that I am disappointed with this product.   </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have broken eye shadow all throughout my makeup bag as usual...</li>
            <li> The bottom compartment is not adjustable, that makes it impossible to put larger things i.e. make up palettes inside.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only received it today so if anything goes wrong ill post it for others</li>
            <li> Shallow drawers are a disadvantage.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a little difficult to get things in and out from that part.</li>
            <li> I found this item to be very poorly constructed,  the lining inside the compartments was not fitted properly,  the metal parts were affixed loosely and it was basically a piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s I have had a very hard time finding a case that has them.</li>
            <li> I suppose if yours arrived intact it wouldn&#x27;t be too bad if you weren&#x27;t rough with it.</li>
            <li> Once it arrived it was broken.</li>
            <li> And it must have been broken before it was shipped because it was the wall of one of the trays that snapped off.  </li>
            <li> It arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> The case was dirty at few area.</li>
            <li> but I found it to be of poor quality.</li>
            <li> The metal is thin as paper and would offer no protection from anything.</li>
            <li> Just poorly constructed in my opinion.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to leave your face stuff behind.</li>
            <li> I received the package today in Caracas - Venezuela, and the merchandise is broken.</li>
            <li> POORLY constructed interior.</li>
            <li> This Makeup case is a must have for any serious make up artist, or aficionado!  </li>
            <li> You have to ease it closed or it jams :(</li>
            <li> I did rank it as 4 stars instead of 5 because the sliding mechanisms seem a little on the weak side.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in the case.</li>
            <li> It came dusty and dirty,</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it yet..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to get this one because of the tray system</li>
            <li> I could be wrong</li>
            <li> , it is a tad bit mediocre.</li>
            <li> but i was WRONG</li>
            <li> Construction is of a very thin hence, do not expect, sturdyness.</li>
            <li> Parts of the aluminum also looked rusty and dirty.</li>
            <li> Also the dividers have a cover that kept coming apart, i will have to glue it with crazy glue for it to stay.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be afraid to leave it sitting out or toting it around.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Train cases are EXPENSIVE!  </li>
            <li> and it is practically impossible to move the adjustable inserts on the bottom trays.</li>
            <li> The trays themselves are also badly constructed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality is really bad too.</li>
            <li> I got the bad one with the foam compartments</li>
            <li> The quality is too bad.  </li>
            <li> When the box arrived I was shocked.</li>
            <li> in addition, the quality is quite poor and customer service of this company is terrible.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so extremely disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Received case and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE SIZE, BUT THE QUALITY IS VERY, VERY POOR!!  </li>
            <li> After we unpack and opened it we were so very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Purchased this train case and was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so very disappointed with the case I received</li>
            <li> it I was truly upset about this terrible packaging.</li>
            <li> This case was AWFUL!!!</li>
            <li> The quality is horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
            <li> This case is a wonderful size.  This is also the best price I&#x27;ve found for a aluminum cosmetic case of this size.  You can reposition the dividers in the top compartments and make them any size.  You can also take out the dividers in the bottom and change the size of the bottom compartment.  The two lower trays are not adjustable without breaking something, but that is not a problem.  This is made so well, so sturdy.  This case looks very professional.  It comes with a shoulder strap if you need such a thing and a key to lock it if you need it.  I really am impressed.  This is an awesome product for your buck.  I would have paid more but am glad I didn&#x27;t have to.  If you&#x27;re thinking about buying it, get it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great quality for a great price, some of the draws were not removable so you had to just work with them how they were. Besides that, this train case is great quality. Perfect for small makeup collections; a great starter train case for those new to makeup. I know that once my makeup collection grows I will need a bigger train case, but for now it fits my makeup perfectly with some room to spare. I definitely suggest this train case.</li>
            <li> I like this case a lot. It&#x27;s sturdy, well laid out and roomy. The one con I have for it is the shoulder strap. Becareful because at times the case will flip (pivot) when you have it on your shoulder and are walking. Other than that I love it.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed for my onsite make up applications. It&#x27;s large enough but still very portable. Also I love that there is a strap that comes with it too. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great case.  Bought it for my daughter to organize her airbrushing tanning and makeup supplies as she begins her new airbrushing business.  It&#x27;s perfect.  Huge.  Holds everything, with room for more.</li>
            <li> I bought this case hoping it would accommodate  all my make up and be easy to clean.  It has plenty of room--no question.  And its tiers are lined with a plastic that is easy to wipe, better than the cardboard I have now.  But unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t close properly, a point made in an earlier review, which I&#x27;d hoped was a rare problem.  I returned the train case but wish I could have kept it.  If only the accordion style \\&quot;spines\\&quot; had closed properly.  Perhaps Shany should make a 12inch style--less stress on the closure?</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife and was a little concerned about the size; I thought it would be too small. When the box arrived I was shocked. It is a huge box. It is also heavy and durable. I am beyond satisfied with this product especially because the price is low!</li>
            <li> I loved it already when I received it. The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the aluminum which makes it feel cheap. But over all it&#x27;s great. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it ever since I started using it. It&#x27;s big and can store lots of makeup. Great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> This is huge! I am glad I will never have to buy another box or bag for makeup because it is so big. It is kinf of flimsy and I am glad I didnt pay full price, I only paid about half. i would have felt riped off if I paid 80 buck. It is good for about 20-40 buck I think, but not 80 buck worth in my opinion. like I said to flimsy, seems like of cheeply made, but I am happy with the size and It should work great for me. Only thing is not so great for travel. I would have to get a smaller bag or box to travel with. Over all not bad. It did get here quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> The bottom compartment is not adjustable, that makes it impossible to put larger things i.e. make up palettes inside.&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd tier compartment is not adjustable, too. And it&#x27;s a little difficult to get things in and out from that part. Otherwise, a good sized case.</li>
            <li> OMG i looooove it!!!! the only thing i would like to change is that it is VERY hard to get the dividers in the second row. but thats mostley it. i overall like it! it is very sturdy and is HUGE!! it comes with 12 dividers! thats alot. plus you can rearrange the bottom with dividers also! it is like 4x&#x27;s bigger than it looked in the picture!! and i am soooo glad i got it!!! it looks and probably is one of the proffesional ones and i am soooooo glad i spent the money on it becuase it was sooooo worth it!!! i am so glad i ordered it! but it took a while to get here. oh well i still love it! i am going to be adding a picture soon!</li>
            <li> Hardware is not very strong/smooth, but OTOH, it was not that expensive.  Lots of room inside.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do a ton of travel with my makeup right now, hopefully that will change as I find more work as a Make-up Artist in my area. I find that for the price this case will do just fine for now until my makeup collection expands and no longer fits(which is pretty much the case now,lol)however, all of my basics and then some fit quite nicely.I will be upgrading in the future to a roll-a-round kit. I was expecting the case to be somewhat larger than it was when it arrived. I agree with some of the other reviews that the metal sliding hinges seem to be cheaply made and if one isn&#x27;t careful especially when closing the case, they seem like they could snap in half. I&#x27;m glad that the dividers are removable and/or can be customized to fit your needs. However,not only are the dividers made of cheap plastic, but it is especially difficult to move the ones on the second tier around. I like the fact that this case comes with keys,although I&#x27;m pretty sure most of them do-even the cheapest ones? Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product for the price I paid and it arrived super fast!</li>
            <li> This train case is huge and very heavy.  Look carefully at the dimensions - might be perfect if you have a ton of makeup.  Because of the weight and bulk, the case doesn&#x27;t seem to close securely.  On a positive note, the case looks beautiful.  I returned it because of the closure issue, but other than that, it is a gorgeous train case.</li>
            <li> The inside lining/felt lifted almost immediately throughout.  Whatever glue they use clearly does not work.  However, it was nothing a bit of superglue couldn&#x27;t manage.  Other than that, this case is pretty functional.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my grand daughter for her graduation. She does special makeup features and needed the case to keep all her supplies in one place. she loved this!</li>
            <li> It is better than it looks in the Picture. It is made of good material and it is in good size and reasonable weight.</li>
            <li> For the size of the case, there is a lot of wasted space. I wish I could lift the expandable trays out so that I can access the bottom part of the case better. The trays themselves are also badly constructed. The top tray blocks about a 1/3 of the bottom one, so you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;ve got in there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is really bad too. It&#x27;s not even plastic on the inside, it&#x27;s foam covered cardboard. It looks like someone put it together at a Michael&#x27;s Saturday craft class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just about the only redeeming factor with this case is that 1) it was cheap and 2) you can adjust the length of the trays for the size of your products. But, as I mentioned, you can&#x27;t readily access all of the parts of the case well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just stick to Caboodles.</li>
            <li> We got this because its price was low. It looks good on the picture right?  After we unpack and opened it we were so very disappointed. It weights probably less than a plastic one, meaning it&#x27;s really not solid and everything is loose. It doesn&#x27;t close smoothly - the small racks inside does not move exactly with the cover, and falls on the bottom when you close and there is nothing that cushions the free fall so every time it just hits the grid, quite hard and makes annoying sound.  If that doesn&#x27;t sound too bad, opening it takes more effort. some metal parts got into each others&#x27; ways and you have to adjust it&#x27;s positions carefully so they can pass each other nicely. it&#x27;s supposed to make things easier to reach but when you need to grab something quick, this won&#x27;t help you at all and overtime will frustrate you.  the small iron pieces around the exterior look more like decorative than providing real support.</li>
            <li> I love this case!  It&#x27;s sturdy, well made, easy to customize, has a lock and a carrying strap.  I&#x27;m a member of a few different subscription makeup services, so I&#x27;ve been building a large collection of makeup.  This keeps everything neat and organized.  Plus, I&#x27;ve been wanting a makeup train case since I was a teenager.  So it&#x27;s a win-win</li>
            <li> Once it arrived it was broken. The hinges and in general the case is cheaply built. Not worth the money, I don&#x27;t have anything good to say about this product! Do not waste your time and money!</li>
            <li> A little expensive for what it is, inside top compartments aren&#x27;t very sturdy.  However it did arrive quickly and is exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> This case is hard to open and close.  The shelves don&#x27;t slide very easily, and I had to glue a lot of the lining back down.  It&#x27;s also a lot bigger than it needs to be.  Most of the room is at the top of case, and the shelves aren&#x27;t really deep enough to stand anything up without it just falling over.  The little brand tag on the outside of the box was even attached crooked.  Don&#x27;t buy this box unless you want to start out with something that is already falling apart.  I really wish I would have spent more money and get something a lot nicer.</li>
            <li> You do get what you pay for, and as a storage case this works well! It is quite large, and I was able to store 80% of \\&quot;my stuff\\&quot; in one concise place. On the downside, the underneath compartments are hard to reach into, the divider in the bottom that is removable...very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t fit to create four egual compartments in the bottom.  I can&#x27;t even see what is in one of the compartments once I had my stash in there.  End results,  I like it and happy I purchased it.  If I were a professional makeup artist and not an individual looking for storage...this would not be ideal.</li>
            <li> the case itself is ok. Got it for a gift, it was supposed to be silver and received a pink one, so be careful where you order if you don&#x27;t want a pink case.</li>
            <li> I bought this case knowing it was junky but big. I didn&#x27;t realize just how junky it was though! The dividers are poorly-cut cardboard covered in cheap foam, which was peeling off when I got it. Parts of the aluminum also looked rusty and dirty. Despite the fact that its junk I&#x27;m going to keep it because I just need a way to bring all of my stuff back and forth from college. This is big enough to hold all of my makeup plus face-wash, makeup remover, moisturizer and all of my nail polish and a full size bottle of nail polish remover. If you are looking for quality DON&#x27;T BUY THIS CASE!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift several years ago now, and it is still in almost new condition. The case comes with several plastic dividers, and all four of the shelves are lined, so you can divide the shelves as you desire. Right now I have nail polish on the three of the shelves, and then tons of eye shadow on the fourth shelf. Then I have various makeup, nail and hair products in the bottom area. There is a lot of room between the shelves and the bottom area, so large items can fit, standing straight up; plus the bottom area has several different padded areas for additional organization. I love this box so much, my friends sometimes make fun of me because they think that it looks like I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist, but I don&#x27;t use it as my daily makeup container - I use it to hold and organize all the beauty products I have that I do not use on a daily basis and it does the job perfectly. The case is incredibly well made and durable-it seriously looks like a professional case. I actually have seen the makeup artists at Sephora use the same case. It can become heavy when it&#x27;s filled, but perhaps I just have too much stuff :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews, and I don&#x27;t know if I was given a different case than they were, but I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems anyone else has mentioned. If you look at the first member photo, where you can see the bottom padded area, that is exactly what my case looks like, except of course that it is primarily black, not silver. But like I said, I have had this case for many years now, and nothing is falling apart...</li>
            <li> I love this makeup box! it&#x27;s bigger than i expected because it looks so small in the picture. it&#x27;s very sturdy and feels very strong. it&#x27;s a little heavy which is good i guess, it&#x27;s not cheap material. If i got anything smaller, i wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit all my make-up in there.&lt;br /&gt;All the slots in the inside are removable, which means you can remove them or slide them over and make any size cubicles and there&#x27;s lots of sizes available. it comes with a sturdy strap which i haven&#x27;t used yet. it also comes with 3 keys to lock your makeup box. it works i tried it, although don&#x27;t need it. i will be postinga a picture of the box full of my makeup to give an idea of how much makeup it can fit. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This case is an okay choice as far as quality goes. I have a large Sephora train case that is higher quality than this one. It is worth paying an extra $30.00 for the Sephora case and get a case with better quality. I don&#x27;t believe this case has a swivel handle as advertised, if it does than the one I got doesn&#x27;t work. In addition, the trays in the top are plastic(not the greatest quality plastic either) with a flimsy metal type attachment that lifts the trays. The dividers, in the lower trays and compartments, are hard to adjust. There is a lot of room in the bottom compartment but it is hard to get to because of the way the trays are constructed. This is a gift for a person who does not have one at all so I think it will do, but if I was buying it for me I would return it. I did get delivery really fast, that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Consdering that I ordered this to replace an old SHOEBOX, it says a lot that I am disappointed with this product.   The outside looks nice, but opening it I saw that it&#x27;s already falling apart! The compartment dividers are made of cardboard covered with some foam material that is already peeling off and the trays are flimsy and difficult to get open and closed. Very cheaply made.   Also, there is a huuuge gap between the top tray and the top of the case, so you can&#x27;t jostle this thing at all or the makeup will get mixed up (but I&#x27;ve never had a cosmetic case before, so maybe this is normal?).   Overall, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was very excited for this to arrive and when it did it was broken.  And it must have been broken before it was shipped because it was the wall of one of the trays that snapped off.  And all of the trays are made of cardboard.  I remember when they were made of PLASTIC...but clearly that is a thing of the past.  Thankfully Amazon&#x27;s return policy is fabulous and I will get my money back. For $50 not only should the product have been quality checked before it left, but it should be made better as well.</li>
            <li> I love this kit for my freelance makeup jobs or just for personal use, its big enough to pack the really needed items yet small enough to carry, seems a little on the un even side when folded out but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me I would so far recommend this!</li>
            <li> This make up case should sell for less. Everything inside the box was falling apart. I have never returned anything but this was a huge disappointment and a waist of money. I was forced to return it.</li>
            <li> exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> So ticked.  Was very happy with this box for the first few weeks.  Then the material on the inside of the box started falling apart. After only a few weeks! Now there are millions of black dots all over everything.  And the last thing you want is crud sticking to all of your makeup. Swear, it&#x27;s ruined hundreds of dollars worth of my makeup.  Buy a different case!</li>
            <li> Purchased this train case and was very disappointed.  It arrived broken.  I had to repair the bracket which was connected to the moveable trays inside the case.  The trays are very flimsey and it is practically impossible to move the adjustable inserts on the bottom trays. This case is very cheaply made and I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> The case itself seems sturdy enough.  The bottom compartment is a very good size, which is why I bought this case.  The trays seem to work fine.  The only drawback is the dividers in the bottom compartment.  They are cardboard with some foam glued to the outside.  If you don&#x27;t put the big divider in just the right place the smaller dividers are basically useless.  They are also difficult to adjust since the trays don&#x27;t fold completely out of the way.  For the price and size, I&#x27;d say this is still a good product.</li>
            <li> This thing ig HUGE!! Bought it as a Christmas gift for the wife and she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I might have to buy another one and use it as a tool box...lol</li>
            <li> It was big enough to fit all my makeup. I travel a lot and Ive had many makeup cases. this one is the best. Thanks,</li>
            <li> I am so extremely disappointed in this product. I returned it after having it in my possession for a minute. I bought it as a gift for my friend thinking that because it was a Shany product it would be good quality because I have bought from them before. I was wrong! It came dusty and dirty, the black handle on top was all stratched up, and what bothered me the most is that the dividers were all unglued! The dividers for the top sections are removable and very cheap. It is a small peice of wood covered in this foam like material, attached together by a cheap glue. When I opened it, all of the dividers were thrown all over the case and they had come unglued. I did not pay that amount of money for such cheap quality. I might sound picky, but it I was truly upset about this terrible packaging. I strongly recommend that you do not buy this product if you are looking for a good sturdy, completed make up train case.</li>
            <li> This case is great for getting organized. It&#x27;s really roomy and fits a ton of stuff. You are able to fill each drawer to the top and there is no problem closing it. The adjustable dividers in the drawers are nice too- I was able to move them around as needed (on top drawers that is, bottom were not easy to move because top drawer got in the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The locks work and it is sturdy when closed up. I have a slight problem with mine closing/aligning just right at the moment because I left it open and had a room full of people getting ready for an event- I&#x27;m thinking that someone ran into it or possibly tried to close it with stuff in the way. I&#x27;m not sure, but either way it was aligning perfectly before hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t even unwrapped the shoulder strap- but I&#x27;m sure it could come in handy at some point. Although, if you are like me and fill this case up.. it could get kind of heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this was a good buy. I do wish that it was a little bit more affordable. Also giving it only 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know how much force it really took to cause the alignment to be off a little. I can&#x27;t blame the case though- so not sure. And it does still close and lock fine.</li>
            <li> The case has enough space for almost all my make up. I like it. Although it is my first make case like this so I don&#x27;t really know what to compare it to. But the quality is good. Feels strong. For the price I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I put all my makeup, accessories, brush, sponge and I have free space in the bottom too. Very sturdy, very good quality. The inside box are sturdy no cardboard. All the corner are metal. You can change drawer dividers and adapt to your needs too. Thank you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a makeup train case for quite some time now, and i&#x27;ve been looking toward to the Sephora. But I guess you pay what you get. I came across this deal on amazon and i thought I came across a perfect deal. However, once i received my package... i was not as pleased as i hope i will be. The case was dirty at few area. the box that the product was delivered in looks like it was a return item. it was clearly that someone else before me opened the box. Also, the train case doors does not stay close unless it is lock. and the interior are poorly made, the interior are glued on and it can be ripped easily. pay for a highly price product sure makes a different!!!</li>
            <li> this makeup case is probably one of the best things that i ever bought for organizational reasons. i own a good amount of makeup and didn&#x27;t have anything to really organize all of my products nor protect them. the fact that it has keys to it makes it even better because i have a sister that likes to borrow my makeup and doesn&#x27;t really bring them back. haha.</li>
            <li> I purchased this case for my granddaughter. She has so much makeup and no place to keep it neat. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Perfect!! Beautiful and functional...exactly as pictured, except roomier and larger than expected. It is lovely and classy, and has enough compartments to organize all of my makeup. The compartment sizes are also flexible. I&#x27;ve used this for a few months now, and it seems to be a high quality item. Recommended! Also, the price is GREAT, especially considering the arm and leg Sephora charges for something similar but uglier. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this cosmetic case on the other reviews.  I have not placed my cosmetic in it as yet, but just from opening it, I foresee a problem.  The bottom shelves does not open fully, so the make up may be a little difficult to remove from the bottom 2nd shelves. Also the dividers have a cover that kept coming apart, i will have to glue it with crazy glue for it to stay. Also I received the case with one rubber tip missing on the bottom of the case to prevent it from scratching my floors. I will have to purchase or use a rubber to attach to it for it not to scratch my floors. Overall I like it because I can have a lot of cosmetics in one place, but I am not as satisfied as I thought I would be. If you have a fair amount of cosmetics, it is a good buy for the money. After I put my cosmetics in, I will update this review and let you know how it worked with the cosmetics in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have placed my cosmetics in the case, and I have to say I like it a lot more than when I received it at first purchase. I have all my cosmetics in one place, and in one neat package.  As mentioned before the shelves are not constructed well enough to allow each shelves to be fully open, so it is difficult to remove an items that is located under the top shelves. You have to remove the item that is in front of it, then go fishing for the item at the back of the shelve. Also if you have a large item, you have to manipulate it to get it out of the shelve, because of the bottom of the shelve over it.  I just think if they had allowed it to open fully away from each other it would be much easier and much better.  All it would have needed was longer bars at the end. The short bars hankering the shelves are too short and does not allow it to extend fully. I have also placed some slider at the bottom that allows me to slide it on my floors and into my bathroom vanity shelve. I also got creative and put some Velcro&#x27;s on the available space of the lid where I anchor my brushes, mirror. After all that is said, I would recommend it because frankly it have grown on me and I have gotten over the little inconveniences.  Hope that help in making your purchase decision..

            <li> This is a huge makeup train case but I found it to be of poor quality. It&#x27;s hard to tell from the pictures but the interior is some cheap foam material. The separators on the inside of mine were flimsy and coming separated from the cardboard that it was glued on. I am going to end up returning this item, and spending more on something better quality.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy it at first, but Im glad I bought it. This was for my sister and its her first case.  Definitely worth the money.  My sister loves it! So Im happy!</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup case for dental hygiene school to hold my instruments in. I purchased this case in August and it has already broke! From the moment I bought it the case did not close properly, shortly after the hinges broke. The case was a nice size and visually apealing with how big it was but it was very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I love it! I was really nervous before receiving the product, because I thought that it might not be like it was described and shown on the pictures. However, it looks just like it said it should! It is perfect for my makeup, and sturdy as well!</li>
            <li> Received case and was disappointed. The inside trays are lined with foam which wasn&#x27;t stuck to the trays properly and the foam on the dividers are not even sticky enough in order for them to stay down.</li>
            <li> This box was a little shaky &amp; the hinges didn&#x27;t line up ie, I had to needle-nose plier them a bit. Other than that, it has great storage capacity &amp; arrangement options.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter for christmas as a last minute idea.  It came in a nice box but I thought I would check it over before I wrapped it. Thank goodness I did.  It took me two bottles of super glue to put all the foam back on the dividers and trays.  The metal is thin as paper and would offer no protection from anything. The shelve supports are so weak that they aren&#x27;t going to last.  It is just cheesey at any price.  Unfortunately I have to give this to my daughter along with an appology and a promise for a better one when the holidays pass.  Avoid this product at all costs unless it is for a small child to put play make-up in.  It is junk and an embarrassment to give it as a gift.  Not what I am used to from an Amazon vendor.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s quality is very iffy... Of course you cannot ask more for this price. The upper compartments do not slide properly when you open the case, and it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> Excellent, my GF love it very much when she got it. It is large which can put a lot of staff in.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in the case. The glue is showing. The felt is peeling. The&lt;br /&gt;Dividers are awful and cheaply made. The aluminum is scratched. The advert said it was worth $80. BULL! Where is the strap and keys. If you have never had a train case before you will like it. Not love it.  It is however a very large box. Just poorly constructed in my opinion. Where are my bottom dividers. It okay. I will not purchase another.</li>
            <li> Adjustable compartments.  Large and roomy. Good quality</li>
            <li> Super nice case. I bought this for an auction and the girl that won it loves it. Lots of room and very durable. Great buy too. Thank you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for travel</li>
            <li> Its alright, I prefer fabric cases with wheels for easy travel and strangth. The case seems like it can brake easily.</li>
            <li> great item.  way bigger than i expected, but a welcome size!  totally worth the $ after seeing the size and quality. would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Before ordering this product, I read ALL the reviews &amp; I read reviews on like every single other caboodle make-up box similar to this style &amp; in this price range, &amp; in the end I chose this one. For this item, I read in 1 review that there are actually 2 different boxes that can be shipped out, 1 from amazon and 1 from yazmo. I read the review that yazmo had the great box and amazon the not-so-great one. But yazmo wanted to take 2-3 weeks to ship it &amp; amazon (which I ordered mine from) promised it within 2 days, and YES it was here in 2 days! The speedy shipping was great &amp; heres what I got: It looks like the picture, except for the inside. the box &amp; its inner tiers open &amp; close smoothly, but need to be done slowly (not in a weird slow way tho, kinda like how you open a door, if you thrust it open &amp; slam it shut every time, it will break) Its not the sturdiest, but if its opened &amp; closed properly and with care, it will last. There are definitely better boxes out there that can take some serious damage, but this one seems to be good for someone who is NOT taking it from place to place for professional use, but rather for someone who is using it daily just keeping it in the house &amp; I would imagine it would be good for transporting make-up on vacations from time to time. I will put up another update soon on how well it has held up after about a month, because I use my make-up every day and I touch up after work so this box will be moved around, open &amp; closed, taken out &amp; put away &amp; taken out again quite a few times a day! All in all...Im glad I bought it, but in the future I will definitely be looking to spend another $20-$30 to upgrade &amp; then use this one as a back up. If your looking for something to transport in &amp; out of the house--Dont get this one--go for the more expensive ones out there. This ones good for the use of one person who is not a professional. ---the only bad thing I can see that might be a problem in the future is that the tier compartments are lineswith foam instead of plastic &amp; I imagine that will be difficult to clean. Also, the foam pieces that are moveable to adjust the size of the compartments within each tier do not fit tightly, so sometimes when I open the box they are falling out of place. But i still like it and I have gotten compliments on it and the \\&quot;Oh where did you get that?\\&quot; comment, which makes us all love our purchasing skills!</li>
            <li> it is a bit flimsy, but it does what it is supposed to. not for professionals! but a good size and enough space.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Good size and love the cross body strap. This was a gift for my college aged daughter. She loves it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed for oranizing and storing my makeup, great quality and size.  Ignore all the negative reviews</li>
            <li> Train cases are EXPENSIVE!  This case is pricey for a box, but in the world it competes in, its a steal! The case is huge.  I&#x27;m a MAC user and in each of the four trays that fold out I can fit about 10 eyeshadows across and 2 deep and in two layers; so that&#x27;s 40 MAC eyeshadows per tray.  pretty great.The bottom portion is deep and can hold massive amounts of things.   Also, the case is completely customizable, with dividers everywhere that you can move around. I really love this case.      The only thing I worry about is the handle.  I have my case jam-packed so its very heavy.  The handle on top doesnt seem like its going to last very long.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it yet.. I just think it may give out.</li>
            <li> This case was AWFUL!!! I got the bad one with the foam compartments and it just wouldn&#x27;t line up trying to open and close it. I&#x27;m so very disappointed with the case I received that I&#x27;m returning it tomorrow. Didn&#x27;t have the SHANY logo on the inside of the lid like the picture, so I assume it&#x27;s not the right product.</li>
            <li> Lots of room in this sturdy case to carry all my makeup. I have had this case for over a year and it is holding up very well.</li>
            <li> This case is larger than I was expecting and holds a ton of makeup. There are adjustable compartments, which works great for those who have a need to really organize/customize. I did rank it as 4 stars instead of 5 because the sliding mechanisms seem a little on the weak side. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t want to try to close this up if I was in a hurry. Overall, I do like the case and plan to buy a smaller version for my daughter.</li>
            <li> this was a great buy. the case was a lot bigger than i thought it would be but the perfect size for me since i have a lot of make up. i use it all the time and lovin it.</li>
            <li> love it for travel, carries a decent amount of products! If it was bigger I&#x27;d like it, but it is really nice.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED MY MAKEUP CASE TODAY, AND WAS VERY EXCITED AT FIRST UNTIL I OPENED THE PACKAGE! THIS CASE IS MADE OF VERY CHEAP MATERIAL. THE COMPARTMENTS ARE MADE OF CARDBOARD LIKE MATERIAL AND WRAPPED WITH SOME SORT OF CHEAP STYROFOAM WHICH WAS ALREADY PEELING OFF(VERY FLIMSY). WHEN I TRIED CLOSING THE CASE, I HAD TO PUSH THE COMPARTMENTS TOWARDS THE CENTER. ALSO, THE CASE WASN&#x27;T FLUSH WHEN I CLOSED IT, I HAD TO ADJUST THE DOORS TO CLOSE EVENLY. I LIKE THE SIZE, BUT THE QUALITY IS VERY, VERY POOR!!  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM AT ALL! I WILL BE RETURNING IT ASAP!</li>
            <li> Being a guy, I don&#x27;t use this box for make up. I had bought one like this at a garage sale, and loved how it worked for my tools, but it got stolen and wanted to replace it. I found this one on Amazon, and am very happy with it.  I  am able to carry it into a customer&#x27;s house and have most everything I need to do my job. A 12 oz. Claw hammer fits in the nice deep lower section, as well as my Porter cable 12 Volt cordless drill and other tools, in just the lower compartment, which is approximately 4\\&quot; deep.. It has plenty of room for screw drivers and pliers and parts in the 4 trays that fold open and closed when opening and closing the box. The entire inside is coated with a felt like material, which is nice. It also has adjustable bin dividers for the trays, to keep parts separated if you choose to use them. The 2 top trays will hold material or tools 2 1/2 \\&quot; high, which it very nice to have. The box  also comes with an adjustable strap that I have found very useful. I can hang the box on my shoulder, since it comes with a shoulder strap, and carry my ladder and anything else I might need in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;  I really highly recommend this box .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is 20 years old and she loved it! She now has a place to keep all her make up and she was very pleased with just how large this case is. I was surprised at the size of the case when she opened it because it was bigger than I thought it would be, which was great. This is a great gift idea for someone looking for a make up case.</li>
            <li> i was sent a PINK case when the one i ordered should have been silver - like the one pictured. in addition, the quality is quite poor and customer service of this company is terrible. this was ordered in december and the company has NOT responded. i was not given a case at all like the one pictured. the inside set-up is extremely different as well.  buyer beware. waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got this case because it wasn&#x27;t the cheapest but it wasn&#x27;t the most expensive.  I don&#x27;t think you get what you pay for with this item.  The inside of the case is lined with foam that has a sticky backing to it.  The foam along the &#x27;drawers&#x27; was falling off in a half a dozen locations.  After taking the case apart and spending some time with a hot glue gun, its in working order.  Its fine now, but I wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> I travel locally so much. I was in the market for a makeup case to help me avoid having to pack and unpack each time. This case met my expectations, fully. In fact, I believe a couple of my friends are going to order it as well.</li>
            <li> Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Durable design&lt;br /&gt;More space and much more durable than caboodle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have any more to say.</li>
            <li> It has lots of space but it didn&#x27;t come with as many dividers as the picture shows and the  pull out drawers are wobbly</li>
            <li> I looked for a make-up case on Amazon for MONTHS untill I found this one. After looking at all the pictures and reading the reviews I decided to buy it. I could be HAPPIER with my choice. The case is large but not too large, LOTS of storage, and your able to adjust the shelves to meet your needs. The case &amp; locks are sturdy!</li>
            <li> So sturdy and the silver color is amazing!!! The slots are removable which means you can fit in a ton of stuff- so you don&#x27;t have to leave your face stuff behind. I also store all my stuff in this when I&#x27;m not traveling, it&#x27;s big enough to accommodate your gazillion tubes , pans and pencils!</li>
            <li> The cost of this makeup case is ridiculous good, I know makeup (train) or case can be really expensive and this is a pretty amazing deal. It can store alot of your makeup and it easy to handle and travel with. It also a great gift for makeup starters who wants to get into the whole collecting idea.</li>
            <li> This company is the BEST!  I received this broken and when I sent it back, the immediately contacted me and sent me a new one.  It is great!  I&#x27;m using it for a lot of halloween makeup &amp; jewelry.  It is prefect &amp; the service is TOPS :)</li>
            <li> The item I received was not 24x10x10 as advertised, but 14x10.5x8.5 far from what i thought i was ordering. Box itself is nice, just not the right size.</li>
            <li> I have gone through a million makeup cases in my time and this is the best one and the longest lasting!! It is a lot bigger than you expect and is made very durable!! I would def recommend this to anyone looking for a higher quality makeup case!!</li>
            <li> I bought this case for my daughters to keep all their nail polish in.  It holds a lot of bottles and files, brushes and tools.  It keeps everything neat and tidy.  Liked it so much, I bought another one as a gift for a girlfriend.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> Got this for a trip to hold my makeup. Has lots of room and very pleased with purchase.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> It was a present for my sister&#x27;s birthday.  She said it is Large enough for all her makeup and has many compartments.  She also likes that it has a lock just in case she travels with it</li>
            <li> its smaller than I thought....kind of light.... but it would def get the job done! I am pleased enough ..not bad at all.....I recommend it for personal use instead of professional use.</li>
            <li> Great product very sturdy and well worth the price. Only one drawback: the bottom portion dividers cannot be adjusted like the dividers in the top fold out drawers. Other than than it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Love my new traincase. It&#x27;s really big and strong. Already packed but still has lots of room for more stuff! I really need to stop buying more makeup...I have a problem you now...I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> Money well spent, it&#x27;s a great storage case for make up, works well and is sturdy.  Very pleased!  Fits lots!</li>
            <li> Great product! Great value!</li>
            <li> Great makeup case.  Good quality.  However it is too large for  my needs.</li>
            <li> Works well for my daughter</li>
            <li> Exellent Product, I am recommended, the product is totaly big, I am very very confort with the product, Very Thanks</li>
            <li> When I received this box I was ecstatic but only to find one of the pegs on the bottom was broken. Trying not to be picky I glued it back on and it&#x27;s ok now. I love it. I have lots of make up and tools in it. Amazing! Everyone needs one!</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of a proper makeup case because I had all my makeup stored in individual bags. Most of the make up cases I found online were either $100 or more. Now I&#x27;m not a makeup artist needing a makeup case for travel so I wasn&#x27;t about to spend that much. I needed a make-up case that I could store and use at home and this is exactly it. I love that the interior is made out of plastic (not cloth like others) so it&#x27;s easy to clean and the dividers are useful for organizing your makeup. The dividers are a bit tricky to adjust (especially on the 2nd shelf) but they are bendable so they are easy to adjust with light force. I also like that this case is a bit larger than other similarly priced make-up cases (I looked at some at Walgreens &amp; Target before deciding on this one). This case is the perfect size for the amount of makeup I own so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase a smaller case. The case isn&#x27;t the most sturdiest so I can see this case falling apart if you don&#x27;t take good care of it.</li>
            <li> Really nice case but one side is really stiff and doesn&#x27;t close easily.  For how expensive it is, I am nervous that the stiff side will break at some point because it doesn&#x27;t seem to fit exactly right.  I can force it to close but it is not easily closed.  It is a nice case and has great sizing options with removable dividers but I wish it closed easily.  Maybe mine got bumped in shipping.</li>
            <li> When I received this I thought it was about the size of the other train case I have bought from caboodles. But then i found it it was a bit larger it was a welcomed surprised. I&#x27;ve bought two large caboodle train cases in my life time and the one i bought maybe 5 years ago is falling apart (the selves are made from cardboard). I&#x27;m so excited to see how long this product last being that its made from plastic and not cardboard! Do yourself a favor and get this Train case because its great!!! I will be getting another one hopefully soon to replace my other 10 year old train case.</li>
            <li> I travel to different dance competitions and I needed something to store all of the make-up and hair products instead of having everything scattered in little plastic bags in a suitcase. This Shany Makeup Case is the largest I was able to find at a reasonable price. Another make-up case I considered was made by Sephora, but it was way overpriced and at this point, I believe, it is discontinued. Now Sephora makes only smaller make-up cases that can not fit all of the performance make-up I have. Actually, I have one of these smaller Sephora cases for my \\&quot;normal\\&quot; make-up and overall, the quality of the Sephora case it better than Shany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I am very happy I got Shany case. Again, it is very large. Not too heavy. Fits hair spray and hair gel bottles (I took the divider in the bottom compartment out), large mirror, blush, lipstick, eyelashes, and all the other small things. Shany does not feel as sturdy as Sephora case, but it does the job just as well. I have taken Shany on a plane and on a bus and it fared very well.</li>
            <li> Great case for make-up.  It&#x27;s quite large.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that, although the sections in the drawers are adjustable, the middle row is almost impossible to adjust because you can&#x27;t lift up the divider easily.  If you play around with it long enough you&#x27;ll be able to, but it really shouldn&#x27;t be that difficult.  The other design flaw is that there is a large space between the top drawer (which has no cover) and the top of the case when it&#x27;s closed.  So - what happens is that if you pack the case, or lie it down somehow, all of the make-up in the top drawer comes out.  On the other hand, because there is so much space, I was able to place my make-up brush case and some other items on top.  This solved the problem of the make-up flying all over the place, but it&#x27;s still a design flaw, in my opinion.  Had it been designed better, I would have given it 5 stars.  On the positive side, it&#x27;s light, holds all of my make-up and seems to be pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> I love this! Last year I bought two other brand smaller cases for my two daughters.Their cases were $60, and I got them on sale for $40. Their&#x27;s are much smaller than this one. I got this case as a lightening deal for $19.99. When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised at its size. I has three tiers. It folds out nicely. It&#x27;s good quality. I am very, very happy with this case!</li>
            <li> Great purchase, nice quality and has great room for organizing.</li>
            <li> I love this so much! I ordered on a Friday and it arrived yesterday, Monday. It&#x27;s very spacious although I wish the shelves/trays had more room. I use it for my clients, with a bunch of standing foundation, powders, bronzers, lip palette, highlighter,lashes, primers and such. I have alot more that couldn&#x27;t fit in the case though, such has my elf 100 eyeshadow palette. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it can actually fit, but it was messing with the way I wanted my set up to look, so I just took it out, but overall, the case is big and sturdy and comes with a strap and keys.</li>
            <li> I receive my case on time, I purchased this case as a Christmas gift for my wife and she love it. I am very satisfied with this product. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this train case its very sturdy, you can rearrange only the top compartments, i wish you could rearrange the very bottom of the case,&#x27;There are 4 medium sized compartments. You definitely cant fit large eyeshadow palettes in this case such as the naked palettes or BH cosmetic palettes. My only complaint would be the squeaky noise it makes when i try to close it  its kinda hard to close it it&#x27;s hard to explain does it close yes but not smoothly</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and boxed well. It was not to big and big enough for all my siters makeup. She travels a lot and loved it. I personalize it with a little note and her name on the outside. She loved it</li>
            <li> I love this case! It&#x27;s the perfect size. I would have given it 5 stars but there is one issue with it. If you use the shoulder strap, the whole thing tips over. There might be a simple fix to this but it&#x27;s not a big deal to me. I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> Liked the product overall.  This case is huge! Tons of space inside. Loved the adjustable dividers. My only complaint is that the outer material and hinges feel cheap. Even so, would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, not too big not too small. If fit all of my makeup and it looks cute on a dresser!</li>
            <li> It got to me perfectly in one piece. very well protected. it was bigger than i expected but it was great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to store my make with so I didn&#x27;t have broken eye shadow all throughout my makeup bag as usual... So I bought this. It&#x27;s great! Very roomy, it is a little hard to open but I am assuming it is because its new. I have not used the strap or key because I don&#x27;t need to but by appearance they look fine. I love the spaces being adjustable. It has a ton of room and is much larger and heavier than I thought. Those were all good things to me, larger so I can hold more stuff, heavy because its sturdy, and roomy to prevent overcrowding. Although this train is big I did find a way to fill it up :)</li>
            <li> Sturdy beautiful case!! You will love it!!</li>
            <li> Very roomy and can accommodate all my cosmetics. The material is strong and easy to carry.  I really love this one</li>
            <li> Super choice. All make up in one place</li>
            <li> great make up box for me;  love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this case for a little over a month now and I think it&#x27;s totally great. Plenty of space and their adjustable.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and looks great.  I would recommend to anyone in need of a pretty big makeup case.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally purchase a new makeup case at a great price. I got this and spent the entire evening organizing my makeup collection. after it was all said and done i wondered why one side was more &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; than the other one of the plastic sides that connects with the metal was completely cracked to the bottom. my husband tried to super glue it did not work. i went ahead and kept it because the hassle of returning such a large item wasn&#x27;t worth it on top of the fact i had just spent hours organizing it. so far it has held up even broke but not sure for how long.</li>
            <li> Super fast arrival, I am excited to use my new product.</li>
            <li> I really needed a place to put and organize all of my makeup. This case is surprisingly big which I love that about it. To give some prospective, it took up half the space of my small rolling luggage. The top compartments are adjustable. You just lift a dividing slot and move it to create more/less space. However, you can only really adjust the top level. Because the case only opens up as much as shown in the pictures, the second level is still slightly covered by the first level making it hard to remove the slots (which I still haven&#x27;t figured out how). The bottom compartments are not adjustable, but they are very deep and I stack my eye-shadows and foundation bottles there. It&#x27;s not an indestructible case, so don&#x27;t abuse it, but it&#x27;s quite sturdy and I have everything I need to get ready in there. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great makeup train case for the price point.  It is definitely worth the money as any others at or near this price range will not get you the size or durability of this case.  It has dividers on the top shelves that you can adjust to your makeup items; however, the middle ones are not adjustable.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this item 5 stars is that the strap feels cheaply made and at one point, snapped and thank goodness, I had a grip on the handle!! So don&#x27;t rely on the straps to transport this case! Otherwise, I would recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;~Pam</li>
            <li> I have tons of makeup...and haven&#x27;t been able to find a case big enough to hold it all.....until now.....everything all together and organized....</li>
            <li> I looked all over the internet, mostly on ebay, to find a storage solution for my vaping (e cigarette) supplies. These supplies include: e-juice (e-liquid) bottles (ranging from 4ml to 20ml), two ego-c twist batteries (900mah and 1100mah), clearomizers, glassomizers, lanyards, drip tips, and battery charger. Storage options found online that are made specifically for vaping are not effective (in my opinion) because they were not enclosed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing that some ebay sellers were re-purposing office supplies, I looked up various storage boxes and office supplies. I found a nail polish train case on ebay for around $60 (name brand). I didn&#x27;t want to spend this much. So, I looked for other types of train cases. I was skeptical to get this one because of the tray system (I liked the simplicity of the first nail polish case I saw).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is beyond perfect! The trays are plastic and have adjustable sides, which is perfect for storing batteries, drip tips, clearomizers, etc. The bottom is deep and feels like it&#x27;s covered in felt. I use the bottom to store e-juice bottles. To keep the bottom clean (e-juice bottles tend to get sticky), I&#x27;ve placed them in empty medicine bottles. This method works very effectively!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the silver box! The fact that it locks makes it an even better storage solution for vaping (keeps it childproof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a way to organize and store your vaping supplies, I highly recommend the Shany makeup case!!</li>
            <li> this make up case was bought for the wife. I know it will make a good present for her. When the staff saw it they were simply amazed with the organization of the thing.</li>
            <li> This case is great if you get the right one!  I ordered two within a couple weeks of each other, so they were shipped from different companies.  The one from Yazmo is great, inside and out, and looks just like the one pictured. The reason there are so many mixed reviews on this is that some people are receiving one that has foam lined trays inside. The quality is horrible! It was falling apart on arrival and the trays are not sturdy at all. If you decide to order, good luck!  I hope you get the good one!</li>
            <li> I found this item to be very poorly constructed,  the lining inside the compartments was not fitted properly,  the metal parts were affixed loosely and it was basically a piece of crap.  I sent it back the same day it was delivered.</li>
            <li> i returned it as soon as i opened it was scratch on the inside,had make-up residue,was dented and (yuck)there were a couple of grey hairs in one of the compartments.I was really disappointed since i had read such good reviews for this product and was eagerly awaiting its arrival.</li>
            <li> girls love it.  like a tackle box for makeup and whatever else they have in it. well made.</li>
            <li> I love this case! I just got it so I&#x27;m not sure on the overall sturdiness but it&#x27;s holding all my makeup pretty well. It&#x27;s very roomy and it&#x27;s actually a lot bigger than I had thought and the shelves are WAY deeper than I thought they would be, so I have plenty of room. I didn&#x27;t like how you can&#x27;t move the second shelves&#x27; little plastic divider because the top shelves are in the way so those shelves are pretty set unless you use force. The bottom has a rubbery divider that divides the bottom into four and it seems removable, but not easily. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine if you just start to buy yourself some makeup, I don&#x27;t wear it every day, only on the weekends, and even then I wasn&#x27;t able to fit everything inside and to see what you have you almost have to remove everything out, don&#x27;t waste your money, go for something larger if you have a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> This case is great for my make-up. It is big enough to put everything. It comes with a black strap.</li>
            <li> Good sized. Locks are kinda crappy though, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have to lock your stuff to make sure it won&#x27;t be gone through. One side doesn&#x27;t lock at all, even though it clicks like it has locked. And the locks are pretty cheap, feels like I am going to break it every time I lock it.</li>
            <li> Holds all my makeup and then some. Sometimes the shelf get stuck, but you just have to work with them.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine I said &#x27;&#x27;OMG&#x27;&#x27; when I opened the case and saw inside. The quality is too bad.  Only one thing made me feel better is the case is large enough.</li>
            <li> Its nice to see a makeup case that has a variety of dividers for all your makeup, also looks really great!</li>
            <li> It looks smaller in the photo than it really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-I can DEFINITELY store ALL of my make up in this thing.&lt;br /&gt;-Keeps me organized&lt;br /&gt;-I KNOW where my make up is&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s hard to lose. (Don&#x27;t wanna end up like Ella and Lola in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen!)&lt;br /&gt;-I know my makeup is safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Not the best quality&lt;br /&gt;-Bulky, as a student, I don&#x27;t have much room&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in All, I&#x27;d have to say this product is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Overall, this train case comes in around a 6.5 on a scale of 1 to 10. Its great to take on vacations, perfect for a makeup artist transporting makeup, and nice for those who want to get organized. The exterior is very nice and clean looking, way more classy and attractive than some of the crazy animal print cases (which are better for younger girls). Its a lot bigger than shown in the picture, which was a pleasant surprise! I think this is a good gift for any makeup lover on your shopping list. The only problem is that  I have seen makeup cases which were more affordable and were quality equal to this case. Other than that, a nice product from Shany!</li>
            <li> I purchased this and I am so happy I did it holds everything comfortably. I even got one for my sister</li>
            <li> I love this makeup box! it&#x27;s very sturdy and feels very strong. it&#x27;s heavy which is good, it&#x27;s not cheap material. If i got anything smaller, i wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit all my make-up in there</li>
            <li> This box is more than your imagination can ever conceive!! I absolutely love it. For the price...you can not match the quality of this product!! Trust me, you will be more than satisfied with this case!!</li>
            <li> this case is well built, sturdy and strong material. I would reccomend this case to every woman. Great price for a great case.</li>
            <li> After looking thru many many many different sizes, colors, styles, brands &amp; types - I settled on this makeup case for my daughter&#x27;s Sweet 16.  She has a TON of makeup she&#x27;s gathered over the past 2 years of high school, cheerleading &amp; dances. I knew in 2 years she&#x27;s heading away to college &amp; might wish to lock up her things if she&#x27;s sharing a room or suite.  Right now, she definitely wanted to lock her things up to keep them away from her 8 yr old sister who thinks all things are hers regardless of ownership.  So the locking component was a huge factor.  The color is something that could go with any room or decor &amp; won&#x27;t go out of style or be a \\&quot;trend\\&quot; &amp; so that gives it longevity.  The size of the entire piece is just right - not too big to need wheels &amp; not too small so it can handle lots of items.  The drawers &amp; shelves are deep enough to hold just about every size of tube, compact, or package.  We haven&#x27;t found anything yet that won&#x27;t fit well in this box.  So it&#x27;s a hit all the way around &amp; for the price - definitely something that should be considered for any gift or personal purchase.</li>
            <li> My niece wanted this to keep all her hair products in it.  She has quite a bit of products for her hair.  Well she loves it!  It is great for traveling and she is quite attached to it when we go places.</li>
            <li> I frequently travel and am the kind of person that likes to carry a lot of stuff so this was a great choice. It&#x27;s decently priced for the size, has a lot of dividers and is surprisingly deep. You can definitely fit all your travel makeup/brushes and other essentials (shampoo, conditioner, face lotion, etc.).</li>
            <li> the makeup case is really sturdy and can hold every product you might have. it was definately a good buy to keep things organized and handy when you need them.</li>
            <li> This is a great case to store all the make up you have no place for and it is just piling up in your medicine cabinet of vanity. This holds 4 pounds wow! You can also add your own personal touch to the case with stickers or color.</li>
            <li> This case was bigger than I thought that it was going to be and can fit just about everything inside of it!</li>
            <li> the makeup case is really sturdy and can hold every product you might have.  it was definately a good buy to keep things organized and handy when you need them.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time for me to find a makeup case that allowed me to store all of my makeup in an organized, yet easily accessible way.  I am not  professional makeup artist, just a regular consumer who has a large selection of makeup products.</li>
            <li> First off this is not a silver case, this is a pink case with silver out lining.  Secondly this is not a metal case it&#x27;s a cheap plastic box made of totally inferior meaterial.  The one I got the entire interior was unsticking, it was all scratched up and dirty.  I will not be buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I love this case and it does hold a TON of makeup. The tray sizes are able to be completely customized and even come with extra separators. The only issue I have had is with the closing tray. I feel like the quality could be better and more durable, but I&#x27;ll just be sure to not be to rough with it.</li>
            <li> Why spend $100 on a Sephora train case when you can buy this?! I&#x27;ve had this for almost 3 years, and I love it. I love the compartments and that you can change the size of each of them accordingly.  It&#x27;s also great for travel!</li>
            <li> This make up kit has EVERYTHING in it,brushes too it&#x27;s amazing.Weighting only four pounds.I love it.I can take it anywere.</li>
            <li> Can you say good quality, yes !! I must say that this case has exceeded my expectations. I most definitly recommend this case to anyone. It has lots of room, very sturdy and I compare it to the one from Sephora but this is well worth the price. I wish it came in more colors, I will use this case to begin my freelance work.</li>
            <li> This Makeup case is a must have for any serious make up artist, or aficionado!  Though it is heavy, it is a perfect place to put all of your makeup products (eyeshadow, blush, etc...), along with accessories (brushes).  Being a lover of makeup, I know that the right accessories (which this product comes with), are crucial to getting the \\&quot;right look.\\&quot;  And having the right look is desirable.</li>
            <li> Today i received my train case i bought this for my husband he has gotten into sfx make up and i thought this would be a great starter case at a first glance i noticed right away that this case is far from being 24\\&quot; in! Its about 18 not that big of a deal but like another reviewer stated that should probably be fixed in the description but other than that im pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this case. It has plenty of storage room. It is sturdy and spacious. She loves that it comes with a key. You can also adjust the size of some of the storage spaces because it comes with little spacers.</li>
            <li> This box came quickly and arrived on the expected day.  It was in perfect condition too.  The best part is that it looks very professional.  I plan to use it for essential oils and related items.  Everything fits neatly into the box so I can carry it wherever I want as I train people to mix recipes using essential oils.  Thanks Amazon and ETRAVIS Inc. for being so dependable!</li>
            <li> This train case is a bit heavy but I just purchased it to keep all my makeup in one place. I like that you can adjust the size of the compartments and the bottom bit is very roomy.</li>
            <li> The case has different compartments making it easier to storage and change products. It contains movable slides to change the capacity of the compartments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen similar boxes in stores and I just couldnt commit to those high prices.  This box is huge, has alot of room with adjustable compartments.  So cheap I am kicking myself for not buying one years ago!</li>
            <li> I love my new shany makeup case, plenty of room for all my products and I love that they give u spacers to use to fit different sizes of makeup in it. It looks small from the picture but it is the perfect size!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend this make up box for those girls who love make up  I love the space that this make up has I love it I have to buy a second box because it is full. Overall, I recommend this make-up box</li>
            <li> best thing the divider on the bottom case can be remove, has all the storge space for all your needed. i&#x27;ll have a video up on youtube/bibianca15</li>
            <li> I received the package today in Caracas - Venezuela, and the merchandise is broken. the support of the steps, within the case, this badly broken, so the steps are uneven when fully deployed. I demand that the store (ETRAVIS Inc) who sold me the product, or Amazon.com give me an adequate response, take responsibility for it and I somehow solve this problem. I do not think it broke while being transported because it has no bumps, no scratches or damage on the outside. q rupture had taken for human error when closing the doors of the case incorrectly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t close the case.. I has a defect... I&#x27;m going to return it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it&#x27;s perfect size; I love the adjustable trays/dividers and it definitely is worth the price! I have a lot  of makeup and this box holds it all and just works perfectly!!! Quality also is really good! Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I live this makeup case. It&#x27;s much more sturdy than other train cases I looked at for around the same price. It&#x27;s a great size and holds all of my makeup great! I didn&#x27;t think I would like the bottom dividers but it makes everything so much more organized. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Great quality. Perfect size. Both daughters love it. One is a cosmetology  student and the other travels back and forth from college with it.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty rigorous routine at night and morning. So there are many little serums and jars.  This case works perfect!  I can find what I need and keep it all together.  I carry the case to the sink and find all my facial needs are available and easy to find. I can keep 3-4 different regimes all there and ready to change with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and would easily recommend this product to any one that has many different combination makeup and cleansers all there ready, no searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this case because I was going to move, but that has changed and now it is my case for all my stuff, forever!</li>
            <li> Let me begin with this... cheap cheap cheap! I must admit, it \\&quot;looks\\&quot; nice, but once you get your hands on it the truth is revealed. The moment I pulled it from the box I knew something was up. The handles and latches were flimsy as I tried to get inside it. Once I did I realized why this makeup case was so inexpensive. The foam lining was already pealing off and the drawers that fold open were a mess to get open and close. I knew from the first moment I opened it I was going to return it. Please dont waste your time with this purchase unless you just won the lottery and you have money to burn. Even then, just toss your money in the trash or burn it, you&#x27;ll probably get more in return than you would if you purchased this makeup case. A tackle box from a local sporting goods store would serve you better. Run my friends, run from this product!!</li>
            <li> It is perfect to storage all the accesories and makeup, it can fit all products that you need to store</li>
            <li> When i got this package int he mail, the outside box was sturdy but the small box the actual makeup case was in fell apart immediately! I bought it as a gift for my dog groomer.</li>
            <li> For fifty dollars I was expecting something a little more sturdy. Also the movable dividers on the inside drawers on the bottom ones- if you take them out be resigned to the fact that they are not going back in (i might not be doing it right though!&lt;br /&gt;Besides that it&#x27;s so spacious, and it even has enough room to fit my bh cosmetics 120 pallet.</li>
            <li> I thought it would not feel cheap. It does. It doesnt feel horribly cheap but enough to make me regret buying it. If it was just a little bit more well made I&#x27;d be satisfied. Other then that its okay.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have a lot of makeup but enough to the point where I needed a makeup case. I really liked this one because it fits all of my makeup so well! And it keeps my makeup safe and nice! I also love the color of the makeup case because it&#x27;s very professional looking and matches my room! :D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big, it&#x27;s roomy, it holds all your stuff. Great for your daughter if her cosmetics are taking over your bathroom counter. However, if you&#x27;re a makeup artist looking for something to take with you when seeing clients, skip it. It&#x27;s just not professional enough. I do believe it&#x27;s perfect for at-home or personal travel use.</li>
            <li> I love this make up case! I spent an entire day looking at all the make up cases on Amazon and even some other websites to compare. I can&#x27;t keep my make up in my bathroom so I need a way to transport to and from easily and have all of my make up accessible but easily accessible. This was the perfect choice! It is plenty of room, and the way the compartments are I can keep everything so organized that I just open it up and do my make up close it up and put it back where I got it. I love this make up case! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The size of the case is advertised as being 24 x 10 x 10. The case I received is 14 x 10.5 x 8.5. The model number in the description is SHANY044, but the model number of the case I received is SHANY005. However the UPC codes do match. I know of at least one other reviewer who had the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;Beware! They need to fix the description so that it matches the product!</li>
            <li> This was actually purchased as a gift for me from my husband. He knows I have a LOT of makeup and thought I needed some extra storage space. I love the quality of the case and the fact that its big! It&#x27;s actually so much bigger than the picture looks! Great gift for yourself or to give to someone you know that loves makeup!</li>
            <li> My wife was begging for a makeup case. I grabbed this one for her. She swears by it now, and doesn&#x27;t know how she got by before it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build is solid, and feels sturdy. It offers plenty of ways to organize your make up from what I&#x27;ve seen. My wife won&#x27;t leave for vacation without it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my sister. It was better than expected. She loved it!! Two Thumbs Up.</li>
            <li> This case is huge for the price! It is very sturdy. I was very surprised when I opened it. It even has a lock on it.&lt;br /&gt;It looks very professional and sleek! This was a christmas gift for my sister ( a makeup queen).....she fell in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;This case is worth buying!!</li>
            <li> i love this make up box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this make up box holds my make up very well and also has room for more. it comes with removable  plastic parts that you can adjust to fit whatever you need it to hld. It looks small it the pictures but it is a little bigger in person . I would recommend this Shany makeup box for everyone who needs storage of makeup all in one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a set of keys to lock the top if you need to  and a strap to carry makeup box.</li>
            <li> Was looking at shelves and cabinets to install in the bathroom, but this perfectly suits our needs, with no need to drill, nail or otherwise put something together.</li>
            <li> Its a little too &amp;#34;aluminum&amp;#34; and flimsy for my liking. I could be wrong but I don&#x27;t see the case lasting past this time next year. It is a great case for people who are just starting to keep make up around. I can see why many people are satisfied with the product however, it is a tad bit mediocre. I would spend the extra coins to buy something more sturdy.</li>
            <li> It was delivered today, on time! About three days after I purchased it! Very happy with it! All my makeup fit it in nicely!  Happy to have everything all in one place!</li>
            <li> peefect, i love it a lot!</li>
            <li> It was just the right size for everything I had makeup wise and it all fit. Now instead of having a makeup bag to dig through, everything has a proper place and is neatly organized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to realize this same makeup case is being sold under several different brands. I&#x27;m using it for my film makeup kit, and I originally bought a black one. It arrived with a cracked hinge, but when I ordered this as a replacement the shelves were of such poor quality I decided to keep the first one. Fully loaded, the hinges are very wobbly and in general the case materials are thin and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the research I&#x27;ve done it seems to be cheaper than some options, but beware of the quality. I suppose if yours arrived intact it wouldn&#x27;t be too bad if you weren&#x27;t rough with it.</li>
            <li> No as expected. Interior padding was not glued to sides. Construction is of a very thin hence, do not expect, sturdyness.</li>
            <li> This case is great if you are just getting started.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great size for the price of it.</li>
            <li> This train case is amazing. You can fit so much in it and organize your make up. The only flaw is that the keys don&#x27;t work they don&#x27;t lock the train case</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price, it&#x27;s a great organizer and helped declutter my bathroom. I recommend this to any makeup junkie.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this case. Seeing the price, I was expecting something cheap and flimsy - man was I wrong! This is a heavy duty, strong case. Big enough to fit even my largest brushes and plenty of room for everything else I need (which is a lot)! Perfect for traveling and all the little compartments make it super easy to stay organized!</li>
            <li> This box is actually way bigger than I thought! I like the quality of it. This box is able to hold all of my make up. With this makeup box, all my make up will be organized and I know exactly where to find my blushes, eye shadow, mascara and etc. totally wroth it! :)</li>
            <li> this box is very nice, good size to put all my makeup in. everything will fit. i love the silver color just a nice clean cut box.</li>
            <li> This case was well made and attractive.  Its perfect for doing make up on the go.</li>
            <li> The case is pretty big but its a good thing because then you could fit all your makeup in there. What i like most is that there is removable trays unlike some makeup cases.</li>
            <li> This train is perfect. It&#x27;s much bigger than I expected so I am able to store more of my makeup in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this case for about 2 months now. I really do like it. I was expecting the bottom to be completely open, but it has dividers that are NOT removable... however I just tore them out and it is the way that I want it. The dividers in the second shelf are hard to get in and out, but besides that it is a very sturdy and I would reccomend it to anyone that wants some organization to their make-up madness!</li>
            <li> My 10 year-old-daughter has been in dance classes and competition since she was 3-1/2 years old.  She and her mom say this is a great case for all her dance necessities.  Well constructed with lots of storage area!!  This summer and last they used in National dance competition in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> Hard, durable, goo materials. Too much space for put the paint nails</li>
            <li> This makeup box is reall good and fits a lot of makeup. The box seems a little smaller in the picture, but its real good. Its perfect to keep all the makeup clear and organized.</li>
            <li> This is a great train case, it holds a lot of products and it is very durable.  This train case is easy to use for travel and storage, it fits nicely on any vanity table.  I would recommend this train case of make up storage.</li>
            <li> Update 8/15/2012 I am in love with this case I use it all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been searching for a decent priced train case for a while. I&#x27;m not a pro or anything but I wanted something that I could keep all my makeup in at home. I like that the compartments have adjustable pieces so I can make room for everything. Its perfect for what I need :)</li>
            <li> When I purchased this I didn&#x27;t realize how much room that I have to work with. I&#x27;m so glad that I bought this because I finally found a case that holds all of my makeup. There are many compartments to seperate the different categories! I organize my makeup after so long... o_0 :) I must add, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> Its just the right amount of space I need to fit all my Makeup! Plus I love the feel and look of the case.</li>
            <li> These cases are a good value - lots of room, cosmetically sleek and able to keep all of your makeup together in one place.</li>
            <li> when I bought it I thought, \\&quot;what if it&#x27;s not as big as i think it will be!!\\&quot; but then.. it came and it was bigger than i thought! it holds all of my mascara, and eye shadow sponge brushes, and blush brushes, and all of my other makeup accessories it was such a great find!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good case maybe to just sit around your house and just grab things to put into a small travel kit. Very nice size, something maybe a new starter makeup artist, or makeup lover, would use to begin their collection!</li>
            <li> This is much larger than I thought it was going to be so I was pleasantly surprised. It still doesn&#x27;t hold all of my makeup, but that is bc I am pretty much a hoarder of makeup lol It is very sturdy and I love that I can move the slides around and change the size of each compartment to accommodate which makeup I put in each spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister (make up lover) and she LOVES it !! So much bigger that her old one! Wonderful space and cute design. Shipping was very fast. I&#x27;ll defiantly buy from this seller again !</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for Christmas.  I was not expecting it to be as big, but she loves it.</li>
            <li> I use the case for my gel nails stuff. I have a lot of different brushes, glitters, gels and other equipment, but it&#x27;s big enough to storage all my stuff. It&#x27;s quite heavy with all the things in it, but at least it&#x27;s not made of plastic and won&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can lock it if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for makeup artists and manicurists, it&#x27;s good to have your equipment in one place.</li>
            <li> My bff loooooves makeup! So I got her this for her birthday! The girl is always doing something to her face...so of course she loved this! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be about the same size as my caboodle but i was WRONG it&#x27;s bigger and the inside set up is better! it&#x27;s great for traveling especially when I don&#x27;t want to take my large makeup case. I can just pack this and put in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> This is a case that I would be \\&quot;rough\\&quot; with. I wouldn&#x27;t be afraid to leave it sitting out or toting it around. It&#x27;s strong. It has good sized compartments and a good variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> I recently needed to buy a new train case to fit my large makeup collection and it&#x27;s amazing! It fits all my makeup and I have a ton of makeup I buy so much makeup on a regular basis but it holds all of it! The case is beautiful, arrived very quickly, is professional looking, and is worth the money! I highly recommend buying this! I love everything about it. Definitely buy it!</li>
            <li> Great makeup box! the size of it was bigger than i expected it to be which is a plus! I love every product from this company!</li>
            <li> My cousin has this case and I am sooo jealous! I love that it has the side compartments with adjustable dividers so you have the perfect size compartments and its so light weight, It really is made for convenience. Shany really thought this one through!</li>
            <li> I love how roomy this train case is. you can fit all the essentials in it quite easily. You can pack all your brushes, and makeup in here for easy travel.</li>
            <li> I love this case. It&#x27;s lightweight and the two extendable trays are so fab. Great way to stay organized. Love it</li>
            <li> This Makeup case is good for anyone, you can use it for makeup or even your own purposes. It is big enough to hold everything that you want it to! This is a great buy on all aspects.</li>
            <li> had my make up all over the place ..bought this case and it the best purchase I have ever made...everything is inside now..Im happy</li>
            <li> Request by Granddaughter and she loved it</li>
            <li> when i took it out the box i said wow how big it is and sturdy, good job with this product i love it! i put all my makeup  in order i was soooooo pleased with my purchase. thanks again.</li>
            <li> When I first started getting into make up, this case was perfect, I have since outgrown it and now have a 6 drawer cabinet from IKEA to house all my Make up...Yes it is an addiction...LOL, but this little case held a lot of Make up for a long time, it is very, very roomy and easy to organize so that everything has a place and is easy to access. Its in my closet now, but It was a perfect case for me when I first started liking Make up. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> yes it is not the biggest makeup case but you can get a pretty sufficient amount of makeup in it. It was pretty durable and is sure to last!</li>
            <li> First up I should state that I love makeup, and I have lots and lots of it. So when I saw this case I thought it would be perfect for storing everything. It does store everything, and the adjustable dividers in the case are perfect. The case holds everything, and is well made and sturdy. The problem is - it&#x27;s just enormous. It can&#x27;t comfortably fit in my bathroom and it looks rediculous to have it anywhere else. It weighs about 5 pounds and measures 14 x 10.5 x 8.5 inches. I ended up taking out the makeup I wear everyday amd putting it in the bathroom and putting this case into my closet with all my other makeup to take out and use for special occasions and when I go out.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for - tons of adjustable storage space to fit what I need. The only reason I rated 4 instead of 5 is I do have trouble getting mine to close properly....it ends up closing just takes some effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this case for a little over a year now and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I looked for quite a while before making a purchase. It&#x27;s held up VERY well to a little bit of beating, and the drawers still slide up and out just as well as when I first opened it. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I absolutely love it! Super spacious and holds all of my makeup, such a great buy. Not to mention reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> What a beauty! The removable dividers are a great plus. Great quality construction of the case. The extendable trays with adjustable dividers are great for versatility. I like that parts of it&#x27;s made of aluminum for durability. The latches with key locks are a great feature. A very useful makeup case to own!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing makeup case! I love everything about this case. The only thing I would change is the bottom area - I&#x27;d like to be able to adjust the sections at the bottom, but it&#x27;s not really that big of an issue. Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with it. I do recommend this case. I haven&#x27;t tried the shoulder strap, so I can&#x27;t really comment on that.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Super durable. Tons of compartment space. Great price and arrived quickly. Def feel like I got a great deal.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous make up box! I bought this not having very high expectations but needing something because I was moving and needed a case to put all of my make up in. I received it the day after I ordered it with one day shipping, and as soon as I opened it I was pleasantly surprised at how large it was! It carried all of my make up and has cute little compartments that are removable if something is too big to fit. All in all this case worked out excellently and I will be using it for much longer than the short while that I needed it to move. Recommended!</li>
            <li> This case is amazing. It holds a ton of stuff. Eyeshadows, some lipsticks, foundations, I even got my Dinair Airbrush setup in there. I keep my pallets out though they could go in there to. The dividers are something that seems to me would be a no brainer for this kind of case yet it&#x27;s amazing how many don&#x27;t have them. In fact, it&#x27;s I have had a very hard time finding a case that has them. The ones on the lower tray are hard to get in and out of place. Be nice if I could lift the top up for a bit more room but otherwise everything else is perfect. Hard to describe stuff so check out the pic I will upload. It should help but in short. Well worth the forty bucks or so.</li>
            <li> This is a good case because its roomy enough for all of my makeup, plus it comes with dividers which you can use to customize the shelf spaces. Overall a decent case, doesnt open quite as smoothly as I would like but for the money it&#x60;s a pretty good deal. It also looks really nice.</li>
            <li> Great case for the price. First one I received was cracked near the hinge. Return was easy and was promptly sent a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds a lot of make-up. Larger than in picture. Holds almost all of my make-up, I have a lot. Only thing I do not like is that you cannot change the size of the compartments in the middle and lower part. The compartments in the upper rows can be easily changed, but the top row blocks your ability to change the size of the  middle row. The lower main part is divided into four parts and the size can&#x27;t be changes. My make-up brushes don&#x27;t easily fit in the case because of this- they have to be angled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the case for almost four months and not issues with sturdiness and anything else. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> love my case.  at first i thought i would not have enought make up to fill it up, but i find myself having too much.  great way to keep all my make up organized.</li>
            <li> I love my new make up case!!! I have always wanted one but for some reason never got one before! It is very professional looking! Love the carrying strap, has a lot of room and you can adjust the sizes of all the compartments to fit your make up of different sizes and brushes. It&#x27;s perfect! Would certainly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup artist who needs to travel around with a makeup kit. I use this at home mainly for storage and I take it outside once in a while for events. I like how durable the outside is, but the construction on the inside is definitely what you pay for. If you&#x27;re not a professional who needs a super sturdy and well constructed case, then this is for you!</li>
            <li> The double trays on each side are attached so when you open it they fold out like a tackle box. Holds a lot of items and the bottom has a divider which is easily removed. I only wish i could find one that was deeper so it would hold a bottle that was 4 or 5&amp;#34; high.</li>
            <li> This makeup case is the best! Looks like a professional one that can cost over alot of money! Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is nice but really quite big. I made a mistake and did not read the measurements.</li>
            <li> I really love this case! I only received it today so if anything goes wrong ill post it for others</li>
            <li> So let me just say that after ordering I recieved it a couple of days after!! So fast! I got it today.. opened the box n everything was just like it said.. im so happy n satisfied with the choice I made ;)... n just fyi not everyone is rich to afford \\&quot;sephora\\&quot; ...this was a deal n im in love with it!! ♥♥ TY!!!</li>
            <li> Received a KNOCK OFF!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware!!! My case was made of extremely poor materials, was missing keys, and most importantly, it had NO brand insignia printed on the inside of the case. It&#x27;s a KNOCK OFF!!! I am so sick and irritated of Amazon pedaling knock off items as the real thing.</li>
            <li> I needed an easy solution for the 150 eyeshadows, 35 blushes, 12 mascaras, etc etc etc that I have in my collection and this was it! I was impressed that I was able to fit so much in it. I filled the trays with my everyday products and filled the bottom storage with things I don&#x27;t use as often. The case has a great look to it and stores easily under the bathroom counter. It opens and closes very smoothly and has dividers to customize the tray sizes. It looks professional and is of good quality!</li>
            <li> This case is a morning, evening, date and whatever server you can think of. There are places for all my makeup in one place so it saves me time getting ready</li>
            <li> I had purchased a similar makeup case from a different manufacturer and thought this case would be similar. The dividers are very flimsy and the construction overall is cheap.</li>
            <li> The SHANY box!!! Heavy duty, looks like it will last forever!!!&lt;br /&gt;Lots of compartments also.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> As expected. POORLY constructed interior.</li>
            <li> My wife bought it for me for 50 bucks, to be used as a fishing tackle box.  Its great or it and with enough slots for both large and small fishing gear.  Take it from a Avid fisherman, its a great box and strong enough where u can sit on it too !!  That says something for a 200 lb man !!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I purchased it! This case is really big, very roomy, and also very pretty. I like simple things, so I ordered the silver one and I love love love it! It worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love this case. For the price it is amazing. Great for a starter trunk. I sell makeup so I&#x27;m already outgrowing it, but for someone who has an average amount i would recommend it. The only problem ive had with it is sometimes it won&#x27;t close all of the way . It has to be lined up perfectly to snap close. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t let that stop you from purchasing this item, though .</li>
            <li> perfect for the price</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter... She is happy with it, it has plenty of compartments, more space to store her makeup... I received it on time and was happy with that..</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a professional.  It holds a ton of makeup and the inside isn&#x27;t cloth so it can be wiped clean. I LOVE Shany products</li>
            <li> It comes with keys to lock it, and a strap for easy carrying. It&#x27;s durable and has more room in it than I had anticipated. I&#x27;m glad I held out until I found this case to buy, the price was right.</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price! There are bigger cases, but they are much more expensive.  This case holds a lot and it&#x27;s washable should you spill anything inside.</li>
            <li> While this does not hold ALL of my makeup, as I&#x27;m a makeup Artist, this is a FANTASTIC on-the-go case.....as you NEVER need to bring ALL of your make up with you!!!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT! And it holds A LOT of makeup! INCLUDING my airbrush machine!!  :-)</li>
            <li> Plastic on the inside. Light. Shallow drawers are a disadvantage. You have to ease it closed or it jams :(</li>
            <li> I order this for an aunt that needed it for her daughters. It has what it says it does and the quality is good. But is heavy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. This fit all my nail items in it an I had a lot!!!</li>
            <li> I have a large quantity of makeup and this is an excellent storage solution. It also leaves my makeup very accessable and organized, unlike some other makeup cases I&#x27;ve had. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love having all my makeup in one spot.  Only thing I would have a complaint about is that the compartments are non adjustable.  One side is but the other isn&#x27;t.  But overall I&#x27;m extremely happy with my case</li>
            <li> I was looking for a makeup case that was a little bigger than the the cases I had found online. The Shany case was a perfect size.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item is just as advertised. This is just what I was looking for. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because it didn&#x27;t have a mirror. That would have made this case the ultimate perfect. It does come with a shoulder strap and a set of keys for locking.</li>
            <li> This is a bit larger than I expected but I am not complaining.  I finally have something to keep all of my makeup and cleansers in so they are semi organized.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really organize things it all gets piled  in the bottom , only small things fit up top can&#x27;t even fit brushes.</li>
            <li> Fast service from vendor and the case totally met my expectations. Has loads of compartments to store makeup and I highly recommend it. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> the case is bigger than I was thinking.  I first was shocked how big it is and I thought I might sent it back.  It does not fit on my dresser.  But to big is better than to small.  It works for me and my make up is organized.</li>
    </ol>
