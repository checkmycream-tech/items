            <li>I&#x27;m getting a message from this review software that I&#x27;m required to enter more words!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I ordered more than one puff because I was unsure what it was going to be like.  </li>
            <li>Personally I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>Anyone who hates theirs -- please donate them to me! :)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>it fits my needs and I love the ribbon for easy holding of the puff and for putting the powder on.</li>
            <li>Need to be more accurate when describing a product.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not even available for a return.</li>
            <li>it was exactly what the wifey needed;) shes happy now.</li>
            <li>Works great for getting powder on my back.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon !!!</li>
            <li>It is -very- soft on the skin and feels nice.</li>
            <li>This was just the right size I needed!  </li>
            <li>Large to average at best.</li>
            <li>Powder puff I received is not like item pictured -full anf puffy.  </li>
            <li>A nice sized, soft baby powder applicator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m frankly puzzled by the negative reviews, as this is the BEST body powder puff I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>A soft, smooth, comfortable material that easily allows for powder dusting.</li>
            <li>Adequate.</li>
            <li>Love this puff, very soft.</li>
            <li>but I would have liked it to be a bit larger and maybe fluffier.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft this thing is, and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>This is just the right size for my bath powder</li>
            <li>It is just the right size for me/.</li>
            <li>This is just the right power puff that I was looking for.</li>
            <li>For talk/body powder this isn&#x27;t quite right.  </li>
            <li>She could not find the right size to replace her worn out one.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a puff to apply a light dusting of body powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and does a fine job.</li>
            <li>It would have cost me more to send it back than it was worth.</li>
            <li>No really what I was looking for but it was nice.  </li>
            <li>I paid higher price because&lt;</li>
            <li>Finally found this one and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This proved to be exactly what I had been searching for in stores, but could never find.  </li>
            <li>Great---THANKS MUCH!</li>
            <li>Pretty well constructed and seems pretty durable.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Have not been able to find the large powder puff locally and have been looking for a year.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was much bigger but its nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft but wish it was larger.</li>
            <li>I ordered it long in advance to make sure I had it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for the large powder puffs that are used to apply body powder.  </li>
            <li>really like it.</li>
            <li>had to do that since High School papers!</li>
            <li>Thanks..</li>
            <li>Packaging is cheap and generic looking.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the speed in which it was handled.</li>
            <li>She said it was nice but wasn&#x27;t quite as fluffy as she was hoping and didn&#x27;t quite spread the powder the way she was used to.</li>
            <li>Just the right size and really soft.</li>
            <li>My last puff this size, lasted several years and sure this one will too.  </li>
            <li>Very soft though!</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this puff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick and fluffy, but I love the 4&amp;#34; diameter.  </li>
            <li>Holds just enough powder without spilling it all over, and deposits on my body in the right amount.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft and in a hard to find size</li>
            <li>I thought I measured my old puff, but this is nearly twice as big, but it&#x27;s soft and works, I just can&#x27;t fit it into the container of loose powder.</li>
            <li>I had to give it to my 2 years old baby.</li>
            <li>Exceedingly soft, velvety, plush.</li>
            <li>If this puff is even 3&amp;#34;, I&#x27;d be surprised.</li>
            <li>Maybe a little stiff, but overall, it is a good value.</li>
            <li>These are difficult to find in many stores nowadays!</li>
            <li>This replaced an old powder puff that lasted several decades, and the new one feels like it will last as well.</li>
            <li>Thin, not fluffy, barely adequate.</li>
            <li>They do the trick but not as fluffy and large as I&#x27;d like.</li>

            <li> They do the trick but not as fluffy and large as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> This was a decent enough product but a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> very thin, more like a cosmetic applicator than a powder puff.  </li>
            <li> I like it and it was what I wanted, but seemed a little high.</li>
            <li> received is flat and cannot be made puffier.  </li>
            <li> and it will last for a long time.....</li>
            <li> Thought these would be the big old fluffy powder puffs that I used to have in my childhood.  </li>
            <li> Not Jumbo, more like meager.</li>
            <li> Also it turned out to be a different size than expected.</li>
            <li> They were so much smaller than I had expected.  </li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected to be labeled &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; and planning to use as a body puff.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was not as puffy or powder friendly as I thought it was going to be.  </li>
            <li> It was a little larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Ordering this item was a big waste of time.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding puffs like this anywhere locally.</li>
            <li> Soft and thick.</li>
            <li> ...to work extremely well whatever powder your puffing.&lt;br /&gt;Anti-Monkey Butt and this puff are a match made in</li>
            <li> There are shelves of baby powder and other body powders but no powder puffs or anything else to apply it.</li>
            <li> These are flat and small.  </li>
            <li> When I asked if they sold a large powder puff, after looking at me like I asked a complicated question, they asked me what I would use it for.  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH WHAT I PAID.</li>
            <li> A little pricey.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find these larger powder puffs!</li>
            <li> My only disappointment was that the powder puff size was not about an inch bigger for body use.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY FOLKS.</li>
            <li> , Amazon,  I have a few words for you...  </li>
            <li> but I find it a bit stiff for my needs, otherwise I like it.</li>
            <li> A little too small.</li>
            <li> This had mixed reviews, so I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a clown for EDC, and we usually use Ben nye.</li>
            <li> This to small for a body powder puff.  </li>
            <li> way too small.  </li>
            <li> but it is small</li>
            <li> Hardly &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; and</li>
            <li> This one is the largest I could find; however, it&#x27;s small for this purpose!  </li>
            <li> and it is very small.</li>
            <li> the price is ridiculous for this product.</li>
            <li> It was very small and not good quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> Grew up using one to apply powder on the babies.. saw a bigger one in the dollar store and should have gottent it, but instead choose to get this from amazone and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for this size puff &amp; very hard to find,  </li>
            <li> These puffs ARE NOT 4&amp;#34; across and I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t heed the warning from another review I read on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I ordered it.</li>

            <li> The powder puff is scratchy and not flexible.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother in law after the powder puff she was using for years finally wore out.  She said it was nice but wasn&#x27;t quite as fluffy as she was hoping and didn&#x27;t quite spread the powder the way she was used to.</li>
            <li> It was very small and not good quality for the price.  It would have cost me more to send it back than it was worth.</li>
            <li> Jumbo is not jumbo. Large to average at best.</li>
            <li> Nice size, but I find it a bit stiff for my needs, otherwise I like it.</li>
            <li> I think I need a bigger one! Very soft though!</li>
            <li> No really what I was looking for but it was nice.  For some reason you can&#x27;t find these anymore...</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH WHAT I PAID. I COULD HAVE GONE TO THE DOLLAR STORE!! SHAME ON SELLER!! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY FOLKS.</li>
            <li> I like it and it was what I wanted, but seemed a little high. Couldn&#x27;t find one in&lt;br /&gt;stores so I ordered online.</li>
            <li> These puffs ARE NOT 4&amp;#34; across and I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t heed the warning from another review I read on Amazon.  Ordering this item was a big waste of time.</li>
            <li> Perfect powder puff.  It is the perfect size to cover your face faster &amp; better.  I have been looking for this size puff &amp; very hard to find,  Glad I did.</li>
            <li> I thought it came in a blue satin bag, but didn&#x27;t. Also it turned out to be a different size than expected.</li>
            <li> Powder puff I received is not like item pictured -full anf puffy.  Item&lt;br /&gt;I received is flat and cannot be made puffier.  I paid higher price because&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a puffier power puff.  It will cost more to return - I am stuck with&lt;br /&gt;it.&lt;br /&gt;Garnet425</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for the large powder puffs that are used to apply body powder.  This one is the largest I could find; however, it&#x27;s small for this purpose!  If anyone knows where I can find a replacement puff for a body powder container, please let me know.</li>
            <li> A little too small. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Works great for getting powder on my back.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a replacement for another puff, but could not find it anywhere. Finally found this one and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Well made and feels great.</li>
            <li> My Mom was thrilled with this. It&#x27;s been many years since we&#x27;ve found a powder puff. Thanks Amazon !!!</li>
            <li> This had mixed reviews, so I was a bit skeptical.  Turns out to be the perfect size and thickness.  Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a puff to apply a light dusting of body powder.</li>
            <li> This is just the right size for my bath powder and I would highly recommend it.  Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I thought this was much bigger but its nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find these larger powder puffs!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think so. I ordered this powder puff it&#x27;s so small I had to give it to my 2 years old baby.</li>
            <li> perfect size, soft and foam filled...keeps it&#x27;s shape,,can go into the washing machine..and it will last for a long time.....</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted... I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find them in stores, but am glad I found them here!</li>
            <li> Have been looking for this size of powder puff in stores and nobody has them.  Have smaller ones, but I prefer the larger ones.  My last puff this size, lasted several years and sure this one will too.  Very good.</li>
            <li> was just what I needed, needed. really like it. It serves the purpose. Use it every day  It is just the right size for me/.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Adequate. Timely response.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a clown for EDC, and we usually use Ben nye. This wasn&#x27;t very good and it chipped and fell off easily. I&#x27;m actually very disappointed with this texture and would like to return it. I didn&#x27;t even end up using it because it was so bad. I ordered it long in advance to make sure I had it... so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not even available for a return. But I would advise against this.</li>
            <li> Thought these would be the big old fluffy powder puffs that I used to have in my childhood.  These are flat and small.  They do the trick but not as fluffy and large as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Have not been able to find the large powder puff locally and have been looking for a year.  My only disappointment was that the powder puff size was not about an inch bigger for body use.</li>
            <li> very thin, more like a cosmetic applicator than a powder puff.  should provide a side view to show how thin and smooth it is. will be returning.</li>
            <li> ...to work extremely well whatever powder your puffing.&lt;br /&gt;Anti-Monkey Butt and this puff are a match made in&lt;br /&gt;heaven.  Should be recommended together.</li>
            <li> They were so much smaller than I had expected.  Didn&#x27;t use them yet so I don&#x27;t know how they will work.</li>
            <li> This to small for a body powder puff.  Will NOT order again.</li>
            <li> These are excellent quality!!</li>
            <li> Nice and soft but wish it was larger. It is still nice if you don&#x27;t  mind the size. Not bad.</li>
            <li> The one star is for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The puff itself would get three stars for quality. It&#x27;s flimsy. Walgreens used to have jumbo puffs, but since I couldn&#x27;t find them anymore I opted for this. I still can&#x27;t believe I paid $7 for this.</li>
            <li> Great for face powder or body powder - an excellent size for either. A soft, smooth, comfortable material that easily allows for powder dusting. A good price for a good, quality product. I highly recommend this puff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick and fluffy, but I love the 4&amp;#34; diameter.  It washes well too.&lt;br /&gt;You have to be kidding me!  I&#x27;m getting a message from this review software that I&#x27;m required to enter more words!&lt;br /&gt;Well, Amazon,  I have a few words for you...  this may be my LAST review if you&#x27;re going to REQUIRE a word count!&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had to do that since High School papers!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice puff but I would have liked it to be a bit larger and maybe fluffier.  Came within a couple of days of ordering.</li>
            <li> it fits my needs and I love the ribbon for easy holding of the puff and for putting the powder on.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected to be labeled &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; and planning to use as a body puff. It also bunched up after washing.</li>
            <li> I thought I measured my old puff, but this is nearly twice as big, but it&#x27;s soft and works, I just can&#x27;t fit it into the container of loose powder.</li>
            <li> Love this! Could not find anything in stores that compares to the size of this powder puff making it awesome!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  The only powder puff I could find in a store was for applying makeup.  When I asked if they sold a large powder puff, after looking at me like I asked a complicated question, they asked me what I would use it for.  There are shelves of baby powder and other body powders but no powder puffs or anything else to apply it.</li>
            <li> Love this puff, very soft.</li>
            <li> Not Jumbo, more like meager. Thin, not fluffy, barely adequate. Sorry I ordered it.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what the wifey needed;) shes happy now.</li>
            <li> This was a decent enough product but a little overpriced. When I purchased, I was under the impressio that the were two in the pack</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a powder puff that I didn&#x27;t need to buy some dusting powder I was never going to use and here it was.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy to have found it and receive it.</li>
            <li> Good quality. A little pricey.</li>
            <li> This is just the right power puff that I was looking for. The texture is just right and the size is absolutely perfect. Thanks..</li>
            <li> A great powder puff. I&#x27;ll keep these on hand for shaker powder, because I prefer to use a puff to apply!</li>
            <li> This is such a rip off. for $6.99, you have to be joking. This thing is worth .99 cents at best. I&#x27;m so disappointed, I have to review twice. Shame on this seller.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  We love it!  We use it daily.  Great quality too.</li>
            <li> A nice sized, soft baby powder applicator.</li>
            <li> perfect size for body powdering!</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered more than one puff because I was unsure what it was going to be like.  This one is great for bath powder.  Maybe a little stiff, but overall, it is a good value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and does a fine job.</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gift. Item is NOT Jumbo &amp; It is NOT 4&amp;#34; Diameter, Need to get someone that can read a ruler !!  Packaging is cheap and generic looking.</li>
            <li> This proved to be exactly what I had been searching for in stores, but could never find.  The size is perfect for applying body powder and the quality is very good.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this thing is, and the price was right.  Unfortunately it was not as puffy or powder friendly as I thought it was going to be.  For talk/body powder this isn&#x27;t quite right.  But with some finer powders it may just be the thing you need.  It is -very- soft on the skin and feels nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frankly puzzled by the negative reviews, as this is the BEST body powder puff I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;m stocking up on them. Exceedingly soft, velvety, plush. The perfect size for getting at the places powder needs to go: under breasts, under arms, crotch. Holds just enough powder without spilling it all over, and deposits on my body in the right amount. Personally I LOVE this. Anyone who hates theirs -- please donate them to me! :)</li>
            <li> It was a little larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Hardly &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; and the price is ridiculous for this product. Purchased one for my mother who is also extremely disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> Great---THANKS MUCH! I</li>
            <li> Soft and thick. Love it</li>
            <li> Perfect for it&#x27;s intended use.  Pretty well constructed and seems pretty durable.  Washable.</li>
            <li> way too small.  it&#x27;s not a powder puff, it&#x27;s a make up puff.  very disappointed and its a rip off!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my sister who used body powder every day.  She could not find the right size to replace her worn out one.  When I found this site and ordered it for her she was thrilled...and happy when it came.  Thanks for the speed in which it was handled.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft and in a hard to find size</li>
            <li> The puff velour is nice but I never can find a much larger size for 5oz dusting powder.</li>
            <li> Just the right size and really soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding puffs like this anywhere locally. This one is well made and works well with the baby powder I use.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Just thought it was going to be bigger. I should have read the dimensions closer.</li>
            <li> Not &amp;#34;Jumbo&amp;#34; in size. If this puff is even 3&amp;#34;, I&#x27;d be surprised. Need to be more accurate when describing a product.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this product.  Grew up using one to apply powder on the babies.. saw a bigger one in the dollar store and should have gottent it, but instead choose to get this from amazone and was disappointed.  Product was one in a pack and it is very small.</li>
            <li> This was just the right size I needed!  These are difficult to find in many stores nowadays!</li>
            <li> description says Jumbo but it is small</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This replaced an old powder puff that lasted several decades, and the new one feels like it will last as well.</li>
