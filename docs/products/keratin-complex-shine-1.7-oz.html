            <li>I love the smell too, not too strong.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>But for the back, it is great.</li>
            <li>I thought it would make my hair silky smooth, but not until I bought the suave keratin shampoo</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and was excited to buy it on here.  </li>
            <li>Best on thick hair.</li>

            <li>Definitely recommend for a good hair day.</li>

            <li>Better than Chi, I cannot live without this oil!  </li>
            <li>and it was fading quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick ships x</li>
            <li>If you like to straighten your hair, I highly highly recommend you add this to your hair before straightening; it makes the hair so pretty, smooth, and shiny :)</li>
            <li>Coppola Keratin Complex leaves your hair with incredible shine.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but this product is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>not just make me feel warm and fuzzy because there is a specific word on the bottle.</li>
            <li>The Keratin Complex Shine has a light pleasant fragrance</li>
            <li>It gets my hair super straights and very shiny.  </li>
            <li>This product eliminates any appearance of flyways which is very unusual with chemically straightened hair.&lt;br /&gt;She wears her hair up in a ponytail.</li>
            <li>Overall, her hair appears healthier then before for sure.</li>
            <li>I have to take off the entire top of the container to get the product.  </li>
            <li>It is the only keratin product I have tried so far that works this well, and I have bought a ton TON of hair products, since I first started doing my own hair years ago.</li>
            <li>It takes my natural spiral curls &amp; pulls them out with a blow dryer on a cool setting, I don&#x27;t even need heat anymore.  </li>
            <li>My hair is as dry as they come and this makes it look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li>And I never thought my dry, course hair could shine, but it does now :)</li>
            <li>what I did notice is that it produces static electricity after you blow the hair dry.  </li>
            <li>And will more then likely end your search from ever needing to find a new heat product.</li>
            <li>It came out super straight, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li>If you put in too much it will be greasy looking.   </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t go with out this stuff.</li>
            <li>thanks...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use a lot of it or your hair will be very oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Her hair has gotten longer since she started using the whole system.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite keratin product, and I bought many different brands because I am African American with hair that is very curly, frizzy, and kinks.</li>
            <li>Works better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I recently had a Global Keratin treatment that I love.  </li>
            <li>What initially drew me to this product was it was a product off of a Keratin treatment which made me feel it would be safe to use with the Global Keratin that I had done.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way for giving you glossy shiny hair; it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy and it smells good too.  </li>
            <li>This really does make a difference if you apply directly after towel drying.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any real improvement in my hair with this product as far as shine or manageability.  </li>
            <li>Overall while it may cost a little more then what you might want to spend, a little it will go a long way and give you results that will make you happy</li>
            <li>Soft and shiny hair!</li>
            <li>I tried this product on my medium length, color treated, coarse, dry hair and this product was nothing but a huge dissapointment.</li>
            <li>and my hair is far from oily.  </li>
            <li>Spray into your hair directly.  </li>
            <li>pump is not enough and two is too much....</li>
            <li>My sister purchased this as so far no complaints</li>
            <li>My mom is Egyptian with very wavy hair in front and canopy but with kinky curls in the back bottom of her head.</li>
            <li>She has to trim her hair frequently.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and soft, just like it says it will, and it really does protect my hair from the heat of the blow drying and flat ironing.  </li>
            <li>I used the second option because I was able to control where I need a little more and where I want a little less.</li>
            <li>I live in the tropics where the humidity is unbridled and only punctuated by bouts of rain (hurricanes etc.)  </li>
            <li>This makes my curls so tame it is wonderful, even when my hair desperately needs a perm, this product helps hide it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy like a silicone product (ie Frizz Ease) and really only takes drops.</li>
            <li>It came without a dispenser straw, and I have to open it completely instead of pumping it.</li>
            <li>I have a brazilian blowout that is only 8 weeks old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Keratin Complex &amp;#34;Motion Potion&amp;#34; or something like that in the past and loved it.  </li>
            <li>In effort to make my money stretch as far as it can go and make the treatment last the salon suggested that I use the Global Keratin line.  </li>

            <li> So much shine power in such a small amount...LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I have coarse, grey hair, and it get&#x27;s frizzy after each washing (and sometimes in between).  </li>
            <li> To my dismay they do not have a heat product which with using a flat iron is a must.  </li>
            <li> It protects my hair well as allows my flat iron to slide through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my ends when I am just flat ironing my hair between shampoos.</li>
            <li> And i only use a litte amount, this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Spray in your hands and work into your hair starting in the mid shaft and down to the ends.   </li>
            <li> and I only used a tiny amount, half what I use of the infusion.  </li>
            <li> I do not see any shine difference or blow dry</li>
            <li> I use the product after i blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> When I flat iron my hair with this it doesn&#x27;t feel fried like it would with other products AND when it rains I don&#x27;t have to dash for cover.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t flat iron you can use it with a curling iron or even put into your hair before you use a dryer and will cut down on frizz and add shine.  </li>
            <li> Caution: when applying it only takes a little.  </li>
            <li> When shopping for anything with Keratin you have to be careful because that has become a buzz word that everyone likes to use</li>
            <li> This is not what I would have expected from Coppola.  </li>
            <li> However, I just opened the package and the pump does not work because the product is missing the middle tube piece for the serum to be pumped with...</li>
            <li> I use many of their products and this is the absolute worst.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops on my wet hair and then blow dry.   </li>
            <li> You truly only need a small drop to do the job.  </li>
            <li> is my 3rd coppola product that i have tried, all have been a dissapointment, no more for me</li>
            <li> i got a small box with something blue looks like a wax.</li>
            <li> Comparing it to a previous product, BioSilk, it does not provide the shine I expected.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last me a year at least.  </li>
            <li> When I used it on the front, it gave my hair a wet, heavy look, which I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> all the other orphans have been trashed!</li>
            <li> Then maybe a drop on dry hair to add shine or tame a little frizz on day two or three.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so one or two pumps will usually suffice.</li>
            <li> In addition, half the liquid spilled into a travel bag because the bottle does not seal well.</li>
            <li> not a good product, big waste of money</li>
            <li> I use this product, just a little, on my hair before blow drying.  </li>
            <li> A little heavy than I would like.  </li>
            <li> I also had trouble with the container.</li>
            <li> Then I used just a quarter size on my hair and blow dried it.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, it was very expensive.</li>
            <li> Will reorder when gone but takes very little of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it</li>
            <li> I applied a very small amount  on towel dried hair, followed by blowdrying...smooth, shine, silky...</li>
            <li> So after doing some research I decided to try Coppola Keratin Complex Shine.  </li>
            <li> Ill sometimes use it on the ends of my hair so it looks healthier</li>
            <li> ...very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Obsessed with it!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Works fine.  A little heavy than I would like.  Use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Coppola Keratin Complex leaves your hair with incredible shine. A little goes a long way, so one or two pumps will usually suffice. Non-greasy, Great smell, light texture. Best on thick hair. Can make thin/fine hair appear greasy.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops on my wet hair and then blow dry.   Then maybe a drop on dry hair to add shine or tame a little frizz on day two or three.  It only takes a drop. This bottle will last me a year at least.  It&#x27;s not heavy like a silicone product (ie Frizz Ease) and really only takes drops.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS.  I have coarse, grey hair, and it get&#x27;s frizzy after each washing (and sometimes in between).  This really does make a difference if you apply directly after towel drying.  I have relatively short hair, so I just use 1 squirt.  If I use more, my hair looks a bit oily...and my hair is far from oily.  It just seems to relax the hair.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous other&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; products, but nothing works the way this product does, it just makes your hair shiney.</li>
            <li> I recently had a Global Keratin treatment that I love.  In effort to make my money stretch as far as it can go and make the treatment last the salon suggested that I use the Global Keratin line.  To my dismay they do not have a heat product which with using a flat iron is a must.  So after doing some research I decided to try Coppola Keratin Complex Shine.  What initially drew me to this product was it was a product off of a Keratin treatment which made me feel it would be safe to use with the Global Keratin that I had done.  When shopping for anything with Keratin you have to be careful because that has become a buzz word that everyone likes to use so I wanted to make sure that what I am buying really is going to do something for me not just make me feel warm and fuzzy because there is a specific word on the bottle. This product does just that.  It protects my hair well as allows my flat iron to slide through my hair.  There are several ways you can apply it.  1. Spray into your hair directly.  2. Spray in your hands and work into your hair starting in the mid shaft and down to the ends.   Caution: when applying it only takes a little.  If you put in too much it will be greasy looking.   I used the second option because I was able to control where I need a little more and where I want a little less. If you don&#x27;t flat iron you can use it with a curling iron or even put into your hair before you use a dryer and will cut down on frizz and add shine.  It has a wonderful smell that also is not over powering.  Overall while it may cost a little more then what you might want to spend, a little it will go a long way and give you results that will make you happy you tried it. And will more then likely end your search from ever needing to find a new heat product.</li>
            <li> Gives a beautiful shine to your hair without a build up. I love it and recommend it for all hair types.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t go with out this stuff. My hair is as dry as they come and this makes it look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li> Better than Chi, I cannot live without this oil!  It takes my natural spiral curls &amp; pulls them out with a blow dryer on a cool setting, I don&#x27;t even need heat anymore.  And I never thought my dry, course hair could shine, but it does now :)</li>
            <li> I was initially quite hesitant to purchase this product, thinking it would join the collection of products in my vanity that claimed to provide shine but  were ultimately too watery or too oily or too odorous.  The Keratin Complex Shine has a light pleasant fragrance, that does not announce your presence.  One precaution - don&#x27;t over do it! You truly only need a small drop to do the job.  I applied a very small amount  on towel dried hair, followed by blowdrying...smooth, shine, silky...all the other orphans have been trashed!</li>
            <li> Love the shine and feel of this infusion hair balm.  It is worth every penny!  Definitely recommend for a good hair day.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for giving you glossy shiny hair; it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy and it smells good too.  I am African American with unrelaxed 3c curly hair.</li>
            <li> Comparing it to a previous product, BioSilk, it does not provide the shine I expected. I also had trouble with the container. It came without a dispenser straw, and I have to open it completely instead of pumping it. In addition, half the liquid spilled into a travel bag because the bottle does not seal well.</li>
            <li> I have a brazilian blowout that is only 8 weeks old. I tried this product on my medium length, color treated, coarse, dry hair and this product was nothing but a huge dissapointment. It doesnt feel good in your hair at all, i only used one pump and then tried two.&lt;br /&gt;One pump is not enough and two is too much....not a good product, big waste of money and i have tried a lot of serums, the best so far i have tried is the kenra platinum series serum...pricier but much better. I do not see any shine difference or blow dry difference.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd coppola product that i have tried, all have been a dissapointment, no more for me thanks...</li>
            <li> I love the Coppola line.  I use this product, just a little, on my hair before blow drying.  It makes my hair shiny and soft, just like it says it will, and it really does protect my hair from the heat of the blow drying and flat ironing.  I also use it on my ends when I am just flat ironing my hair between shampoos.</li>
            <li> Love this  product for my hair.  I have bi-racial hair and it keeps it shiny.  I use the thermoshine as well to protect my ends.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but this product is fabulous.  I washed my hair which I had keratin in over 4 months ago and it was fading quickly.  Then I used just a quarter size on my hair and blow dried it.  It came out super straight, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li> I use the product after i blow dry my hair. It gives it the shiny look all day. And i only use a litte amount, this goes a long way. For me, it&#x27;s best used on the back of my hair. When I used it on the front, it gave my hair a wet, heavy look, which I didn&#x27;t like. But for the back, it is great. I love the smell too, not too strong.</li>
            <li> i got a small box with something blue looks like a wax.I got a different product than what it shows.</li>
            <li> This is not what I would have expected from Coppola.  This leaves my hair greasy, in fact I had to wash my hair again to get it out and I only used a tiny amount, half what I use of the infusion.  I use many of their products and this is the absolute worst.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product! Soft and shiny hair! Will reorder when gone but takes very little of this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use a lot of it or your hair will be very oily feeling. I would just use the Keratin Repair therapy...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and was excited to buy it on here.  However, I just opened the package and the pump does not work because the product is missing the middle tube piece for the serum to be pumped with...now I have to break the pump off to get the product out to use...very disappointing.  Box was not damaged.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite keratin product, and I bought many different brands because I am African American with hair that is very curly, frizzy, and kinks. This makes my curls so tame it is wonderful, even when my hair desperately needs a perm, this product helps hide it. It is the only keratin product I have tried so far that works this well, and I have bought a ton TON of hair products, since I first started doing my own hair years ago. When I first started using this product, it was very expensive. I paid over $50 for it, close to $60. I have been using this product for years and intend to continue using it. If you like to straighten your hair, I highly highly recommend you add this to your hair before straightening; it makes the hair so pretty, smooth, and shiny :)</li>
            <li> Works better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> My sister purchased this as so far no complaints the on it at all, looks like it was a good buy</li>
            <li> Item is as described. Quick ships x x x x x x x x x x x x x x</li>
            <li> Ill sometimes use it on the ends of my hair so it looks healthier but I&#x27;ll never use it on my roots again. It looks greasy and my fly aways still stick up!</li>
            <li> So/so purchase.  I thought it would make my hair silky smooth, but not until I bought the suave keratin shampoo did it work.  I would suggest the buyer save there money.</li>
            <li> My mom loves and swears about Keratin. Her hair has gotten longer since she started using the whole system. My mom is Egyptian with very wavy hair in front and canopy but with kinky curls in the back bottom of her head. This product eliminates any appearance of flyways which is very unusual with chemically straightened hair.&lt;br /&gt;She wears her hair up in a ponytail. The product gives her hair shine and a polished appearance.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason i give it 4 stars instead of five is because the system increases split ends. She has to trim her hair frequently. Overall, her hair appears healthier then before for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product several times and found that there is no pump attached.  I have to take off the entire top of the container to get the product.  Definitely has a flaw in the packaging.  The keratin works great on my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any real improvement in my hair with this product as far as shine or manageability.  what I did notice is that it produces static electricity after you blow the hair dry.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what the drugstore serums say on the packaging.  If you want an excellent product you have to pay for it (more often than not).  This serum fights the frizz exceptionally well.  I live in the tropics where the humidity is unbridled and only punctuated by bouts of rain (hurricanes etc.)  When I flat iron my hair with this it doesn&#x27;t feel fried like it would with other products AND when it rains I don&#x27;t have to dash for cover.  It gets my hair super straights and very shiny.  I have been using this shine serum for about three years now.  Obsessed with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Keratin Complex &amp;#34;Motion Potion&amp;#34; or something like that in the past and loved it.  I though this would be similiar, but it made my hair look and feel oily and caused a itchy red scalp.  I&#x27;m not sure it it&#x27;s the product itself or the supplier?</li>
            <li> So much shine power in such a small amount...LOVE IT</li>
