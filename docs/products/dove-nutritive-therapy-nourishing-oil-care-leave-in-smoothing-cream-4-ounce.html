            <li>I love Dove products, inexpensive, but effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many serums, oils, creams, sprays you name it....</li>
            <li>I love dove products.</li>
            <li>Now they look organized and much better, and the leave-on conditioner is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>Product is ok, won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I just love this.</li>
            <li>Will have to fall in love with another product.  </li>
            <li>Glad that I found it here.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly with damp hair.  </li>
            <li>Once we got out of the beach showers a friend lent us this magic potion called &amp;#34;Dove leave in smoothing cream&amp;#34; and</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this stuff that I was able to try before I bought a bottle.  </li>
            <li>the static is still there.  </li>
            <li>, fly-away static ends without leaving my hair crunchy.  </li>
            <li>Was so glad to find this since it seems to be phasing out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d argue that it works better than the salon stuff.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to get it at the grocery store, but they stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Then I comb it all through with a very wide-toothed comb (Conair makes a great one).</li>
            <li>love this stuff cant find it in stores</li>
            <li>so glad i looked online</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>I have not been able to to find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>So glad to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>the scent is light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I am very grateful for another good, effective shampoo and conditioner from Dove.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product 2 years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>I love the leave-in conditioner that helps me style my hair easily.</li>
            <li>It shines, smells good, reasonably priced, not sticky on the hair, bascially I would purchase this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of all good reviews I read about it, and my good experience of Dove&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent, is easy to apply, and makes my hair static free without feeling like it is full of product.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely the best for good results when I blow dry.</li>
            <li>(I apply it to damp hair) and leaves my hair silky smooth and shining.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>when this was available in the stores it was about 5.00.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products that are designed to smooth frizziness, but they make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth and feel healthier.</li>
            <li>No longer available in the stores.</li>
            <li>My girls have straight and curly hair and it works on both equally effective.</li>
            <li>Fine product, use frequently and very glad to find on Amazon</li>
            <li>Vive Pro Smooth Gloss Anti-Frizz Cream,\\&quot; which worked ok, but has a very strong smell and made my hair feel kind of heavy.</li>
            <li>Love it so much</li>
            <li>Have tried many many different products, this leave</li>
            <li>My product was delivered quickly too.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Since then I have tried many many other lines by brands like Pantene, Garnier, Nueutrogena, Fekkai and nothing worked as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried several other products, and this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this one and they led me right.</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair, but every winter it turns into a frizzy, staticky nightmare.</li>
            <li>I have longish (about to my shoulder blades) length, fine but (natural) loosely-curled hair.</li>
            <li>Better that similar products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and tangle free</li>
            <li>Great leave-in conditioner for dry, coarse, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>If using to smooth dry hair, I rub it into my palms and just smooth all over my hair.  </li>
            <li>I put a little bit specifically on my ends, then I spread it lightly throughout the rest of my hair, and the static is gone.  </li>
            <li>It gives my hair sheen &amp; lets it lay flat &amp; looks really healthy.  </li>
            <li>Now I have NORMAL HAIR!!</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair soft, smells great, tames the frizz and split ends and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I have very dry ends, and I also have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Sure hope it will be thru you for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My long hair becomes static even in humid weather.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, if I want to curl it, it goes limp on me and if I want it straight, especially in high humidity, it will poof up on me in a very unflattering style.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Using this often stops either from happening as often and I&#x27;m able to just put this on my natural hair and wear it alone with no other product.</li>
            <li>This product has made my hair super soft and shiny since I started using it.</li>
            <li>No, I&#x27;ll carry on looking for something else - because there&#x27;s certainly plenty to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent product.</li>
            <li>and they also smell really great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>do bleach my hair, which results in split ends and a very course feeling, this conditioner brings softness and sheen to my otherwise lifeless</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s partly straight and partly wavy.</li>
            <li>I find that using the quarter size amount is to much for my mid-back length hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>A dollar sized dollop of this  one blends in very well</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>and when it&#x27;s straightened, it gets very oily.</li>
            <li>It really gets rid of the frizz in my curly hair.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and I would definitely recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I am switching to DOVE because it is much cheaper and works well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Dove</li>
            <li>Finally something that makes my lifeless hair come to life and feel smooth again.</li>
            <li>These arrived a few days ago and I am truly loving them.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>For fine, dry hair, it is a must for me.</li>
            <li>Nutritive Nourishing Oil Care gave me the right amount of moisture and conditioning without feeling heavy, filmy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s fine particles of almond and mineral oil in it and</li>
            <li>is my all-time favorite, but it&#x27;s much more expensive).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have thick coarse hair that turns out very nice with a smoothing cream.</li>
            <li>I normally purchased this she it was sold everywhere.</li>
            <li>, I needed just a little more to keep my hair from going wild on me.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll look for a new product.</li>
            <li>Does not weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li>It just feels like normal soft hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps hair smooth without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>I found it for a good price, and that should last a long time since you use very little</li>
            <li>Makes hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy with a lot of gray (I don&#x27;t color).</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft but never greasy  can always find it on anazon</li>
            <li>I live in the south, where the humidity is often high, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that calms my fine, curly hair without messing up the level of hydration in my hair and scalp - other products</li>
            <li>Having your hair a bit wet still helps to dilute this conditioner and (for me, anyway) leave just the right amount on the strands.</li>
            <li>I have really think, long hair</li>
            <li>Hot oil treatments really weigh my hair down, for several washings.  </li>
            <li>specially  it doesn&#x27;t tame the frizz(as</li>
            <li>My hair is very frizzy when I blow dry it with this Dove product</li>
            <li>Because I have fine hair, I can only use a little of this stuff, or it weighs it down, but a little is all I need to control the static.  </li>
            <li>have very fine hair that tends to get dry and frizzy and heavy products weigh my hair down or make it look greasy (especially Fekkai products) and lighter ones don&#x27;t provide sufficient hydration.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be me and the way I was applying it, but I tried several different amounts and applied both wet and dry and evenly dispersed and thoroughly rubbed the product into the lower half of my hair where it is most damaged, and each time yielded the same effect.</li>
            <li>I have super frizzy, wavy, thick, hair.  </li>
            <li>some to thick, to light, some left my hair dry, or</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have very straight hair, but every winter it turns into a frizzy, staticky nightmare.</li>
            <li> I have longish (about to my shoulder blades) length, fine but (natural) loosely-curled hair.</li>
            <li> Better that similar products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and tangle free</li>
            <li> Great leave-in conditioner for dry, coarse, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> If using to smooth dry hair, I rub it into my palms and just smooth all over my hair.  </li>
            <li> I put a little bit specifically on my ends, then I spread it lightly throughout the rest of my hair, and the static is gone.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair sheen &amp; lets it lay flat &amp; looks really healthy.  </li>
            <li> Now I have NORMAL HAIR!!</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair soft, smells great, tames the frizz and split ends and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very dry ends, and I also have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Sure hope it will be thru you for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My long hair becomes static even in humid weather.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own, if I want to curl it, it goes limp on me and if I want it straight, especially in high humidity, it will poof up on me in a very unflattering style.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Using this often stops either from happening as often and I&#x27;m able to just put this on my natural hair and wear it alone with no other product.</li>
            <li> This product has made my hair super soft and shiny since I started using it.</li>
            <li> No, I&#x27;ll carry on looking for something else - because there&#x27;s certainly plenty to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent product.</li>
            <li> and they also smell really great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> do bleach my hair, which results in split ends and a very course feeling, this conditioner brings softness and sheen to my otherwise lifeless</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s partly straight and partly wavy.</li>
            <li> I find that using the quarter size amount is to much for my mid-back length hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> A dollar sized dollop of this  one blends in very well</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> and when it&#x27;s straightened, it gets very oily.</li>
            <li> It really gets rid of the frizz in my curly hair.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and I would definitely recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am switching to DOVE because it is much cheaper and works well.</li>
            <li> Thanks Dove</li>
            <li> Finally something that makes my lifeless hair come to life and feel smooth again.</li>
            <li> These arrived a few days ago and I am truly loving them.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> For fine, dry hair, it is a must for me.</li>
            <li> Nutritive Nourishing Oil Care gave me the right amount of moisture and conditioning without feeling heavy, filmy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s fine particles of almond and mineral oil in it and</li>
            <li> is my all-time favorite, but it&#x27;s much more expensive).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have thick coarse hair that turns out very nice with a smoothing cream.</li>
            <li> I normally purchased this she it was sold everywhere.</li>
            <li> , I needed just a little more to keep my hair from going wild on me.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll look for a new product.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li> It just feels like normal soft hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps hair smooth without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> I found it for a good price, and that should last a long time since you use very little</li>
            <li> Makes hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy with a lot of gray (I don&#x27;t color).</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft but never greasy  can always find it on anazon</li>
            <li> I live in the south, where the humidity is often high, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that calms my fine, curly hair without messing up the level of hydration in my hair and scalp - other products</li>
            <li> Having your hair a bit wet still helps to dilute this conditioner and (for me, anyway) leave just the right amount on the strands.</li>
            <li> I have really think, long hair</li>
            <li> Hot oil treatments really weigh my hair down, for several washings.  </li>
            <li> specially  it doesn&#x27;t tame the frizz(as</li>
            <li> My hair is very frizzy when I blow dry it with this Dove product</li>
            <li> Because I have fine hair, I can only use a little of this stuff, or it weighs it down, but a little is all I need to control the static.  </li>
            <li> have very fine hair that tends to get dry and frizzy and heavy products weigh my hair down or make it look greasy (especially Fekkai products) and lighter ones don&#x27;t provide sufficient hydration.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be me and the way I was applying it, but I tried several different amounts and applied both wet and dry and evenly dispersed and thoroughly rubbed the product into the lower half of my hair where it is most damaged, and each time yielded the same effect.</li>
            <li> I have super frizzy, wavy, thick, hair.  </li>
            <li> some to thick, to light, some left my hair dry, or</li>
            <li> It used to take me half an hour to brush her hair on a normal day.</li>
            <li> This product (combined with a spray gel) is the only thing that works to keep my hair frizz-free &amp; holding its definition without looking all greasy or flat.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that smooths the frizz without the grease, and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I have hair that easily tangles, appears dry and is difficult to grow out.</li>
            <li> I would really love to buy this from here but the price is crazy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Dove Intensive Repair shampoo and conditioner for a long time, during the humidity of Summer</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences long term relationship almost had it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually just a styling product that can be used on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never attempted to put this on my hair when it&#x27;s dry...</li>
            <li> It is relatively inexpensive, and since I only need a small amount, it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s curly, it gets very dry</li>
            <li> The instructions say to use a quarter size portion, but I use a little smaller than a dime size.  </li>
            <li> but it was a little to thick n to spread it evenly though my hair, even when wet, i would need to much which would leave my hair greasy</li>
            <li> Comb thru conditioner in shower and while itis so along wet I finger comb thru this dove and leave it</li>
            <li> no thanks .</li>
            <li> Not too wet or oily.</li>
            <li> I am seeing that this product is harder to find, as if it&#x27;s been discontinued by Dove.</li>
            <li> If I want to wear my hair curly, I apply about a quarter-size amount of this product to my hair while wet, scrunching curls as I go.  </li>
            <li> soft, shiny, and no more frizz!</li>
            <li> Help tame wild frizzy hair without weighing it down and feeling limp.</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The other product I had been using was almost $20.</li>
            <li> I put about a dime size of this product in my hand, rub both hands together and then rub that throughout my (still wet) hair, focusing on the lower half of the length and avoiding the roots (where I don&#x27;t need it).</li>
            <li> I naturally have very thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> and now that it is hard to find you want 29.50 for the same 5.00 size bottle.</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly hair that blow dry straight and hate to flat iron.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair 2 times a week and this product moisturizes it but does not make it greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> Gels weigh my hair down, make it crunchy, and</li>
            <li> It actually made it FRIZZIER, fuller, went on thick, and just coated the cuticle with a gross thick layer of product that turned gummy when dried.</li>
            <li> , the cap design is 100% mess</li>
            <li> Pantene reworked a previous-leave in that i used on my long thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would moisturize my hair and that I could use everyday without it weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> only complaint would be that the bottle size is too small and I tend to run out of it in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that it seems like a fairly small bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> i get a halo of little frizzies around my head.  </li>
            <li> A little on the &amp;quot;perfumey&amp;quot; side.</li>
            <li> I moved to Germany and my hair started to feel rough, frizzy, and dull.</li>
            <li> heavy</li>
            <li> I think it would have all the negative results that other reviewers have commented on.</li>
            <li> Minus 3 stars for ridiculous pricing strategy by vendor.</li>
            <li> I just got tired of spending such ridiculous amounts of money on those $20.00+ salon &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> It keeps my curly hair from going crazy, and it keeps my hair soft as well.</li>
            <li> Very few hair care products, even salon grade ones, can do that for me.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding it, so I always order it in bulk.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in store.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be the inexpensive alternative to my usual Moroccan Oil, Argan Oil products, and Fekkai Glossing products that I regularly use for my thick, dry, slightly damaged, and  wavy hair, but it was just awful.</li>
            <li> My daughter has hip length hair and it is THICK, like a tree trunk, or a Disney princess&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy by touch, but did nothing for the texture of my hair except made it greasy and weigh it down without even moisturizing.... horrible.</li>
            <li> I have difficult hair.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment and because I had to buy in the 2 pack, I ended up giving it away.</li>
            <li> So, I read the reviews, figured worst case a few dollars gone.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately,  the company stopped making it!</li>
            <li> Too bad Dove decided to discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Too bad Dove is discontinuing it.  </li>
            <li> However I became disappointed by this one.</li>
            <li> It drives me crazy!  </li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible.  </li>
            <li> It works through the worst rat&#x27;s nests you can imagine.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love using this product after washing my hair everytime. It is effective as a great detangler and keeping hair soft, shiny, and lessens the amount of split ends. This is my miracle hair product, ESP since my haircuts only happen about twice a year.</li>
            <li> These arrived a few days ago and I am truly loving them.&lt;br /&gt;They definitely keep my frizz under control and they also smell really great!&lt;br /&gt;I use just about the recommended amount for my shoulder length hair and what I have noticed is that although sometimes I think it&#x27;s not enough, by the time my hair &amp;#34;air dries&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t tell the difference of where I rubbed or where I didn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s like it totally works itself into the hair!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the cap design is 100% mess free!&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product!</li>
            <li> This works awesome in my daughters hair as a leave in conditioner.  She is mixed.  Have tried many many different products, this leave I is awesome.  Comb thru conditioner in shower and while itis so along wet I finger comb thru this dove and leave it and the curls are amazing.  Great smell.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY! What a disappointment and because I had to buy in the 2 pack, I ended up giving it away. I was hoping this would be the inexpensive alternative to my usual Moroccan Oil, Argan Oil products, and Fekkai Glossing products that I regularly use for my thick, dry, slightly damaged, and  wavy hair, but it was just awful. This is an inferior product and it did not work for my hair at all. It actually made it FRIZZIER, fuller, went on thick, and just coated the cuticle with a gross thick layer of product that turned gummy when dried. I thought it might be me and the way I was applying it, but I tried several different amounts and applied both wet and dry and evenly dispersed and thoroughly rubbed the product into the lower half of my hair where it is most damaged, and each time yielded the same effect. Not good. If I could give it zero stars I would.</li>
            <li> Helps with frizz and it doesn&#x27;t leave a oily residue.</li>
            <li> I love Dove products, inexpensive, but effective.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Dove Intensive Repair shampoo and conditioner for a long time, during the humidity of Summer, I needed just a little more to keep my hair from going wild on me. It has a mind of it&#x27;s own, if I want to curl it, it goes limp on me and if I want it straight, especially in high humidity, it will poof up on me in a very unflattering style.&lt;br /&gt;I do bleach my hair, which results in split ends and a very course feeling, this conditioner brings softness and sheen to my otherwise lifeless hair.&lt;br /&gt;Dove Nutritive Nourishing Oil Care gave me the right amount of moisture and conditioning without feeling heavy, filmy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s fine particles of almond and mineral oil in it and the scent is light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I am very grateful for another good, effective shampoo and conditioner from Dove.</li>
            <li> I have difficult hair. It&#x27;s partly straight and partly wavy. I have hair that easily tangles, appears dry and is difficult to grow out. I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve tried many serums, oils, creams, sprays you name it.... This leaves my hair soft, smells great, tames the frizz and split ends and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy. Also helps detangle it. I love dove products.</li>
            <li> This product separates and looks like it is curdled. White chunks remain in your hair after you apply it. Terrible!</li>
            <li> Help tame wild frizzy hair without weighing it down and feeling limp. Better that similar products I&#x27;ve tried. A bit pricey for the quantity in the bottle, but works well.</li>
            <li> My frizzy hairs have found the treatment. Now they look organized and much better, and the leave-on conditioner is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> This product has made my hair super soft and shiny since I started using it. I find that using the quarter size amount is to much for my mid-back length hair. I use about a nickel size amount and it seems to do great in my hair. I moved to Germany and my hair started to feel rough, frizzy, and dull. This product, along with Mane&amp;Tail Shampoo and TRESemme Thermal Recovery Conditioner, brought my hair back to life.....soft, shiny, and no more frizz! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great leave-in conditioner for dry, coarse, frizzy hair. Complements nicely with the Dove Nutritive Therapy shampoo and conditioner. Smells nice too, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible.  Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy by touch, but did nothing for the texture of my hair except made it greasy and weigh it down without even moisturizing.... horrible.</li>
            <li> Product is ok, won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I first tried this product 2 years ago and loved it. Since then I have tried many many other lines by brands like Pantene, Garnier, Nueutrogena, Fekkai and nothing worked as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair that tends to get dry and frizzy and heavy products weigh my hair down or make it look greasy (especially Fekkai products) and lighter ones don&#x27;t provide sufficient hydration. A dollar sized dollop of this  one blends in very well (I apply it to damp hair) and leaves my hair silky smooth and shining.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that the bottle size is too small and I tend to run out of it in just 2 weeks. Can you make larger sizes so I don&#x27;t have to order so often?</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. All I have to do is wash  my hair, put Dove conditioner in and roll up my hair.  Even if I don&#x27;t roll my hair, it &#x27;s still perfect.  I would highly recommend it to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol P. McNair&lt;br /&gt;c.nair@sbcglobal.net</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works very well.  Too bad Dove decided to discontinue it.</li>
            <li> I just love this. I naturally have very thick, curly hair. When it&#x27;s curly, it gets very dry and when it&#x27;s straightened, it gets very oily. Using this often stops either from happening as often and I&#x27;m able to just put this on my natural hair and wear it alone with no other product.</li>
            <li> I would really love to buy this from here but the price is crazy. when this was available in the stores it was about 5.00. and now that it is hard to find you want 29.50 for the same 5.00 size bottle. no thanks . i&#x27;ll look for a new product.</li>
            <li> Always makes my hair look smooth &amp; amazing, i apply it on damp hair before blow-drying,- plus the fragrance is divine!!</li>
            <li> It really gets rid of the frizz in my curly hair. But Dove has discontinued making it and the people who have remaining tubes are price gouging.</li>
            <li> Fine product, use frequently and very glad to find on Amazon</li>
            <li> Says $14.95 on Amazon search page, then it&#x27;s over $27 on the product page. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that calms my fine, curly hair without messing up the level of hydration in my hair and scalp - other products have either been too greasy or too drying. However, at this price? No, I&#x27;ll carry on looking for something else - because there&#x27;s certainly plenty to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent product. Minus 3 stars for ridiculous pricing strategy by vendor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products that are designed to smooth frizziness, but they make my hair look greasy. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that smooths the frizz without the grease, and lasts all day long. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair, but every winter it turns into a frizzy, staticky nightmare. I tried \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Vive Pro Smooth Gloss Anti-Frizz Cream,\\&quot; which worked ok, but has a very strong smell and made my hair feel kind of heavy. I got a free sample of Dove&#x27;s Nourishing Smoothing Cream and loved it, I decided to switch over to using it instead. It has a light scent, is easy to apply, and makes my hair static free without feeling like it is full of product. It just feels like normal soft hair. Only negative is that it seems like a fairly small bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because it could no longer be found in stores.  Will have to fall in love with another product.  Does not weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li> I normally purchased this she it was sold everywhere. Unfortunately it was taken off the shelves and now I have to pay more. This is the best leave in smoothig cream. It smells fantastic and I would definitely recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Unfortunately,  the company stopped making it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my fine hair. I love the leave-in conditioner that helps me style my hair easily. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all good reviews I read about it, and my good experience of Dove&#x27;s other products. However I became disappointed by this one. It doesn&#x27;t give me any result at all! specially  it doesn&#x27;t tame the frizz(as it claims!).</li>
            <li> Pantene reworked a previous-leave in that i used on my long thick curly hair n i didnt like the results. I have been searching for a replacement for 2 years now. some to thick, to light, some left my hair dry, or greasy one even smelled bad.(sounds like Goldilocks and the Three Bears lol)  Herbal Essences long term relationship almost had it but it was a little to thick n to spread it evenly though my hair, even when wet, i would need to much which would leave my hair greasy n heavy but i was the closest i had until this product. it is the perfect consistency and works great with my hair type. if i hear that this product is being discontinued i will be stocking up. i recommend this to anyone who asks what i use in my hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this anywhere in any stores anymore. Love it so much I ask my husband to search for it online and buy it for me. I have dry, curly hair that blow dry straight and hate to flat iron. It makes my hair smooth and feel healthier. Very few hair care products, even salon grade ones, can do that for me.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! No longer available in the stores. Sure hope it will be thru you for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for years and my local drug stores stopped carrying them. Glad that I found it here. It makes my hair very soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have super frizzy, wavy, thick, hair.  This product (combined with a spray gel) is the only thing that works to keep my hair frizz-free &amp; holding its definition without looking all greasy or flat.  I use it mostly with damp hair.  I have a hard time finding it, so I always order it in bulk.</li>
            <li> My daughter has hip length hair and it is THICK, like a tree trunk, or a Disney princess&#x27; hair. We went to the beach and her braid came undone. Once we got out of the beach showers a friend lent us this magic potion called &amp;#34;Dove leave in smoothing cream&amp;#34; and **BAM** brushing her salty beach stricken hair was like running my fingers through silk strands. It only took FIVE MINUTES to brush her hair. It used to take me half an hour to brush her hair on a normal day. We have NEVER LOOKED BACK!! I have a bottle in my bathroom, her bathroom, my purse, and two under the sink...just in case. I never want to be without this product again!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would moisturize my hair and that I could use everyday without it weighing my hair down. This is it. I wash my hair 2 times a week and this product moisturizes it but does not make it greasy or weighed down. I am happy to find something that looks really nice in my hair and helps it also. I read the reviews on this one and they led me right.</li>
            <li> This product takes all the frizzys out! I use all dove products because they work so well!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and tangle free</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and a great price for 2!</li>
            <li> I have very dry ends, and I also have very fine hair.  My long hair becomes static even in humid weather.  It drives me crazy!  I got a sample of this stuff that I was able to try before I bought a bottle.  I love it!  I put a little bit specifically on my ends, then I spread it lightly throughout the rest of my hair, and the static is gone.  Because I have fine hair, I can only use a little of this stuff, or it weighs it down, but a little is all I need to control the static.  The instructions say to use a quarter size portion, but I use a little smaller than a dime size.  It has a very light scent that smells kind of like citrus.  I have tried several other products, and this is the best I have found. Gels weigh my hair down, make it crunchy, and the static is still there.  Hot oil treatments really weigh my hair down, for several washings.  This stuff washes out well, and eliminates the frizzy, fly-away static ends without leaving my hair crunchy.  I just went and bought a bottle and I will be set for about 6 months.  It is relatively inexpensive, and since I only need a small amount, it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It keeps my curly hair from going crazy, and it keeps my hair soft as well. My hair doesn&#x27;t even feel like I have any product in it. Yet, Dove is inexpensive. The other product I had been using was almost $20. I am switching to DOVE because it is much cheaper and works well.</li>
            <li> I have always had frizzy hair &amp; when its humid i get a halo of little frizzies around my head.  Now I have NORMAL HAIR!! It gives my hair sheen &amp; lets it lay flat &amp; looks really healthy.  It is not greasy or clumpy @ all!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I have found for my hair. Thanks Dove</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Was so glad to find this since it seems to be phasing out.</li>
            <li> have thick coarse hair that turns out very nice with a smoothing cream. I just got tired of spending such ridiculous amounts of money on those $20.00+ salon &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; products. So, I read the reviews, figured worst case a few dollars gone. This stuff is wonderful. I&#x27;d argue that it works better than the salon stuff.</li>
            <li> Mom loves this stuff. Hard to find in store. Great price</li>
            <li> This stuff is good. Makes hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> I have really think, long hair but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend this for frizz, but I do think it works on making my hair softer.</li>
            <li> I have kinky curly hair and my hair loves it. Not too wet or oily. A little on the &amp;quot;perfumey&amp;quot; side.</li>
            <li> I live in the south, where the humidity is often high, especially in the summer. My hair is naturally wavy with a lot of gray (I don&#x27;t color). This product is definitely the best for good results when I blow dry. I used to be able to get it at the grocery store, but they stopped carrying it. It says a lot that I would bother to seek it out online!!</li>
            <li> Finally something that makes my lifeless hair come to life and feel smooth again.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  Too bad Dove is discontinuing it.  A little dab goes a long way.  It keeps hair smooth without weighing it down.  It smells great too.</li>
            <li> No longer being made by the manufacturer. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but I think there is a lot of confusion on how best to use it. The name implies that it can be used instead of a conditioner in the shower...for me anyway, that is definitely not the case. I have longish (about to my shoulder blades) length, fine but (natural) loosely-curled hair. I wanted a product that controlled the frizz yet allowed my curls to retain their shape. This product works for that, but only after I&#x27;ve already used a shampoo and conditioner in the shower that are both rinsed-out. I put about a dime size of this product in my hand, rub both hands together and then rub that throughout my (still wet) hair, focusing on the lower half of the length and avoiding the roots (where I don&#x27;t need it). Then I comb it all through with a very wide-toothed comb (Conair makes a great one). This is the best &#x27;leave-in conditioner&#x27; I&#x27;ve found for the price (&#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; is my all-time favorite, but it&#x27;s much more expensive). I am seeing that this product is harder to find, as if it&#x27;s been discontinued by Dove. I stocked-up on it last time I found it for a good price, and that should last a long time since you use very little and I am alternating with my more expensive stuff. I&#x27;ve never attempted to put this on my hair when it&#x27;s dry...I think it would have all the negative results that other reviewers have commented on. Having your hair a bit wet still helps to dilute this conditioner and (for me, anyway) leave just the right amount on the strands.</li>
            <li> It shines, smells good, reasonably priced, not sticky on the hair, bascially I would purchase this product. Does it come in a bigger bottle?</li>
            <li> love this stuff cant find it in stores so glad i looked online</li>
            <li> For fine, dry hair, it is a must for me.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft but never greasy  can always find it on anazon</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have no idea why the took it of the shelf. My hair is very frizzy when I blow dry it with this Dove product looks like I just left the salon every morning.  My product was delivered quickly too.</li>
            <li> I was using Avon advance techniques smoothing balm but they discontinued and heard this is one of the best alternatives. It was okay but it was too oily. Yes I know it&#x27;s a leave-in conditioner but it shouldn&#x27;t leave your hair so oily.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a detangler and it is truly a miracle. My girls have straight and curly hair and it works on both equally effective. It works through the worst rat&#x27;s nests you can imagine. I have not been able to to find it in stores anymore. So glad to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li> Since this product was called a leave-in smoothing cream, I thought it was essentially a leave-in conditioner.  It&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s actually just a styling product that can be used on wet or dry hair.  That said, it has worked great for me - and I&#x27;ve tried (and been unsatisfied with) just about every aveda and b&amp;b product out there!  If I want to wear my hair curly, I apply about a quarter-size amount of this product to my hair while wet, scrunching curls as I go.  If using to smooth dry hair, I rub it into my palms and just smooth all over my hair.  Works great either way at reducing/preventing frizz and puff.</li>
            <li> Her hair is beautiful when using the product, the ripple occasions he is perfect, sometimes I have to control it because she wants to put every day</li>
