            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume and I have ordered it many times!</li>
            <li>Nice strawberry smell,just love it.</li>
            <li>Product arrived early and in perfect condition</li>
            <li>Seeing her happy makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li>Great deal, worth the search.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that \\&quot;hovering\\&quot; soft-sweet-light quality that makes Fantasy so amazing, and so sexy.</li>

            <li>good price and quick shipment</li>

            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>It smells like magic.</li>
            <li>My fiance is in love with the smell as well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be for sure but fantasy</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not too sure anymore.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing any more perfumes at Amazon again.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume of all time.  </li>
            <li>This is the one I reach for the most.  </li>
            <li>Here you get more for cheeper.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>My bestfriend, her husband, and I all love it.</li>
            <li>and him would love it.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Still, Fantasy is vanilla frosting, from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>However, I think Escada Magnetism is much better.</li>
            <li>My mom had this spray and we shared it because I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I love wearing it</li>
            <li>Whats not to love?  </li>
            <li>I have friends who love it</li>
            <li>The bottle is cute itself.</li>
            <li>But once we sniffed the perfume it smelled  more like cotton candy and chocolates .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the design of the bottle too.</li>
            <li>my favorite.</li>
            <li>it surely lasts as well.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scent and now get complimented on it</li>
            <li>I will totally be buying this again best stuff ever</li>
            <li>THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PERFUMES .</li>
            <li>My body chemistry may have changed since then and it could have to do with season, so if I like it any better as it gets warmer I will update.</li>
            <li>so I went to the department store to smell the top 10 perfumes.</li>
            <li>I took a whiff with no expectations and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>&quot; line smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this summer perfume.</li>
            <li>:) I must have bought 3 dozen of these bottles by now</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>and you will be SO pleased.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume, my signature scent.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and fresh.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m sure she would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Paying top dollar does not always ensure that you&#x27;ll get a better product, however perfume may be the exception.</li>
            <li>Favorite perfume yet besides burberry</li>
            <li>This used to be one of my favorite perfumes a couple years ago</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>First off, let me say, I am not a fan of Britney Spears, but this perfume smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I have purchased this perfume many times.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love Britney&#x27;s Fantasy Parfum.......  </li>
            <li>Was better in the bottle and not on the bathroom floor when she broke it, but that&#x27;s beside the point.</li>
            <li>I JUST LOVE THE SCENT.</li>
            <li>MY FAVORITE BRITNEY SPEARS FRAGRANCE.  </li>

            <li>I have purchased this perfume many times and have never had any problems with buying it off of Amazon until now.</li>
            <li>Amazon has it cheaper than most online stores as well, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume because it&#x27;s lovely.  </li>
            <li>: I have to admit I love a bargain..</li>

            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find a better price.</li>
            <li>After smelling it i fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>so if you don&#x27;t absolutely love it don&#x27;t bother because you&#x27;re going to be walking around in a Fantasy cloud all day.</li>
            <li>but with this purchase I see that it is ok.</li>

            <li>If you like Heidi Klum Shine, you will love this.</li>
            <li>I favor more musky notes, but this scent is a nice blend of musky and sweet.</li>

            <li>Great seller, but won&#x27;t repurchase until they bring the old formula(and box!)</li>
            <li>a very sweet scent and not for everyone.</li>
            <li>A very sweet smell.</li>
            <li>I know of those who think it very sweet</li>
            <li>This is a very sweet smelling parfum.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells like the most wonderful smell to men and woman, I  have had soo many people ask me what I was wearing and a few embarrasing moments.</li>
            <li>My favorite cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>I originally tried it because I love Britney</li>
            <li>I also love original Chloe but again..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s authentic (which needs to be said online), and smells like a beachy fresh citrus!</li>
            <li>At first it does have the strong scent of vanilla but mixed with the most wonderful scent I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It opens with a strong fruit smell.  </li>
            <li>I am not very happy with this perfume ,though i am not a fan of singer but the bottle looked kind of impressive to give as a gift to my wife.</li>
            <li>Magnetism is an oriental vanilla for a sexy woman, whereas Fantasy is sweet vanilla for a coy girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle is cool, although not horribly well made.</li>
            <li>would recommend this fragrance to anyone who love sweet and seductive smells.</li>
            <li>This perfume has a sweet scent love it</li>
            <li>It smells sweet and the most noticeable scent is the vanilla cupcake.  </li>
            <li>cute perfume when you want to smell sweet(:</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pleasure to deal with amazon - everything is smooth and easy -</li>
            <li>Fantasy however, has quickly become one of my favorite perfumes of all time.</li>
            <li>A very pretty and pleasing smell for sure.</li>
            <li>and I liked Curious a lot, but this one is most definitely my favorite now!</li>
            <li>excellent product as described on this page, highly recommended, really fast if the occasion volvere to buy with you thank you very much for everything</li>
            <li>Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I OPENED THE HUGE BOX</li>
            <li>This is the cheapest I&#x27;ve ever purchased/seen it available.</li>
            <li>perfume seems cheap but cheaper in ebay</li>
            <li>However, This is one of those celebrity fragrances that fit the personality to a T.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but noticable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I enjoy when my wife us it.</li>
            <li>the perfume does not smell cheap (which to me smells like alcohol).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x27;Fantasy&#x27; is a bottle full of festive sweet treats, notably cotton candy &amp; cupcake accord.  </li>
            <li>Hi guys, get this for your lady, she will love it, and I love how it smell on her, the price is unbelievable for what you get in return, hi have too rate this 5 stars, for what I get in return, and of course she love it too, good return for the money as I said before.</li>
            <li>It was nice to find it on Amazon, not have to venture into a store AND still receive the item quickly before I completely ran out :)</li>
            <li>Love it and it is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>guess we had much higher expectations from this perfume,may be due to its impressive packaging, but</li>
            <li>Very sexy, feminine, and not too young.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an excellent everyday perfume!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% original.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite scent since it first came out</li>
            <li>Really a great fragrance, as long as you don&#x27;t take yourself</li>
            <li>EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
            <li>She received it first as a gift and decided to order more when it run out......</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s the original &#x27;Fantasy&#x27;</li>
            <li>excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opini&amp;oacute;n les sea &amp;uacute;til.</li>
            <li>This one is kind of different then most.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a head-turner (I work in a place which is mostly male-dominated, and they all tell me how nice I smell).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, bright, makes you feel young, radiant, special.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft &amp; elegant and can be worn anytime whether you&#x27;re snuggling up to watch movies with your boyfriend or going to a wedding!</li>
            <li>Nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>Came right on time too!</li>
            <li>and yet so right (smells like heaven!).</li>
            <li>The perfume smells very sweet, not necessarily fresh, but condensed, warm, and more sweet again xD</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very memorable fragrance....and has such a huge silage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great scent, and the bottle is actually pretty big.</li>
            <li>Its sweet, and fruity...</li>
            <li>Granted, it&#x27;s a creamy, sweet vanilla frosting</li>
            <li>The smell is too sweet for my taste.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but I was expecting something sweet like cotton candy or something.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even like Brittney spears that much, but she has lovely scents.</li>
            <li>the lingering aroma brings back all the good moments of gift giving</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so sweet and girly.</li>
            <li>Not to sweet but not to musky.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a creamy, fruity, sweet gourmand but there is something about the kiwi note that sometimes smells like rotting fruit.</li>
            <li>Also, I used to be a perfume snob and think britney couldn&#x27;t possibly make a good perfume...</li>
            <li>I really recommend it, it is a very rich fragrance for those who like sweet but not cloying fragrance.</li>
            <li>Well, for the most part, I have previously owned this fragrance and I loved it to peices.</li>
            <li>, THE DELIVERY WAS QUICK AND SAFE ON YOUR ESTIMATED TIME FOR DELIVERY, THANKS FOR THE SERVICE</li>
            <li>This is a great fragrance for feeling fun and flirty, fresh and perhaps even a little coy - you smell innocent, but are you?</li>
            <li>The perfume on the other hand not so great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find REALLY nice perfumes for good prices, so this was a treat.</li>
            <li>It is soft, light, sensual, exotic, and addicting.</li>
            <li>I try not to purchase high end perfumes anywhere but at the malls but brands like Britney would be OK to purchase here</li>
            <li>Highly recomended :)</li>
            <li>It resembles a cotton candy scent without being too teeny bopper-ish, it definitely has a very elegant yet playful scent.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my daughter in law, and from what she tell me, she loves it very much!</li>
            <li>It is not expensive but doesnt smell cheap at all.</li>
            <li>She like this perfume very much!</li>
            <li>Clearly it&#x27;s very recognizable...</li>
            <li>It smells very lady like, not too strong for those with sinus or allergy problems.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend if your into fruity &amp; sexy woman smell!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remind me of old ladies at all; it&#x27;s very sweet and unique.</li>
            <li>The best way to describe the scent is kind of sugary, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all, so long as you don&#x27;t apply too much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bottle its cool and pretty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly surprised at the reaction I get with this fragrance that my daughter described as something like cotton-candy and vanilla, but better.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one that he liked.</li>
            <li>It is my signature scent, this is my 4th bottle of fantasy, I have all of the fantasy line, but I like this one better just because every time I have it on everyone just wants to hug me or kiss me hahahaha</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my favorite perfume from Britney&#x27;s line so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to hold.  </li>
            <li>It sort of smells vanilla-y and fresh, with a hint of woods, but not musky.  </li>
            <li>it smells really good not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li>But the size of the bottle is definitely worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased numerous perfumes and I&#x27;ve been pretty satisfied that all are genuine until this purchase.</li>
            <li>I have loved this perfume every since it came out &amp; tried to take a break from it by switching to other smells</li>
            <li>I have been on ever since i have gotten over 50 free products of all types everything brand new!</li>
            <li>Hands down my most favorite perfume...</li>
            <li>I love the whole line, the regular fantasy is my favorite because my fiance always wants to rip my clothes off when he smells it.</li>
            <li>The perfume smells very feminine and sweet.</li>
            <li>It will fit perfectly without insulting your loved ones noses.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s hard trusting a complete strangers judgment on something you&#x27;ve never even tried, but I honestly think you&#x27;d still be very pleased if you bought this perfume before smelling it first!</li>
            <li>The store has been very professional and attentive.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to apply very much at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you very much for your attention</li>
            <li>The dry down is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone who likes sweet smells.</li>
            <li>It is very well worth the money, trust me.</li>
            <li>i was first refered to this site i didnt bother with it.</li>
            <li>Overall though I really love this perfume.</li>
            <li>and i like it so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t work the same for everyone</li>
            <li>- will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>would mention, though, that I think this scent is better for younger women.</li>
            <li>but when I received it in the mail today it&#x27;s not the real fantasy!</li>
            <li>I still remember the first time I smelled this, when it came out, around 2005 when I was 13.</li>
            <li>i suggest trying at the store first,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly like smelling a box of chocolates next to a bouquet of flowers.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 41), I just love it and keep coming back to it.</li>
            <li>I like the tropical fruits in the opening, but I like what comes next even more</li>
            <li>I love this parfume and wear it daily.</li>
            <li>I love that it last all day and is not over powering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not strong &amp; smells so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not \\&quot;stuffy\\&quot; at all, very soft and sweet.</li>
            <li>I really think it is the epitome of a feminine perfume because it is so sweet and throughout the day has a light scent that actually sticks around instead of fading!</li>
            <li>Snooki&#x27;s perfume cost less and smelled better!  </li>
            <li>Luckily it disappears 20 minutes later, and starts to smell sweet and flowery.  </li>
            <li>I have never ordered online since I&#x27;ve been very sketched about it but for being my first</li>
            <li>It is a soft sweet smell.</li>
            <li>It is not strong but stays close and intimate on your skin and reminds me so much of every county fair</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this scent to any sweet people I know!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d like to spray a shirt with it, but it seems to spray a large amount each time</li>
            <li>This is one of my few favorite perfumes!</li>
            <li>Not only because I&#x27;m not the ultimate Britney fan but because it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>For that, it is very well done.</li>
            <li>So you don&#x27;t really have to spray a lot.</li>
            <li>It lasts through out the whole day too.</li>
            <li>I think Fantasy smell nicer than Curious because it smelled more like candy.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely my favourite perfume.</li>
            <li>ON SOME REAL THOE</li>
            <li>I just really like the smell.</li>
            <li>and I was ready to give up when my fiance kindingly asked about the Britney Spears Fantasy perfume.</li>
            <li>In fact, the whole \\&quot;Fantasy\\</li>
            <li>the cost reasonable...</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this one!</li>
            <li>they go REALLY??</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li>I CANNOT REALLY DESCRIBE THE SCENT</li>
            <li>+ FOR THE SAME SIZE PLUS FREE SHIPPING.  </li>
            <li>She really wanted some</li>
            <li>very recomended</li>
            <li>It is not broken and is looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li>thank you so much bye.</li>
            <li>A very girly/womanly scent without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lol..too much money for perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>got it again for a friend because she smell reminds me so much of her.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get cotton candy from it.  </li>
            <li>is very well-done and the notes skillfully blended, so that it isn&#x27;t a saccharine overload.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance, and it arrived as expected.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Fantasy because I liked Curious alot and thought it was a great casual perfume.</li>
            <li>What can I say except that I get more compliments on this perfume than any other I&#x27;ve ever worn.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is also different from my 2006 original bottle.</li>
            <li>I purchased thinking I was getting a great deal, but after a couple of days of use, the bottle started peeling and I noticed that the fragrance lasted only a few hours!</li>
            <li>This is one of the few fragrances that have fallen in love from the first time I met her.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m not big on gourmand scents in general-- Angel smells more like Hell on me-- Fantasy</li>
            <li>So will whomever the special someone in your life may be, or in the future.</li>
            <li>The only way I can think to describe it is sweet.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>Honestly perfumes don&#x27;t usually have this power over me but this scent is almost mouth watering, but without being foodie or syrupy.</li>
            <li>This is soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li>This perfume changed my mind about perfumes in general, and now I&#x27;m more open to trying new stuff.</li>
            <li>It was weak and had kind of an after scent to it that just wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>Although, this fragrance is not what I would typically purchase, I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li>As the description states, this perfume has top notes of Lychee, Quince &amp; Kiwi; middle notes of Cupcake, Jasmine &amp; White Chocolate Orchid; finish of Creamy Musk, Orris Root &amp; Sensual Woods.</li>
            <li>Classic &amp;#</li>
            <li>&#x27;Fantasy&#x27; may be perceived as a &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; fragrance to older women &amp; the bottle design may be a turn-off, but it&#x27;s all about preference.</li>
            <li>I reccommned highly.</li>
            <li>I got this perfume the month before i would graduate from high school.</li>
            <li>The large bottle has some weight to it, but not heavy.  </li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t feel out of place wearing it to work, and I have a professional office job.</li>
            <li>The perfume bottle is pretty as well, but honestly I could care less if it was in an ugly bottle, it doesn&#x27;t take anything away from how great this perfume smells.</li>
            <li>Exotic orris root (from the iris bulb) and a little musk and sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Some are strong and sharp.  </li>
            <li>but it kinda get old fast...</li>
            <li>Yes, it sounds strange, but I like to wear sweet smelling fragrances in the spring and summer.</li>
            <li>First, let me say that I am very picky about my perfume, actually anything with a smell I will use or have in my home.</li>
            <li>One friend, it was so funny, she left my house and drove straight to the store to purchase.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments everyday .</li>
            <li>: sweet vanilla buttercream with a soft, mysterious, \\&quot;hovering\\&quot; note of powdery orris and woods.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and the packaging was new and in tact.</li>
            <li>I finally bought a small bottle based on the notes and while some days I love it, others I want to wash it off right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s deep pink and cute.  </li>
            <li>I laughed at the round pink girly bottle and sprayed it on the tester paper to amuse him.</li>
            <li>I will probably keep ordering it as long as she wants it!!</li>
            <li>When people have asked me what I&#x27;m wearing, they&#x27;re very surprised that it&#x27;s a Britney perfume.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not as sickly sweet as that baby powder-smelling spray from the drug store, it&#x27;s definitely not for someone who likes a more complex, mature or spicy scent.  </li>
            <li>but you&#x27;re on the fence, just order directly from AMAZON!</li>
            <li>but unfortunately the original is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I did buy the original, real Fantasy for my niece for Christmas, and compared the two a few times.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not really a floral smell, but it is sweet.  </li>
            <li>This poor review has nothing to do with the actual Britney Spears Fantasy Eau de Parfum (which I love and think it smells amazing), it is in regards to the empty perfume bottle which I paid $35 for.</li>
            <li>I have heard cautionary tales about buying things like this off of Amazon but always felt comfortable as long as it was actually from the Amazon Warehouse/Amazon seller</li>
            <li>I think I tried almost every single female perfume available</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 20yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>Just understand...whomever is near you at the time will not want to leave your side.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many floral notes, not that I can detect at least.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume for my 8 year old daughter for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  </li>
            <li>But the bottle I received was maybe old or something.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt last very long&lt;</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t think so, but this perfume tops the charts by far.</li>
            <li>That being said, this is my third (!) bottle of Fantasy, despite preferring fragrances more along the lines of Chanel Chance or Marc Jacobs Daisy, and I find it to be a comforting, youthful, addictive scent that I will probably continue to buy in the future.  </li>
            <li>, IT IS BY FAR</li>
            <li>so naturally I&#x27;m always in a panic when I run out.</li>
            <li>My nine year old daughter and</li>
            <li>my 14 year old niece also loves it.</li>
            <li>They are always surprised when I tell them its Britney Spears Fantasy.</li>
            <li>People are usually surprised when I say it&#x27;s a Britney Spears fragrance, I guess they were expecting me to say Prada or something.</li>
            <li>I have gotten compliments in a variety of settings, and I see no reason why a professional woman could not wear it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really explain the scent, but I can say it&#x27;s different than everything else I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li>Originally released in 2005 (succeeding Spears&#x27; blockbuster 2004 fragrance &#x27;Curious&#x27;), &#x27;Fantasy&#x27; has spawned numerous spin-off flanker fragrances.  </li>
            <li>own a few other Fantasy fragrances</li>
            <li>It has had its formula changed to(as I also read) less white chocolate warmth to a strong overpowering kiwi.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time in just a few days &amp; was shipped in the original packaging.</li>
            <li>Britney Spears Fantasy is a warm, musky, sweet, long-lasting fragrance that is fun and romantic, in a silly, juvenile way.  </li>
            <li>My sweet 16 month old has knocked it onto the bathroom floor a few times and no damage was done to the bottle.</li>
            <li>The notes include red lychee, golden quince, kiwi, cupcake accord, jasmine, white chocolate orchid, musk, woods, and orris root, but the cupcake, musk, and white chocolate seem to stick around the longest.  </li>
            <li>This scent is very heavy with huge sillage</li>
            <li>It came with a really cute sequined pink and green striped tote bag.</li>
            <li>Asked for as a Christms present, I get to enjoy this gift I gave to another everyday that she wears it...</li>
            <li>I work in a busy medical office as a healthcare professional</li>
            <li>I get compliments on it constantly from people who are surprised when I say it&#x27;s from Britney!</li>
            <li>it is in a clear and blue bottle) before I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>Apparently my body chemistry just loves vanilla or this scent triggers vanilla frosting in my brain.</li>
            <li>I HAVE MY OLD BOTTLE AND THE BOTTLES ARE EVEN DIFFERENT -  </li>
            <li>the scent does not last like the ones you buy from a professional retailer.</li>
            <li>I purchased it as a early Christmas present for myself</li>
            <li>One day every time I walked past the displays all I could smell was a deliciously sweet, enticing smell.</li>
            <li>It Is exactly what I had expected!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through countless of designer potions and have spent way too much money on all of them.</li>
            <li>I spent decent money on it</li>
            <li>I hate ultra strong or asian inspired scents or too fruity or too musky :)  </li>
            <li>This perfume stays on you &amp; your clothes all day long &amp; smells so classy not flowery at all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on reviews and on basenotes, I was expecting something less infantile &amp; more mature from Fantasy.</li>

            <li> I love smelling nice and one of the nicest compliments I can get is that I smell nice, and this happens often when I wear this perfume.</li>
            <li> The bottles are very strong too.</li>
            <li> Of all of my perfumes, this one is the one I&#x27;ve gotten the most compliments on... mostly from men!</li>
            <li> hoping that you do too, I found the &#x27;copy cat&#x27; scent at most Dollar Tree stores to be even better!  </li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume and I have ordered it many times!</li>
            <li> Nice strawberry smell,just love it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived early and in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Seeing her happy makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great deal, worth the search.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that \\&quot;hovering\\&quot; soft-sweet-light quality that makes Fantasy so amazing, and so sexy.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li> Not too strong and very sexy.</li>
            <li> It came in a good condition, the box was original.</li>
            <li> Sweet and delicious, was delivered very fast</li>
            <li> I basically grew up despising perfumes because most of them just smelled like old ladies to me, but I was very impressed by this perfume.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, beautiful gift.</li>
            <li> good price and quick shipment</li>
            <li> and I lived the large size and thought it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> I recommend it very good offer fast and secure</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.</li>
            <li> It smells like magic.</li>
            <li> My fiance is in love with the smell as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be for sure but fantasy</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not too sure anymore.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing any more perfumes at Amazon again.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume of all time.  </li>
            <li> This is the one I reach for the most.  </li>
            <li> Here you get more for cheeper.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> My bestfriend, her husband, and I all love it.</li>
            <li> and him would love it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> Still, Fantasy is vanilla frosting, from top to bottom.</li>
            <li> However, I think Escada Magnetism is much better.</li>
            <li> My mom had this spray and we shared it because I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I love wearing it</li>
            <li> Whats not to love?  </li>
            <li> I have friends who love it</li>
            <li> The bottle is cute itself.</li>
            <li> But once we sniffed the perfume it smelled  more like cotton candy and chocolates .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the design of the bottle too.</li>
            <li> my favorite.</li>
            <li> it surely lasts as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent and now get complimented on it</li>
            <li> I will totally be buying this again best stuff ever</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PERFUMES .</li>
            <li> My body chemistry may have changed since then and it could have to do with season, so if I like it any better as it gets warmer I will update.</li>
            <li> so I went to the department store to smell the top 10 perfumes.</li>
            <li> I took a whiff with no expectations and I fell in love.</li>
            <li> &quot; line smells fantastic!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure she would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Paying top dollar does not always ensure that you&#x27;ll get a better product, however perfume may be the exception.</li>

            <li> I have purchased this perfume many times and have never had any problems with buying it off of Amazon until now.</li>
            <li> Amazon has it cheaper than most online stores as well, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume because it&#x27;s lovely.  </li>
            <li> : I have to admit I love a bargain..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve remembered the scent for like 8 years :)...</li>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> First I got this one for myself and then my mom stole it because she liked it!</li>
            <li> plan to get another one for me soon :]</li>
            <li> My sister and I just love it.</li>
            <li> but the boys just love the smell and feel attracted to us when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li> Many perfumes give me a headache, but this doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like cotton candy to me.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was a great purchasing experience!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find a better price.</li>
            <li> After smelling it i fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li> so if you don&#x27;t absolutely love it don&#x27;t bother because you&#x27;re going to be walking around in a Fantasy cloud all day.</li>
            <li> but with this purchase I see that it is ok.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t decide which one I like better.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> It was authentic and came in the box.</li>
            <li> I love this perfum.</li>

            <li> that is most remembered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If is sexy and feminine but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> If you like Heidi Klum Shine, you will love this.</li>
            <li> I favor more musky notes, but this scent is a nice blend of musky and sweet.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance to wear dinner, party and  special occasions</li>
            <li> Warm and Sweet...</li>
            <li> sweet and nice fragance</li>
            <li> Believe me this site is worth checking out!!</li>
            <li> Love that sweet vanilla smell!</li>
            <li> Great seller, but won&#x27;t repurchase until they bring the old formula(and box!)</li>
            <li> a very sweet scent and not for everyone.</li>
            <li> A very sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I know of those who think it very sweet</li>
            <li> This is a very sweet smelling parfum.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells like the most wonderful smell to men and woman, I  have had soo many people ask me what I was wearing and a few embarrasing moments.</li>
            <li> My favorite cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> I originally tried it because I love Britney</li>
            <li> I also love original Chloe but again..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s authentic (which needs to be said online), and smells like a beachy fresh citrus!</li>
            <li> At first it does have the strong scent of vanilla but mixed with the most wonderful scent I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It opens with a strong fruit smell.  </li>
            <li> I am not very happy with this perfume ,though i am not a fan of singer but the bottle looked kind of impressive to give as a gift to my wife.</li>
            <li> Magnetism is an oriental vanilla for a sexy woman, whereas Fantasy is sweet vanilla for a coy girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle is cool, although not horribly well made.</li>
            <li> would recommend this fragrance to anyone who love sweet and seductive smells.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a sweet scent love it</li>
            <li> It smells sweet and the most noticeable scent is the vanilla cupcake.  </li>
            <li> cute perfume when you want to smell sweet(:</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pleasure to deal with amazon - everything is smooth and easy -</li>
            <li> Fantasy however, has quickly become one of my favorite perfumes of all time.</li>
            <li> A very pretty and pleasing smell for sure.</li>
            <li> and I liked Curious a lot, but this one is most definitely my favorite now!</li>
            <li> excellent product as described on this page, highly recommended, really fast if the occasion volvere to buy with you thank you very much for everything</li>
            <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I OPENED THE HUGE BOX</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest I&#x27;ve ever purchased/seen it available.</li>
            <li> perfume seems cheap but cheaper in ebay</li>
            <li> However, This is one of those celebrity fragrances that fit the personality to a T.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light but noticable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I enjoy when my wife us it.</li>
            <li> the perfume does not smell cheap (which to me smells like alcohol).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x27;Fantasy&#x27; is a bottle full of festive sweet treats, notably cotton candy &amp; cupcake accord.  </li>
            <li> Hi guys, get this for your lady, she will love it, and I love how it smell on her, the price is unbelievable for what you get in return, hi have too rate this 5 stars, for what I get in return, and of course she love it too, good return for the money as I said before.</li>
            <li> It was nice to find it on Amazon, not have to venture into a store AND still receive the item quickly before I completely ran out :)</li>
            <li> Love it and it is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> guess we had much higher expectations from this perfume,may be due to its impressive packaging, but</li>
            <li> Very sexy, feminine, and not too young.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an excellent everyday perfume!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% original.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite scent since it first came out</li>
            <li> Really a great fragrance, as long as you don&#x27;t take yourself</li>
            <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
            <li> She received it first as a gift and decided to order more when it run out......</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s the original &#x27;Fantasy&#x27;</li>
            <li> excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opini&amp;oacute;n les sea &amp;uacute;til.</li>
            <li> This one is kind of different then most.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a head-turner (I work in a place which is mostly male-dominated, and they all tell me how nice I smell).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh, bright, makes you feel young, radiant, special.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft &amp; elegant and can be worn anytime whether you&#x27;re snuggling up to watch movies with your boyfriend or going to a wedding!</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> Came right on time too!</li>
            <li> and yet so right (smells like heaven!).</li>
            <li> The perfume smells very sweet, not necessarily fresh, but condensed, warm, and more sweet again xD</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very memorable fragrance....and has such a huge silage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great scent, and the bottle is actually pretty big.</li>
            <li> Its sweet, and fruity...</li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s a creamy, sweet vanilla frosting</li>
            <li> The smell is too sweet for my taste.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I was expecting something sweet like cotton candy or something.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even like Brittney spears that much, but she has lovely scents.</li>
            <li> the lingering aroma brings back all the good moments of gift giving</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so sweet and girly.</li>
            <li> Not to sweet but not to musky.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a creamy, fruity, sweet gourmand but there is something about the kiwi note that sometimes smells like rotting fruit.</li>
            <li> Also, I used to be a perfume snob and think britney couldn&#x27;t possibly make a good perfume...</li>
            <li> I really recommend it, it is a very rich fragrance for those who like sweet but not cloying fragrance.</li>
            <li> Well, for the most part, I have previously owned this fragrance and I loved it to peices.</li>
            <li> , THE DELIVERY WAS QUICK AND SAFE ON YOUR ESTIMATED TIME FOR DELIVERY, THANKS FOR THE SERVICE</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance for feeling fun and flirty, fresh and perhaps even a little coy - you smell innocent, but are you?</li>
            <li> The perfume on the other hand not so great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find REALLY nice perfumes for good prices, so this was a treat.</li>
            <li> It is soft, light, sensual, exotic, and addicting.</li>
            <li> I try not to purchase high end perfumes anywhere but at the malls but brands like Britney would be OK to purchase here</li>
            <li> Highly recomended :)</li>
            <li> It resembles a cotton candy scent without being too teeny bopper-ish, it definitely has a very elegant yet playful scent.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter in law, and from what she tell me, she loves it very much!</li>
            <li> It is not expensive but doesnt smell cheap at all.</li>
            <li> She like this perfume very much!</li>
            <li> Clearly it&#x27;s very recognizable...</li>
            <li> It smells very lady like, not too strong for those with sinus or allergy problems.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend if your into fruity &amp; sexy woman smell!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remind me of old ladies at all; it&#x27;s very sweet and unique.</li>
            <li> The best way to describe the scent is kind of sugary, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all, so long as you don&#x27;t apply too much!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bottle its cool and pretty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly surprised at the reaction I get with this fragrance that my daughter described as something like cotton-candy and vanilla, but better.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one that he liked.</li>
            <li> It is my signature scent, this is my 4th bottle of fantasy, I have all of the fantasy line, but I like this one better just because every time I have it on everyone just wants to hug me or kiss me hahahaha</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my favorite perfume from Britney&#x27;s line so far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to hold.  </li>
            <li> It sort of smells vanilla-y and fresh, with a hint of woods, but not musky.  </li>
            <li> it smells really good not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> But the size of the bottle is definitely worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased numerous perfumes and I&#x27;ve been pretty satisfied that all are genuine until this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume every since it came out &amp; tried to take a break from it by switching to other smells</li>
            <li> I have been on ever since i have gotten over 50 free products of all types everything brand new!</li>
            <li> Hands down my most favorite perfume...</li>
            <li> I love the whole line, the regular fantasy is my favorite because my fiance always wants to rip my clothes off when he smells it.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells very feminine and sweet.</li>
            <li> It will fit perfectly without insulting your loved ones noses.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard trusting a complete strangers judgment on something you&#x27;ve never even tried, but I honestly think you&#x27;d still be very pleased if you bought this perfume before smelling it first!</li>
            <li> The store has been very professional and attentive.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to apply very much at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you very much for your attention</li>
            <li> The dry down is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone who likes sweet smells.</li>
            <li> It is very well worth the money, trust me.</li>
            <li> i was first refered to this site i didnt bother with it.</li>
            <li> Overall though I really love this perfume.</li>
            <li> and i like it so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t work the same for everyone</li>
            <li> - will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> would mention, though, that I think this scent is better for younger women.</li>
            <li> but when I received it in the mail today it&#x27;s not the real fantasy!</li>
            <li> I still remember the first time I smelled this, when it came out, around 2005 when I was 13.</li>
            <li> i suggest trying at the store first,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly like smelling a box of chocolates next to a bouquet of flowers.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 41), I just love it and keep coming back to it.</li>
            <li> I like the tropical fruits in the opening, but I like what comes next even more</li>
            <li> I love this parfume and wear it daily.</li>
            <li> I love that it last all day and is not over powering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong &amp; smells so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not \\&quot;stuffy\\&quot; at all, very soft and sweet.</li>
            <li> I really think it is the epitome of a feminine perfume because it is so sweet and throughout the day has a light scent that actually sticks around instead of fading!</li>
            <li> Snooki&#x27;s perfume cost less and smelled better!  </li>
            <li> Luckily it disappears 20 minutes later, and starts to smell sweet and flowery.  </li>
            <li> I have never ordered online since I&#x27;ve been very sketched about it but for being my first</li>
            <li> It is a soft sweet smell.</li>
            <li> It is not strong but stays close and intimate on your skin and reminds me so much of every county fair</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this scent to any sweet people I know!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d like to spray a shirt with it, but it seems to spray a large amount each time</li>
            <li> This is one of my few favorite perfumes!</li>
            <li> Not only because I&#x27;m not the ultimate Britney fan but because it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> For that, it is very well done.</li>
            <li> So you don&#x27;t really have to spray a lot.</li>
            <li> It lasts through out the whole day too.</li>
            <li> I think Fantasy smell nicer than Curious because it smelled more like candy.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my favourite perfume.</li>
            <li> ON SOME REAL THOE</li>
            <li> I just really like the smell.</li>
            <li> and I was ready to give up when my fiance kindingly asked about the Britney Spears Fantasy perfume.</li>
            <li> In fact, the whole \\&quot;Fantasy\\</li>
            <li> the cost reasonable...</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this one!</li>
            <li> they go REALLY??</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li> I CANNOT REALLY DESCRIBE THE SCENT</li>
            <li> + FOR THE SAME SIZE PLUS FREE SHIPPING.  </li>
            <li> She really wanted some</li>
            <li> very recomended</li>
            <li> It is not broken and is looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li> thank you so much bye.</li>
            <li> A very girly/womanly scent without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lol..too much money for perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> got it again for a friend because she smell reminds me so much of her.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get cotton candy from it.  </li>
            <li> is very well-done and the notes skillfully blended, so that it isn&#x27;t a saccharine overload.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance, and it arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Fantasy because I liked Curious alot and thought it was a great casual perfume.</li>
            <li> What can I say except that I get more compliments on this perfume than any other I&#x27;ve ever worn.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is also different from my 2006 original bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased thinking I was getting a great deal, but after a couple of days of use, the bottle started peeling and I noticed that the fragrance lasted only a few hours!</li>
            <li> This is one of the few fragrances that have fallen in love from the first time I met her.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not big on gourmand scents in general-- Angel smells more like Hell on me-- Fantasy</li>
            <li> So will whomever the special someone in your life may be, or in the future.</li>
            <li> The only way I can think to describe it is sweet.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> Honestly perfumes don&#x27;t usually have this power over me but this scent is almost mouth watering, but without being foodie or syrupy.</li>
            <li> This is soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li> This perfume changed my mind about perfumes in general, and now I&#x27;m more open to trying new stuff.</li>
            <li> It was weak and had kind of an after scent to it that just wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> Although, this fragrance is not what I would typically purchase, I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li> As the description states, this perfume has top notes of Lychee, Quince &amp; Kiwi; middle notes of Cupcake, Jasmine &amp; White Chocolate Orchid; finish of Creamy Musk, Orris Root &amp; Sensual Woods.</li>
            <li> Classic &amp;#</li>
            <li> &#x27;Fantasy&#x27; may be perceived as a &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; fragrance to older women &amp; the bottle design may be a turn-off, but it&#x27;s all about preference.</li>
            <li> I reccommned highly.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume the month before i would graduate from high school.</li>
            <li> The large bottle has some weight to it, but not heavy.  </li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t feel out of place wearing it to work, and I have a professional office job.</li>
            <li> The perfume bottle is pretty as well, but honestly I could care less if it was in an ugly bottle, it doesn&#x27;t take anything away from how great this perfume smells.</li>
            <li> Exotic orris root (from the iris bulb) and a little musk and sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Some are strong and sharp.  </li>
            <li> but it kinda get old fast...</li>
            <li> Yes, it sounds strange, but I like to wear sweet smelling fragrances in the spring and summer.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I am very picky about my perfume, actually anything with a smell I will use or have in my home.</li>
            <li> One friend, it was so funny, she left my house and drove straight to the store to purchase.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments everyday .</li>
            <li> : sweet vanilla buttercream with a soft, mysterious, \\&quot;hovering\\&quot; note of powdery orris and woods.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and the packaging was new and in tact.</li>
            <li> I finally bought a small bottle based on the notes and while some days I love it, others I want to wash it off right away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deep pink and cute.  </li>
            <li> I laughed at the round pink girly bottle and sprayed it on the tester paper to amuse him.</li>
            <li> I will probably keep ordering it as long as she wants it!!</li>
            <li> When people have asked me what I&#x27;m wearing, they&#x27;re very surprised that it&#x27;s a Britney perfume.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not as sickly sweet as that baby powder-smelling spray from the drug store, it&#x27;s definitely not for someone who likes a more complex, mature or spicy scent.  </li>
            <li> but you&#x27;re on the fence, just order directly from AMAZON!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the original is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I did buy the original, real Fantasy for my niece for Christmas, and compared the two a few times.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really a floral smell, but it is sweet.  </li>
            <li> This poor review has nothing to do with the actual Britney Spears Fantasy Eau de Parfum (which I love and think it smells amazing), it is in regards to the empty perfume bottle which I paid $35 for.</li>
            <li> I have heard cautionary tales about buying things like this off of Amazon but always felt comfortable as long as it was actually from the Amazon Warehouse/Amazon seller</li>
            <li> I think I tried almost every single female perfume available</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 20yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> Just understand...whomever is near you at the time will not want to leave your side.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many floral notes, not that I can detect at least.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my 8 year old daughter for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  </li>
            <li> But the bottle I received was maybe old or something.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt last very long&lt;</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think so, but this perfume tops the charts by far.</li>
            <li> That being said, this is my third (!) bottle of Fantasy, despite preferring fragrances more along the lines of Chanel Chance or Marc Jacobs Daisy, and I find it to be a comforting, youthful, addictive scent that I will probably continue to buy in the future.  </li>
            <li> , IT IS BY FAR</li>
            <li> so naturally I&#x27;m always in a panic when I run out.</li>
            <li> My nine year old daughter and</li>
            <li> my 14 year old niece also loves it.</li>
            <li> They are always surprised when I tell them its Britney Spears Fantasy.</li>
            <li> People are usually surprised when I say it&#x27;s a Britney Spears fragrance, I guess they were expecting me to say Prada or something.</li>
            <li> I have gotten compliments in a variety of settings, and I see no reason why a professional woman could not wear it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really explain the scent, but I can say it&#x27;s different than everything else I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li> Originally released in 2005 (succeeding Spears&#x27; blockbuster 2004 fragrance &#x27;Curious&#x27;), &#x27;Fantasy&#x27; has spawned numerous spin-off flanker fragrances.  </li>
            <li> own a few other Fantasy fragrances</li>
            <li> It has had its formula changed to(as I also read) less white chocolate warmth to a strong overpowering kiwi.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time in just a few days &amp; was shipped in the original packaging.</li>
            <li> Britney Spears Fantasy is a warm, musky, sweet, long-lasting fragrance that is fun and romantic, in a silly, juvenile way.  </li>
            <li> My sweet 16 month old has knocked it onto the bathroom floor a few times and no damage was done to the bottle.</li>
            <li> The notes include red lychee, golden quince, kiwi, cupcake accord, jasmine, white chocolate orchid, musk, woods, and orris root, but the cupcake, musk, and white chocolate seem to stick around the longest.  </li>
            <li> This scent is very heavy with huge sillage</li>
            <li> It came with a really cute sequined pink and green striped tote bag.</li>
            <li> Asked for as a Christms present, I get to enjoy this gift I gave to another everyday that she wears it...</li>
            <li> I work in a busy medical office as a healthcare professional</li>
            <li> I get compliments on it constantly from people who are surprised when I say it&#x27;s from Britney!</li>
            <li> it is in a clear and blue bottle) before I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Apparently my body chemistry just loves vanilla or this scent triggers vanilla frosting in my brain.</li>
            <li> I HAVE MY OLD BOTTLE AND THE BOTTLES ARE EVEN DIFFERENT -  </li>
            <li> the scent does not last like the ones you buy from a professional retailer.</li>
            <li> I purchased it as a early Christmas present for myself</li>
            <li> One day every time I walked past the displays all I could smell was a deliciously sweet, enticing smell.</li>
            <li> It Is exactly what I had expected!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through countless of designer potions and have spent way too much money on all of them.</li>
            <li> I spent decent money on it</li>
            <li> I hate ultra strong or asian inspired scents or too fruity or too musky :)  </li>
            <li> This perfume stays on you &amp; your clothes all day long &amp; smells so classy not flowery at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on reviews and on basenotes, I was expecting something less infantile &amp; more mature from Fantasy.</li>
            <li> I did attempt to mix it with Bath &amp; Body Works&#x27; Secret Wonderland (discontinued in stores) and that does smell slightly more Electric Youth-like but not really the same.  </li>
            <li> It smells similar but isn&#x27;t as strong and doesn&#x27;t last spend an extra 20 bucks at the most and get the real deal not happy at all waste of money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Normally at the department stores you get stuck paying 40 to 60 bucks for it 1oz or less.</li>
            <li> I was very unsure about buying this perfume because I usually just stick with the simple body mists from local stores.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance just smells flat and hardly last an hour.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last long and doesn&#x27;t even smell the way it should because i have used this before.</li>
            <li> Hardly any scent, so you don&#x27;t save any money getting this larger amount, you can just go to Walmart and buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> You can definitely smell the sweet, slightly citrus of the lychee and quince fruits after spraying but that fades to a softer vanilla-flavored cupcake with an oh-so subtle hint of chocolate.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to purchase this perfume after noticing that I would go to smell it every single time I was at Target!</li>
            <li> I smelled it all day long.</li>
            <li> The 3.3 oz bottle lasts a long time, too.</li>
            <li> But when I opened it I discovered that the bottle was completely empty, there was not even a drop of perfume left in it.</li>
            <li> Very different than scents like Mariah Carey&#x27;s junk and Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> As long as you stick with the perfume rule (spray on wrist and dab at neck)  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;ve tried curious and didn&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t think fantasy is similar!</li>
            <li> The initial scent calms down within an hour but with a lasting one that is to die for.</li>
            <li> Unlike other perfumes that don&#x27;t last long, I spray it in the morning</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume that I wear other than Lolita Lempicka.</li>
            <li> I have to cut back on a star due to the price.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product as long I can!</li>
            <li> It lasts for a very long time and people can smell you from a mile away.</li>
            <li> THIS FAKE BOTTLE DOES NOT HAVE THE GREEN DIAMOND AROUND THE TOP BELOW THE SPRAY NOZZLE.  </li>
            <li> But i kept hearing about it , so i came back a few months later got onto the site</li>
            <li> Every single one of my friends who smelled it,all bought it within one week.</li>
            <li> they are very very slight and definitely in the background of the white chocolate vanilla sugar!</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long on, maybe two to three hours, but I could just be use to it.  </li>
            <li> I am not a Britney fan and spent a long time thinking assuming this was totally overrated and boring and only got popular based on her fame.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even a britney fan, never really have been, but this.</li>
            <li> When the product arrived, it was exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Received package about 3 days after I ordered it and it was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Though there was a few scratches on the actually bottle</li>
            <li> but it was a pink bottle made by Britney Spears.</li>
            <li> For about the $30 I spent on it</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll go into sugar shock with this one like you might with Aquolina&#x27;s Pink.</li>
            <li> I decided to oreder it again, and it was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> but when I unwrapped the package, there was literally and empty bottle.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is what I would consider immature.</li>
            <li> what i expected.  </li>
            <li> The cotton candy is noticeable, but isn&#x27;t overpowering a la Aqualina&#x27;s &#x27;Pink Sugar&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this same fragrance free from the link below:[...</li>
            <li> One of my co-worker&#x27;s favorite past times was to spray a random perfume as he walked past.</li>
            <li> other than that.</li>
            <li> have also purchased other &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I smelled this on a girl the other day and thought she was wearing Brit</li>
            <li> recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> From the first time I sampled Fantasy, I knew it was so wrong (</li>
            <li> I mix this with other perfumes and colognes.</li>
            <li> i personally think it&#x27;s too strong of a flowery smell, but if she sprays very little it isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this since I was very young, and I&#x27;ll never grow tired of it.</li>
            <li> The dry down reminds me a little bit of Burberry Brit.</li>
            <li> Not your average perfume.</li>
            <li> This bottle came to me EMPTY!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER FROM ANY OTHER SELLER!</li>
            <li> The price is half what you pay at Ulta.</li>
            <li> It smells just like my previous one.</li>
            <li> It, to me, is less musty than Hidden Fantasy</li>
            <li> ,I have a collection of perfumes under the sink, they just were not right!</li>
            <li> There are knockoffs of this at the dollar store and if you like that, but want something a little smoother, get Spears&#x27; perfume.  </li>
            <li> it also did not smell like a little girl which i was worried it would because of the bottle design</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my sister and she wore it a few times but quickly became sick of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it every day for a few years and get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I brought this a few years ago on a whim.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle a few years ago as a gift and now it&#x27;s all I wear.</li>
            <li> but I had to take a few stars off for the quality of the scent....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this perfume rocks,but it&#x27;s normal,for everyday use...</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> So this past Christmas I got it for her because I know both her</li>
            <li> IT ARRIVED IN TO FIND A DAMAGED SMALL BOX OF BRITNEY PERFUME.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small sample bottle in a store.  </li>
            <li> One guy told me that this perfume had to be illegal because he just couldn&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> usually end up washing perfume off.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure on how I feel about this scent.</li>
            <li> noting that it was too overpowering for just one small squirt.  </li>
            <li> It starts out with a soft vanilla, almost cotton candy smell, and then changes throughout the day to a little bit deeper, a little bit musky, but not too musky at all (I hate musky smells).</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s has decent longevity &amp; isn&#x27;t sickly, almost like buttercream ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet, but not cloying or sickeningly so.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my signature scent now, I hardly wear anything else.  </li>
            <li> The fragance is dull vanilla.</li>
            <li> I usually wear  Romance ,Angel,  Hermes, and other expensive ones</li>
            <li> When it arrived, the perfume was dull and has no life to it whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe a scent</li>
            <li> This is quite a complex perfume</li>
            <li> so I think it sucks that I have to wait for it to be shipped ALL over again.</li>
            <li> I mean it, people can smell this on you even after you leave the room if you overdo it</li>
            <li> I smelled cake very faintly one day, but not enough as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> *too* seriously.</li>
            <li> Subtle and never over powering.</li>
            <li> I have lots of perfumes and a lot of expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> sorry amazon its true,but</li>
            <li> Weird because vanilla isn&#x27;t even a listed note.</li>
            <li> Ladies can&#x27;t go wrong for buying this scent...</li>
            <li> I feel sorry for my husband</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my husband hates Lolita Lempicka.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it does not.  </li>
            <li> Ever since then I ahve become obsessed with celebrity perfumes.</li>
            <li> Even over all the ritzy expensive ones.</li>
            <li> It shares shelf space with my Chanels, my Lauders and my Marc Jacobses, unashamedly.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about this being fake or defective.</li>
            <li> They will not give you any fake perfume.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy fragrances online</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> well, what I mean is, even if I sweat it doesn&#x27;t wear off or smell bad.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A FAKE PERFUME!</li>
            <li> its probably fake!</li>
            <li> Un perfume, el de britney.. de jevita... is not toxic unless you drink it, not recommended for bad breath, irritates the throat</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mind th smell too bad either on her</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> BOTTLE IS FAKE, SMELLS HORRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> we were disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of Brittany Spears or the way she wreaked herself and made a terrible raunchy example of womanhood to girls everywhere</li>
            <li> is very disappointing</li>
            <li> I hate her</li>
            <li> I hate musky smells.  </li>
            <li> Again, not too bad, though!</li>
            <li> You WON&#x27;T be unhappy!!</li>

            <li> What my was looking for. ...</li>
            <li> Just like pictured. Love this perfume.</li>
            <li> The smell is indescribable. I&#x27;ve used this since I was very young, and I&#x27;ll never grow tired of it. Its sweet, and fruity... It smells like magic. Not your average perfume. I&#x27;m not even a britney fan, never really have been, but this. This is my obsession. My fiance is in love with the smell as well. I would definitely reccomend to anyone, and especially to buy it here. This is the cheapest I&#x27;ve ever purchased/seen it available. I will be a costumer for years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased numerous perfumes and I&#x27;ve been pretty satisfied that all are genuine until this purchase. I can&#x27;t be for sure but fantasy I ordered sold by Amazon just doesn&#x27;t quite smell the same as the ones I tried at the stores. The fragrance just smells flat and hardly last an hour. I try not to purchase high end perfumes anywhere but at the malls but brands like Britney would be OK to purchase here but I&#x27;m not too sure anymore. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing any more perfumes at Amazon again.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume of all time.  I have lots of perfumes and a lot of expensive ones.  This is the one I reach for the most.  I also get tons of compliments every time I wear it.  When people have asked me what I&#x27;m wearing, they&#x27;re very surprised that it&#x27;s a Britney perfume.  I will never stop buying this, I hope they never discontinue it.</li>
            <li> this is prefect. The seller got the perfume to me quickly and in perfect condition. When the product arrived, it was exactly as I expected. Everything was perfect.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal. Normally at the department stores you get stuck paying 40 to 60 bucks for it 1oz or less. Here you get more for cheeper. I also love the smell. I get tons of complements from men and women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Britney Spears.  I bought the FANTASY by Britney Spears perfume.  This perfume smells so good I love it.  I should definantly look into the rest of her perfume line.</li>
            <li> My bestfriend, her husband, and I all love it. See I got this perfume as a gift years ago and I loved it. Got it again and my bestfriend and I both started wearing it, her husband loved the perfume on her. So this past Christmas I got it for her because I know both her and him would love it. I reccommned highly. I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> perfume seems cheap but cheaper in ebay sorry amazon its true,but great product amazon is the best though in tracking number shipping quality gotta be honest with the readers,this perfume is my fav its very sweet and girly im a candy lover and that why i luv it!</li>
            <li> my favorite!! Love it! Good price!</li>
            <li> The product is great. I bought it for my 20yr old daughter. It arrived on time in just a few days &amp; was shipped in the original packaging. I was very happy with this product &amp; the merchant.</li>
            <li> What can I say except that I get more compliments on this perfume than any other I&#x27;ve ever worn.  It&#x27;s my signature scent now, I hardly wear anything else.  Love, love, love it!  Stays on!</li>
            <li> Fantasy is all vanilla on me. Granted, it&#x27;s a creamy, sweet vanilla frosting that&#x27;s has decent longevity &amp; isn&#x27;t sickly, almost like buttercream ... but sweeter, creamer, wetter. Still, Fantasy is vanilla frosting, from top to bottom. Weird because vanilla isn&#x27;t even a listed note. Apparently my body chemistry just loves vanilla or this scent triggers vanilla frosting in my brain. Don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have said that Fantasy is similar to Escada Magnetism. On that we agree. However, I think Escada Magnetism is much better. Magnetism is an oriental vanilla for a sexy woman, whereas Fantasy is sweet vanilla for a coy girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on reviews and on basenotes, I was expecting something less infantile &amp; more mature from Fantasy. However, This is one of those celebrity fragrances that fit the personality to a T. For that, it is very well done.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best perfume in the world. It smells incredibly good, I feel like I&#x27;m in heaven whenever I put it on!!! It is very well worth the money, trust me. This is the perfume scent you&#x27;ve been searching for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Received package about 3 days after I ordered it and it was just what I expected. The perfume on the other hand not so great.  The smell is too sweet for my taste. Not for everybody</li>
            <li> Everyone compliments her on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> My mom had this spray and we shared it because I love the smell of it. And the smell stays on you. So you don&#x27;t really have to spray a lot. But it smells amazing. I loved it!</li>
            <li> This perfume smella AMAZING!!! I don&#x27;t even know the words to describe it. I was over at my friends house yesterday and she had this and I sprayed some one me just our of curiosity and i about died it smelled so goood! Highly recomended :)</li>
            <li> THIS IS A FAKE PERFUME! PACKAGE DAMAGED, BOTTLE IS FAKE, SMELLS HORRIBLE.  I OPENED THE HUGE BOX IT ARRIVED IN TO FIND A DAMAGED SMALL BOX OF BRITNEY PERFUME. I HAVE MY OLD BOTTLE AND THE BOTTLES ARE EVEN DIFFERENT -  THIS FAKE BOTTLE DOES NOT HAVE THE GREEN DIAMOND AROUND THE TOP BELOW THE SPRAY NOZZLE.  ALSO, THE BOTTLE WAS MESSED UP AND HAD LIQUID ALL OVER.  YOU CAN&#x27;T EVEN RETURN IT.  DON&#x27;T ORDER THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small sample bottle in a store.  The container is very cute and I plan to keep it. The fragance is dull vanilla.</li>
            <li> Sweet and delicious, was delivered very fast</li>
            <li> This is a VERY romantic scent. It is soft, light, sensual, exotic, and addicting. I love wearing it and my husband loves it on me as well. This is a perfume I must have in my home at all times. I recommend everyone try it of all ages...I promise you will not regret the investment. Just understand...whomever is near you at the time will not want to leave your side.</li>
            <li> Wife likes it. me too smells nice!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so happy with this purchase. i LOVE fantasy! it smells sooo good and the pricepoint is fantastic!</li>
            <li> exelente compra y me la mandaron hasta ecuador... muy buena la tienda muy seria.. el perfume muy bueno .. personas serias</li>
            <li> Un perfume, el de britney.. de jevita... is not toxic unless you drink it, not recommended for bad breath, irritates the throat</li>
            <li> Whats not to love?  All 3 of my daughters ask for their Fantasy to be replaced on every wish list.</li>

Believe me this site is worth checking out!! Join,have fun,and enjoy!!</li>
            <li> This perfume smell awesome!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it! It makes me feel dizzy! Provably because it contains somethng that doesn&#x27;tmake quemestry with my body.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never buy it again! I have friends who love it but it&#x27;s no my case.</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing! It has a musk smell, but it is great. It lasts through out the whole day too. I would buy this perfume over and over again.</li>
            <li> I have never ordered online since I&#x27;ve been very sketched about it but for being my first I was so surprised. The price, shipping time, &amp; handling was amazing. Though there was a few scratches on the actually bottle I didn&#x27;t have a care in the world cause i was buying it for the perfume not looks. Soo Im very happy customer!!</li>
            <li> I got this perfume the month before i would graduate from high school. It came with a really cute sequined pink and green striped tote bag. I think Fantasy smell nicer than Curious because it smelled more like candy. The bottle is cute itself.</li>
            <li> I worked at a Wal-mart last year and we got fragrance displays for the Christmas season. One of my co-worker&#x27;s favorite past times was to spray a random perfume as he walked past. One day every time I walked past the displays all I could smell was a deliciously sweet, enticing smell. I smelled it all day long. After work that night I finally found out what it was. Britney Spears Fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a very sweet scent and not for everyone. There aren&#x27;t many floral notes, not that I can detect at least. The only way I can think to describe it is sweet.</li>
            <li> I am not very happy with this perfume ,though i am not a fan of singer but the bottle looked kind of impressive to give as a gift to my wife.But once we sniffed the perfume it smelled  more like cotton candy and chocolates .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess we had much higher expectations from this perfume,may be due to its impressive packaging, but we were disappointed. I do not recommend to buy this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She tried it before and ran out of it, so she requested another bottle for Christmas. I found a great deal here on Amazon- $36.00 ( including everything) for a 3.3 oz. bottle. I love the design of the bottle too. The perfume smells very feminine and sweet.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet.. my favorite.</li>
            <li> In love wither perfume! Ladies can&#x27;t go wrong for buying this scent...it surely lasts as well.</li>
            <li> The product meets my expectations were on time, flawless, they recommended 100% of all purchases. This perfume is amazing! and has an odor of musk is genial.Tiene lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> good price and quick shipment</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my 8 year old daughter for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  I love the scent of the perfume! It does smell like cotton candy, but in a good way.  It is a soft sweet smell.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my favourite perfume. I have been using it since 2008 or there about.The compliments just never cease!</li>
            <li> Excellent !!! It worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> very good product and excellent service and speed</li>
            <li> Although, this fragrance is not what I would typically purchase, I&#x27;m okay with it. I don&#x27;t know why, but I was expecting something sweet like cotton candy or something. Yes, it sounds strange, but I like to wear sweet smelling fragrances in the spring and summer. Again, not too bad, though!</li>
            <li> I discovered this scent at the beauty salon. My shampoo girl always wears this and I smelled it each time she washed my hair. I asked her what she was wearing and she said she didn&#x27;t know the name but it was a pink bottle made by Britney Spears. I searched online and immediately found this. I absolutely love this scent and now get complimented on it everytime I wear it. Great fragrance!</li>
            <li> Omg I just love this Perfume smells awesome nice and fruity I will totally be buying this again best stuff ever</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PERFUMES . I ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS WHILE WEARING THIS FRAGRANCE. I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERRYONE OF ALL AGES.. ON SOME REAL THOE</li>
            <li> I finally decided to purchase this perfume after noticing that I would go to smell it every single time I was at Target! I just really like the smell. It somewhat reminds me of some of the summer Escada fragrances they release every year. It&#x27;s got a similar feel. The bottle is cool, although not horribly well made. Overall though I really love this perfume. For about the $30 I spent on it, I think it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved his fragrance for quite some time and it&#x27;s still amazing. Not too strong and very sexy.</li>
            <li> All i can say is like OMG! this parfum is the best flavor i have ever had and i like it so much! i will always buy this parfum!</li>
            <li> It has always been one of my favourite scents! Love that sweet vanilla smell! It came in a good condition, the box was original. The price is good! I will order it again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even like Brittney spears that much, but she has lovely scents. This one is kind of different then most. A very sweet smell. This came out during middle school for me and I still wear it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like it used to at all. I used to wear it back in 05-07. It seems that the formula has changed now. My body chemistry may have changed since then and it could have to do with season, so if I like it any better as it gets warmer I will update.</li>
            <li> Mixes well with my sweat...well, what I mean is, even if I sweat it doesn&#x27;t wear off or smell bad.</li>
            <li> I basically grew up despising perfumes because most of them just smelled like old ladies to me, but I was very impressed by this perfume. It doesn&#x27;t remind me of old ladies at all; it&#x27;s very sweet and unique. I don&#x27;t know how people could ever dislike this perfume, I think it smells amazing. This perfume changed my mind about perfumes in general, and now I&#x27;m more open to trying new stuff.</li>
            <li> I was in search for the perfect perfume. I did research online, read reviews, looked at polls... so I went to the department store to smell the top 10 perfumes. I was kind of disgusted-- I think I tried almost every single female perfume available and I was ready to give up when my fiance kindingly asked about the Britney Spears Fantasy perfume. I laughed at the round pink girly bottle and sprayed it on the tester paper to amuse him. I took a whiff with no expectations and I fell in love. My fiance smelled and couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing it smelled. In fact, the whole \\&quot;Fantasy\\&quot; line smells fantastic! It resembles a cotton candy scent without being too teeny bopper-ish, it definitely has a very elegant yet playful scent. I love the whole line, the regular fantasy is my favorite because my fiance always wants to rip my clothes off when he smells it. Very sexy, feminine, and not too young. Love it and it is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Asked for as a Christms present, I get to enjoy this gift I gave to another everyday that she wears it... the fragrance is terrific... the cost reasonable... the lingering aroma brings back all the good moments of gift giving</li>
            <li> This is quite a complex perfume and I don&#x27;t know anyone who doesn&#x27;t like it. I know of those who think it very sweet but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll go into sugar shock with this one like you might with Aquolina&#x27;s Pink. You can definitely smell the sweet, slightly citrus of the lychee and quince fruits after spraying but that fades to a softer vanilla-flavored cupcake with an oh-so subtle hint of chocolate. The dry down is wonderful! Exotic orris root (from the iris bulb) and a little musk and sandalwood. I LOVE this summer perfume. It is not strong but stays close and intimate on your skin and reminds me so much of every county fair I&#x27;ve ever been to holding hands on the ferris wheel, eating cotton candy with my boyfriend. I HIGHLY recommend this one!</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s fav and I don&#x27;t mind th smell too bad either on her :) I must have bought 3 dozen of these bottles by now and I still find it pleasant. Not a fan of Brittany Spears or the way she wreaked herself and made a terrible raunchy example of womanhood to girls everywhere but ither than that, this is a nice perfume.</li>
            <li> Yum, always get compliments on how good I smell from men and ladies.</li>
            <li> Recibi mi producto en la comodidad de mi hogar, en muy buen estado, el perfume es riquisimo, muy contenta con mi compra, recomiendo este perfume a todas las pavas de Venezuela..mi hija de veinte a&amp;ntilde;os lo usa todos los dias para la universidad y a sus compa&amp;ntilde;eras les encanta, dice que ya es fiel a este perfume porque se identifica con el..excelente compra y cuando lo acabe lo vuelvo a comprar..excelente para regalo de cumplea&amp;ntilde;os..le doy cinco merecidas estrellas</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wears this perfume and I cant get enought of it. I cant stop sniffing her hair. She smells like vanilla frosting and sugar. Smelling Britney Spears \\&quot;Fantasy\\&quot; triggers all kinds of fantasies for me...</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I am very picky about my perfume, actually anything with a smell I will use or have in my home. I feel sorry for my husband,I have a collection of perfumes under the sink, they just were not right! I love this perfume. It is so wonderful. I was wearing Ralph Lauren(just the reg. it is in a clear and blue bottle) before I purchased this product. This perfume smells like the most wonderful smell to men and woman, I  have had soo many people ask me what I was wearing and a few embarrasing moments. At first it does have the strong scent of vanilla but mixed with the most wonderful scent I have ever smelled. Every single one of my friends who smelled it,all bought it within one week. One friend, it was so funny, she left my house and drove straight to the store to purchase. I would say buy this and you will be SO pleased. So will whomever the special someone in your life may be, or in the future. Its also great because it stays true to scent all day. The initial scent calms down within an hour but with a lasting one that is to die for. It is a summer and winter fragrance. IT is just THE BEST I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent that lasts throughout the day</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, my signature scent. But the bottle I received was maybe old or something. It was weak and had kind of an after scent to it that just wasn&#x27;t right. Maybe it was just the bottle I got, but I won&#x27;t chance it again.</li>
            <li> not a fan of the singer herself but the fragrance is AWSOME!!  My girl smells great!!</li>
            <li> Smell is great, huge bottle</li>
            <li> great price for the amount. my wife loves it. happy wife, happy life. other than that. i do not care.</li>
            <li> My experience for this item is excellent! It&#x27;s perfect for my mom&#x27;s because it&#x27;s one of her favorite fragrances with others! I recommend this fragrances!</li>
            <li> This purfume is amazing. I originally tried it because I love Britney and I liked Curious a lot, but this one is most definitely my favorite now! It starts out with a soft vanilla, almost cotton candy smell, and then changes throughout the day to a little bit deeper, a little bit musky, but not too musky at all (I hate musky smells). I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t work the same for everyone but I love how it changes on me throughout the day! I get compliments on it constantly from people who are surprised when I say it&#x27;s from Britney! In the end, I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> The price is half what you pay at Ulta. But, I may be imagining this, but it seems the product itself is inferior. Same box and everything, but the scent does not last like the ones you buy from a professional retailer.</li>
            <li> I never would have thought to buy this perfume, me NOT being a Britney Spears fan in all. I tried some of this at my friend&#x27;s house and I loved it. I finally got myself a bottle! It smells really good and fresh. It&#x27;s kind of sweet smelling and it&#x27;s also very warm and inviting. It&#x27;s so soft &amp; elegant and can be worn anytime whether you&#x27;re snuggling up to watch movies with your boyfriend or going to a wedding! Whatever the occassion Fantasy is perfect!</li>
            <li> I gave it away. It wasn&#x27;t the scent that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pleasure to deal with amazon - everything is smooth and easy - thanks again for great service. - will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> smells great but it doesnt last very long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bottle its cool and pretty, I like the desing a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfume for over 8 years and I don&#x27;t plan on switching. Not only because I&#x27;m not the ultimate Britney fan but because it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I do like this scent and I get alot of people asking me what I am wearing,when I say Britney Spears they go REALLY?? But I do like it!!  I usually wear  Romance ,Angel,  Hermes, and other expensive ones but I do Like this it is a fun spray!!!! I will buy again..</li>
            <li> excellent product recommended .</li>
            <li> i personally think it&#x27;s too strong of a flowery smell, but if she sprays very little it isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and I love it on her!!!</li>
            <li> Gift for my sister. She loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume—I&#x27;ve been wearing it every day for a few years and get a lot of compliments on it. The 3.3 oz bottle lasts a long time, too. You don&#x27;t need to apply very much at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would mention, though, that I think this scent is better for younger women. I&#x27;m twenty and think it&#x27;s perfect for my age and for women probably up to 10 years older than I am. The best way to describe the scent is kind of sugary, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all, so long as you don&#x27;t apply too much!</li>
            <li> Ordered this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. She was/is very happy with it. Yours was the best price I could find anywhere. I&#x27;m sure she would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased thinking I was getting a great deal, but after a couple of days of use, the bottle started peeling and I noticed that the fragrance lasted only a few hours! Paying top dollar does not always ensure that you&#x27;ll get a better product, however perfume may be the exception.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift &amp; have been buying it ever since! I recommend this perfume to everyone! It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!! It smells so nice, and it lasts. Unlike other perfumes that don&#x27;t last long, I spray it in the morning and I still smell it at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume yet besides burberry</li>
            <li> This used to be one of my favorite perfumes a couple years ago so I thought I would order it since it has been a while since I have had it. When it arrived, the perfume was dull and has no life to it whatsoever. The smell lasts no longer than 10 minutes. Waste of money</li>
            <li> I used to use this perfume before. it was cheaper than the store. so I worried about the quality and if it is copy from the origin fragment. but when I tried it it was very good.</li>
            <li> I brought this a few years ago on a whim. I was pleasantly surprised when I first put it on. The smell is just perfect for me! I favor more musky notes, but this scent is a nice blend of musky and sweet. I get so many compliments every time I wear it. The body cream that comes in some of the gift sets is great too. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Well, for the most part, I have previously owned this fragrance and I loved it to peices. I decided to oreder it again, and it was just what I expected. Arrived on time and the packaging was new and in tact. I would definitly not hesitate to order this again from amazon.. Great Job....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this fragrance to anyone who love sweet and seductive smells.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say, I am not a fan of Britney Spears, but this perfume smells amazing! I received a bottle a few years ago as a gift and now it&#x27;s all I wear. I am always getting compliments on it, even from strangers. Love it!</li>
            <li> Favorite!  Everywhere  I go I&#x27;m told I smell so good.You don&#x27;t need much at all.I can&#x27;t believe that I can spray it on at 8am by even 5pm I am being told I smell good.It is not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> This perfume is AMAZING. I&#x27;m a total perfume snob. I&#x27;ve gone through countless of designer potions and have spent way too much money on all of them. But, I am not lying when I say that this perfume continues to turn heads. Of all of my perfumes, this one is the one I&#x27;ve gotten the most compliments on... mostly from men! It&#x27;s sweet and seductive in the most perfect way. You wouldn&#x27;t think so, but this perfume tops the charts by far. TRUST ME LADIES!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome Smell!!!!!I get alot of compliments about it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Britney Spears Fantasy is a warm, musky, sweet, long-lasting fragrance that is fun and romantic, in a silly, juvenile way.  The notes include red lychee, golden quince, kiwi, cupcake accord, jasmine, white chocolate orchid, musk, woods, and orris root, but the cupcake, musk, and white chocolate seem to stick around the longest.  While it&#x27;s not as sickly sweet as that baby powder-smelling spray from the drug store, it&#x27;s definitely not for someone who likes a more complex, mature or spicy scent.  That being said, this is my third (!) bottle of Fantasy, despite preferring fragrances more along the lines of Chanel Chance or Marc Jacobs Daisy, and I find it to be a comforting, youthful, addictive scent that I will probably continue to buy in the future.  (And PS- Amazon&#x27;s price is great!)</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift and the person who received it was delighted!</li>
            <li> Hi guys, get this for your lady, she will love it, and I love how it smell on her, the price is unbelievable for what you get in return, hi have too rate this 5 stars, for what I get in return, and of course she love it too, good return for the money as I said before.</li>
            <li> ME ENCANTA ESTE PERFUME, MUY BUENO.</li>
            <li> This was on my nieces Christmas list and I lived the large size and thought it was a great deal. It does smell very nice also. Came right on time too!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter in law, and from what she tell me, she loves it very much!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this perfume many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one if the best I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also purchased other &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; perfumes that do not last the day, but with Fantasy, I can still smell it when I get home from work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an excellent everyday perfume!</li>
            <li> One of my favorites!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy a lot of perfume but this one works so well with my body. I get compliments ALL the time about how I smell really nice. It is definitely a head-turner (I work in a place which is mostly male-dominated, and they all tell me how nice I smell). But with all scents, you should try it before you buy it.</li>
            <li> Love Britney&#x27;s Fantasy Parfum.......  It stays on your skin longer than more expensive Parfums that I have.  Amazon always comes through with my purchases......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this perfume from Dillard&#x27;s and walmart many times before saw this great deal and thought I&#x27;d go for it but when I received it in the mail today it&#x27;s not the real fantasy! It smells similar but isn&#x27;t as strong and doesn&#x27;t last spend an extra 20 bucks at the most and get the real deal not happy at all waste of money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly surprised at the reaction I get with this fragrance that my daughter described as something like cotton-candy and vanilla, but better.  This is a great fragrance for feeling fun and flirty, fresh and perhaps even a little coy - you smell innocent, but are you?</li>
            <li> It scores in my book.  Was better in the bottle and not on the bathroom floor when she broke it, but that&#x27;s beside the point.</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance for very special moments and conquer the beloved .... I recommend it very good offer fast and secure</li>
            <li> excellent product as described on this page, highly recommended, really fast if the occasion volvere to buy with you thank you very much for everything</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN BUYING THIS PERFUME FOR YEARS.  I JUST LOVE THE SCENT. I CANNOT REALLY DESCRIBE THE SCENT, IT IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE BRITNEY SPEARS FRAGRANCE.  IT IS JUST AMAZING.  THE GREAT THING WITH ORDERING FROM AMAZON IS THE FACT THAT I PAID APPROX. $30 FOR 3.3 OUNCES.  REGULAR DEPARTMENT STORES CHARGE $50+ FOR THE SAME SIZE PLUS FREE SHIPPING.  GREAT DEAL.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my sister because some of her friends had it and she liked it.  She really wanted some so I got it for her as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.It stays for a week and more.Nice strawberry smell,just love it.Yes i would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> The product fulfilled my expectations were on time without imperfections, recommended 100% for all purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much for your attention</li>

            <li> Love Love this perfume. I get so many compliments everyday .</li>
            <li> Recommend. very nice!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> its probably fake! it doesn&#x27;t last long and doesn&#x27;t even smell the way it should because i have used this before. Nothing was the same this time I bought it from Amazon. disappointed!!</li>
            <li> muy serios con el env&amp;iacute;o, todo lleg&amp;oacute; al lugar de destino sin ninguna novedad, recomiendo este art&amp;iacute;culo a todos, muy seria la tienda a la que le hice la compra</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my girlfriend. It was actually pretty funny, because we were looking for a random perfume, and we finally choosed this one. We&#x27;re very satisfied. My girlfriend loved the sweet smell, and I loved to see her happy. We recommend this perfume, you won&#x27;t get dissappointed.</li>
            <li> Always love this perfume. Wearing it since highschool and now I&#x27;m 30. I&#x27;ll never grow out of this scent. Lol</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite frangances. I love the smell. It&#x27;s 100% original. I will purchase it again. :)</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume every since it came out &amp; tried to take a break from it by switching to other smells but NOTHING comes close to fantasy!!! This perfume stays on you &amp; your clothes all day long &amp; smells so classy not flowery at all</li>
            <li> My wife loves this &amp;#34;Parfum&amp;#34;  though I would rather not send money to britney spears, because she is a no talent hack.  however the wife likes it so I continue to get it to her.</li>
            <li> I love Britney Spears Fantasy and I just received my product. It is not broken and is looks just like the picture. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume that I wear other than Lolita Lempicka. Unfortunately, my husband hates Lolita Lempicka. We went to the store together and I tried on every fragrance. This is the only one that he liked. It reminded him of a cupcake. As soon as I smelled it, I loved it too! It&#x27;s so sweet and girly. I get so many compliments. I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years now.</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing!!! Not to sweet but not to musky. It lasts for a very long time and people can smell you from a mile away.</li>
            <li> Bought for granddaughter and she really liked it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It&#x27;s fresh, bright, makes you feel young, radiant, special. I really recommend it, it is a very rich fragrance for those who like sweet but not cloying fragrance. This is one of the few fragrances that have fallen in love from the first time I met her. It is very good for both day and night. I recommend it! The seller was very satisfied, met all my expectations!</li>
            <li> Smells OK.....but it kinda get old fast...Seems more like a starter perfume for teens. My wife and daughter like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she loved it. It smells really good, a very sweet fragance. It is not expensive but doesnt smell cheap at all.</li>
            <li> Very good shopping experience</li>
            <li> I got this because I was searching for something that smelled like Debbie Gibson&#x27;s Electric Youth perfume.  Sadly, it does not.  It&#x27;s too purfumey for me and now it&#x27;s just sitting in my closet.  I did attempt to mix it with Bath &amp; Body Works&#x27; Secret Wonderland (discontinued in stores) and that does smell slightly more Electric Youth-like but not really the same.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to buy a rancid bottle of Electric Youth and take my chances with that.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite scent since it first came out so naturally I&#x27;m always in a panic when I run out. It was nice to find it on Amazon, not have to venture into a store AND still receive the item quickly before I completely ran out :)</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!!! It smells amazing!!! I would definitely recommend if your into fruity &amp; sexy woman smell! I always get compliments even from men.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the perfume is not making the way it used to years ago but it smells like knock off to me. You can&#x27;t even smell it .This is very disappointing I purchased it as a early Christmas present for myself and I was eager to receive it. I just threw it in the garbage. I will never order perfume from Amazon again!!!!</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my daughter. She like this perfume very much!</li>
            <li> On time I receive the item in Colombia, without damage, and good quality</li>
            <li> Product arrived early and in perfect condition but I had to take a few stars off for the quality of the scent.... It has had its formula changed to(as I also read) less white chocolate warmth to a strong overpowering kiwi. Too bad. The packaging is also different from my 2006 original bottle. Such a shame. Great seller, but won&#x27;t repurchase until they bring the old formula(and box!) back.</li>
            <li> I like you, but I don&#x27;t to be waiting for perfum, but valid wait. thank you so much bye. Brazil</li>
            <li> bought for my granddaughter; she loved it</li>
            <li> It is my signature scent, this is my 4th bottle of fantasy, I have all of the fantasy line, but I like this one better just because every time I have it on everyone just wants to hug me or kiss me hahahaha, it is a great perfume. One guy told me that this perfume had to be illegal because he just couldn&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> I love smelling nice and one of the nicest compliments I can get is that I smell nice, and this happens often when I wear this perfume. I really think it is the epitome of a feminine perfume because it is so sweet and throughout the day has a light scent that actually sticks around instead of fading! The perfume bottle is pretty as well, but honestly I could care less if it was in an ugly bottle, it doesn&#x27;t take anything away from how great this perfume smells.</li>
            <li> This is my oldest daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> This bottle came to me EMPTY!! There was no sign of a cracked bottle or anything but when I unwrapped the package, there was literally and empty bottle. I spent decent money on it so I think it sucks that I have to wait for it to be shipped ALL over again. Dissapointed</li>
            <li> Satisfecha con la compra. El vendedor muy responsable. El perfume huele muy bien aunque muy dulce para mi gusto. El producto me llego en buenas condiciones. Saludos desde Venezuela!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this perfume many times and have never had any problems with buying it off of Amazon until now. I received the package which was wrapped up perfectly, there was no sign of damage, and it did not smell as if the liquid had leaked out. But when I opened it I discovered that the bottle was completely empty, there was not even a drop of perfume left in it. This poor review has nothing to do with the actual Britney Spears Fantasy Eau de Parfum (which I love and think it smells amazing), it is in regards to the empty perfume bottle which I paid $35 for. I have heard cautionary tales about buying things like this off of Amazon but always felt comfortable as long as it was actually from the Amazon Warehouse/Amazon seller but now I have learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> She is happy with it.</li>
            <li> I buy this every year for my mom as a gift. She loves it. Amazon has it cheaper than most online stores as well, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Todo muy bien. Me gusto... Fue lo que pedi... llego a tiempo... Excelente, recomendando 100%...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saludos desde Valencia - Venezuela...</li>
            <li> Calidad de productos 100% Confiable y seguro si si si si si si si si si si si si si si si si si si si !</li>
            <li> If it were affordable I would say ten stars!  I have to cut back on a star due to the price. You can find this at drug store, wallys etc but it&#x27;s pricey for me anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a perfect scent if you like sweet but not gag-you-sweet.  There are knockoffs of this at the dollar store and if you like that, but want something a little smoother, get Spears&#x27; perfume.  It&#x27;s light but noticable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually end up washing perfume off.  I hate ultra strong or asian inspired scents or too fruity or too musky :)  I love this perfume because it&#x27;s lovely.  A very girly/womanly scent without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My niece and I tried it on at JC Penny and kept smelling our wrists, going on and on about how wonderful the scent was.  I plan to buy her a bottle for her birthday. If it was cheaper, I&#x27;d get some for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I wear Bath and Body&#x27;s Noel Christmas scent or their cotton scent.  I also love original Chloe but again..lol..too much money for perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Edit: I have to admit I love a bargain..hoping that you do too, I found the &#x27;copy cat&#x27; scent at most Dollar Tree stores to be even better!  That&#x27;s right..better.  I have five bottles of it, I even use it as an air scent in my bedroom!  I did buy the original, real Fantasy for my niece for Christmas, and compared the two a few times.  No kidding, the dollar store knock-off version is even better! Woohoo!!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! It&#x27;s very romantic and seductive. It&#x27;s not \\&quot;stuffy\\&quot; at all, very soft and sweet. I get compliments on this scent all the time....including from my guy! Not a fan of Britney herself, but I have to admit, this is a great scent from her line. I will continue to buy this product as long I can!</li>
            <li> As advertised, good price</li>
            <li> This was what I spected, it has a wonderful fruit smell! I enjoy when my wife us it. I fully recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not really sure on how I feel about this scent. I purchased it for my sister and she wore it a few times but quickly became sick of it noting that it was too overpowering for just one small squirt.  I personally found the scent offensive and overpowering.  This won&#x27;t be something I buy again.</li>
            <li> Two words to describe this...Warm and Sweet...It has some flower notes in there though that counteract with the sweetness... they are very very slight and definitely in the background of the white chocolate vanilla sugar! Honestly perfumes don&#x27;t usually have this power over me but this scent is almost mouth watering, but without being foodie or syrupy. I still remember the first time I smelled this, when it came out, around 2005 when I was 13. I instantly loved it then and still love it now at 22. I smelled it only once in 2005 and just smelled it again today when I bought it. I&#x27;ve remembered the scent for like 8 years :)...IT&#x27;S THAT UNIQUE!! Clearly it&#x27;s very recognizable... It&#x27;s not immature though. Very different than scents like Mariah Carey&#x27;s junk and Pink Sugar. Pink Sugar is what I would consider immature. It&#x27;s a very memorable fragrance....and has such a huge silage. The dry down reminds me a little bit of Burberry Brit. I smelled this on a girl the other day and thought she was wearing Brit but she told me it was Fantasy.</li>
            <li> Because the item was great, Perfume smells good, nothing that I dislike about this perfume. I would like to recommend this product to a friend and co-worker.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase, a very nice fragance, according to the request, very good service, 100% satisfied customer, thank for your attention...</li>
            <li> I love all things perfume!  I have quite the collection from high-end $500+ to lower-end perfumes.  This is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I hate her but I love this perfume. I get compliments on it when I wear it. The bottle is cute too.</li>
            <li> what i expected.  i suggest trying at the store first, then buying online, my baby momma loved it for mothers day</li>
            <li> I buy this for my daughter and she loves it! Seeing her happy makes it worth the price. Cute bottle...</li>
            <li> Love this perfum. Excellent price. Thanks</li>
            <li> My nine year old daughter and I love this perfume! We seats get TONS of compliments while wearing it! The bottles are very strong too. My sweet 16 month old has knocked it onto the bathroom floor a few times and no damage was done to the bottle.</li>
            <li> excelente producto llego en el tiempo previsto recomiendo a la tienda</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  I get compliments on it all the time</li>
            <li> Just as described, arrived on time, great product GF Is happy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find REALLY nice perfumes for good prices, so this was a treat. It&#x27;s a great scent, and the bottle is actually pretty big.</li>
            <li> looks and smells just like the ones in the store.. I love it the sent is good for anytime and never gets on my nerves. I would also say its good for any age.. im in my mid 20&#x27;s and my 14 year old niece also loves it.</li>
            <li> Amazing fragance. First I got this one for myself and then my mom stole it because she liked it! So she kept it. And she bought another bottle once that one was gone.&lt;br /&gt;I got it again for a friend because she smell reminds me so much of her. The perfume smells very sweet, not necessarily fresh, but condensed, warm, and more sweet again xD&lt;br /&gt;I plan to get another one for me soon :]</li>
            <li> fast delivery, beautiful gift.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in a timely manner. Very happy with my purchase. Delicious scent.</li>
            <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth purchase of this parfum! My sister and I just love it. I don&#x27;t know what it has but the boys just love the smell and feel attracted to us when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want to glam and feel attractive this parfum is just perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I actually never wore any cologne or perfumes growing up. However, i remember one day I was at a target and i came across this bottle. I read who it was and at the time i was obessed over Britney Spears so i decided to take whiff. OMG, this scent is very feminine but it is soooo delicious! Every time i smell it i wish i could eat it! Almost like cotton candy. Ever since then I ahve become obsessed with celebrity perfumes. Britney Spears started it all for me lol Great scent, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this perfume rocks,but it&#x27;s normal,for everyday use...Nothing special about it.Though thank you,amazon,for your amazing service,you rock!</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT, EXCELLENT QUALITY, IS TOTALLY WHAT I ASKED, 100% SATISFIED, THE DELIVERY WAS QUICK AND SAFE ON YOUR ESTIMATED TIME FOR DELIVERY, THANKS FOR THE SERVICE</li>
            <li> i got it for my mom because i had heard good things and it was affordable.  i wasnt dissappointed.  the perfume does not smell cheap (which to me smells like alcohol). it also did not smell like a little girl which i was worried it would because of the bottle design</li>
            <li> I am very pleased the perfume it is perfect and the shipping was fast so that is so awesome, I would recommend to everyone. This perfume has a sweet scent love it</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It&#x27;s sweet, but not cloying or sickeningly so.  Many perfumes give me a headache, but this doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It opens with a strong fruit smell.  I don&#x27;t mind it, but it isn&#x27;t great.  Luckily it disappears 20 minutes later, and starts to smell sweet and flowery.  I get some florals, chocolate, and musk scent.  I don&#x27;t really get cotton candy from it.  I smelled cake very faintly one day, but not enough as I&#x27;d like.  It&#x27;s mostly like smelling a box of chocolates next to a bouquet of flowers.  It&#x27;s soft and lasts a long time.  I got some on my jacket and it still smelled 3 days later.  That was from just one spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to spray a shirt with it, but it seems to spray a large amount each time and I don&#x27;t know if it would go on evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite perfume from Britney&#x27;s line so far.  Some are strong and sharp.  This is soft and pretty.  I also like the look of the bottle.  It&#x27;s deep pink and cute.  The large bottle has some weight to it, but not heavy.  It&#x27;s fun to hold.  I&#x27;m trying to collect each bottle size, but this 100ml is the best value.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent! Even over all the ritzy expensive ones. Everytime I wear this out I literally have people stopping me and telling me how good I smell and what is it? They are always surprised when I tell them its Britney Spears Fantasy. I have been wearing this for over 5 years now and I dont plan on changing that anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Delicious, really sweet</li>
            <li> Great price, came on time and nicely packaged. I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like cotton candy to me.</li>
            <li> My daughter love this!</li>
            <li> hasta la fecha no he recibido el producto.</li>
            <li> My favorite cheap perfume. Always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the same and the spray doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> always get compliments on this perfume</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the timely arrival of my product.  It was in great condition just as was stated on the website.  Overall, it was a great purchasing experience!</li>
            <li> great price, excellent service,  My wifes fave so now it is mine too. Great deal, worth the search. Couldn&#x27;t find a better price.</li>
            <li> Although I am way over the target demographic for this fragrance (I&#x27;m 41), I just love it and keep coming back to it. It shares shelf space with my Chanels, my Lauders and my Marc Jacobses, unashamedly. From the first time I sampled Fantasy, I knew it was so wrong (Britney? Cupcake accord?) and yet so right (smells like heaven!). Although I&#x27;m not big on gourmand scents in general-- Angel smells more like Hell on me-- Fantasy is very well-done and the notes skillfully blended, so that it isn&#x27;t a saccharine overload. I like the tropical fruits in the opening, but I like what comes next even more: sweet vanilla buttercream with a soft, mysterious, \\&quot;hovering\\&quot; note of powdery orris and woods. It&#x27;s that \\&quot;hovering\\&quot; soft-sweet-light quality that makes Fantasy so amazing, and so sexy. Really a great fragrance, as long as you don&#x27;t take yourself *too* seriously. I&#x27;m not the Queen of England, so I don&#x27;t need to worry about it. I certainly don&#x27;t feel out of place wearing it to work, and I have a professional office job. GO GET THIS!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It smells so wonderful, I am hooked! The price is amazing. I recommend it to all ages!  It is a must have! Arrived many days before estimated delivery date!</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE: I read some reviews about this being fake or defective. If you&#x27;re wanting to buy this but you&#x27;re on the fence, just order directly from AMAZON! They will not give you any fake perfume. DO NOT ORDER FROM ANY OTHER SELLER! I love this perfume it lasts all day and smells so good! I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Smells great. My girlfriend wanted it as a gift but i did not know how it smelt. After smelling it i fell in love with the scent.It smells very lady like, not too strong for those with sinus or allergy problems. Nice fragrance to wear dinner, party and  special occasions</li>
            <li> I go back and forth with this fragrance. I am not a Britney fan and spent a long time thinking assuming this was totally overrated and boring and only got popular based on her fame. I finally bought a small bottle based on the notes and while some days I love it, others I want to wash it off right away. Yes, it is a creamy, fruity, sweet gourmand but there is something about the kiwi note that sometimes smells like rotting fruit. This scent is very heavy with huge sillage so if you don&#x27;t absolutely love it don&#x27;t bother because you&#x27;re going to be walking around in a Fantasy cloud all day. I mean it, people can smell this on you even after you leave the room if you overdo it just a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a few other Fantasy fragrances but unfortunately the original is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance, I liked the recommend. The store has been very professional and attentive. I will return to buy Parlux Fragrances</li>
            <li> It Is exactly what I had expected!!  It smells just like my previous one. It is big. I was skeptical to buy fragrances online but with this purchase I see that it is ok.</li>
            <li> Hardly any scent, so you don&#x27;t save any money getting this larger amount, you can just go to Walmart and buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> I get compliments almost every time I wear this perfume from men and women. People are usually surprised when I say it&#x27;s a Britney Spears fragrance, I guess they were expecting me to say Prada or something. Nope...it&#x27;s Britney, b*tch. I will be wearing this one for a loooog time.</li>
            <li> As the description states, this perfume has top notes of Lychee, Quince &amp; Kiwi; middle notes of Cupcake, Jasmine &amp; White Chocolate Orchid; finish of Creamy Musk, Orris Root &amp; Sensual Woods. This perfume is extremely popular because the scent is just wonderful. It, to me, is less musty than Hidden Fantasy and I can&#x27;t decide which one I like better. Also, I used to be a perfume snob and think britney couldn&#x27;t possibly make a good perfume... I was wrong. They are deliciously yummy smelling. Oh, but you may find yourself having to re-apply later in the day because this scent does not last all day.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> I decided to try Fantasy because I liked Curious alot and thought it was a great casual perfume. The Magnolia reminded me of home. Fantasy however, has quickly become one of my favorite perfumes of all time. I have gotten compliments in a variety of settings, and I see no reason why a professional woman could not wear it. It adds a hint of ultra feminine sexiness to any...</li>
            <li> I buy this every year for my daughter, as it is the scent she likes.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear it myself, so I cannot comment on it&#x27;s smell, although she doesn&#x27;t smell terrible!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good price, and she&#x27;s happy with it!</li>
            <li> Snooki&#x27;s perfume cost less and smelled better!  Wish I never bothered trying this one.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It&#x27;s authentic (which needs to be said online), and smells like a beachy fresh citrus! I love it!!!!</li>

            <li> I love this perfum. It&#x27;s a must have. I wear it everyday. It&#x27;s not strong &amp; smells so good. Everyone compliments me.</li>

            <li> El aroma perdura por horas, es un perfume de calidad.</li>
            <li> Hands down my most favorite perfume... If it ever was discontinued, I would cry.  It&#x27;s hard to describe a scent but it&#x27;s not really a floral smell, but it is sweet.  It sort of smells vanilla-y and fresh, with a hint of woods, but not musky.  I hate musky smells.  My only complaint would be that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long on, maybe two to three hours, but I could just be use to it.  A very pretty and pleasing smell for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. it smells really good not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this and she loves the scent. She received it first as a gift and decided to order more when it run out......</li>
            <li> I was very unsure about buying this perfume because I usually just stick with the simple body mists from local stores.  But the size of the bottle is definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Another worry of mine was that the smell would be too &amp;#34;young&amp;#34;  for me, but once I smelled it, I didn&#x27;t care!  It smells sweet and the most noticeable scent is the vanilla cupcake.  It almost has a cotton candy like scent.  This is not overpowering though.  As long as you stick with the perfume rule (spray on wrist and dab at neck)  It will fit perfectly without insulting your loved ones noses.  I would definitely recommend this scent to any sweet people I know!</li>
            <li> This one was a gift for my sister and she loved</li>
            <li> I buy it for my mom she loves it</li>
            <li> Great value. I shopped around at christmas and this was the best value. Love the fragrance, and it arrived as expected. Nice packaging too.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this and so do I</li>
            <li> 5 Star!! Classic &amp;#34;hot girl smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Never disappoints when I use it. People alwys say I smell delicious. Been using this for 7 yrs and it still gets compliments. Try it u will love it. Very sexy scent.</li>
            <li> para todo aquel que le gusten los perfumes esta es una opci&amp;oacute;n excelente, llego sin problema y muy bien envuelto</li>
            <li> hello, my friend! the product is of excellent quality and complies with all the features exposed by you. I have no complaints whatsoever! Thank you very much and happy day!</li>
            <li> OMG this stuff smells awesome</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT ARTICLE. EXPECTATIONS FULFILLED THAT DESCRIBED IN THE SITE. VERY GOOD SUPPLIER. I RECOMMEND IT. VERY GOOD CARE.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard trusting a complete strangers judgment on something you&#x27;ve never even tried, but I honestly think you&#x27;d still be very pleased if you bought this perfume before smelling it first! This is one of my few favorite perfumes! I can&#x27;t really explain the scent, but I can say it&#x27;s different than everything else I&#x27;ve ever smelled. I&#x27;m just in LOVE with this perfume! I get many compliments when I wear it! My sister bought me brittany spears \\&quot;curious\\&quot; for my birthday since she knew I loved fantasy and by my surprise, I didn&#x27;t like the scent at all! It smelled like what a lot of elderly women wear. I actually exchanged it for another perfume! So if you&#x27;ve tried curious and didn&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t think fantasy is similar! And if your thinking of getting this perfume, get it! You WON&#x27;T be unhappy!!</li>
            <li> &#x27;Fantasy&#x27; is a well-known perfume created by/endorsed by Britney Spears.  Originally released in 2005 (succeeding Spears&#x27; blockbuster 2004 fragrance &#x27;Curious&#x27;), &#x27;Fantasy&#x27; has spawned numerous spin-off flanker fragrances.  However, it&#x27;s the original &#x27;Fantasy&#x27; that is most remembered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Fantasy&#x27; is a bottle full of festive sweet treats, notably cotton candy &amp; cupcake accord.  The cotton candy is noticeable, but isn&#x27;t overpowering a la Aqualina&#x27;s &#x27;Pink Sugar&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;d recommend this for tweens-young adults.  &#x27;Fantasy&#x27; may be perceived as a &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; fragrance to older women &amp; the bottle design may be a turn-off, but it&#x27;s all about preference.</li>
            <li> cute perfume when you want to smell sweet(:</li>
            <li> I love this parfume and wear it daily. I work in a busy medical office as a healthcare professional and I get compliments all the time. If is sexy and feminine but not overbearing. If you like Heidi Klum Shine, you will love this.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume and I have ordered it many times! I will probably keep ordering it as long as she wants it!!</li>
            <li> This is a very sweet smelling parfum. I bought it on purpose for springtime. I love that it last all day and is not over powering. I would recommend this for anyone wanting a flowery springtime fragrance. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opini&amp;oacute;n les sea &amp;uacute;til.</li>
            <li> Smells very good, I love this perfume. Subtle and never over powering.</li>
