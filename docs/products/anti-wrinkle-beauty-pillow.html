            <li>So finding the Beauty Pillow was absolutely wonderful for me.</li>
            <li>The design of this pillow is probably the best out of all 4 pillows I tried to prevent sleeping wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I thought that this pillow would be the end for my search for the best anti-wrinkle pillows flooding the market.</li>

            <li>My neck feels great</li>
            <li>Love this pillow!!  </li>
            <li>It is also good for neck support while seated.</li>
            <li>SO glad I did!</li>
            <li>Each day my face is looking BETTER than the morning before!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this pillow!  </li>
            <li>This pillow is amazing for preventing wrinkles on your face.</li>
            <li>or so I started to sleep a bit better, but never did get a good night&#x27;s sleep using it.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable in any sleeping position.</li>
            <li>Love the pillow - even took it with me on a three week trip to India.  </li>
            <li>My neck does not hurt and I no longer wake up with wrinkles from sleeping on my face (which take hours to smooth out!).</li>
            <li>now what else do you have for me? :)</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have bed head anymore either :)  </li>
            <li>Score!  :-)  </li>
            <li>Bedtime is better with this.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Each night has gotten better.</li>
            <li>But I do think it&#x27;s making my neck pain better.</li>
            <li>I love that I do not sweat with this pillow.</li>
            <li>I find this is the best shaped pillow for sleeping in all different positions.</li>
            <li>I love this pillow.  </li>
            <li>but mostly I use it</li>
            <li>I love my pillow.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it fit around your neck and stays there all night.</li>
            <li>but now that I am used to it, I have found I go to sleep on my side, but wake up on my back (the ideal sleeping position).  </li>
            <li>, my face looks much better and I am sleeping soundly as well.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine when the case is on, but I&#x27;d like to wash it and</li>
            <li>I found it easy and comfortable to use as recommended in that position.  </li>
            <li>Cheap quality.  </li>
            <li>It is so comfortable, I bought it to counter squish face, which it works well for, but I would still use it even if it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so comfortable and</li>
            <li>So comfortable and never have puffy eyes in the am.  </li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t have much faith it would work.</li>
            <li>My neck is in the right position to sleep well on my side which is the most important thing for me.</li>
            <li>The concept of this pillow is right on, but at $49.00 the product should have been made much better.  </li>
            <li>I noticed immediately that the folds on my face have reduced significantly.</li>
            <li>If you are a side sleeper and don&#x27;t want to have wrinkles on your face this will help tremendously.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles did gradually fade away in this time, which was a mild surprise.  </li>
            <li>Simple, very comfortable and does the trick!</li>
            <li>I can tell it is not mashing wrinkles into the side of my face the way normal pillows do, because it isn&#x27;t smudgy crushing my face.  </li>
            <li>The shape is great, but the surface of the pillow is HARD.  </li>
            <li>After a restless first week</li>
            <li>Much to hot for summer</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not using it exactly how I should.</li>
            <li>and I love sleeping on my back -</li>
            <li>It feels amazing and so cozy.</li>
            <li>Now I sleep so soundly ,which I really didn&#x27;t expect and don&#x27;t go back on my side..  </li>
            <li>The newer one is much thicker and hotter</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to sleep on my back as well, as my head does not move.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s now much softer and has been getting a lot of praise from customers since the change.</li>
            <li>but now I have no problems and sleep very well with no sleep lines on my face when I wake up.</li>
            <li>really well supported.</li>
            <li>I started using it because I was waking up  very morning with lines in my face.  </li>
            <li>The silk is no longer as soft as before and the pillow is not as full--I had to I had to add my own fluff!</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical about purchasing this pillow, but now I am so happy that I did!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this!  </li>
            <li>The bottom line is we move at night, it&#x27;s natural, and with this pillow there is no flexibility other than 3 stringent positions of on back, on a full left and on a full right side</li>
            <li>I now use it exactly as pictured described (occasionally)</li>
            <li>I ended up using it for nearly a year.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The white cover gets very stained eventually so I&#x27;d recommend a darker color.  </li>
            <li>so I naturally tend to squish my face against the pillow all night, which in turn gives me skin folds.</li>
            <li>Put the new pillowcase on my old pillow and finally started sleeping again!  </li>
            <li>I had started to get deep wrinkles just from sleeping on a normal pillow.  </li>
            <li>The worst pillow ever - great concept, but I don&#x27;t know who could sleep comfortably on this thing.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of that and absolutely cannot sleep on my back so starting doing some research online to see if anything could help me.</li>
            <li>Have been sleeping so comfortably on my  side and decided a few months ago to try sleeping on my  back.</li>
            <li>SUPER cozy!  </li>
            <li>I found this pillow and was excited but saw that a couple people said that the pillow was hard.</li>
            <li>Slepping on the back is OK for a short period of time, but sleeping on my side, way too firm plus not much area to rest your head on.</li>
            <li>It started to flatten out and lose its firmness on around the 3rd night, and by the end of the week, it have completely lost the firmness and support it gave to my neck when sleeping, giving me neck pain and not enough support to raise my face to prevent it from squishing during sleep.</li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s due to the satin case, and I find the same results with my new case on the old pillow.  </li>
            <li>The first night was a bit uncomfortable, but thought my face is worth it so tried it again the next night.</li>

            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave me with flat bed head or squishy face</li>
            <li> Over the last few years I had developed sleep wrinkles on one side of my face, the result of sleeping on my side.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Material was cheaper than expected for such a steep price.</li>
            <li> The problem is the filling material doesn&#x27;t hold up for long.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the pillow for the last few months, and just this morning noticed the wrinkles are coming back.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that it took me several weeks to get used to the pillow, but now I can&#x27;t travel without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only took a few nights to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Very empty, regular polyfil used, not worth it, it is a rip off!</li>
            <li> One morning I awoke with wrinkles in places on my forehead and other places I never got before.  </li>
            <li> The first 2 nights -though were uncomfortable-</li>
            <li> I did expect it to do what it advertised it could, and I believe it does - what I did not expect was the extreme comfort and ease of use.  </li>
            <li> I expected things to not get worse, didn&#x27;t think it would clear up the existing winkles, but it did.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely not overly hard.</li>
            <li> but I found that it&#x27;s impossible to go through the whole night on my back without back pain, leg pain, and poor circulation.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to this pillow, you will want nothing else and it takes up so little space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to get use to the pillow, but I stuck it out.  </li>
            <li> So this gave me the confidence I needed to place my order a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> This pillow is too firm for me to sleep on.  </li>
            <li> i purchased this pillow as a gift for a friend as I has been sleeping on it a few years.</li>
            <li> It did take a few nights to get used to</li>
            <li> which I could never have imagined saying a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Added bonus - less bed head after using this pillow!</li>
            <li> The pillow very firm and not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> Or I can lay on my side as usual</li>
            <li> and they were all extremely uncomfortable or didn&#x27;t help keep me on my back one bit.</li>
            <li> Too hard.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I just thought I would review in response to a couple people who said the pillow is hard---</li>
            <li> I also find that this pillow is not as uncomfortable as other reviewers have noted.  </li>
            <li> The sewing on the cover is sloppy causing the fabric to wrinkle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 6 ft tall, noticed there is weak neck support for a longer neck and the contour of this arched pillow puts an uncomfortable amount of pressure on the lower jaw.  </li>
            <li> Anyway I wanted to mention this as an option in case others may also find prefer using it this way, as I notice a few disappointed customers.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The hardness of the pillow kept waking me, it&#x27;s just uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the silk pillowcases did not work and my face would look \\&quot;smooshed\\&quot; in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Way too expensive, don&#x27;t bother.  </li>
            <li> For the past 5 years or so, the eye skin has gotten so bad on my sleeping side, I looked 48!</li>
            <li> The anti wrinkle pillow is very expensive and it clamped around my neck in an uncomfortable manner.  </li>
            <li> I had also purchased some very expensive silk pillowcases as I was told that this would help to reduce the lines on my face.  </li>
            <li> So I decided, very skeptically to try this pillow.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was very disappointed with them all</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Now I am obsessed with my pillow!!!</li>

            <li> This pillow is amazing for preventing wrinkles on your face. If you are a side sleeper and don&#x27;t want to have wrinkles on your face this will help tremendously. It only took a few nights to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in Dec 2013.  Over the last few years I had developed sleep wrinkles on one side of my face, the result of sleeping on my side.  The wrinkles were not that deep, but enough to notice.  It took a few weeks to get use to the pillow, but I stuck it out.  I ended up using it for nearly a year.  The wrinkles did gradually fade away in this time, which was a mild surprise.  I expected things to not get worse, didn&#x27;t think it would clear up the existing winkles, but it did.  Granted, this may be because the wrinkles were just getting started.  I stopped using the pillow for the last few months, and just this morning noticed the wrinkles are coming back.  For me this is proof that the pillow works.</li>
            <li> best Pillow ever. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Love the pillow - even took it with me on a three week trip to India.  Reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because the seam in the back came apart and now exposes the stuffing inside.  That&#x27;s fine when the case is on, but I&#x27;d like to wash it and cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white cover gets very stained eventually so I&#x27;d recommend a darker color.  Once you get used to this pillow, you will want nothing else and it takes up so little space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***company contacted me and replaced. Great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is I stopped using because they change the pillowcase material. The newer one is much thicker and hotter so it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Bought this pillow after lots of research.  The company advises giving yourself some time to adjust, and so I stuck it out for about three months.  The shape is great, but the surface of the pillow is HARD.  Too hard.  After a restless first week or so I started to sleep a bit better, but never did get a good night&#x27;s sleep using it. The hardness of the pillow kept waking me, it&#x27;s just uncomfortable.  Finally threw in the towel a week ago, went to a local bedding store and found a satin pillowcase for $3.99 that feels, looks and seems to be equal in quality to the case sold for this pillow. Put the new pillowcase on my old pillow and finally started sleeping again!  As for preventing wrinkles, I did notice an improvement in sleep lines when I switched to the Anti Wrinkle Beauty Pillow - but I think that&#x27;s due to the satin case, and I find the same results with my new case on the old pillow.  Still use the Beauty Pillow to read in bed, but can&#x27;t get any beauty rest using it to sleep.    [[ASIN:B003E7HQ5I Anti Wrinkle Beauty Pillow (White)]]</li>
            <li> I have had this pillow for almost 1 year and I am very happy with it. My neck does not hurt and I no longer wake up with wrinkles from sleeping on my face (which take hours to smooth out!). It is comfortable to sleep on my back as well, as my head does not move. The only negative is that it took me several weeks to get used to the pillow, but now I can&#x27;t travel without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this pillow again a year after the above review and IT IS A DIFFERENT PRODUCT. The silk is no longer as soft as before and the pillow is not as full--I had to I had to add my own fluff! I did not return it because I need this shape of pillow but I will be looking for a similar product somewhere else. Again, it is totally different than before and I am quite unsatisfied with it.</li>
            <li> My estetician recently told me that I needed to start sleeping on my back in order to prevent wrinkles on the side of my face. WHAT!? I had never heard of that and absolutely cannot sleep on my back so starting doing some research online to see if anything could help me. I found this pillow and was excited but saw that a couple people said that the pillow was hard. I contacted the company and they let me know that they have changed fillings in the pillow and it&#x27;s now much softer and has been getting a lot of praise from customers since the change. So this gave me the confidence I needed to place my order a few weeks ago. Now I am obsessed with my pillow!!! It took about 4 days to get used to it but now I have no problems and sleep very well with no sleep lines on my face when I wake up. Also, I got some juvederm in my cheeks last week and I feel like this is helping protect it from being smushed or moved around while I sleep. I also use it to read!! Anyway, I just thought I would review in response to a couple people who said the pillow is hard--- it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li> I am now at the age where you can tell I am a stomach sleeper by my face. And, I am not big on going to the ends of the earth for my looks. So finding the Beauty Pillow was absolutely wonderful for me. Simple, very comfortable and does the trick! Thank you Vasseur for helping me stay youthful... now what else do you have for me? :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 6 ft tall, noticed there is weak neck support for a longer neck and the contour of this arched pillow puts an uncomfortable amount of pressure on the lower jaw.  If you have braces or Invisalign this will add to the discomfort using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watched the video and followed the instructions: [...]  One morning I awoke with wrinkles in places on my forehead and other places I never got before.  I also tried adding pillows around my body and this and that.  The bottom line is we move at night, it&#x27;s natural, and with this pillow there is no flexibility other than 3 stringent positions of on back, on a full left and on a full right side position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried taking naps with this but did not see any improvement with my crows feet unless I was hanging off the pillow which then gave not enough support.  I returned and they were prompt to ship to and send return info though you do pay shipping both ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Material was cheaper than expected for such a steep price.</li>
            <li> This pillow is too firm for me to sleep on.  Slepping on the back is OK for a short period of time, but sleeping on my side, way too firm plus not much area to rest your head on.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing this pillow, but now I am so happy that I did!  I had started to get deep wrinkles just from sleeping on a normal pillow.  I had also purchased some very expensive silk pillowcases as I was told that this would help to reduce the lines on my face.  Unfortunately, the silk pillowcases did not work and my face would look \\&quot;smooshed\\&quot; in the morning.  Each day it would take longer and longer for the wrinkles to diminish.  I have had this pillow for a week and have had no wrinkles!  I also find that this pillow is not as uncomfortable as other reviewers have noted.  I can finally sleep on my back with no snoring.  Or I can lay on my side as usual and I still have no lines in the morning!  And I don&#x27;t have bed head anymore either :)  I would definitely recommend this pillow to reduce/diminish sleep lines.</li>
            <li> The concept of this pillow is right on, but at $49.00 the product should have been made much better.  Cheap quality.  I am so disappointed. Way too expensive, don&#x27;t bother.  Very empty, regular polyfil used, not worth it, it is a rip off!</li>
            <li> I have tried 4 different pillows to prevent sleep wrinkles. I am a side sleeper so I naturally tend to squish my face against the pillow all night, which in turn gives me skin folds. I have tried to learn to sleep on my back but I found that it&#x27;s impossible to go through the whole night on my back without back pain, leg pain, and poor circulation. The design of this pillow is probably the best out of all 4 pillows I tried to prevent sleeping wrinkles. The first 2 nights -though were uncomfortable- I noticed immediately that the folds on my face have reduced significantly. The problem is the filling material doesn&#x27;t hold up for long. It started to flatten out and lose its firmness on around the 3rd night, and by the end of the week, it have completely lost the firmness and support it gave to my neck when sleeping, giving me neck pain and not enough support to raise my face to prevent it from squishing during sleep. It&#x27;s a shame because I thought that this pillow would be the end for my search for the best anti-wrinkle pillows flooding the market. Still haven&#x27;t found the perfect pillow.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly, as described, beautifully packaged.  SUPER cozy!  It is definitely not overly hard. I did expect it to do what it advertised it could, and I believe it does - what I did not expect was the extreme comfort and ease of use.  I believe this works well to avoid wrinkle making in the side sleep position.  I found it easy and comfortable to use as recommended in that position.  I can tell it is not mashing wrinkles into the side of my face the way normal pillows do, because it isn&#x27;t smudgy crushing my face.  lol  It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to figure out why this works.  Added bonus - less bed head after using this pillow! Score!  :-)  Bedtime is better with this. It is also good for neck support while seated.</li>
            <li> The anti wrinkle pillow is very expensive and it clamped around my neck in an uncomfortable manner.  Much to hot for summer that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> This pillow is wounderful. I love how it fit around your neck and stays there all night. Very comfortable in any sleeping position.</li>
            <li> After an entire days research, I decided on this one. SO glad I did! The first night was a bit uncomfortable, but thought my face is worth it so tried it again the next night. Each night has gotten better. I guess it takes some getting used to just like anything you switch up. I&#x27;ve been examining my face every morning. Each day my face is looking BETTER than the morning before! Not to mention my hair isn&#x27;t a rats nest anymore either! Double bonus! I&#x27;m not one to write reviews, but this I had to share. If your on the fence, do it! This thing is awesome! FYI I&#x27;m 38 and a side sleeper. For the past 5 years or so, the eye skin has gotten so bad on my sleeping side, I looked 48! Not anymore! Buy it!</li>
            <li> I like this pillow. I can&#x27;t seem to make myself sleep on my back or side all night so I&#x27;m not using it exactly how I should. But I do think it&#x27;s making my neck pain better. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this purchase. The pillow very firm and not comfortable at all. The sewing on the cover is sloppy causing the fabric to wrinkle.</li>
            <li> I love that I do not sweat with this pillow. My neck is in the right position to sleep well on my side which is the most important thing for me.</li>
            <li> I find this is the best shaped pillow for sleeping in all different positions. I don&#x27;t feel like my face is being pressed against the pillow and it keeps my neck really well supported.</li>
            <li> i have been on a mission to find the perfect pillow ....and THIS IS IT !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this pillow.  It is so comfortable, I bought it to counter squish face, which it works well for, but I would still use it even if it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The worst pillow ever - great concept, but I don&#x27;t know who could sleep comfortably on this thing.</li>
            <li> Love this pillow!!  It&#x27;s so comfortable and the best part is it prevents wrinkles.  i purchased this pillow as a gift for a friend as I has been sleeping on it a few years. I started using it because I was waking up  very morning with lines in my face.  Have been sleeping so comfortably on my  side and decided a few months ago to try sleeping on my  back. I didn&#x27;t think I could adjust to being on my back but only took a couple of nites.  Now I sleep so soundly ,which I really didn&#x27;t expect and don&#x27;t go back on my side..  So comfortable and never have puffy eyes in the am.  I even take it with me when I travel,  no squishing my face again into a pillow.  Thank you, Vasseur, for helping me look my best!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews...but I must say that this pillow is awesome!  I am a side/stomach sleeper and it took about a week to get used to this pillow but now that I am used to it, I have found I go to sleep on my side, but wake up on my back (the ideal sleeping position).  My neck feels great, my face looks much better and I am sleeping soundly as well.  In addition, for whatever reason, I am not grinding my teeth at night anymore.  I LOVE this pillow!  It is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Update 6/3/2016. I just want to say I have been sleeping with this pillow for quite sometime now and can&#x27;t imagine not having it. I don&#x27;t leave home without it -- when I go away. I now use it exactly as pictured described (occasionally) but mostly I use it so it surrounds my head and my head is on the mattress. This keeps my head supported so I don&#x27;t roll onto my back. It feels amazing and so cozy. Anyway I wanted to mention this as an option in case others may also find prefer using it this way, as I notice a few disappointed customers. Wonderful pillow!   I love my pillow. Starting about 6 months ago I tried every method out there to train myself from a side to back sleeper. None worked. I also ordered a number of pillows purporting to help. Needless to say I was very disappointed with them all and they were all extremely uncomfortable or didn&#x27;t help keep me on my back one bit. So I decided, very skeptically to try this pillow. I honestly didn&#x27;t have much faith it would work. Well I am now a back sleeper and even if I do sleep on my side my face ia protected from squishing and wrinkling. I can&#x27;t go a night without my pillow. I won&#x27;t travel without. I just love it. It did take a few nights to get used to but now, the way it cradles my head and neck, it just lulls me to sleep and I love sleeping on my back - which I could never have imagined saying a few months ago.</li>
            <li> BEST purchase ever! I can&#x27;t live without this!  doesn&#x27;t leave me with flat bed head or squishy face</li>
            <li> So disappointed.  Pillow hurt my neck. Says a lot!</li>
