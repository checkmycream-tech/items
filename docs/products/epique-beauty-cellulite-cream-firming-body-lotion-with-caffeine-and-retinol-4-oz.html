            <li>well I have been passed for lot of them and promise results but never happened, at least to me, and this one does :) Girls if you are trying to find a product that makes you like you&#x27;re always dreaming, is this one!!!!!</li>
            <li>I like the cool tingling feeling when I apply it.....</li>
            <li>( her words) .It is very efficient if applied correctly .But if you want to get more results using this cream you will have to do exercises every day , you have to give up eating junk food ,chocolate , ice-cream , bread etc.</li>
            <li>Things just are not the same body wise after you give birth.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Saw results after first use!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product so far.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my results so far and the cream was definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>I can remember to apply right before getting out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin was smoother right away</li>
            <li>so I was trying to fit into it a little better!</li>
            <li>and honestly it didnt take nearly as long as i thought it would.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell that great, has a citrus smell but a little funky.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different brands and have found this one to work the best for me....</li>
            <li>With regular exercise and application of the cream, the results are starting to look great.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and the instructions are clearly written.</li>
            <li>I applied some more that same day before i went to sleep and</li>
            <li>This product has totally turned me into younger face and makes my muscle on face is getting more firming and get better.</li>
            <li>It isnâ€™t greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I used with a massage brush for fast results!</li>
            <li>I despise all of my cellulite and this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>and I really recommend this cream!  </li>
            <li>Feels great on my dry skin, moisturizes and helps with my dimples and wrinkles!I have tried many products for reducing my cellulite in the past and although many have helped tighten my skin, none have even come close to what this cellulite cream has done, even though I just used it for a short time.</li>
            <li>I love that it is paraben free; it is really hard to find a paraben free product that really works.</li>
            <li>I am very grateful for this cellulite cream, i will most definitely recommend it,</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t put much on the first time</li>
            <li>it actually makes a difference in the cellulite, and the appearance of that unsightly stuff on your body, and it is easy to do, and doesnt require a bunch of money or fancy equipment or pain to do it.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied</li>
            <li>Also dont care much for the smell.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have started using on my thighs also but haven&#x27;t noticed as much change as like my arms.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have visible cellulite</li>
            <li>Cellulite can be a very unsightly issue for women.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: been using it for a couple weeks now &amp; really seeing a decrease on my stomach flab.</li>
            <li>This caused my skin to shrink, fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this my whole life and brushes and gym time has not made a dent in the problem.</li>
            <li>I am becoming addicted to this stuff :)</li>
            <li>but when I look closely I can see tiny light dimples near hip area.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this cream based on the reviews that I had read.</li>
            <li>I was left with a much healthier body but still had cellulite in certain areas.</li>
            <li>I feel like a new person once I put this on</li>
            <li>I started using this cellulite cream along with my derma roller on my thighs where the cellulite just loves to live no matter</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this cream and if you want to be beach ready, start now!</li>
            <li>Not everyone will get the same results, but it&#x27;s certainly working for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it three times and its a very noticable difference.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I really like the way this smells when you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li>My skin is quite sensitive</li>
            <li>I hate how we women have to be perfect and they can just let themselves go.</li>
            <li>The jacket was a little tight to be honest</li>
            <li>but this cream and a little yoga have me feeling young and hot .</li>
            <li>Her cellulite has dissapeared almost completely, so this product definitely works.</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t last long enough for me to really notice any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Results were most dramatic after 2.5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Millions of women have unsightly cellulite and no easy way to get rid of it, but now there&#x27;s a product that really works!</li>

            <li> Can definitely deal with the strange smell since it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this that long</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s works good, if you buy if you didn&#x27;t waste or money on something bad</li>
            <li> It definitely gives me back my confidence I have been missing!</li>

            <li> After this review was posted I rcvd an email for me to contact them thru the message center.  </li>
            <li> I have a few problem areas with cellulite my thighs front and back as well as my arms and stomach.</li>
            <li> It was definitely a big waste of money!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other cellulite creams but none of them gave me the results I was seeking.</li>
            <li> Also I work out every other day, do a lot of swats since I heard it also help.</li>
            <li> went to a family function the other day and was wearing a maxi dress and jean jacket.</li>
            <li> I assumed that a little went a very, very long way.</li>
            <li> Maybe itll take less time.&amp;#34; and i seriously saw the results the next day.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my cellulite is reducing less visible, my skin feels tighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> but less noticable now.</li>
            <li> When I got my package, I was disappointed to see that the container was less than half full.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m seeing a little result.</li>
            <li> I then put it all over my arms and it seemed ot give them a little life.</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail few days ago</li>
            <li> Waste of time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Can be messy when applying with hands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see improvement on my cellulite but it does make my legs look firm.</li>
            <li> decided to do something about my trouble spots and chose to target that area with a cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> Most women cannot afford painful and expensive plastic surgery but there are other options for dealing with this issue and regaining confidence again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used a DS version of this in the past and this one is a lot smoother and less sticky.</li>
            <li> just a small amount the size of a quarter for both thighs and</li>
            <li> Since I started using this cream I have noticed that not only are my cottage cheese thighs not as cheesy, but the skin is firming up as well.</li>
            <li> Her skin is firmer and the appearance of her cellulite has reduced slowly.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a little skeptical</li>
            <li> i had a little weird tingling feeling, but that must have been the cream doing what it supposed to be doing.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I lost a dramatic amount of weight.</li>
            <li> Now, I understand the difference between weight versus volume, nevertheless I was shocked to see so little in the jar.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that was not the case.</li>
            <li> I was afraid my arms looked bad or that dimples would show on my hips in the dress, so I applied this to all those areas, rubbed in, and never gave it another thought!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I purchases this lotion and was extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This product smells horrible and leaves a tacky feel on my skin</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve always been chunky but my legs have been the worst part, they&#x27;re textured.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great cream to get you up and going! I feel like a new person once I put this on and I love it so much. I would definitely recommend this cream to anyone who is looking for something to brighten there day!</li>
            <li> I like the aroma and soothing effects of Cellulite. Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> After having my daughter, a friend of mine recommended this cellulite cream. I must admit I was a little skeptical, you hear so many stories of some expensive creams not working that is all a myth. As soon I received it, I started using it, I began to notice my cellulite disappearing within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> This product smells horrible and leaves a tacky feel on my skin and I used it as instructed and did nothing for firming my skin and it&#x27;s did not moisturize. Almost smells like liquid hair remover.</li>
            <li> Bought this cellulite cream for my wife, so far so good. Smells nice and she felt her skin smoother. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I wish exercising was enough to keep my butt the way it used to be.... but this cream and a little yoga have me feeling young and hot . I recommend this for any woman that has a boyfriend that is as honest as mine. I asked him if I had cellulite and he said yes! I hate how we women have to be perfect and they can just let themselves go. Oh well I guess im doing this kind of stuff so I feel good about me and maybe thats a good reason :)</li>
            <li> I used this product for more then a month and I see zero difference in my thighs. I personality would not purchase this cream again. Very unsatisfied</li>
            <li> Used full bottled with no results that were visable. Also dont care much for the smell.</li>
            <li> It works! we as women think about this kind of product if they really tighten .. well I have been passed for lot of them and promise results but never happened, at least to me, and this one does :) Girls if you are trying to find a product that makes you like you&#x27;re always dreaming, is this one!!!!! I love it!!! highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail few days ago and i immediately applied some on me. My legs and buttocks. I went to sleep and when i woke up the next morning i had a little weird tingling feeling, but that must have been the cream doing what it supposed to be doing. I applied some more that same day before i went to sleep and the next morning i felt the same feeling, but at the same time i felt my skin my tighter. My husband noticed it too, so i know that my eyes are not playing tricks on me. I actually feel wonderful and my confidence has boosted up. I am very grateful for this cellulite cream, i will most definitely recommend it,</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this cream based on the reviews that I had read. When I got my package, I was disappointed to see that the container was less than half full. Now, I understand the difference between weight versus volume, nevertheless I was shocked to see so little in the jar. I assumed that a little went a very, very long way. Unfortunately that was not the case. While the cream smelled good, and it tingled when I applied it, it didn&#x27;t last long enough for me to really notice any difference in my skin. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I noticed ZERO change in my skin firmness or texture. Waste of time &amp; money. Should have known better.</li>
            <li> Would not buy again. Not a crram more of a lotion</li>
            <li> Not a fan.  Gives a sticky tacky feeling.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a greasy! Also no matter what I&#x27;ve done to try to lose weight on my hips I still have cellulite. So I&#x27;ve been applying it and am very excited to see what the results are.  So far they&#x27;ve been great after these first two weeks.  It simulates my skin and draws redness out which I love! My skin looks more even and the textures better! I can&#x27;t wait by my next tub of this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands and have found this one to work the best for me.... I like the cool tingling feeling when I apply it.....smell is good too.....I noticed a difference in my thighs after using it only a couple weeks.....I know it says to apply twice a day but my schedule only allowed once so may have noticed results quicker had I done that....I am still very pleased with how it works...just reordered another jar....:-)</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this cream weeks ago .It is very cheap and you feel like your skin burning when applying it and results start to show almost immediately ( her words) .It is very efficient if applied correctly .But if you want to get more results using this cream you will have to do exercises every day , you have to give up eating junk food ,chocolate , ice-cream , bread etc.Use this cream and have a healthy lifestyle and you will be satisfied with your body.</li>
            <li> It is a nice cream to use but you have to use more than one bottle to get the result.</li>
            <li> Okay so i thought this would take forever for results and honestly it didnt take nearly as long as i thought it would. I read a review saying it would take two weeks for results so i thought &amp;#34;Okay i wont skimp on lotion. Maybe itll take less time.&amp;#34; and i seriously saw the results the next day. I&#x27;ve only used it three times and its a very noticable difference. GET IT!!</li>
            <li> It tingles, I did notice a difference in my skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> My wife had asked me to find an anti cellulite cream for her to use on her belly. I got the 4oz jar of Epique Firming cream for her. She has tried it and reports that it is nice and effective. She said and I agree that it has a nice scent. It is easy to apply. Yes I helped her by rubbing it on to her belly in a circular motion. I was able to get mine at a discount for an honest review. I would say the same at its current price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;2.) Nice scent&lt;br /&gt;3.) Effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Can be messy when applying with hands. Wash hands afterwards.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I purchases this lotion and was extremely disappointed.  I followed directions along with using a cellulite massage brush and saw no results after using the entire jar.  It was definitely a big waste of money!  UPDATE: After this review was posted I rcvd an email for me to contact them thru the message center.  When I tried to do this there was no way!  Stay away from this product and at this point would not recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> This product has totally turned me into younger face and makes my muscle on face is getting more firming and get better. Besides that, the product was smoothier fine line around my eyes and lift up my face. That was a surprise to me as I used a lot of branded anti-aging product before which does not have effectiveness. I would like to recommend this to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and I do not see ANY results.  Obviously I will finish up the bottles I ordered and see if anything changes.</li>
            <li> I love this, however it is a little sticky but smells great and feels good</li>
            <li> Sticky and doesn&#x27;t smell great. Seems to work ok but nothing special.</li>
            <li> One star because it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I just started if about 1 week it&#x27;s works good, if you buy if you didn&#x27;t waste or money on something bad you did if on something good</li>
            <li> Maybe a little expensive. I am waiting for the results :)</li>
            <li> This cellulite cream works great for my thighs. It isnâ€™t greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I have tried other cellulite creams but none of them gave me the results I was seeking. I love how this cream tightens the skin and reduces the look of cellulite.  I use it twice a day just a small amount the size of a quarter for both thighs and after a week I already saw a change. I love that it is paraben free; it is really hard to find a paraben free product that really works. I am pleased with this product so far.</li>
            <li> love this stuff**its like magic  in a bottle</li>
            <li> I havent&#x27; tried this yet, but will write a review when I do.</li>
            <li> Millions of women have unsightly cellulite and no easy way to get rid of it, but now there&#x27;s a product that really works! I started using this cellulite cream along with my derma roller on my thighs where the cellulite just loves to live no matter what kind of treatments I&#x27;ve tried. Since I started using this cream I have noticed that not only are my cottage cheese thighs not as cheesy, but the skin is firming up as well. Finally, a cellulite cream that does what it says it will! If you have a problem with cellulite, try this cream! Not everyone will get the same results, but it&#x27;s certainly working for me.</li>
            <li> Saw results after first use! Results were most dramatic after 2.5 weeks.  Great scent! I used with a massage brush for fast results! The formula was the perfect consistency!</li>
            <li> I really like the way this smells when you open the bottle.  I haven&#x27;t been using this that long but I already feel my skin around my arms tightening and see cellulite decreasing.  I have started using on my thighs also but haven&#x27;t noticed as much change as like my arms.  I would recommend this product to anyone trying to decrease cellulite and tighten up.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! I despise all of my cellulite and this is exactly what I needed. Anyone who has had children knows what I am talking about.. no amount of working out can get rid of that stubborn cellulite , but this does! You can see the results almost instantly. It works better if you have the massaging brush, but when you are on the go, you can just do what I do and rub it in vigorously with your hand. It definitely gives me back my confidence I have been missing!</li>
            <li> This cream works wonders.I have been doing a lot lately to get my pre pregnancy body back after having my first daughter.Things just are not the same body wise after you give birth.I have a few problem areas with cellulite my thighs front and back as well as my arms and stomach.After using this cellulite cream it has definitely helped reduce my cellulite appearance a lot.My skin in my thighs(front &amp; back), arms, stomach have noticeably firmed up, and appears less cellulite looking.I use it in the morning and at night before bed.I am very happy with my purchase.You get a generous size bottle of cream too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work...period.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m seeing a little result. I don&#x27;t really have visible cellulite but when I look closely I can see tiny light dimples near hip area. After the second week of using this product along with the massager, and caffeine cellulite scrub twice daily, I&#x27;m definitely seeing visible result. Also I work out every other day, do a lot of swats since I heard it also help.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is but is doing something. Legs look firmer. Worth the money. I just wish it came in bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my dry skin, moisturizes and helps with my dimples and wrinkles!I have tried many products for reducing my cellulite in the past and although many have helped tighten my skin, none have even come close to what this cellulite cream has done, even though I just used it for a short time. I have noticed that my cellulite is reducing less visible, my skin feels tighter and smoother. The cream has a nice smell and I really recommend this cream!  Disclaimer: I obtained this item at a discount for my unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> I did not see any change.</li>
            <li> After having my baby girl, I realized my cellulite has become more noticable. I needed them to go away and this product assisted me with that goal. It is still there but less noticable now. With regular exercise and application of the cream, the results are starting to look great.</li>
            <li> I bought this cellulite cream by Epique Beauty for my wife. She has been using it for about 1 week, and she told me that she is seeing some good results. Her skin is firmer and the appearance of her cellulite has reduced slowly. Moreover, this cellulite cream has pleasant smell and the texture is not oily or sticky as most of the cellulite cream. Highly recommended, it&#x27;s a good product with fair price! You will love it too...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see improvement on my cellulite but it does make my legs look firm.</li>
            <li> I am becoming addicted to this stuff :) It makes my skin look better right after applying it and it goes on like lotion which is nice. I used a DS version of this in the past and this one is a lot smoother and less sticky. No irritation, and I have been putting it on all the time! Especially headed out the door, or just before going in places. It&#x27;s a good size packaging and the perfect shape so that I can slide in the door of my car to I can remember to apply right before getting out.&lt;br /&gt;I went to a family function the other day and was wearing a maxi dress and jean jacket. I was afraid my arms looked bad or that dimples would show on my hips in the dress, so I applied this to all those areas, rubbed in, and never gave it another thought! The jacket was a little tight to be honest so I was trying to fit into it a little better! I was so thankful I had just gotten this to try it. I then put it all over my arms and it seemed ot give them a little life. Now I&#x27;m using it in all kinds of places, it&#x27;s is a good all-over lotion IMHO! I&#x27;m hoping it works so well that I won&#x27;t need it anymore one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if it&#x27;s ok to slather this on and saran wrap myself?</li>
            <li> Cellulite can be a very unsightly issue for women. Sometimes even after weight loss, it is an issue. Most women cannot afford painful and expensive plastic surgery but there are other options for dealing with this issue and regaining confidence again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cellulite Cream by Epique Beauty was something I discovered after just having lost a bit of weight myself but still dealing with some embarassing cellulite on my legs. I wanted to diminsh its appearance and I didnt have thousands of dollars for plastic surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creat works wonderfully. It isnt just a body lotion that smells good but used with the brush it actually makes a difference in the cellulite, and the appearance of that unsightly stuff on your body, and it is easy to do, and doesnt require a bunch of money or fancy equipment or pain to do it. I recommend it to any woman bothered by the appearance of cellulite on her body.</li>
            <li> just got it, so no info yet on how well it works. However, it smells great and excited to see results. Will post update soon on how it works &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: been using it for a couple weeks now &amp; really seeing a decrease on my stomach flab. Using it both morning &amp; night, about blueberry size dollop. It doesn&#x27;t really smell that great, has a citrus smell but a little funky. Can definitely deal with the strange smell since it&#x27;s working. &#x3D;) I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Got it because of the amazing reviews and so far I like it. Haven&#x27;t been using it enough to see a difference but i love the way it makes my skin feels and the smell is nice</li>
            <li> When I was in my mid 20â€™s I lost a dramatic amount of weight. This caused my skin to shrink, fast. I was left with a much healthier body but still had cellulite in certain areas. The biggest problem was on the back of my thighs. After years of dieting and finally reaching my goal I didnâ€™t even have the confidence to show off my body in shorts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do something about my trouble spots and chose to target that area with a cellulite cream. Thatâ€™s when I found this product. I noticed my skin was smoother right away but the biggest difference was about 6 weeks after starting. I definitely recommend this cream and if you want to be beach ready, start now!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve always been chunky but my legs have been the worst part, they&#x27;re textured. I&#x27;ve had this my whole life and brushes and gym time has not made a dent in the problem. This cream has definitely lessened the appearance of the dimpling on my thighs. I&#x27;m really happy with the product so far as my legs look more supple. The product is easy to use and the instructions are clearly written. My skin is quite sensitive so I didn&#x27;t put much on the first time but I didn&#x27;t have any reactions which was great. I&#x27;m pleased with my results so far and the cream was definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my mum and she is really happy with it. Her cellulite has dissapeared almost completely, so this product definitely works. I recommend it with no doubt.</li>
