            <li>/&gt;*Applicator is great</li>
            <li>saw a photo of a woman with great lashes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great mascara.</li>
            <li>Still a great product to provide the appearance of longer an dthicker lashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara looks great on.  </li>
            <li>so I was expecting great things out of this product.</li>
            <li>Not so great.</li>
            <li>It goes on great and lasts all day with no flaking.</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried, but I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It works great but clumps up at the end of the brush</li>
            <li>This mascara is great.</li>
            <li>So happy I just bought trial sized.</li>
            <li>And the price is great too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my lashes feel great.</li>
            <li>This mascara does give great volume and length</li>

            <li>Absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>Very nice thank you to upscale deal</li>
            <li>LOVED LOVED LOVED!</li>
            <li>It made my lashes look amazing !</li>
            <li>It does add length but for best results, use a lengthening mascara for one coat, then this on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been more impressed with a mascara.</li>
            <li>and so I didn&#x27;t get to experience the best formula of this product, but whatever I received was just ok for me.</li>
            <li>I have been on a mission to find the best mascara for my lashes for over a year, and this is NOT one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>On the prowl for the Love of My Life so want to look SEXY !!!  </li>
            <li>Not as good as I thought.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li>But because it&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>I tried one of these before in a gift pkg before and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good thing I just bought the travel size.</li>
            <li>i loved this mascara.</li>

            <li>Loved the thickness it gave my lashes.</li>
            <li>BUT, just 1 coat and my eyelashes look so good...</li>
            <li>This is a good one.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s good for night make up.</li>
            <li>good place to buy from.</li>
            <li>Good make up.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t wear make up often, this would be the perfect pop for dates, weddings or any special event.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many online reviews about how awesome Better</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find it here and order more at a discount.  </li>
            <li>This product is good and as advertised, but it isn&#x27;t this amazing mind-blowing mascara like some say.</li>

            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid for the higher end brands and not been too impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for two days since recieving it and love it!</li>
            <li>I might have to splurge and say that I love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this mascara!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>my eyelashes never looked better!</li>
            <li>and it is amazing,</li>
            <li>Amazing mascara.</li>
            <li>truly amazing product.</li>
            <li>Works great for volume and height added to your lashes but not so well with going on smoothly and not clumping up.</li>
            <li>BUT.... This one is amazing</li>
            <li>The brush is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The before and after difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>BUT the bristles do some amazing lash separating.</li>
            <li>nice quality</li>
            <li>But, nice packaging.</li>
            <li>It is a fat brush and the product goes on my lashes nicely.</li>
            <li>While I did get some nice volume and length it flaked off a lot throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I loved the formula and still love the brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best mascara I ever used in my whole</li>
            <li>It looked like you were wearing mascara rather than having nice lashes.</li>
            <li>Tbh, as nice as it is to get things for cheaper value, as you may have read some sellers are shady.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Wonderful mascara and was sent super quick!</li>
            <li>On top of all that, the mascara, while good, is not one bit better than &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; brands like NYC, L&#x27;Oreal, Revlon, and Cover Girl.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super creamy and gives great length..</li>
            <li>but much better than most of the mascaras I tested before!</li>
            <li>( i didn&#x27;t want to spend $23 at sephora until I was sure that I liked it)</li>
            <li>I would recommend wiping off excess product, but it is by far one of the best mascaras I have used up until now.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>I really wish I loved this mascara!</li>
            <li>Really makes your lashes lengthen and separate beautifully.</li>
            <li>it waa great for the first 30 minutes</li>
            <li>This product is great at first.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried Maybeline&#x27;s MegaPlush mascara, it&#x27;s very light weight on your lashes like that mascara.</li>
            <li>Very easy apply and simple to make your eyes look stunning!!!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best I have found.</li>
            <li>so be sure</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy it ever since it came out, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it or not...</li>
            <li>Loreal brand makes my lashes look much better</li>
            <li>Love this mascara</li>
            <li>I will defiantly order more:)</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>It is volumizing more then lengthening.</li>
            <li>Truly fantastic!</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>better than</li>
            <li>love love love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I should have stuck with my all time favorite, Lancôme.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give you any more eyelashes than you already have</li>
            <li>and it not does it give you any more length than you already have.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so i was always looking in mirror to make sure i didnt have racoon face.</li>
            <li>I was using the butterfly brush prior to this one and was impressed on how it covered every lash.  </li>
            <li>When it comes to visual effect, this mascara is the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I love this product,  </li>
            <li>love this product and will reorder</li>
            <li>Love the way this mascara looks on but tends to fall throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump which I think is because of the brush which I love.</li>
            <li>better than sex?</li>
            <li>I am very glad I tried it out before spending a lot more money on a full size one.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I purchased this mascara.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this after reading reviews of it.</li>
            <li>I have had better experiences w cheaper drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will work out better for some than it did for me.</li>
            <li>This is more like a sample size than travel size.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>So glad they did.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product....</li>
            <li>This probably means I should try more mascara.</li>
            <li>Finally, the perfect mascara is here.  </li>
            <li>I found my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara and have used it non-stop since discovering it.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s better in colder climates?</li>
            <li>this product was ok.</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara I have EVER tried and I currently have 26 mascaras.</li>
            <li>For the name I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>Do much better with Cover Girl bombshell.</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;oreal telescoping mascara is much better for lengthening.</li>
            <li>I love this one though and I have used many.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>make up life :)</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>you figure for $10 more</li>
            <li>This turned out to be WAY better than the one I had bought...</li>
            <li>This is one of the best Mascara&#x27;s of all the ones I have purchased, gives Volume and appears to make my lashes longer ,Goes on smooth not dry and takes me through the day .I</li>
            <li>You know, this is a pretty good mascara.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>This was a pretty good masacara.</li>
            <li>I now own the full bottle and couldn&#x27;t imagine not using this product.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I brought this mascara because it promised so much, and I thought If it is better than sex, it have to be good.</li>
            <li>I think it Worked very we&#x27;ll great for traveling and was very very very very useful for a daily use</li>
            <li>Was really excited about this mascara based on the customer reviews here and elsewhere online, and decided a mini would be a great way to try it without investing too much.</li>
            <li>The large tester is a good size and</li>
            <li>In love with this product, shipped VERY fast and the mascara is absoluty AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Loved it works very well.</li>
            <li>I so want the full version!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent mascara, it really makes my lashes look lush.  </li>
            <li>Easily buildable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>To the point though, it does lengthen and volumize, but it clumps and flakes and its easy to get spider leg lashes.</li>
            <li>Melted easily.</li>
            <li>It was ok nothing special.</li>
            <li>Sure, the brush looks cool, but that is about it.</li>
            <li>Also, I think I would&#x27;ve been better off just getting the full size.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best mascara i have ever purchased</li>
            <li>I was not super impressed by this mascara.</li>
            <li>I can slap on some Revlon or L&#x27;Oreal and it looks fine.</li>
            <li>This really give better volume though!</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look huge.</li>
            <li>The brush is HUGE.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I gave it to my daughter and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This product...while it does go on smooth and silky, tends to have some fall out.</li>
            <li>But I still enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some cheap stuff like NYC, then stuff like Cover Girl and L&#x27;oreal, but those all flake off a lot.</li>
            <li>I have light lashes on.</li>
            <li>Went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Yea!&lt;br /&gt;I think the key is to apply and keep working with it until you&#x27;re happy.</li>
            <li>This looks like it could really be a fantastic brush...</li>
            <li>The brush gives good natural, full definition.</li>
            <li>Separated my lashes nicely, but took about 4 coats to get my lashes looking decent</li>
            <li>Product may well be awesome, but the seller is shady.</li>
            <li>and i even got myself excited.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why i was excited about the trial size.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product that I plan on reordering In the near future!</li>
            <li>Great volume and very black which I love</li>
            <li>It makes your eyelashes look full.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s softer and more gentle on your eyes</li>
            <li>i will be getting the full size.  </li>
            <li>I would buy the full size.</li>
            <li>I would go on to invest in the full size.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying a full size.</li>
            <li>Gives really full lashes.  </li>
            <li>I have used full sizes and mini sizes</li>
            <li>I would not purchase the full size item.</li>
            <li>I WILL be buying the full size product.</li>
            <li>I bought the travel size to try out before purchasing the full size.</li>
            <li>But good different.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>you get the full size.</li>
            <li>I bought the trail size to see if I like this mascara before spending over 20$ on the full bottle.</li>
            <li>It wears off pretty easy compared to my drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought the travel size and not the full, because there is no way this mascara could be worth that much.</li>
            <li>It really gives your eye lashes a great look and make your eyes look smaller also.</li>
            <li>That turned out to be a tremendous joke--on me.  </li>
            <li>Her eyelashes look awesome when she wears this, but when i put it on, i put on 3 coats and didn&#x27;t see a big difference at all, especially comapared to the</li>
            <li>It was shipped to me really quickly</li>
            <li>It amazing how light it feels even after several coats.</li>
            <li>Second coat just makes them look more prominent</li>
            <li>But it dries out and gets clumpy insanely quick.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe if i put more on my lash, my lash iwould be more noticeable, or I could just use the liquid with another one of my mascara brushes that works, well that does not work because it is not waterproof and it would not only be on my lash but everywhere else.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to see what everyone was raving about without having to pay the high price of a full-sized one just in case</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of better ones--both high end and drug store.</li>
            <li>I also noticed it irritated my eyes more than normal, but that could have been caused by the flakes getting under my contact lenses.</li>
            <li>Thanks to grav3yardgirl for making a viedo on Youtube showing how this product works its total amazing :) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the money for the full size.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite mascaras!</li>
            <li>Even though its travel size (small) it worked so good!</li>
            <li>Sooo when it comes to mascara, I am usually disappointed when I pay more than the good old stand by - Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash!</li>
            <li>I usually use healthy products, but I bought this for special occasions when I want my eyelashes to look spectacular.</li>
            <li>, most importantly, you can actually see it when it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li>is YSL Faux Cils because I can get the huge lashes I want with only 2 coats, and it also layers nicely and does not seem to smudge or take much to wash</li>
            <li>But the &amp;#34;Better than sex&amp;#34; is definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I tried this sample from Ulta and loved how fast it went from each edge of the last and separated the lashes and the appearance was thinker, longer looking.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>but when I use too faced better than sex mascara, they curl, they look natural and they gain volume.</li>
            <li>and i can see it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>This mascara makes my eyelashes not only look longer but more full looking too.</li>
            <li>The shipping is excellent as expected, the mascara is sooooooo dry</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look so long and amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good mascara, but it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li>an it made them look thick :) well be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t order the full size from seller A2ZLiquidators, because I might as well have thrown my $6 into the toilet.</li>
            <li>The mascara got really crappy really quick.</li>
            <li>This mascara is the only mascara I will use now, it&#x27;s formula is amazing and makes my eyelashes really pop.</li>
            <li>But they time tax is added on and if there&#x27;s a shipping cost, you&#x27;ve pretty much paid for a full size.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I went to Sephora to buy a different mascara to try out and this one was available for free with 100 points</li>
            <li>I found the item only ok.</li>
            <li>First, I like the brush that comes with this mascara.</li>
            <li>And sometimes I even sleep in it- just to add more layers the next day.</li>
            <li>Im glad that I only purchased the travel size.</li>
            <li>I wanted to sample it first.</li>
            <li>this is my first time trying it.</li>
            <li>Not only did my product arrive before time, but I absolutely LOVE the mascara.</li>
            <li>It really can separate lashes!</li>
            <li>makes your eyelashes really stand out!</li>
            <li>I love the smaller size.  </li>
            <li>It may start to flake off more with multiple coats, but with one coat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure that I agree with the name of the mascara (haha!), but it is definitely one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>boy am I glad I did not only did it make my eye lashes fan out</li>
            <li>First coat gives you volume n curls the lashes.</li>
            <li>so much I ordered another one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only got the travel size.</li>
            <li>formula itself is pretty rad too-</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>If I had reviewed the first week I had got this would&#x27;ve been a 5 star review.</li>
            <li>Just like reviews have stated, a very nice, thick, unclumped finish.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as dramatic as advertised, but it is very good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but it has a lot of good qualities, and it&#x27;s one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I try this mascara again, I&#x27;ll get it directly from a brick-and-mortar retailer where I can be sure I&#x27;m not being sold someone&#x27;s old used-up makeup.</li>
            <li>I really like this smaller, travel size, also making it more affordable.</li>
            <li>I think I would&#x27;ve loved the product if there was any mascara left in the actual tube.</li>
            <li>My jaw dropped a little at the price, so i bought this smaller size to make sure i liked it before investing in the large.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I heard about it on a talk show and they RAVED on how long and healthy this mascara made your lashes look.</li>
            <li>It came in its original packaging securely without being crushed.</li>
            <li>I use the maybelline full n soft for my lower lashes,</li>
            <li>It gives me amazingly long, clump-free lashes perfect for a natural, everyday look.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine lashes.</li>
            <li>That was totally my bad, the product itself is definitely nice and she still loved it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real.</li>
            <li>Not the real thing.</li>
            <li>The real product doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>when it&#x27;s time to take it off, gentle makeup remover wipes are all you need</li>
            <li>My daughter raved about this mascara so much that I had to try it.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in a very timely fashion, but there was no documentation in the envelope with the tube of mascara, and the mascara had no box or safety seal.</li>
            <li>I really notice a difference in my lashes when I use this and when I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the wand though.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not annoying enough for me to stop using it!!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to spend that much money on a mascara.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I really like the mascara</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real mascara that i&#x27;ve been using, and i&#x27;ll continue to use now.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>haha...</li>
            <li>I really do like this, it seems to catch all you lashes.</li>
            <li>And they ensure that your lashes are REALLY coated.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>well it arrived fast</li>
            <li>It works very well for me, and I will be getting of this product when needed.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>but this was too much mascara.  </li>
            <li>It really adds volume and length to my lashes better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>In other words, I love this Mascara.</li>
            <li>The travel size is all I need because it can dry up from frequent use...like most mascaras.</li>
            <li>Generally, I would never pay this price for mascara, but it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy the full size.</li>
            <li>it leaving my lashes looking long and beautiful without getting hard and all clumpy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it any more or less than me este Lauder.</li>
            <li>As it&#x27;s recommended that you throw out mascara every three months anyway, why buy the regular size if you&#x27;ll waste a good portion.</li>
            <li>So when I found this trial size version at a decent price I decided to try it that way</li>
            <li>I use many different brands such as, Benefit, Dior, Lancôme, Loreal, Maybelline, etc.  </li>
            <li>the good old fav that usually can&#x27;t be be beat for the price until now!)</li>
            <li>The seller shipped it promptly and I was super excited to try it, only to see it was dry and wasn&#x27;t like anything I&#x27;ve tried at ulta store.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Price is way to high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li>wow!!</li>
            <li>the sample size is a little more than i would pay for a sample.</li>
            <li>It dried out super quickly.</li>
            <li>I am 68 years old, still rocking the  high heels and teaching public school full time.  </li>
            <li>It can get clumpy if overly applied, but if you like that look, just let it dry, brush it out with a clean brush and re-apply.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara even though it does get clumpy after a few uses.  </li>
            <li>Nice thick bristle brush.</li>
            <li>But I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>very professional</li>
            <li>It definitely kept my eyelashes long and full all day!</li>
            <li>Personally I like this one better due to the softness of the brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only mascara that does exactly what it says its going to do...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only got the travel size, and will likely only use it when I am flying somewhere.</li>
            <li>Though it is pretty pricey, I purchased the smaller version to try it...</li>
            <li>My lash is no more better for it.</li>
            <li>Not better than sex, for sure.</li>
            <li>Going to have to order a full size tube of this little black magic.  </li>
            <li>I have really light lashes (I&#x27;m a pale Irish girl), and this mascara plumps them right up with no clumping.</li>
            <li>Must of been old</li>
            <li>As far as the mascara goes.</li>
            <li>I was charged nearly $30 in shipping costs.  </li>
            <li>This really does work, I have short lashes</li>
            <li>It seemed old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and eyes.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get enough in the tiny bottle worth this price.</li>
            <li>It was ok, but not amazing.  </li>
            <li>I could never get my right eye and left eye to look similar, but this does it.</li>
            <li>(Most of you guys know what I mean...</li>
            <li>When it comes to black mascara, this is my holy grail.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Absolutely incredible volume, false eyelash length, does NOT clump, even when I&#x27;m loading obscene amounts of coats on my lashes, and actually adds curl.</li>
            <li>After reading some positive reviews on this expensive mascara, I was thrilled to find &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; sizes at such a bargain price.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it is now what I use daily.</li>
            <li>nothing special, so don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.</li>
            <li>Is it legal to have lashes this long at my age?</li>
            <li>This was just OK to me and certainly not as good as the name implies.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are already very curly and long</li>
            <li>This one was all dried out and doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes pop out like the full sized one did.</li>
            <li>I live in Southern Arizona though, so maybe the heat had something to do with it?</li>
            <li>It dried too fast and didn&#x27;t really helped with my lashes.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is pretty miraculous to me because my eyelashes are almost non-existant.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 3 stars because it also smudges easily and looks like I have dark circles under my eyes if I am not conscious about keeping it wiped</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands: this makes my lashes long and thick.</li>
            <li>Is a little clumpy on the brush, but once applied looks great, almost like fake lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if I am not wearing other makeup get ready for Raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li>I like this at least as much as the Lancome Hypnose Drama and better than Bare Minerals Lash Domination or any of the drugstore mascaras I&#x27;ve tried lately.</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes uber long full and very black.</li>
            <li>I used it and found that it looked no better than when I use the Maybelline Colossal Volume mascara.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants natural lashes that could pass as falsies without being over dramatic, It is fine for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t curl as much as some others, but it flakes MUCH LESS than others, as well.</li>
            <li>Long, lush lashes at age 67, finally!</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m getting lazy in my middle age to do it quicker, but I think this is definately worth a try.  </li>
            <li>The brush carries so much mascara on it that it is almost impossible to do more than one coat...and that coat sticks lashes together and clumps.</li>
            <li>It sometimes clumps and little pieces fall into my eye, but that doesn&#x27;t happen very often.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried, but I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s amazing.</li>

            <li> LOVED LOVED LOVED!</li>
            <li> It made my lashes look amazing !</li>
            <li> It does add length but for best results, use a lengthening mascara for one coat, then this on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been more impressed with a mascara.</li>
            <li> and so I didn&#x27;t get to experience the best formula of this product, but whatever I received was just ok for me.</li>
            <li> I have been on a mission to find the best mascara for my lashes for over a year, and this is NOT one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> On the prowl for the Love of My Life so want to look SEXY !!!  </li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li> But because it&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li> Good.</li>

            <li> BUT, just 1 coat and my eyelashes look so good...</li>

            <li> I think it&#x27;s good for night make up.</li>
            <li> good place to buy from.</li>
            <li> Good make up.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve read many online reviews about how awesome Better</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find it here and order more at a discount.  </li>
            <li> This product is good and as advertised, but it isn&#x27;t this amazing mind-blowing mascara like some say.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many people say great things about this mascara</li>

            <li> Better than anything!</li>
            <li> but I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid for the higher end brands and not been too impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two days since recieving it and love it!</li>
            <li> I might have to splurge and say that I love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!</li>
            <li> my eyelashes never looked better!</li>
            <li> and it is amazing,</li>
            <li> Amazing mascara.</li>
            <li> truly amazing product.</li>
            <li> Works great for volume and height added to your lashes but not so well with going on smoothly and not clumping up.</li>
            <li> BUT.... This one is amazing</li>
            <li> The brush is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The before and after difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> BUT the bristles do some amazing lash separating.</li>
            <li> nice quality</li>
            <li> But, nice packaging.</li>
            <li> It is a fat brush and the product goes on my lashes nicely.</li>
            <li> While I did get some nice volume and length it flaked off a lot throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I loved the formula and still love the brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best mascara I ever used in my whole</li>
            <li> It looked like you were wearing mascara rather than having nice lashes.</li>
            <li> Tbh, as nice as it is to get things for cheaper value, as you may have read some sellers are shady.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Wonderful mascara and was sent super quick!</li>
            <li> On top of all that, the mascara, while good, is not one bit better than &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; brands like NYC, L&#x27;Oreal, Revlon, and Cover Girl.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super creamy and gives great length..</li>
            <li> but much better than most of the mascaras I tested before!</li>
            <li> ( i didn&#x27;t want to spend $23 at sephora until I was sure that I liked it)</li>
            <li> I would recommend wiping off excess product, but it is by far one of the best mascaras I have used up until now.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> I really wish I loved this mascara!</li>
            <li> Really makes your lashes lengthen and separate beautifully.</li>
            <li> it waa great for the first 30 minutes</li>
            <li> This product is great at first.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried Maybeline&#x27;s MegaPlush mascara, it&#x27;s very light weight on your lashes like that mascara.</li>
            <li> Very easy apply and simple to make your eyes look stunning!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best I have found.</li>
            <li> so be sure</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy it ever since it came out, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it or not...</li>
            <li> Loreal brand makes my lashes look much better</li>
            <li> Love this mascara</li>
            <li> I will defiantly order more:)</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> It is volumizing more then lengthening.</li>
            <li> Truly fantastic!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li> better than</li>
            <li> love love love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I should have stuck with my all time favorite, Lancôme.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you any more eyelashes than you already have</li>
            <li> and it not does it give you any more length than you already have.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so i was always looking in mirror to make sure i didnt have racoon face.</li>
            <li> I was using the butterfly brush prior to this one and was impressed on how it covered every lash.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to visual effect, this mascara is the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I love this product,  </li>
            <li> love this product and will reorder</li>
            <li> Love the way this mascara looks on but tends to fall throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump which I think is because of the brush which I love.</li>
            <li> better than sex?</li>
            <li> I am very glad I tried it out before spending a lot more money on a full size one.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I purchased this mascara.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this after reading reviews of it.</li>
            <li> I have had better experiences w cheaper drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will work out better for some than it did for me.</li>
            <li> This is more like a sample size than travel size.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> So glad they did.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product....</li>
            <li> This probably means I should try more mascara.</li>
            <li> Finally, the perfect mascara is here.  </li>
            <li> I found my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara and have used it non-stop since discovering it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s better in colder climates?</li>
            <li> this product was ok.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have EVER tried and I currently have 26 mascaras.</li>
            <li> For the name I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> Do much better with Cover Girl bombshell.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;oreal telescoping mascara is much better for lengthening.</li>
            <li> I love this one though and I have used many.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> make up life :)</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> you figure for $10 more</li>
            <li> This turned out to be WAY better than the one I had bought...</li>
            <li> This is one of the best Mascara&#x27;s of all the ones I have purchased, gives Volume and appears to make my lashes longer ,Goes on smooth not dry and takes me through the day .I</li>
            <li> You know, this is a pretty good mascara.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty good masacara.</li>
            <li> I now own the full bottle and couldn&#x27;t imagine not using this product.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I brought this mascara because it promised so much, and I thought If it is better than sex, it have to be good.</li>
            <li> I think it Worked very we&#x27;ll great for traveling and was very very very very useful for a daily use</li>
            <li> Was really excited about this mascara based on the customer reviews here and elsewhere online, and decided a mini would be a great way to try it without investing too much.</li>
            <li> The large tester is a good size and</li>
            <li> In love with this product, shipped VERY fast and the mascara is absoluty AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Loved it works very well.</li>
            <li> I so want the full version!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent mascara, it really makes my lashes look lush.  </li>
            <li> Easily buildable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> To the point though, it does lengthen and volumize, but it clumps and flakes and its easy to get spider leg lashes.</li>
            <li> Melted easily.</li>
            <li> It was ok nothing special.</li>
            <li> Sure, the brush looks cool, but that is about it.</li>
            <li> Also, I think I would&#x27;ve been better off just getting the full size.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best mascara i have ever purchased</li>
            <li> I was not super impressed by this mascara.</li>
            <li> I can slap on some Revlon or L&#x27;Oreal and it looks fine.</li>
            <li> This really give better volume though!</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look huge.</li>
            <li> The brush is HUGE.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I gave it to my daughter and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This product...while it does go on smooth and silky, tends to have some fall out.</li>
            <li> But I still enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some cheap stuff like NYC, then stuff like Cover Girl and L&#x27;oreal, but those all flake off a lot.</li>
            <li> I have light lashes on.</li>
            <li> Went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Yea!&lt;br /&gt;I think the key is to apply and keep working with it until you&#x27;re happy.</li>
            <li> This looks like it could really be a fantastic brush...</li>
            <li> The brush gives good natural, full definition.</li>
            <li> Separated my lashes nicely, but took about 4 coats to get my lashes looking decent</li>
            <li> Product may well be awesome, but the seller is shady.</li>
            <li> and i even got myself excited.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why i was excited about the trial size.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product that I plan on reordering In the near future!</li>
            <li> Great volume and very black which I love</li>
            <li> It makes your eyelashes look full.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s softer and more gentle on your eyes</li>
            <li> i will be getting the full size.  </li>
            <li> I would buy the full size.</li>
            <li> I would go on to invest in the full size.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying a full size.</li>
            <li> Gives really full lashes.  </li>
            <li> I have used full sizes and mini sizes</li>
            <li> I would not purchase the full size item.</li>
            <li> I WILL be buying the full size product.</li>
            <li> I bought the travel size to try out before purchasing the full size.</li>
            <li> But good different.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> you get the full size.</li>
            <li> I bought the trail size to see if I like this mascara before spending over 20$ on the full bottle.</li>
            <li> It wears off pretty easy compared to my drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought the travel size and not the full, because there is no way this mascara could be worth that much.</li>
            <li> It really gives your eye lashes a great look and make your eyes look smaller also.</li>
            <li> That turned out to be a tremendous joke--on me.  </li>
            <li> Her eyelashes look awesome when she wears this, but when i put it on, i put on 3 coats and didn&#x27;t see a big difference at all, especially comapared to the</li>
            <li> It was shipped to me really quickly</li>
            <li> It amazing how light it feels even after several coats.</li>
            <li> Second coat just makes them look more prominent</li>
            <li> But it dries out and gets clumpy insanely quick.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe if i put more on my lash, my lash iwould be more noticeable, or I could just use the liquid with another one of my mascara brushes that works, well that does not work because it is not waterproof and it would not only be on my lash but everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to see what everyone was raving about without having to pay the high price of a full-sized one just in case</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of better ones--both high end and drug store.</li>
            <li> I also noticed it irritated my eyes more than normal, but that could have been caused by the flakes getting under my contact lenses.</li>
            <li> Thanks to grav3yardgirl for making a viedo on Youtube showing how this product works its total amazing :) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the money for the full size.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite mascaras!</li>
            <li> Even though its travel size (small) it worked so good!</li>
            <li> Sooo when it comes to mascara, I am usually disappointed when I pay more than the good old stand by - Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash!</li>
            <li> I usually use healthy products, but I bought this for special occasions when I want my eyelashes to look spectacular.</li>
            <li> , most importantly, you can actually see it when it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> is YSL Faux Cils because I can get the huge lashes I want with only 2 coats, and it also layers nicely and does not seem to smudge or take much to wash</li>
            <li> But the &amp;#34;Better than sex&amp;#34; is definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried this sample from Ulta and loved how fast it went from each edge of the last and separated the lashes and the appearance was thinker, longer looking.  </li>
            <li> well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> but when I use too faced better than sex mascara, they curl, they look natural and they gain volume.</li>
            <li> and i can see it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my eyelashes not only look longer but more full looking too.</li>
            <li> The shipping is excellent as expected, the mascara is sooooooo dry</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look so long and amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good mascara, but it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> an it made them look thick :) well be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t order the full size from seller A2ZLiquidators, because I might as well have thrown my $6 into the toilet.</li>
            <li> The mascara got really crappy really quick.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the only mascara I will use now, it&#x27;s formula is amazing and makes my eyelashes really pop.</li>
            <li> But they time tax is added on and if there&#x27;s a shipping cost, you&#x27;ve pretty much paid for a full size.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I went to Sephora to buy a different mascara to try out and this one was available for free with 100 points</li>
            <li> I found the item only ok.</li>
            <li> First, I like the brush that comes with this mascara.</li>
            <li> And sometimes I even sleep in it- just to add more layers the next day.</li>
            <li> Im glad that I only purchased the travel size.</li>
            <li> I wanted to sample it first.</li>
            <li> this is my first time trying it.</li>
            <li> Not only did my product arrive before time, but I absolutely LOVE the mascara.</li>
            <li> It really can separate lashes!</li>
            <li> makes your eyelashes really stand out!</li>
            <li> I love the smaller size.  </li>
            <li> It may start to flake off more with multiple coats, but with one coat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure that I agree with the name of the mascara (haha!), but it is definitely one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> boy am I glad I did not only did it make my eye lashes fan out</li>
            <li> First coat gives you volume n curls the lashes.</li>
            <li> so much I ordered another one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I only got the travel size.</li>
            <li> formula itself is pretty rad too-</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> If I had reviewed the first week I had got this would&#x27;ve been a 5 star review.</li>
            <li> Just like reviews have stated, a very nice, thick, unclumped finish.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as dramatic as advertised, but it is very good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it has a lot of good qualities, and it&#x27;s one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I try this mascara again, I&#x27;ll get it directly from a brick-and-mortar retailer where I can be sure I&#x27;m not being sold someone&#x27;s old used-up makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like this smaller, travel size, also making it more affordable.</li>
            <li> I think I would&#x27;ve loved the product if there was any mascara left in the actual tube.</li>
            <li> My jaw dropped a little at the price, so i bought this smaller size to make sure i liked it before investing in the large.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I heard about it on a talk show and they RAVED on how long and healthy this mascara made your lashes look.</li>
            <li> It came in its original packaging securely without being crushed.</li>
            <li> I use the maybelline full n soft for my lower lashes,</li>
            <li> It gives me amazingly long, clump-free lashes perfect for a natural, everyday look.</li>
            <li> I have short, fine lashes.</li>
            <li> That was totally my bad, the product itself is definitely nice and she still loved it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing.</li>
            <li> The real product doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s time to take it off, gentle makeup remover wipes are all you need</li>
            <li> My daughter raved about this mascara so much that I had to try it.  </li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a very timely fashion, but there was no documentation in the envelope with the tube of mascara, and the mascara had no box or safety seal.</li>
            <li> I really notice a difference in my lashes when I use this and when I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the wand though.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not annoying enough for me to stop using it!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to spend that much money on a mascara.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I really like the mascara</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real mascara that i&#x27;ve been using, and i&#x27;ll continue to use now.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> haha...</li>
            <li> I really do like this, it seems to catch all you lashes.</li>
            <li> And they ensure that your lashes are REALLY coated.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> well it arrived fast</li>
            <li> It works very well for me, and I will be getting of this product when needed.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> but this was too much mascara.  </li>
            <li> It really adds volume and length to my lashes better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> In other words, I love this Mascara.</li>
            <li> The travel size is all I need because it can dry up from frequent use...like most mascaras.</li>
            <li> Generally, I would never pay this price for mascara, but it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy the full size.</li>
            <li> it leaving my lashes looking long and beautiful without getting hard and all clumpy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it any more or less than me este Lauder.</li>
            <li> As it&#x27;s recommended that you throw out mascara every three months anyway, why buy the regular size if you&#x27;ll waste a good portion.</li>
            <li> So when I found this trial size version at a decent price I decided to try it that way</li>
            <li> I use many different brands such as, Benefit, Dior, Lancôme, Loreal, Maybelline, etc.  </li>
            <li> the good old fav that usually can&#x27;t be be beat for the price until now!)</li>
            <li> The seller shipped it promptly and I was super excited to try it, only to see it was dry and wasn&#x27;t like anything I&#x27;ve tried at ulta store.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Price is way to high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> wow!!</li>
            <li> the sample size is a little more than i would pay for a sample.</li>
            <li> It dried out super quickly.</li>
            <li> I am 68 years old, still rocking the  high heels and teaching public school full time.  </li>
            <li> It can get clumpy if overly applied, but if you like that look, just let it dry, brush it out with a clean brush and re-apply.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara even though it does get clumpy after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Nice thick bristle brush.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> very professional</li>
            <li> It definitely kept my eyelashes long and full all day!</li>
            <li> Personally I like this one better due to the softness of the brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only mascara that does exactly what it says its going to do...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I only got the travel size, and will likely only use it when I am flying somewhere.</li>
            <li> Though it is pretty pricey, I purchased the smaller version to try it...</li>
            <li> My lash is no more better for it.</li>
            <li> Not better than sex, for sure.</li>
            <li> Going to have to order a full size tube of this little black magic.  </li>
            <li> I have really light lashes (I&#x27;m a pale Irish girl), and this mascara plumps them right up with no clumping.</li>
            <li> Must of been old</li>
            <li> As far as the mascara goes.</li>
            <li> I was charged nearly $30 in shipping costs.  </li>
            <li> This really does work, I have short lashes</li>
            <li> It seemed old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and eyes.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get enough in the tiny bottle worth this price.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but not amazing.  </li>
            <li> I could never get my right eye and left eye to look similar, but this does it.</li>
            <li> (Most of you guys know what I mean...</li>
            <li> When it comes to black mascara, this is my holy grail.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Absolutely incredible volume, false eyelash length, does NOT clump, even when I&#x27;m loading obscene amounts of coats on my lashes, and actually adds curl.</li>
            <li> After reading some positive reviews on this expensive mascara, I was thrilled to find &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; sizes at such a bargain price.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it is now what I use daily.</li>
            <li> nothing special, so don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.</li>
            <li> Is it legal to have lashes this long at my age?</li>
            <li> This was just OK to me and certainly not as good as the name implies.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are already very curly and long</li>
            <li> This one was all dried out and doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes pop out like the full sized one did.</li>
            <li> I live in Southern Arizona though, so maybe the heat had something to do with it?</li>
            <li> It dried too fast and didn&#x27;t really helped with my lashes.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is pretty miraculous to me because my eyelashes are almost non-existant.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 3 stars because it also smudges easily and looks like I have dark circles under my eyes if I am not conscious about keeping it wiped</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands: this makes my lashes long and thick.</li>
            <li> Is a little clumpy on the brush, but once applied looks great, almost like fake lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if I am not wearing other makeup get ready for Raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> I like this at least as much as the Lancome Hypnose Drama and better than Bare Minerals Lash Domination or any of the drugstore mascaras I&#x27;ve tried lately.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes uber long full and very black.</li>
            <li> I used it and found that it looked no better than when I use the Maybelline Colossal Volume mascara.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants natural lashes that could pass as falsies without being over dramatic, It is fine for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl as much as some others, but it flakes MUCH LESS than others, as well.</li>
            <li> Long, lush lashes at age 67, finally!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m getting lazy in my middle age to do it quicker, but I think this is definately worth a try.  </li>
            <li> The brush carries so much mascara on it that it is almost impossible to do more than one coat...and that coat sticks lashes together and clumps.</li>
            <li> It sometimes clumps and little pieces fall into my eye, but that doesn&#x27;t happen very often.</li>
            <li> It was super dry not very good.</li>
            <li> I have tried 2 other expensive brands recently, one w/ 5 stars, and this is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> I recived this im not sure of the date, the mascara it self was not in a package, but it did seem new and not previously used.</li>
            <li> at first I loved it but after about a week I hated it!</li>
            <li> but it doesnt last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a couple of uses to get used to the long bristles of the brush, but the brush design is sheer genius.</li>
            <li> My lids get a little oily and the product rubbed off right on my brow bone after only a few hours.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive sample tube of mascara that I didn&#x27;t find to be any better than big tubes that cost half the price.  </li>
            <li> makes my lashes look so long</li>
            <li> Want long lashes?</li>
            <li> Lasts long on your eyes</li>
            <li> It came sooner than expected, the the actual product did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long eyelashes and always wanted a mascara that didn&#x27;t give me a clumpy look</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump on my lashes and makes them long longer.</li>
            <li> My lashes are naturally long but for some reason this mascara makes it seem like i have applied falsies.</li>
            <li> It really extends the lashes without making my lashes hard and dry.</li>
            <li> The product did make my eyelashes very long but not without giving me a lot of clumps of mascara to go a long with it.</li>
            <li> I applies very fast and does make your lashes look very thick and long</li>
            <li> my lashes look so long!</li>
            <li> Also, it rubbed off all over my lower lash line (and I have dry skin btw).</li>
            <li> the product was dry it also was not seal, had to throw it a way.will not be buying anything from the buyer again.</li>
            <li> I found it to be somewhat dry, and it did not make any noticeable difference to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The mascara is dry.</li>
            <li> The only downside is not to use it in the summer if you are active: golf, tennis, etc.  </li>
            <li> Only lasted a half day, then started running and smearing.  </li>
            <li> It barely comes off even with an eye makeup remover and even then it takes half your lashes with it and is just not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because I felt like it coulda been a little darker.</li>
            <li> It looks a little like a tiny hourglass-shaped bottle brush, but it works like a freaking champ.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly shocked by the love for this mascara.</li>
            <li> So if an occasional speck and thorough washing aren&#x27;t an issue for you, I&#x27;d say the Pros HEAVILY outweigh the cons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not much product in the bottle</li>
            <li> I have been a user for 40 years of the covergirl pink container mascara.  </li>
            <li> I used it a few times then moved on to a different mascara.</li>
            <li> Formula is medium in consistency, not so wet that it uncurls my lashes but gives me raccoon eyes within a couple hours.</li>
            <li> But it takes 3-4 coats before I can get thick lush lashes.</li>
            <li> The mascara product is very black &amp; makes ur lashes thick but not so much length like I expexted.</li>
            <li> Like I said, my cousin&#x27;s eyelashes look amazing when she uses this, so maybe this vendor is sending out some bad batches or virtually empty containers, not sure.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got some old mascara, but this stuff was pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> The brush was likely misshapen because the product was incredibly dry and thick, either expired or just had been opened some time ago.</li>
            <li> but I want to try other brands</li>
            <li> I also use Clump Crusher and have used L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend in the past, and this beats the length/volume of both.</li>
            <li> I did a text of this product on one eye and another brand on the other, oh yes, there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li> Unforunately due to this arriving not in a package and flaking</li>
            <li> It only requires a few coats and it is dark black.  </li>
            <li> It is a very wet formula</li>
            <li> NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> A little dry and clumpy than I expected but not sure if everyone has this experience from this company.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Nice, dark black color&lt;</li>
            <li> If you have doubts, then definitely get the travel size one that way if you dont like it, you wont feel bad for spending so much money on a product that didnt work out.</li>
            <li> I wish it was less exspensive.</li>
            <li> Flakes half way through the day.</li>
            <li> For much less.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it takes less effort to get a fuller and thicker results...</li>
            <li> maybe the problem is with the mascara, but the two together just make a mess of my lashes.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes look twice as long and thick than they are.</li>
            <li> When I want a more dramatic look, I layer this under a volumizing mascara for crazy length AND volume.</li>
            <li> I do like that it doesn&#x27;t get hard or dry out my lashes and can be layered which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> it does get a little clumpy but you can just Half to put a little on at a time</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Seems to come off a little bit *</li>
            <li> , thank God I only bought the travel size first, because I would have been very mad if I had paid lots of money for it.  </li>
            <li> you still have to work with it on your lashes a little to get it</li>
            <li> This mascara is not rightly named, &amp;#34;IT IS NOT BETTER THAN SEX&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Mascara was dried out.</li>
            <li> cause it flaked after a few hours or wear.</li>
            <li> Flakes and smears after a few hours use.</li>
            <li> and I regret it, waste of money</li>
            <li> At any rate, I&#x27;m not using an eye product that isn&#x27;t safety sealed and which appears to have been already used and dried up.</li>
            <li> : It tends to flake SOMETIMES, but I would say that I experience maybe one isolated incident of one or two flakes irritating me every several applications.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> It was already dried up by the time I got it.</li>
            <li> It dried out and clumped out before I could even get through the trial size bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks now and it never disappoints.</li>
            <li> Goodbye spider lashes and uneven eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> After using it a few times you&#x27;ll be drinking the Koolaid with the rest of us.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a huge con in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have long but thin eyelashes</li>
            <li> Thick, gloppy mess.</li>
            <li> The product was dry and the brush a sad little clump of limp fibers instead of</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my roommate but didn&#x27;t realize how SMALL it was.</li>
            <li> It is no better than what I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Lancôme or Benefit mascaras.</li>
            <li> Possibly it was a fake.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right--THIRTY DOLLARS for 6 small items that weighed a fraction of a pound.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I even want it now</li>
            <li> not sure...</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t bother with make up when I work</li>
            <li> I like the small size</li>
            <li> I bought the small one ,</li>
            <li> me lazy)</li>
            <li> And I was surely not going to pay $25 to find out.</li>
            <li> It was very dried out.  </li>
            <li> Just ordinary glumpy thick, gooey mascara, don&#x27;t be fooled.  </li>
            <li> it makes it hard to get the baby lashes</li>
            <li> Hard to imagine</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how some people are say my this mascara sucks</li>
            <li> Others complained that the product wasn&#x27;t packaged well, but that wasn&#x27;t the case for me.</li>
            <li> At least I couldnt find it.</li>
            <li> It made my lashes really thick though.</li>
            <li> The look is not quite as thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick, and &amp;#34;gloppy&amp;#34; save your money.</li>
            <li> It was flaky and too thick.  </li>
            <li> very small</li>
            <li> A little difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> It made it obvious that I was wearing mascara in a BAD way.</li>
            <li> gave this mascara a shot because my YSL is so expensive and was hoping I could find a dupe and save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> It holds a curl, which can be hard to find, adds volume and length without being clumpy!</li>
            <li> the very least, get the travel size to see what the fuss is all about.</li>
            <li> Brush is poorly designed in that</li>
            <li> gave that false lash look.</li>
            <li> I seriously wish this worked for me!</li>
            <li> It crumbles and leaves dark spots all around my eyes. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oddly thick and chunky, and just downright awkward IMO.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve never found a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump, or flake, or smell weird, or give me creepy spider eyelashes, or the formula is too thin, or the brush shape just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I didn&#x27;t get a bad one</li>
            <li> But I am disappointed that i wasted money on this</li>
            <li> People thought my lashes were fake .love</li>
            <li> I got this mascara because I suck at putting on fake eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> NOT BETTER THAN SEX!!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> unlike other mascaras where you sit and apply over and over until it clumps up and looks awful.</li>
            <li> I am officially obsessed with this mascara after recieving a sample from Ulta!</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s not the worst mascara ever</li>
            <li> I guess because of the bad storge</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the bad reviews scare you.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Sort of disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with it</li>
            <li> Awful, clumpy mascara!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The brush gives good natural, full definition. However, there is some smudging.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. I like to try different brands but I think I will be stopping here. This is definitely the best I have found.</li>
            <li> Literally BEST Mascara ever used and awesome purse sized!</li>
            <li> I bought this at the same time that I bought a travel sized tube of Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real. I wanted to be able to see what everyone was raving about without having to pay the high price of a full-sized one just in case I hated it. Personally I like this one better due to the softness of the brush. Benefit&#x27;s was a rigid plastic one that would poke my upper waterline and cause a bit of discomfort so I personally found this easier on my eyelids. It is a very wet formula so be sure to double check that there&#x27;s no mascara that&#x27;s gotten by your brow between when you put it on and when you&#x27;re walking out the door.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent mascara, it really makes my lashes look lush.  The only downside is not to use it in the summer if you are active: golf, tennis, etc.  I will continue to use it otherwise.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite mascaras! I wanted to buy it ever since it came out, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it or not... ( i didn&#x27;t want to spend $23 at sephora until I was sure that I liked it) So, thats why I was so happy to find this &#x27;mini version for cheaper! Its a must have!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought. Loreal brand makes my lashes look much better</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how some people are say my this mascara sucks and it doesn&#x27;t work, this is the only mascara I use and it is amazing, it leaving my lashes looking long and beautiful without getting hard and all clumpy.</li>
            <li> I love it! It does wonders@</li>
            <li> Maybe I got some old mascara, but this stuff was pretty bad.  It was very dried out.  I will not purchase make up from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Mascara was dried out.Must of been old</li>
            <li> wow!! gave that false lash look. but had to take off a star cause it flaked after a few hours or wear.</li>
            <li> Gives great volume! I usually use healthy products, but I bought this for special occasions when I want my eyelashes to look spectacular.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara it does get a little clumpy but you can just Half to put a little on at a time makes my lashes look so long</li>
            <li> Not the real thing. Flakes and smears after a few hours use. The real product doesn&#x27;t do that. NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> This is defiantly a great mascara, it makes your lashes longer and thicker! I will defiantly order more:)</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara! I have really light lashes (I&#x27;m a pale Irish girl), and this mascara plumps them right up with no clumping. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my roommate but didn&#x27;t realize how SMALL it was. That was totally my bad, the product itself is definitely nice and she still loved it.</li>
            <li> Amazing mascara. Do yourself a favor and order it.</li>
            <li> Arrived  on time and it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li> I am officially obsessed with this mascara after recieving a sample from Ulta! It gives me amazingly long, clump-free lashes perfect for a natural, everyday look. When I want a more dramatic look, I layer this under a volumizing mascara for crazy length AND volume. This is definitely a staple in my makeup bag!!</li>
            <li> You know, this is a pretty good mascara. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it has a lot of good qualities, and it&#x27;s one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Stays on all day (no raccoon eyes)&lt;br /&gt;*Nice, dark black color&lt;br /&gt;*But when it&#x27;s time to take it off, gentle makeup remover wipes are all you need&lt;br /&gt;*Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, even with contacts in&lt;br /&gt;*Applicator is great (I don&#x27;t get the mascara anywhere but on my eyelashes)&lt;br /&gt;*And, most importantly, you can actually see it when it&#x27;s on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Seems to come off a little bit *in* my eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again if I ever run out of mascara minis and samples (I&#x27;m overloaded with them at the moment). I like this at least as much as the Lancome Hypnose Drama and better than Bare Minerals Lash Domination or any of the drugstore mascaras I&#x27;ve tried lately.</li>
            <li> I really wish I loved this mascara! I was so dissapointed! It made my lashes really thick though. But it made my lashes have that spider lash look. It made it obvious that I was wearing mascara in a BAD way. It also flaked all over my face and I had to keep using a tissue to wipe it off. Also, it rubbed off all over my lower lash line (and I have dry skin btw). I seriously wish this worked for me! I will continue to use my cover girl lash blast mascara as soon as this mascara runs out!</li>
            <li> Awful, clumpy mascara! I will never purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. That&#x27;s it! Try it!</li>
            <li> Best mascara on the market. Have use 3 tubes and will be buying again. truly amazing product. It is volumizing more then lengthening. It does add length but for best results, use a lengthening mascara for one coat, then this on top. Truly fantastic!</li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews and watched YouTube reviews before buying this. It makes your eyelashes look full. I love it!!</li>
            <li> It smudges!  I will stick to Clinque</li>
            <li> Wonderful mascara and was sent super quick!</li>
            <li> I would buy the entire bottle. You don&#x27;t get enough in the tiny bottle worth this price. It dries out faster and feels cheaper. Just get the large/regular size!</li>
            <li> JK but it makes my eyelashes look awesome.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara. It makes my lashes look huge. I&#x27;ve never been more impressed with a mascara. The only downside is the price. I wish it was less exspensive. But because it&#x27;s so good I might splurge and buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> better than sex mascara is the best I have ever used,</li>
            <li> very small but it&#x27;s pretty good. nice quality but it clumps occasionally. it helps a lot with volume but not length. I like it but I want to try other brands</li>
            <li> Hands down the best mascara i have ever purchased&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a photo of a woman with great lashes and she was asked what she used. My jaw dropped a little at the price, so i bought this smaller size to make sure i liked it before investing in the large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the same results with an easier application than with 3d lashes. The look is not quite as thick so i may still use 3d for nights out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this!</li>
            <li> It was ok nothing special. The mascara product is very black &amp; makes ur lashes thick but not so much length like I expexted.</li>
            <li> My daughter raved about this mascara so much that I had to try it.  Generally, I would never pay this price for mascara, but it is worth every penny.  Long, lush lashes at age 67, finally!</li>
            <li> if I am not wearing other makeup get ready for Raccoon eyes.  If I have the works on, it stays.  And it curls, lengthens, volumizes, so YAY!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used! I will definitely be ordering a bigger size with my next purchase!</li>
            <li> The shipping is excellent as expected, the mascara is sooooooo dry its made my lashes stick together I guess because of the bad storge</li>
            <li> Love! Is a little clumpy on the brush, but once applied looks great, almost like fake lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. Planning on buying it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great mascara. Makes my lashes uber long full and very black. love love love it.  I suggest you try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> It crumbles and leaves dark spots all around my eyes. :(</li>
            <li> I found the item only ok. It did not enlarge my eye lashes as I thought that it would. It is no better than what I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good mascara, but it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this will buy it again. It really gives your eye lashes a great look and make your eyes look smaller also.</li>
            <li> Is it legal to have lashes this long at my age?</li>
            <li> This was just OK to me and certainly not as good as the name implies.  The size of the tube is perfect for your purse or suitcase and I did like the brush.  Separated my lashes nicely, but took about 4 coats to get my lashes looking decent</li>
            <li> Only lasted a half day, then started running and smearing.  I should have stuck with my all time favorite, Lancôme. But I wanted to try something new and I regret it, waste of money</li>
            <li> This product really works. People thought my lashes were fake .love it</li>
            <li> This is an expensive sample tube of mascara that I didn&#x27;t find to be any better than big tubes that cost half the price.  It doesn&#x27;t give you any more eyelashes than you already have and it not does it give you any more length than you already have.</li>
            <li> LOVED LOVED LOVED! Even though its travel size (small) it worked so good! It made my eyelashes look fuller! I have long but thin eyelashes an it made them look thick :) well be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!! It works wonders on my lashes. No clumps at all!&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> Good. Can get clumpy though. I don&#x27;t like it any more or less than me este Lauder.</li>
            <li> Want long lashes? Buy this product. Don&#x27;t like the price? Buy the mini-travel size. As it&#x27;s recommended that you throw out mascara every three months anyway, why buy the regular size if you&#x27;ll waste a good portion. I have tried many brands: this makes my lashes long and thick. Love it.</li>
            <li> Thick, gloppy mess. Flakes half way through the day. I usually buy Lancôme or Benefit mascaras. Overpriced. But, nice packaging. Would never buy again.</li>
            <li> Bleeds during the day so i was always looking in mirror to make sure i didnt have racoon face. Price is way to high. It did make my lashes fuller and thicker, no clumping.</li>
            <li> the product was dry it also was not seal, had to throw it a way.will not be buying anything from the buyer again.</li>
            <li> Was really excited about this mascara based on the customer reviews here and elsewhere online, and decided a mini would be a great way to try it without investing too much. Glad I didn&#x27;t order the full size from seller A2ZLiquidators, because I might as well have thrown my $6 into the toilet. The product arrived in a very timely fashion, but there was no documentation in the envelope with the tube of mascara, and the mascara had no box or safety seal. It was just a tube of (probably already used) mascara hanging out in an envelope. The product was dry and the brush a sad little clump of limp fibers instead of the bristly hourglass brush I was expecting. The brush was likely misshapen because the product was incredibly dry and thick, either expired or just had been opened some time ago. Possibly it was a fake. At any rate, I&#x27;m not using an eye product that isn&#x27;t safety sealed and which appears to have been already used and dried up. Gross. If I try this mascara again, I&#x27;ll get it directly from a brick-and-mortar retailer where I can be sure I&#x27;m not being sold someone&#x27;s old used-up makeup. Product may well be awesome, but the seller is shady.</li>
            <li> I really notice a difference in my lashes when I use this and when I don&#x27;t.  I get compliments on my lashes by strangers when I wear it. Nobody says a word to me when I don&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t really like the wand though.  it makes it hard to get the baby lashes and if you try you end up smudging.  I was using the butterfly brush prior to this one and was impressed on how it covered every lash.  It&#x27;s not annoying enough for me to stop using it!! Sometimes, I grab my butterfly brush and dip it in this. A make up cardinal sin but oh well</li>
            <li> First, I like the brush that comes with this mascara. It is a fat brush and the product goes on my lashes nicely. But it takes 3-4 coats before I can get thick lush lashes. And sometimes I even sleep in it- just to add more layers the next day. (Horrible I know) I do like that it doesn&#x27;t get hard or dry out my lashes and can be layered which is a plus for me. I only gave it 3 stars because it also smudges easily and looks like I have dark circles under my eyes if I am not conscious about keeping it wiped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My go-to mascara is YSL Faux Cils because I can get the huge lashes I want with only 2 coats, and it also layers nicely and does not seem to smudge or take much to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this mascara a shot because my YSL is so expensive and was hoping I could find a dupe and save a few bucks. But looks like I will be paying the extra money to stick with what I know works.</li>
            <li> 4get abt ysl dior or lancome, this one is the best!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara even though it does get clumpy after a few uses.  I just have to work with it to get it to individualize each lash. It really adds volume and length to my lashes better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It sometimes clumps and little pieces fall into my eye, but that doesn&#x27;t happen very often. In other words, I love this Mascara. It&#x27;s the only mascara that does exactly what it says its going to do... ThanksToo Faced!</li>
            <li> First of all not much is better than sex. As far as the mascara goes. It DOES thicken but doesn&#x27;t lengthen. Im glad that I only purchased the travel size. Don&#x27;t need to spend that much money on a mascara.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  I tried one of these before in a gift pkg before and loved it.  I was so happy to find it here and order more at a discount.  Awesome mascara!  Really makes your lashes lengthen and separate beautifully.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best mascara I have ever used. It makes my eyelashes look twice as long and thick than they are.</li>
            <li> Good thing I just bought the travel size. I&#x27;ll stick with my Clinique mascara. It&#x27;s too thick, and &amp;#34;gloppy&amp;#34; save your money.</li>
            <li> I was not super impressed by this mascara. I found it to be somewhat dry, and it did not make any noticeable difference to my eyelashes. I&#x27;m glad I only got the travel size, and will likely only use it when I am flying somewhere.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I gave it to my daughter and she absolutely loves it. It&#x27;s a heavy mascara and really coats her lashes well. They look almost double the depth of her lashes without it applied.</li>
            <li> I really like the mascara and my eyelashes get complimented every time I wear it.  I so want the full version!</li>
            <li> The best mascara I have ever used - bar none.  My mom keeps sneaking it because she loves it too!</li>
            <li> After reading some positive reviews on this expensive mascara, I was thrilled to find &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; sizes at such a bargain price.  In my excitement, I put six into my cart and hit the &amp;#34;Buy with one click&amp;#34; option.  That turned out to be a tremendous joke--on me.  I was charged nearly $30 in shipping costs.  That&#x27;s right--THIRTY DOLLARS for 6 small items that weighed a fraction of a pound.  On top of all that, the mascara, while good, is not one bit better than &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; brands like NYC, L&#x27;Oreal, Revlon, and Cover Girl.  Do NOT make the same mistake I did.  From now on, I will ALWAYS check the shipping charges before purchasing ANYTHING from ANYONE--ever again!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I bought the &amp;#34;They&#x27;re real&amp;#34; mascara before this one and at first I loved it but after about a week I hated it! It barely comes off even with an eye makeup remover and even then it takes half your lashes with it and is just not worth the money. But the &amp;#34;Better than sex&amp;#34; is definitely worth the money it&#x27;s softer and more gentle on your eyes it makes them look longer and not like they are covered in mascara. Very easy apply and simple to make your eyes look stunning!!! I absolutely love it!! I will forsure be buying more when the time comes!</li>
            <li> Just ordinary glumpy thick, gooey mascara, don&#x27;t be fooled.  I&#x27;ts nothing special, so don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.</li>
            <li> I heard lots of hype about this mascara, and for me it lived up to it, sorta. It really extends the lashes without making my lashes hard and dry. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because I felt like it coulda been a little darker. Other than that it is pretty miraculous to me because my eyelashes are almost non-existant. I will definitely order this again!</li>
            <li> When it comes to black mascara, this is my holy grail.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Absolutely incredible volume, false eyelash length, does NOT clump, even when I&#x27;m loading obscene amounts of coats on my lashes, and actually adds curl. I don&#x27;t need a curler with this, personally. When it comes to visual effect, this mascara is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and it has it all. I also use Clump Crusher and have used L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend in the past, and this beats the length/volume of both. Plus, like I said, adds curl and doesn&#x27;t clump. Easily buildable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: It tends to flake SOMETIMES, but I would say that I experience maybe one isolated incident of one or two flakes irritating me every several applications. Definitely not a huge con in my eyes. A little difficult to wash off. So if an occasional speck and thorough washing aren&#x27;t an issue for you, I&#x27;d say the Pros HEAVILY outweigh the cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be repurchasing this product once the travel size ran out. I wanted to sample it first.</li>
            <li> This really does work, I have short lashes so I spend a lot of time and money on mascara and this works for me I will be getting this in the regular size</li>
            <li> In love with this product, shipped VERY fast and the mascara is absoluty AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I love this product,  this is my first time trying it. I got this mascara because I suck at putting on fake eyelashes.  This mascara makes my eyelashes not only look longer but more full looking too. It is a must buy, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> love this product and will reorder</li>
            <li> This product...while it does go on smooth and silky, tends to have some fall out. But I still enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about its cheeky claim, but this mascara does everything you would want it to! It holds a curl, which can be hard to find, adds volume and length without being clumpy! This mascara isn&#x27;t water proof so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest wearing in  on your lower lashes.</li>
            <li> Not only did my product arrive before time, but I absolutely LOVE the mascara. I heard about it on a talk show and they RAVED on how long and healthy this mascara made your lashes look. I just wanted to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; it. AWESOME decision!</li>
            <li> Excellent Seller, perfect item!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Love the way this mascara looks on but tends to fall throughout the day.  Still a great product to provide the appearance of longer an dthicker lashes.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It really can separate lashes! My only con is it seems to clump on the brush sooner than 3 months, which is what I&#x27;m use to for drugstore. This really give better volume though!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product that I plan on reordering In the near future! It made my lashes look amazing !</li>
            <li> This gives me lashes like I am 16 again! Love it!</li>
            <li> My cousin has been raving about this mascara so i figured i&#x27;d give it a try and buy the trial size. Her eyelashes look awesome when she wears this, but when i put it on, i put on 3 coats and didn&#x27;t see a big difference at all, especially comapared to the They&#x27;re Real mascara that i&#x27;ve been using, and i&#x27;ll continue to use now. Like I said, my cousin&#x27;s eyelashes look amazing when she uses this, so maybe this vendor is sending out some bad batches or virtually empty containers, not sure. But I am disappointed that i wasted money on this and i even got myself excited.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. A little dry and clumpy than I expected but not sure if everyone has this experience from this company. I try to use it as i can see some results.</li>
            <li> Lasts long on your eyes but it&#x27;s not much product in the bottle</li>
            <li> This is worth the money!! makes your eyelashes really stand out!</li>
            <li> I did a text of this product on one eye and another brand on the other, oh yes, there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li> i loved this mascara. i will be getting the full size.  the sample size is a little more than i would pay for a sample.</li>
            <li> Others complained that the product wasn&#x27;t packaged well, but that wasn&#x27;t the case for me. It came in its original packaging securely without being crushed. I am glad I bought the travel size and not the full, because there is no way this mascara could be worth that much. I used it and found that it looked no better than when I use the Maybelline Colossal Volume mascara. Sure, the brush looks cool, but that is about it. This product is good and as advertised, but it isn&#x27;t this amazing mind-blowing mascara like some say.</li>
            <li> I love the smaller size.  It doesn&#x27;t get clumpy before it is gone.  This is my favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> It came sooner than expected, the the actual product did not meet my expectations. It dried too fast and didn&#x27;t really helped with my lashes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely incredible! I love this mascara! It is certainly a great product! I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Better than anything!</li>
            <li> I have been waiting for this since March. Not sure if I even want it now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. It doesn&#x27;t curl as much as some others, but it flakes MUCH LESS than others, as well. I&#x27;ve tried some cheap stuff like NYC, then stuff like Cover Girl and L&#x27;oreal, but those all flake off a lot. I don&#x27;t want to have to keep dusting my eyes off throughout the day. It may start to flake off more with multiple coats, but with one coat it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> it waa great for the first 30 minutes but then it alwayss smudges</li>
            <li> It dried out super quickly. Also, I think I would&#x27;ve been better off just getting the full size. I think they skimp on the quality of the brush on the travel size.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Easy to apply. Nice thick bristle brush. Lashes do improve in width in length. Rating&#x3D; 8/10.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure that I agree with the name of the mascara (haha!), but it is definitely one of my favorites! It was shipped to me really quickly and I used it the morning I received it! It definitely kept my eyelashes long and full all day!</li>
            <li> I recived this im not sure of the date, the mascara it self was not in a package, but it did seem new and not previously used.</li>
            <li> This mascara looks great on.  It&#x27;s not as dramatic as advertised, but it is very good.  I really like this smaller, travel size, also making it more affordable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the money for the full size. It doesn&#x27;t clump which I think is because of the brush which I love. But i think drugstore might work just as well. It wears off pretty easy compared to my drugstore brands. My lashes are already very curly and long but I love it! I&#x27;ll just keeping looking for something else because I just don&#x27;t think for the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for me I did not like it at all. Clumpy. Waste of money</li>
            <li> better than sex? I&#x60;m not sure...haha...but much better than most of the mascaras I tested before! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been a user for 40 years of the covergirl pink container mascara.  I tried this sample from Ulta and loved how fast it went from each edge of the last and separated the lashes and the appearance was thinker, longer looking.  Maybe I&#x27;m getting lazy in my middle age to do it quicker, but I think this is definately worth a try.  It&#x27;s a tiny tube, not the traditional size of a mascara.</li>
            <li> Loved it works very well.</li>
            <li> NOT BETTER THAN SEX!!!! CLUMPS&amp;#60; CLUMPS &amp; MORE CLUMPS!!</li>
            <li> The product did make my eyelashes very long but not without giving me a lot of clumps of mascara to go a long with it. Works great for volume and height added to your lashes but not so well with going on smoothly and not clumping up. I am very glad I tried it out before spending a lot more money on a full size one.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I&#x27;m glad I purchased this mascara. Itlooks llike I have light lashes on. I use it daily and I usually don&#x27;t bother with make up when I work</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this after reading reviews of it. It was ok, but not amazing.  While I did get some nice volume and length it flaked off a lot throughout the day. I also noticed it irritated my eyes more than normal, but that could have been caused by the flakes getting under my contact lenses. I have had better experiences w cheaper drugstore brands. That being said- the mini version of this was a perfect way to try it out.</li>
            <li> BEST MASCARA EVER.&lt;br /&gt;NO CLUMPS AND YOUR LASHES LOOK FULLER AND LONGER THAN EVER.</li>
            <li> Just like reviews have stated, a very nice, thick, unclumped finish.  The large tester is a good size and well worth the money.  I would buy the full size.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many people say great things about this mascara so I was expecting great things out of this product. So when I found this trial size version at a decent price I decided to try it that way if I did like it I would go on to invest in the full size. However, it just didn&#x27;t amaze me. I mean it&#x27;s not the worst mascara ever but to me not the greatest either. I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I didn&#x27;t get a bad one and so I didn&#x27;t get to experience the best formula of this product, but whatever I received was just ok for me. I used it a few times then moved on to a different mascara. Hopefully it will work out better for some than it did for me.</li>
            <li> This is more like a sample size than travel size. Definitely not worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> It was already dried up by the time I got it.</li>
            <li> Leaks to cheeks... smudging under eyes.</li>
            <li> I feel like I was given a used tube. Very disappointed. I think I would&#x27;ve loved the product if there was any mascara left in the actual tube.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty good masacara. I like the small size so I can actually finish the product. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Made my moms eyelashes even larger 0.0</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ot a make up person by any means however I saw this in a catalog and thought I try it and boy am I glad I did not only did it make my eye lashes fan out but since I wear glasses 100% of the time everyone notice them some even thought I had eye lash extentions one... trust me when I say this is the only product you need for your lashes....</li>
            <li> Not so great. Brush is poorly designed in that is is fatter at the end so I get mascara on my eyelids when I&#x27;m trying to get at the corners of my lashes.  Formula is medium in consistency, not so wet that it uncurls my lashes but gives me raccoon eyes within a couple hours. I won&#x27;t be buying a full size.</li>
            <li> No seal nothing on this product! The mascara is dry. Looks used, will trash it.</li>
            <li> Sooo when it comes to mascara, I am usually disappointed when I pay more than the good old stand by - Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash! (Most of you guys know what I mean... the good old fav that usually can&#x27;t be be beat for the price until now!) I&#x27;ve paid for the higher end brands and not been too impressed. BUT.... This one is amazing and I have to say that it may have won me over. I&#x27;ve used it for two days since recieving it and love it! I&#x27;d definitely recommend! Though it is pretty pricey, I purchased the smaller version to try it... I might have to splurge and say that I love it!</li>
            <li> It was flaky and too thick.  Did not apply well.  It seemed old.</li>
            <li> The brush is amazing.  Gives really full lashes.  Went on smoothly. Loved the thickness it gave my lashes. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> OMG......I love this mascara. I bought the small one ,just incase I didn&#x27;t like it...BUT, just 1 coat and my eyelashes look so good...WHO made this? So glad they did. Going to have to order a full size tube of this little black magic.  Made my eyelashes look longer and fuller....LOVE this product....Mascara did not smudge or clump.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara! It goes on great and lasts all day with no flaking. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried, but I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s amazing. This probably means I should try more mascara. To the point though, it does lengthen and volumize, but it clumps and flakes and its easy to get spider leg lashes. I&#x27;ll use it till it&#x27;s done, then try something else.</li>
            <li> I really do like this, it seems to catch all you lashes.</li>
            <li> Finally, the perfect mascara is here.  I&#x27;ve got long eyelashes and always wanted a mascara that didn&#x27;t give me a clumpy look and this is it. Its perfect. I don&#x27;t curl my lashes(call me lazy) but when I use too faced better than sex mascara, they curl, they look natural and they gain volume. It amazing how light it feels even after several coats. It doesn&#x27;t run either.  First coat gives you volume n curls the lashes. Second coat just makes them look more prominent n gives extra curls.  I&#x27;m in love with it and will die happy coz I found my favorite mascara.  The seller shipped it promptly and I was super excited to try it, only to see it was dry and wasn&#x27;t like anything I&#x27;ve tried at ulta store. So I contacted the seller and he was generous enough to send me a replacement only this one was a bit clumpy. But I switched the brushes and guess what, its perfect like I&#x27;ve known it to be.</li>
            <li> Sort of disappointed in this product. The mascara got really crappy really quick.</li>
            <li> This item is a travel size and was $8.00. It works great but clumps up at the end of the brush so you have maneuver the brush to take the excess mascara off prior to putting it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as good as what I remembered the full size being. This one was all dried out and doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes pop out like the full sized one did. It clumps together and crumbles off throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and have used it non-stop since discovering it. I have used full sizes and mini sizes and they all work great!</li>
            <li> This product is great at first. I loved the formula and still love the brush. But it dries out and gets clumpy insanely quick. I only bought the trial size cause I didn&#x27;t want to invest in something if it wouldn&#x27;t work for me. It dried out and clumped out before I could even get through the trial size bottle. I live in Southern Arizona though, so maybe the heat had something to do with it? Maybe it&#x27;s better in colder climates?</li>
            <li> this product was ok. but not the holy grail product that I was expecting.  I would not purchase the full size item. For the price there are plenty of drugstore dupes.</li>
            <li> I WILL be buying the full size product. This mascara does everything it claims it will. This is the best mascara I have EVER tried and I currently have 26 mascaras. The formula adds massive volume and length with out clumping. I would recommend this to anyone who wants natural lashes that could pass as falsies without being over dramatic, It is fine for everyday wear. If you don&#x27;t wear make up often, this would be the perfect pop for dates, weddings or any special event.</li>
            <li> Smudged a lot throughout the day. My lids get a little oily and the product rubbed off right on my brow bone after only a few hours. I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great. It only requires a few coats and it is dark black.  I would recommend wiping off excess product, but it is by far one of the best mascaras I have used up until now.  I use many different brands such as, Benefit, Dior, Lancôme, Loreal, Maybelline, etc.  This is a good one.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best Mascara&#x27;s of all the ones I have purchased, gives Volume and appears to make my lashes longer ,Goes on smooth not dry and takes me through the day .I don&#x27;t wear any on my lower lashes because this isn&#x27;t water prof also this doesn&#x27;t go on clumpy I like it so much I ordered another one!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of mascara&#x27;s. And I have to tell this is the best mascara I have ever used love it !!</li>
            <li> For the name I was expecting more. I dont like that it doesnt come in brown. At least I couldnt find it. The brush is HUGE. I applies very fast and does make your lashes look very thick and long but it doesnt last long. Its flaking hours later. I prefer the stiletto mascara made by another company. I think it&#x27;s good for night make up. I dont think I&#x27;d buy it again anytime soon.</li>
            <li> So happy I just bought trial sized. This did nothing for my lashes. It also clumped with each layer. Melted easily. Do much better with Cover Girl bombshell. For much less.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I bought the travel size to try out before purchasing the full size. I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks now and it never disappoints. It can get clumpy if overly applied, but if you like that look, just let it dry, brush it out with a clean brush and re-apply. The before and after difference is amazing. I have short, fine lashes. This gives me the va va voom that I was looking for. Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> I brought this mascara because it promised so much, and I thought If it is better than sex, it have to be good. Well for one,  it runs and smears when I touch my eyes.  My lash is no more better for it. I thought maybe if i put more on my lash, my lash iwould be more noticeable, or I could just use the liquid with another one of my mascara brushes that works, well that does not work because it is not waterproof and it would not only be on my lash but everywhere else. . I am very disappointed with it, thank God I only bought the travel size first, because I would have been very mad if I had paid lots of money for it.  This mascara is not rightly named, &amp;#34;IT IS NOT BETTER THAN SEX&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I think it Worked very we&#x27;ll great for traveling and was very very very very useful for a daily use</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;oreal telescoping mascara is much better for lengthening. I&#x27;m glad I only got the travel size. Not better than sex, for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many online reviews about how awesome Better Than Sex Mascara is, and I just could not believe that it was that life-changing. And I was surely not going to pay $25 to find out. So I got the mini size just to see....&lt;br /&gt;The brush is different. But good different. It looks a little like a tiny hourglass-shaped bottle brush, but it works like a freaking champ. Full disclosure: I have very good eyelashes. I can slap on some Revlon or L&#x27;Oreal and it looks fine. But I&#x27;ve never found a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump, or flake, or smell weird, or give me creepy spider eyelashes, or the formula is too thin, or the brush shape just doesn&#x27;t work for me. THIS is IT!&lt;br /&gt;It took a couple of uses to get used to the long bristles of the brush, but the brush design is sheer genius. I could never get my right eye and left eye to look similar, but this does it. Now, I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;ll put this on and magically it&#x27;s perfect- you still have to work with it on your lashes a little to get it just right. BUT the bristles do some amazing lash separating. And they ensure that your lashes are REALLY coated.&lt;br /&gt;The formula itself is pretty rad too- I had no clumping and NO FLAKES! Yea!&lt;br /&gt;I think the key is to apply and keep working with it until you&#x27;re happy. Then apply your second coat. Goodbye spider lashes and uneven eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;At the very least, get the travel size to see what the fuss is all about. After using it a few times you&#x27;ll be drinking the Koolaid with the rest of us. ;)</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about this mascara but the price was a bit more than i am used to paying for mascara. That&#x27;s why i was excited about the trial size. well it arrived fast and i can see it is well worth the price. my lashes look so long! I will definitely buy the full size.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me, and I will be getting of this product when needed. Try it ! And the price is great too.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the only mascara I will use now, it&#x27;s formula is amazing and makes my eyelashes really pop.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous mascara! I highly recommend it.. It&#x27;s super creamy and gives great length.. My eyes just pop after wearing this mascara!</li>
            <li> good place to buy from. very professional</li>
            <li> Best mascar I&#x27;ve ever used. Absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> Wear it every day! Can&#x27;t wait to get the bigger size.  Best mascara yet.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and was happy to find it in travel size.  Wish that it came in a box, and not with a label stuck to the side of it that couldnt be removed.</li>
            <li> The brush carries so much mascara on it that it is almost impossible to do more than one coat...and that coat sticks lashes together and clumps. This looks like it could really be a fantastic brush...maybe the problem is with the mascara, but the two together just make a mess of my lashes. I have been on a mission to find the best mascara for my lashes for over a year, and this is NOT one of the better ones. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! my eyelashes never looked better!</li>
            <li> It coats evenly and doesn&#x27;t clump.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> BEST mascara out there....for me. It fluffs up the lashes like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I had chemo....so I lost my eyelashes, but when they came back? I returned to using this mascara. The travel size is all I need because it can dry up from frequent use...like most mascaras. I love this one though and I have used many. My holy grail mascara! I FOUND IT!!!</li>
            <li> Good make up. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s the best mascara I ever used in my whole make up life :) Thanks to grav3yardgirl for making a viedo on Youtube showing how this product works its total amazing :) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara!!! It makes my eyelashes look AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. One of the best I ever used.</li>
            <li> Hard to imagine but this was too much mascara.  It looked like you were wearing mascara rather than having nice lashes.</li>
            <li> Tube was unsealed and used.  Returned it immediately, I&#x27;m not risking using used makeup.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed! Didn&#x27;t keep my lashes curled at all. Flaked off just an hour after application. Fail.</li>
            <li> So I got mine from Ulta. Tbh, as nice as it is to get things for cheaper value, as you may have read some sellers are shady.&lt;br /&gt;And you figure for $10 more you get the full size. But they time tax is added on and if there&#x27;s a shipping cost, you&#x27;ve pretty much paid for a full size.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my lashes feel great. It&#x27;s not heavy at all. If you&#x27;ve tried Maybeline&#x27;s MegaPlush mascara, it&#x27;s very light weight on your lashes like that mascara. It doesn&#x27;t clump on my lashes and makes them long longer. If you are weary of the price, I would go with the MegaPlush tbh. Don&#x27;t let the bad reviews scare you. Everyone is different and has difference in opinions. I have sensitive skin and eyes. It doesn&#x27;t hurt me. So I&#x27;d give it a try. But you know, if you go to Ulta or Sephora and ask if you could try it, they may let you.</li>
            <li> makes eyelashess pop !</li>
            <li> Really, an awesome product!!! The best mascara that I have used, and I have gone through many!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful mascara. I went to Sephora to buy a different mascara to try out and this one was available for free with 100 points (I have a lot of points so I used it). This turned out to be WAY better than the one I had bought...which I will be returning and getting a bigger size of this mascara! It gives a lot of volume without clumping. I noticed that it takes less effort to get a fuller and thicker results...unlike other mascaras where you sit and apply over and over until it clumps up and looks awful. I highly recommend this product, it is now what I use daily.</li>
            <li> Great volume and very black which I love</li>
            <li> I have tried 2 other expensive brands recently, one w/ 5 stars, and this is AMAZING.  Had no problems w/ the packaging or flaking.  I am 68 years old, still rocking the  high heels and teaching public school full time.  On the prowl for the Love of My Life so want to look SEXY !!!  My eye lashes lQQk the best THEY HAVE EVER LQQKED!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was super dry not very good. wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very nice thank you to upscale deal</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought the trail size to see if I like this mascara before spending over 20$ on the full bottle. I now own the full bottle and couldn&#x27;t imagine not using this product. It makes my lashes look so long and amazing. This is definitely a beauty must.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly shocked by the love for this mascara. I have tried tons of better ones--both high end and drug store. I feel like the biggest drawback with this liner is the applicator. It&#x27;s oddly thick and chunky, and just downright awkward IMO. Don&#x27;t even TRY to use this for bottom lashes... Oh and do yourselves a favor and save your money and buy my holy grail mascara: http://www.amazon.com/Loreal-Voluminous-Mascara-Carbon-0-26-Fluid/dp/B004BCXAM8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1420749958&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;loreal+carbon+black+mascara</li>
            <li> . the hourglass shape of the wand makes it easier for the lashes. My lashes dont clump at all.  My lashes are naturally long but for some reason this mascara makes it seem like i have applied falsies. It just makes my lashes look amazing!!!!. If you have doubts, then definitely get the travel size one that way if you dont like it, you wont feel bad for spending so much money on a product that didnt work out. BTW! I gave it 4 stars because i didnt like how it applied to my lower lashes. I use the maybelline full n soft for my lower lashes,</li>
            <li> If I had reviewed the first week I had got this would&#x27;ve been a 5 star review. Unforunately due to this arriving not in a package and flaking I had to just give it 4. This mascara does give great volume and length but I stick to using it at night because of the flaking.</li>
    </ol>
