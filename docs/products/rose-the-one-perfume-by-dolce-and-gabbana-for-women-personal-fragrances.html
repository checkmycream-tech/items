            <li>I happened to be at the fragrance counter at Macy&#x27;s and tried Miss Dior Cherie and absolutely loved it.  </li>

            <li>Packing was good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy with Rose the One.  </li>

            <li>Smells good.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>The sales woman handed me D&amp;G Rose</li>
            <li>But when I smelled Rose the One I knew I found the fragrance made for me.  </li>
            <li>But this one smells like the rose but</li>
            <li>I will keep looking for a rose scented perfume that lasts.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t even return the product because it is deemed hazardous or flamable.  </li>
            <li>Product was as described and  advertise arrive on time or within the promise arrival time , totally satisfied  with my purchase , Price was good</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, really like it.</li>
            <li>well i bought this perfume on Amazon because i had liked it at Sephora, with the exeption that at Sephora this perfume was 100.00 dlls, when i sprayed the perfume there, at the store it lasted all</li>
            <li>Real thing unopened, and a great price too!!</li>
            <li>Very light, fragrant and feminine.</li>
            <li>Very light and refreshing daytime scent.</li>
            <li>I love it even more than Miss Dior Cherie.  </li>
            <li>oh so lovely.</li>
            <li>The eau de parfum is more concentrated than the eau de toilette.</li>
            <li>I love how the bottle looks as well.</li>
            <li>Was sent to wronge address and some one else enjoyed .  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love designer parfums.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Was recommended a co worker who got this for his wife to try out this perfume with my wife and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s both feminine and sexy.</li>
            <li>I love this scent...</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found many who where it, and love the compliments I get from others when I walk in a room.  </li>
            <li>Wish bottle was bigger, but very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfrum.</li>
            <li>On the authentic perfume it&#x27;s a metal lid.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought this because someone else had one, and I fell in love with the scent.  </li>
            <li>I tried a bunch of perfumes in an airport duty-free shop and found this one to be my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Being my wife&#x27;s favorite made this an easy purchase.  </li>
            <li>When you spray the perfume, there is  scent sort of like the rose the one, more alcohol&#x27;y&#x27;, if that makes sense, and the scent goes away right away.  </li>
            <li>I love Stella McCartney, Rose Absolute, but, like every product I love</li>
            <li>This fragrance smells just like a fresh rose.</li>
            <li>I no longer enjoy the citrusy, strong fruity fragrances that I used to love.  </li>
            <li>It was received very quickly after ordering it.</li>
            <li>packaging makes it really easy to store in any bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li>While the aroma of the perfume is good, it seems to dissipate very quickly, how much can one use at one time without smelling like cheap pot-pourrie?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was delivered timely but it was a strong &amp;#34;old woman&amp;#34; type of smell</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s favorite smell is different, however I have had so many people ask me what I was wearing because they loved this scent.</li>
            <li>This is my first online cologne purchase, and I am thrilled with this scent.  </li>
            <li>And everything was fine ...........</li>
            <li>it is NOT fruity or sicky sweet but rather very rich and light.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny and more.  </li>
            <li>As always, got it for a great price and terrific convenience via Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>All my expectations were filled.</li>
            <li>Lol.. thanks you so much .</li>
            <li>This perfume is perfect for everyday wear or special occasion and  females of all ages.</li>
            <li>This version is better than the first one.</li>
            <li>First of all, the scent is feminine, light but concentrated, soft, elegant, rose (but not too floral),fresh, and</li>
            <li>Fresh, light, clean.</li>
            <li>, I was super excited.</li>
            <li>Super excited I can get this cheaper here.</li>
            <li>Not even the super popular light blue.</li>
            <li>yet super feminine and</li>
            <li>I feel soooo pretty in it!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this perfume when my cousin sprayed this on herself near me and the scent caught my attention.</li>
            <li>that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite parfum so far.</li>
            <li>I had read other peoples reviews about how great AAA MERCHANTS services was and the fast delivery</li>
            <li>I feel super feminine and pretty when I wear this</li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked for a rose cologne for a long time, it makes me think of my grandmother.</li>
            <li>very fast shipping by Amazon.</li>
            <li>Because all colognes/perfumes that are new and ORIGINAL are suppose to stay longer on you no matter what the brand is.</li>
            <li>I asked for a soft, floral, light scented perfume.</li>
            <li>I absolutely am in love with this perfume and definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>So be aware of this when you buy a fragrance.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t understand why he would do that.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend knew exactly was.</li>
            <li>iT WAS HER FIRST TIME USING A D&amp;G PRODUCT..</li>
            <li>Smells different on every one, but I love it on me c;</li>
            <li>First, I didn&#x27;t buy this perfume here yet.</li>
            <li>but it does not last on me for more than two hours..</li>
            <li>went to work the other day in Rose</li>
            <li>the rose does smell perfect but the scent will only last for a few hrs and you need to respray it constantly during the day.</li>
            <li>Good switch from heavy, intense fragrances that go along with winter scarves, hats, boots, leggings, wooly sweaters.</li>
            <li>Perfium evaporates very fast, contains lots of alcohol, I don&#x27;t think it is the real Dolce &amp; Gabbana, to be hones I am dissapointed</li>
            <li>A little pricey but nice.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, Amazon has the 2.5 ounce bottle for almost the same price as the 1.6 ounce bottle that I bought!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It isnot to be the real</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>But I absolutely adore this combination with the spray bottle, the roller ball and the lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fussy about my perfume</li>
            <li>This perfume smells so real, remind me of real roses once i had in my garden.</li>
            <li>this is not the real</li>
            <li>She loves it and can get by a whole day with one spray on the neck.</li>
            <li>Not the real thing.</li>
            <li>PURCHASED AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT, THE RECIPIENT APPRECIATED THE SIZE AND PACKAGING OF THE PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>I never like roses much because I always thought of them being old fashion and very granny.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>got there on time in fact a little early, very convenient and excellant pricing too :-)</li>
            <li>I have many perfumes and all are soft fragrances but lasting some times until next day</li>
            <li>I researched and narrowed my choices down to Rose the One and J&#x27;Adore and several others.  </li>
            <li>It really took me a long time to decide if the reviews I had read on here were right or not.  </li>
            <li>Found out that it is now discontinued, so I decided to buy a new scent.</li>
            <li>The packaging, and the bottle all look exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>I first smell this at a local mall as I was looking for a Bday gift.</li>
            <li>Went to a fragrance outlet to buy another bottle of my old perfume.</li>
            <li>It gave me goosebumps and raised my pulse rate and even made my scalp tingle and sweat a little - in short - a very positive reaction!!     </li>
            <li>The scent is so sophisticated and subtle that anytime I wore it, everyone took noticed.</li>
            <li>Put in the order, return small bottle, and get my money back!! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I just hope it&#x27;s not fake because of the reviews of people that they do not last that long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feminine and light enough for everyday.</li>
            <li>It cost about half the price it does in the stores and it was shipped right to my work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully soft and very romantic.  </li>
            <li>Definitely for someone looking for a natural scent.</li>
            <li>Not only does it last longer, I don&#x27;t like ruining my clothes when I spray it directly on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and discovered recently that my body chemistry is reacting differently to the perfumes I currently have.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Thanks for the great purchase.</li>

            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Being my wife&#x27;s favorite made this an easy purchase.  </li>
            <li> When you spray the perfume, there is  scent sort of like the rose the one, more alcohol&#x27;y&#x27;, if that makes sense, and the scent goes away right away.  </li>
            <li> I love Stella McCartney, Rose Absolute, but, like every product I love</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells just like a fresh rose.</li>
            <li> I no longer enjoy the citrusy, strong fruity fragrances that I used to love.  </li>
            <li> It was received very quickly after ordering it.</li>

            <li> It was delivered timely but it was a strong &amp;#34;old woman&amp;#34; type of smell</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s favorite smell is different, however I have had so many people ask me what I was wearing because they loved this scent.</li>
            <li> This is my first online cologne purchase, and I am thrilled with this scent.  </li>
            <li> And everything was fine ...........</li>
            <li> it is NOT fruity or sicky sweet but rather very rich and light.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny and more.  </li>
            <li> As always, got it for a great price and terrific convenience via Amazon Prime.</li>

            <li> This version is better than the first one.</li>
            <li> First of all, the scent is feminine, light but concentrated, soft, elegant, rose (but not too floral),fresh, and</li>
            <li> Fresh, light, clean.</li>
            <li> , I was super excited.</li>
            <li> Super excited I can get this cheaper here.</li>
            <li> Not even the super popular light blue.</li>
            <li> yet super feminine and</li>
            <li> I feel soooo pretty in it!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this perfume when my cousin sprayed this on herself near me and the scent caught my attention.</li>
            <li> that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite parfum so far.</li>
            <li> I had read other peoples reviews about how great AAA MERCHANTS services was and the fast delivery</li>
            <li> I feel super feminine and pretty when I wear this</li>
            <li> Right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for a rose cologne for a long time, it makes me think of my grandmother.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Because all colognes/perfumes that are new and ORIGINAL are suppose to stay longer on you no matter what the brand is.</li>
            <li> I asked for a soft, floral, light scented perfume.</li>
            <li> I absolutely am in love with this perfume and definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> So be aware of this when you buy a fragrance.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t understand why he would do that.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend knew exactly was.</li>
            <li> iT WAS HER FIRST TIME USING A D&amp;G PRODUCT..</li>
            <li> Smells different on every one, but I love it on me c;</li>
            <li> First, I didn&#x27;t buy this perfume here yet.</li>
            <li> but it does not last on me for more than two hours..</li>
            <li> went to work the other day in Rose</li>
            <li> the rose does smell perfect but the scent will only last for a few hrs and you need to respray it constantly during the day.</li>
            <li> Good switch from heavy, intense fragrances that go along with winter scarves, hats, boots, leggings, wooly sweaters.</li>
            <li> Perfium evaporates very fast, contains lots of alcohol, I don&#x27;t think it is the real Dolce &amp; Gabbana, to be hones I am dissapointed</li>
            <li> A little pricey but nice.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, Amazon has the 2.5 ounce bottle for almost the same price as the 1.6 ounce bottle that I bought!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It isnot to be the real</li>
            <li> hahaha</li>
            <li> But I absolutely adore this combination with the spray bottle, the roller ball and the lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fussy about my perfume</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so real, remind me of real roses once i had in my garden.</li>
            <li> this is not the real</li>
            <li> She loves it and can get by a whole day with one spray on the neck.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing.</li>
            <li> PURCHASED AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT, THE RECIPIENT APPRECIATED THE SIZE AND PACKAGING OF THE PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> I never like roses much because I always thought of them being old fashion and very granny.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> got there on time in fact a little early, very convenient and excellant pricing too :-)</li>
            <li> I have many perfumes and all are soft fragrances but lasting some times until next day</li>
            <li> I researched and narrowed my choices down to Rose the One and J&#x27;Adore and several others.  </li>
            <li> It really took me a long time to decide if the reviews I had read on here were right or not.  </li>
            <li> Found out that it is now discontinued, so I decided to buy a new scent.</li>
            <li> The packaging, and the bottle all look exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> I first smell this at a local mall as I was looking for a Bday gift.</li>
            <li> Went to a fragrance outlet to buy another bottle of my old perfume.</li>
            <li> It gave me goosebumps and raised my pulse rate and even made my scalp tingle and sweat a little - in short - a very positive reaction!!     </li>
            <li> The scent is so sophisticated and subtle that anytime I wore it, everyone took noticed.</li>
            <li> Put in the order, return small bottle, and get my money back!! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I just hope it&#x27;s not fake because of the reviews of people that they do not last that long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feminine and light enough for everyday.</li>
            <li> It cost about half the price it does in the stores and it was shipped right to my work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderfully soft and very romantic.  </li>
            <li> Definitely for someone looking for a natural scent.</li>
            <li> Not only does it last longer, I don&#x27;t like ruining my clothes when I spray it directly on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and discovered recently that my body chemistry is reacting differently to the perfumes I currently have.  </li>
            <li> My only regret is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, but I find that to be the case with many expensive fragrances for some reason.</li>
            <li> So far I have had favorable comments from my friends and had to write the name down for several waitresses.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also long lasting.</li>
            <li> I decided to search for other fragrances similar to Miss Dior Cherie that would give me the same euphoric feeling.  </li>
            <li> From Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s Madame, Fragile and Classic to Chanel&#x27;s Coco and Mademoiselle, Gucci&#x27;s Flora and Victoria Secret&#x27;s Bombshell, I do not have any Dolce &amp; Gabbana parfum at all.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I keep the empty bottle as a reminder of our 17 years of being together.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting a gift set with the body cream and other \\&quot;goodies\\&quot; included.     </li>
            <li> Same product I purchased in the past</li>
            <li> I also smelled a few other ones, but none of them compared.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy it again as no one can smell it on me a half hour after I put it on.  </li>
            <li> also cost me about $30 less than what Macy&#x27;s charges.  </li>
            <li> It is subtle, yet enough to know it is there.  </li>
            <li> it took me a little bit to realize the &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34;something</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad as it smells so pretty!  </li>
            <li> i wasted my money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap either to allow one to use copious amounts.</li>
            <li> No more surprise.</li>
            <li> lo barato sale caro :-/</li>
            <li> My wife usually buys this perfume.</li>
            <li> At least half of what department stores charge!</li>
            <li> and I feel like a delicate flower.</li>
            <li> Turns out, the negative ones are.  </li>
            <li> but i mean all day and night on my clothes and body.</li>
            <li> I was little doubtful regarding the pink box.</li>
            <li> so sad.</li>
            <li> The sad thing is that when i received this one in the mail, i wore it, and i am not kidding, the smell fades within an hour or two.</li>
            <li> This item is a fake.</li>
            <li> This bottle has every ingredient to be a fake.</li>
            <li> Reported to customer svc but was told they cold not help...</li>
            <li> sad :(</li>
            <li> it was horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Went to a fragrance outlet to buy another bottle of my old perfume. Found out that it is now discontinued, so I decided to buy a new scent. I asked for a soft, floral, light scented perfume. The sales woman handed me D&amp;G Rose The One. I fell in love with this fragrance!! I also smelled a few other ones, but none of them compared. So I bought it, not realizing I paid seventy dollars for 1.6 ounce bottle. The price was a bit hefty for my budget. Fortunately, Amazon has the 2.5 ounce bottle for almost the same price as the 1.6 ounce bottle that I bought!! Oh yeah, I&#x27;m sold. Put in the order, return small bottle, and get my money back!! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s favorite smell is different, however I have had so many people ask me what I was wearing because they loved this scent. It is a bit strong, but very pleasant. I am 22 and my aunt is in her 50&#x27;s and we wear the same perfume - Can&#x27;t say that about very many. It is good for all ages.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and discovered recently that my body chemistry is reacting differently to the perfumes I currently have.  I no longer enjoy the citrusy, strong fruity fragrances that I used to love.  I happened to be at the fragrance counter at Macy&#x27;s and tried Miss Dior Cherie and absolutely loved it.  It was so different from any fragrance that I ever wore before - flowery with a bit of fruity undertones.  I absolutely loved it. It gave me goosebumps and raised my pulse rate and even made my scalp tingle and sweat a little - in short - a very positive reaction!!     I decided to search for other fragrances similar to Miss Dior Cherie that would give me the same euphoric feeling.  I researched and narrowed my choices down to Rose the One and J&#x27;Adore and several others.  But when I smelled Rose the One I knew I found the fragrance made for me.  I absolutely adore this fragrance.  It enhances my mood and matches my body chemistry perfectly.  I love it even more than Miss Dior Cherie.  It is worth every penny and more.  I recommend getting a gift set with the body cream and other \\&quot;goodies\\&quot; included.     Any woman over 16 could wear this fragrance, day or night.  My only regret is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, but I find that to be the case with many expensive fragrances for some reason.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a must - have! I absolutely am in love with this perfume and definitely recommend this product! First of all, the scent is feminine, light but concentrated, soft, elegant, rose (but not too floral),fresh, and oh so lovely. I fell in love with this perfume when my cousin sprayed this on herself near me and the scent caught my attention. I knew I had to have it. The scent is so sophisticated and subtle that anytime I wore it, everyone took noticed. The scent last all day which is a must! I dislike how some fragrance just fade away.. What&#x27;s the point? Right? The eau de parfum is more concentrated than the eau de toilette. So be aware of this when you buy a fragrance. This perfume is perfect for everyday wear or special occasion and  females of all ages. I love how the bottle looks as well. This product arrived 2 days early than the expected delivery date which made me oh so happy. I had read other peoples reviews about how great AAA MERCHANTS services was and the fast delivery so here I am vouching that this service was spectacular!!!! I would buy from this company again!</li>
            <li> Was sent to wronge address and some one else enjoyed .  Reported to customer svc but was told they cold not help...</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this order. It was received very quickly after ordering it. The gift was a hit!!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for several years!</li>
            <li> It isnot to be the real</li>
            <li> Packing was good. I was little doubtful regarding the pink box. Happy for the price. Hope to get gift box of this perfume in future.</li>
            <li> My husband buys me a bottle of Parfum every Christmas. At first I didn&#x27;t understand why he would do that. But now, it has gotten to be a tradition. I keep the empty bottle as a reminder of our 17 years of being together. ^_^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get this bottle this Christmas (2011), I was super excited. I love designer parfums. From Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s Madame, Fragile and Classic to Chanel&#x27;s Coco and Mademoiselle, Gucci&#x27;s Flora and Victoria Secret&#x27;s Bombshell, I do not have any Dolce &amp; Gabbana parfum at all. Not even the super popular light blue. So when I got this, I was besides myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy oh boy was this a treat!!! I never like roses much because I always thought of them being old fashion and very granny. But this one smells like the rose but yet super feminine and I feel soooo pretty in it! I like to put the lotion on both of my wrist and them spray the parfum on. Not only does it last longer, I don&#x27;t like ruining my clothes when I spray it directly on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to work the other day in Rose The One and this customer asked me what I was wearing so he can get it for his girlfriend. I was so excited when I came home and told my husband that he did awesome this year. But my husband&#x27;s reaction was that if the guy can smell it on you, I think he is standing wayyyy too close! hahaha I never thought of it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite parfum so far. I feel super feminine and pretty when I wear this and I feel like a delicate flower. It smells different on everyone so I can&#x27;t tell you how it will smell on you. But I absolutely adore this combination with the spray bottle, the roller ball and the lotion. Love love love this!!! I hope you will too!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I won&#x27;t buy it again as no one can smell it on me a half hour after I put it on.  It&#x27;s too bad as it smells so pretty!  I will keep looking for a rose scented perfume that lasts.  I love Stella McCartney, Rose Absolute, but, like every product I love, I believe it is discontinued.</li>
            <li> I thought I had found a great deal compared to department store prices, but I was fooled.  It really took me a long time to decide if the reviews I had read on here were right or not.  Turns out, the negative ones are.  The packaging, and the bottle all look exactly the same.  When you spray the perfume, there is  scent sort of like the rose the one, more alcohol&#x27;y&#x27;, if that makes sense, and the scent goes away right away.  I am so disapointed and I can&#x27;t even return the product because it is deemed hazardous or flamable.  Please spend the money and get the perfume from a department store.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells very sexy! For the price it was a great buy!! I luv how it smells on me</li>
            <li> Product was as described and  advertise arrive on time or within the promise arrival time , totally satisfied  with my purchase , Price was good</li>
            <li> Being my wife&#x27;s favorite made this an easy purchase.  The scent is wonderful....it is NOT fruity or sicky sweet but rather very rich and light.  As always, got it for a great price and terrific convenience via Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> My husband tells me how great I smell every time I wear this fragrance.  It&#x27;s wonderfully soft and very romantic.  I&#x27;m very fussy about my perfume and I&#x27;m so happy with Rose the One.  It&#x27;s one thing to have a man find your fragrance pleasing,  but quite another to have a woman comment on it.  So far I have had favorable comments from my friends and had to write the name down for several waitresses.  The bottle is beautiful and so is the outer packaging.  It was a great buy as well.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! Beautiful notes of rose, grapefruit, peach and vanilla but not too overpowering.... Very light and refreshing daytime scent. This is a great buy for a great price!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so real, remind me of real roses once i had in my garden. Definitely for someone looking for a natural scent.</li>
            <li> Sent it as a gift.....got there on time in fact a little early, very convenient and excellant pricing too :-)</li>
            <li> I have many perfumes and all are soft fragrances but lasting some times until next day&lt;br /&gt;this one ship and sold by Amazon smell like alcohol after wear it 3-4 hours dont smell at all&lt;br /&gt;wasting of money , for me this is not the real</li>
            <li> Was recommended a co worker who got this for his wife to try out this perfume with my wife and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s both feminine and sexy. The over tones remind me of a richer version of fragonard perfume. It&#x27;s also long lasting. She loves it and can get by a whole day with one spray on the neck. Don&#x27;t over use it though because too much of a good thing can be overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging makes it really easy to store in any bathroom drawer. Happy with the purchase and size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this scent...it took me a little bit to realize the &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34;something I was smelling everytime I wore it was actually me!</li>
            <li> Not the real thing. smells like alcohol. it was horrible. i wasted my money. it&#x27;s basically alcohol with wwater and some scent. so sad.</li>
            <li> This smells great ..... also cost me about $30 less than what Macy&#x27;s charges.  I received the package in two days .... very fast shipping by Amazon.</li>
            <li> the rose does smell perfect but the scent will only last for a few hrs and you need to respray it constantly during the day.</li>
            <li> My mom loves it. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas and we both love the scent!  She wears it anywhere and always gets compliments.  The size and the price can&#x27;t be beat either.  At least half of what department stores charge!</li>
            <li> Great Perfume.  My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Love my perfume! It was perfect! great price for size, but it was not sealed, the box was opened upon arrival.</li>
            <li> The perfume is wonderful but.... this was a present and the box was a total giveaway. Said perfume all over it. My girlfriend knew exactly was. No more surprise.</li>
            <li> Wow!! Great producted got it for my wife OMG cant stay off of her Lol.. thanks you so much .</li>
            <li> One of my signature fragrances.  Haven&#x27;t found many who where it, and love the compliments I get from others when I walk in a room.  Very light, fragrant and feminine.</li>
            <li> Same product I purchased in the past</li>
            <li> PURCHASED AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT, THE RECIPIENT APPRECIATED THE SIZE AND PACKAGING OF THE PRODUCT.  iT WAS HER FIRST TIME USING A D&amp;G PRODUCT..</li>
            <li> Compre este perfume de regalo para mi Esposa y le gusto mucho, tanto el perfume como el diseño. Lo Recomiendo</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, really like it. Wish bottle was bigger, but very happy with purchase. A little pricey but nice.</li>
            <li> Perfium evaporates very fast, contains lots of alcohol, I don&#x27;t think it is the real Dolce &amp; Gabbana, to be hones I am dissapointed</li>
            <li> My favorite! Super excited I can get this cheaper here. It&#x27;s amazing. Smells different on every one, but I love it on me c;</li>
            <li> First, I didn&#x27;t buy this perfume here yet. I first smell this at a local mall as I was looking for a Bday gift. This version is better than the first one. I&#x27;ll probably purchase one here coz it&#x27;s cheaper. I just hope it&#x27;s not fake because of the reviews of people that they do not last that long. Because all colognes/perfumes that are new and ORIGINAL are suppose to stay longer on you no matter what the brand is.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfrum. I had to stock up when they quit selling them in stores. It&#x27;s feminine and light enough for everyday.</li>
            <li> Great scent and great buy.</li>
            <li> well i bought this perfume on Amazon because i had liked it at Sephora, with the exeption that at Sephora this perfume was 100.00 dlls, when i sprayed the perfume there, at the store it lasted all but i mean all day and night on my clothes and body. The sad thing is that when i received this one in the mail, i wore it, and i am not kidding, the smell fades within an hour or two. Whatta shame, i was so upset,. note that it does smell good but for who knows why or for what reason but it does not last on me for more than two hours.. sad :( you get for what you pay for..  lo barato sale caro :-/</li>
            <li> This item is a fake. My wife usually buys this perfume. Thus smelled like alcohol and lasted about 5 minutes. The lid was plastic. On the authentic perfume it&#x27;s a metal lid. The box came damaged, letters were smeared on the bottle. This bottle has every ingredient to be a fake. I have tried contacting this seller for over a week now and no response. Experiences like this make you wonder if you should buy things from people off amazon</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Real thing unopened, and a great price too!! Would definitely order again. Thanks for the great purchase.</li>
            <li> I am sorry but it was not the same scent of fragrance that I enjoyed in the Department store. I guess that is what I get for trying to save some money on my girlfriends fragrance. lol!</li>
            <li> I bought this because someone else had one, and I fell in love with the scent.  I never would have imagined it was a perfume.  Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I did not like this scent at all.  It was delivered timely but it was a strong &amp;#34;old woman&amp;#34; type of smell and I don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> your shipment got here time... And everything was fine ........... Thank You</li>
            <li> Fresh, light, clean. Good switch from heavy, intense fragrances that go along with winter scarves, hats, boots, leggings, wooly sweaters.</li>
            <li> While the aroma of the perfume is good, it seems to dissipate very quickly, how much can one use at one time without smelling like cheap pot-pourrie?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap either to allow one to use copious amounts.</li>
            <li> I tried a bunch of perfumes in an airport duty-free shop and found this one to be my favorite scent.  It&#x27;s floral without being overbearing or &amp;#34;old lady-ish&amp;#34;.  Of course, I didn&#x27;t get it there since I knew where the best price could be found...  I will definitely buy again once I go through this bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife for Christmas because she loves it. It cost about half the price it does in the stores and it was shipped right to my work. You can&#x27;t beat that anywhere else!</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells just like a fresh rose. I love it.  Amazon did a great job correcting a shipping error.  I highly recommend both.</li>
            <li> I had a great experience.All my expectations were filled.The purchase arrive timely at the agreed time.The product arrived in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my first online cologne purchase, and I am thrilled with this scent.  It is subtle, yet enough to know it is there.  I&#x27;ve looked for a rose cologne for a long time, it makes me think of my grandmother.</li>
