            <li>Wonderful!</li>
            <li>great color - perfect coverage - very happy.</li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>This concealer is great because it has ingredients to help reduce swelling.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27; a good concealer.</li>
            <li>Looks good on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what it&#x27;s done with the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Nice neutral color.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>liked how creamy it is and doesn&#x27;t crease.  </li>
            <li>But, at first application, it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, not dry, just perfect</li>
            <li>For the price of this tiny tube the cream should be flawless.</li>
            <li>And I have tried so many.</li>
            <li>This is a great product of you want i accentuate your wrinkles and look older.</li>
            <li>I have paid $100s trying to find a good under eye concealer and wish I had found this first.</li>
            <li>this is really good as it covers up dark eye circle very nicely.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and blends well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so easy for me to sweat it off.</li>
            <li>I have medium warm skin tone and the light is still the right color to use.  </li>
            <li>It is an amazing product that works great for dark circles and puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I can not get a smooth coverage form this product.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if this is the best concealer for me..</li>
            <li>1st  Tube - good color and coverage, but watery - had to keep massaging the tube to keep it mixed.</li>
            <li>The other reviews on this product were relatively good.</li>
            <li>Have tried many different techniques.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, but I don&#x27;t know how effective it would be if one had really dark circles under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>just wasn&#x27;t as nice as I expected.i thought it shoulb be a little creamier.i</li>
            <li>My dark circles and puffiness were not hidden well with other products and this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li>It is very runny and you do not get much in the tube.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;tsee much of a changearound my eyes.</li>
            <li>However it really does seem to be tightening the wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>really cover much but just adds a sheen to my bluish circles.</li>
            <li>Good product but its a bit watery for a concealer so doesn&#x27;t stay with enough thickness to really conceal my dark rings, need to use a lot.</li>
            <li>This product is not for older skin.</li>
            <li>The tubes I received must have been old or stored incorrectly because the color separated from the oil or water and ever time went to use clear liquid came out first then the color.</li>
            <li>For the price I didn&#x27;t feel like it worked any better than plain coverup</li>
            <li>This is very sheer but can be layered after the first layer dries.  </li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s because of ingredients, but the consistency vs other concealers isn&#x27;t so good.</li>
            <li>If put on too thick, it does tend to stick in wrinkles and creases, but if you dab it on very gently (you don&#x27;t need much), it covers bluish/dark/greenish circles and shadows pretty well.</li>
            <li>and I can clearly see a difference in the disappearance of undereye darkness.</li>
            <li>On my 58 year old skin, it clumped and smeared.</li>
            <li>Covers and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>Now what - I cannot afford $60 a tube and take my chances on getting an old or off color product?????????</li>
            <li>my friends are amazed how I have no wrinkles, and very few fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Not pink!  </li>
            <li>Did not conceal my dark circles at all, no matter how much I applied.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This product works great. I have been using it for a couple of months and I can clearly see a difference in the disappearance of undereye darkness.</li>
            <li> It is very runny and you do not get much in the tube. Too pricey for the cost.</li>
            <li> Good product but its a bit watery for a concealer so doesn&#x27;t stay with enough thickness to really conceal my dark rings, need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a great product of you want i accentuate your wrinkles and look older.</li>
            <li> Did not conceal my dark circles at all, no matter how much I applied.  And when I applied my finishing powder to my face as I usually do after my liquid foundation, it left my under eyes looking very wrinkled.  Also did not like the opalescent quality.</li>
            <li> I hope it is helping , I will give it time.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream since my Dermatologist recommended it.  I am now over 60 and have used it the last 20 years -- my friends are amazed how I have no wrinkles, and very few fine lines.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it helps with wrinkles but it&#x27; a good concealer. Nice neutral color. Not pink!  Easy to apply and blends well. Looks good on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing it on a skin care segment of a television show.  I have a little bit of dark circles under my eyes so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I liked how creamy it is and doesn&#x27;t crease.  And although the circles are not totally gone, the difference is noticeable.  I would recommend this product, but I don&#x27;t know how effective it would be if one had really dark circles under the eyes.  I have medium warm skin tone and the light is still the right color to use.  I found the medium to be too dark and didn&#x27;t like the look.</li>
            <li> For the price I didn&#x27;t feel like it worked any better than plain coverup cream.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> bought this as i&#x27;ve already tried the sample. this is really good as it covers up dark eye circle very nicely.</li>
            <li> For the price of this tiny tube the cream should be flawless. On my 58 year old skin, it clumped and smeared. I am very disappointed. The other reviews on this product were relatively good. This product is not for older skin.</li>
            <li> This concealer is great because it has ingredients to help reduce swelling.  I use it on breakouts as well and they seem to not only be covered but disappear faster.</li>
            <li> The tubes I received must have been old or stored incorrectly because the color separated from the oil or water and ever time went to use clear liquid came out first then the color.</li>
            <li> just wasn&#x27;t as nice as I expected.i thought it shoulb be a little creamier.i don&#x27;tsee much of a changearound my eyes.</li>
            <li> Best under-eye concealer that I have tried. And I have tried so many. My runner-up is the Perricone No Concealer Concealer, but after reading or seeing a review of the Teamine, I tried it. And I like it the very, very best. If put on too thick, it does tend to stick in wrinkles and creases, but if you dab it on very gently (you don&#x27;t need much), it covers bluish/dark/greenish circles and shadows pretty well. I also try the iced-metal-spoon trick to help with under-eye bags. Seems only cold takes care of those.</li>
            <li> My dark circles and puffiness were not hidden well with other products and this one seems to work the best. Would buy again without hesitation. I have paid $100s trying to find a good under eye concealer and wish I had found this first. Not greasy, not dry, just perfect</li>
            <li> Covers and looks natural.  Also received samples of another product that I am going to order.  I will order this concealer again.</li>
            <li> It has a flaky finish.  I can not get a smooth coverage form this product.  Have tried many different techniques.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but lasts a long time. I put it on under my eyes with a brush. I&#x27;ve used it for a year and my wrinkles aren&#x27;t worse. So, I say it works.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the best concealer for me..</li>
            <li> Wonderful! It is an amazing product that works great for dark circles and puffiness.  Would recommend for anyone at any age</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s because of ingredients, but the consistency vs other concealers isn&#x27;t so good. But, at first application, it&#x27;s very good. As time goes on, it doesn&#x27;t wear well.</li>
            <li> Have bought 4 tubes of Teamine Concealer. 1st from DR. at $60. Next 3 from Amazon at $40. 1st  Tube - good color and coverage, but watery - had to keep massaging the tube to keep it mixed. 2nd &amp; 3rd Tubes - great color - perfect coverage - very happy. 4th Tube - color is greener???? on consistency is thinner. Contacted Teamine customer service - their reply was terse, told me I should only buy this item through my doctors office.  Contacted them again, about the color and consistency, a short reply stated they had not changed the formula.  Now what - I cannot afford $60 a tube and take my chances on getting an old or off color product?????????</li>
            <li> This is very sheer but can be layered after the first layer dries.  However it really does seem to be tightening the wrinkles under my eyes. Even when I have it off.&lt;br /&gt;It would be 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so easy for me to sweat it off. But I would still buy it again and would also recommend it. It&#x27;s amazing what it&#x27;s done with the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Itmcomes out oily and separated unless you massage the tube vigorously. It does&lt;br /&gt;Not really cover much but just adds a sheen to my bluish circles. It stinks too, like ear wax.</li>
