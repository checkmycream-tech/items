            <li>Great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update December 2012: at my 6-month teeth cleaning the hygienist commented on how great my teeth looked.</li>
            <li>Great on the go when you don&#x27;t want to floss.</li>
            <li>For me, this works great.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love Stimudents!!</li>
            <li>These are better than any toothpick AND any gum massager, all in one perfect</li>
            <li>My dentist tells me they are very good for my gums and I find it a lot more convenient than flossing and essentially as good for teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>My dentist says anything that massages the gums is a good thing</li>
            <li>And btw, they work really good on your teeth.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Thin\\&quot; version is great because you get more picks per pack</li>
            <li>My gums are very healthy.</li>
            <li>Great way to keep your teeth free of plaque!</li>
            <li>Love these slim tooth picks!</li>
            <li>Great for fine tuning teeth cleaning; flexible, and, if soaked in water before use, is strong.</li>
            <li>Depending on your particular situation you may go through 2 or more per day but the results are very good.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Hey good useful product.</li>
            <li>At my checkup the hygienist said my teeth and gums looked better than ever.    </li>
            <li>Glad we were able to find them here.</li>
            <li>I love these toothpicks.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>They are very easy on your gums, very easy to carry around, and the &#x27;V&#x27; shape makes them very effective in cleaning between teeth, especially when you have gum recession like I do.</li>
            <li>I find these thinner ones are a better fit for my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and they fit between crowned or filled teeth better.</li>
            <li>The product does the job and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not quite as strong as the thicker ones, but I&#x27;ve not found that to be a problem.  </li>
            <li>I strongly prefer them over the original thicker ones.</li>
            <li>VERy useful wedges,thin,gets in thight spaces.</li>
            <li>Convenient to carry it with me to use for keeping teeth clean after eating.</li>
            <li>but I find these to be much easier to use, and I also think they do a more thorough job.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I can still order them here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love that Amazon offers them!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for having them available online.</li>
            <li>wife also likes them very much.</li>
            <li>Although the thin ones are more fragile they do a great job of cleaning between your teeth.</li>
            <li>Ehhhh, its pretty much a overpriced toothpick.</li>
            <li>These are however compact but you burn through them so fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you for selling this much needed product.</li>
            <li>I keep several packs in my purse at all times and use them after meals to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>This is so much easier than flossing, and apparently at least as effective.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these over floss any day.</li>
            <li>cant live without them</li>
            <li>Unlike standard Stim-U-Dent these truly are &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; as advertised and more difficult to use, break easily so more need to be used.</li>
            <li>I used the heavy duty extension cord for a portable heater and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>old Amazon came thru again.</li>
            <li>Love these things and so hard to find locally</li>
            <li>I use both sizes of Stim-U-Dents because space between teeth varies somewhat, and these give me an additional tool to clean those very tight spaces.</li>
            <li>the originals were much more sturdy--and even the non thin ones are not the same as old brand.</li>
            <li>They are OK; they do the work; However way too thin (Obviously they are NOT Stim-u-dent the originals by J&amp;J)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Hey good useful product. I&#x27;ve heard they&#x27;re not making them anymore. I wish they were.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t hold up as well as some others i&#x27;ve used, but there are plenty and they seem to work.</li>
            <li> Unlike standard Stim-U-Dent these truly are &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; as advertised and more difficult to use, break easily so more need to be used.</li>
            <li> I carry these with me everywhere and my consider them my low calorie dessert.  My dentist tells me they are very good for my gums and I find it a lot more convenient than flossing and essentially as good for teeth and gums.  I went 6 months without flossing but using these everyday.  At my checkup the hygienist said my teeth and gums looked better than ever.    The \\&quot;Thin\\&quot; version is great because you get more picks per pack and they fit between crowned or filled teeth better.</li>
            <li> Items are hard to find in the dental isle of pharmacies or grocery stores. I like the wooden stemudents.</li>
            <li> Since I started using these, as recommended by my hygienist, I have had no cavities. I highly recommend these over floss any day.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my dentist some years ago.  LOVE IT!!!!  The &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; version works well for me.  I use it religiously after eating.  Have had NO problems, no cavities, etc in 10 years.  I keep  some in my car, my desk and at home.</li>
            <li> Love these things and so hard to find locally</li>
            <li> It was the product we expected.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Just what we ordered. Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that does the trick.</li>
            <li> Although the thin ones are more fragile they do a great job of cleaning between your teeth. Depending on your particular situation you may go through 2 or more per day but the results are very good. Do be careful to not break it off between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;After learning how to use them I strongly prefer them over the original thicker ones.</li>
            <li> I use both sizes of Stim-U-Dents because space between teeth varies somewhat, and these give me an additional tool to clean those very tight spaces.</li>
            <li> The regular stimudents were too thick for my gums so I was very happy when they came out with these. I use them after every meal and my dentist thinks I floss. My gums are very healthy. They aren&#x27;t as sturdy as the regular ones so I go through them faster but you get 40 picks instead of 25 in each pack so it evens out.</li>
            <li> Ehhhh, its pretty much a overpriced toothpick. I dont understand how this serves as a plaque remover. Just buy those plastic toothpicks. These are however compact but you burn through them so fast. once it gets moist, there useless.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected  it is just another stick toothpick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find these in our area.  Walmart stopped carrying them because they said they couldn&#x27;t make a profit on them.  Thank you for selling this much needed product.</li>
            <li> tried these before but when I tried to rep[ace them no one was carrying them.&lt;br /&gt;good old Amazon came thru again.</li>
            <li> They are OK; they do the work; However way too thin (Obviously they are NOT Stim-u-dent the originals by J&amp;J)</li>
            <li> My husband loves these. They were recommended by our dentist &amp; then became impossible to find. Glad we were able to find them here.</li>
            <li> As advertised great delivery</li>
            <li> Great way to keep your teeth free of plaque!</li>
            <li> remember what I said, the THIN ones are the ones the work, the regular ones do not for the purpose intended</li>
            <li> These thinner stimudents work well for those tight spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li> This product was difficult to find in the drugstores in my immediate area. The product does the job and is easy to use.</li>

            <li> Love these slim tooth picks! My dentist says anything that massages the gums is a good thing and these are wonderful. I keep several packs in my purse at all times and use them after meals to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> Always use these  - they are great</li>
            <li> I have problems with food getting stuck between my teeth.  Of course flossing can deal with that, but I find these to be much easier to use, and I also think they do a more thorough job.  I even carry a pack in my wallet, and try to use them after every meal.  I find these thinner ones are a better fit for my teeth.  They&#x27;re not quite as strong as the thicker ones, but I&#x27;ve not found that to be a problem.  Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update December 2012: at my 6-month teeth cleaning the hygienist commented on how great my teeth looked. I had not used floss at all since my last cleaning, but used this product regularly. This is so much easier than flossing, and apparently at least as effective.</li>
            <li> Best toothpicks ever!  The &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; style work best for us and we can&#x27;t find them in stores anywhere.  Grateful for amazon.com.</li>
            <li> VERy useful wedges,thin,gets in thight spaces. rating should reflect 5 stars positiv&lt;br /&gt;My wife also likes them very much. OK</li>
            <li> I recieved what I ordered. No complaints</li>
            <li> great product! best stimudents in years.</li>
            <li> Product is as expected. I used the heavy duty extension cord for a portable heater and it worked fine. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love Stimudents!! They get in between the teeth and don&#x27;t hurt. Great on the go when you don&#x27;t want to floss. We love that Amazon offers them!</li>
            <li> Convenient to carry it with me to use for keeping teeth clean after eating.</li>
            <li> way too thin--break every time.  the originals were much more sturdy--and even the non thin ones are not the same as old brand.</li>
            <li> cant live without them</li>
            <li> Great for fine tuning teeth cleaning; flexible, and, if soaked in water before use, is strong.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find these in stores anymore and I wonder why? Luckily I can still order them here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to stock up. These are better than any toothpick AND any gum massager, all in one perfect sliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grab these and stock up!</li>
            <li> These Stim-U-Dent toothpicks are the thin variety.  Very hard to get in retail stores.  Thanks Amazon for having them available online. And btw, they work really good on your teeth.</li>
            <li> A pleasure to deal with.</li>
            <li> These are the best!! The originals are too, too thick.</li>
            <li> I like to use stim-u-dents for flossing because my teeth are tight together and, frequently brake the floss, leaving pieces of string stuck in the teeth. For me, this works great.</li>
