            <li>Whenever I use this to apply my powder (either loose or pressed) over my foundation, I always get compliments on how perfect my skin looks (even though it&#x27;s far from perfect!).</li>
            <li>ok puff.</li>
            <li>(hopefully they&#x27;re still available five years from now)!</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I love these for my pressed powder foundation.</li>
            <li>I wish companies that sell products like this would use a coin for comparison, or say, &amp;#34;nice for a compact.&amp;#34; Then you would have a better idea about the size.</li>
            <li>In sure the puffs are fine.</li>
            <li>These are good quality and are holding up very well</li>
            <li>Thicker than I had hoped, doesnt fit in my compact</li>
            <li>It works but I was expecting it to be fluffier for a light application of powder not &amp;#34;patted&amp;#34; on coverage.</li>
            <li>They fit in my powder box and is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>(I use L&#x27;Oreal True Match.</li>
            <li>This has been true of a variety of powder compacts I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li>As Advertised &amp; Shipped Quickly</li>
            <li>I love how soft they feel on my face too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s probably my own fault, but I thought these were larger powder puffs.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The puffs are plush on both sides, and I believe they are most likely stitched together unlike the onside puffs that have a stuffing and backing glued on.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them.</li>
            <li>They are sooooo soft and so much easier to apply compact powder lightly to your face areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have only used these a few times so far but the quality seems to be excellent.</li>
            <li>puffs are fantastic for several reasons: they&#x27;re obviously of much higher quality than the puff that&#x27;s included with a powder compact.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy to find double-sided puffs, and these are high quality for a good price.</li>
            <li>Even if that happens, the puffs are reversible, so you should be able to use a single puff for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description very well as I was expecting a 5&amp;#34</li>
            <li>These are too big to fit in the compact.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding that my powder actually stays on significantly longer when I use them.</li>
            <li>These are velour, not cotton velour, which is far better for applying loose face powder.</li>
            <li>These are so fluffy and soft, applies powdered makeup nice and even.</li>
            <li>Gives me nice coverage and they are thick.</li>
            <li>I also love that they&#x27;re double-sided - will last twice as long!  </li>
            <li>This item arrived on time as stated and are very soft and durable.</li>
            <li>As such, the Total Beauty Double Velour Powder Puff doesn&#x27;t really fit into my compact, but I like it so much that I just leave the compact partway</li>
            <li>I typically use my MAC cleanse off oil to get it really clean and then follow with hand soap.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find these locally at an affordable price unless I go to the mall makeup store where I have to park and walk a mile - and pay 3x as much.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also no sign of caking with this puff, so you can likely use the puff much longer than the one that comes with the compact.</li>
            <li>they are more for face powder than body powder, although they wouldn&#x27;t work in a compact as they are too thick.  </li>
            <li>In the interest of keeping my skin clear, as well as using the third of the powder I never get to, I decided to try these puffs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also well worth a few dollars a piece; if your powder is $10 and you tend to throw it out before the powder is gone because the puff becomes unusable, these puffs solve that problem.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be coming back to these when I need new ones</li>

            <li> ; wide product and this is half that size.</li>
            <li> Was sick of the cheap powder puffs you get with compacts.  </li>
            <li> Very small and low quality</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had them for a few months now).  </li>
            <li> They become unusable (unless you want to break out from the caked-on powder that accumulates after a few weeks of use), often before the powder is gone.</li>
            <li> fabric is not that soft....a little stiff.</li>
            <li> I suspect I&#x27;m not the only woman who gets frustrated with the powder puffs included in your standard compact.</li>
            <li> they are exactly as small as they say they are.  </li>
            <li> Hope this will others to know they are small.</li>
            <li> Very Small.</li>
            <li> Overpriced, these are very small.</li>
            <li> Considering they were over $5 for just two, I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>

            <li> These powder puffs are perfect. It&#x27;s not easy to find double-sided puffs, and these are high quality for a good price.</li>
            <li> Very small and low quality</li>
            <li> Very Small. Not soft. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these for quite a while..the ones in the drug store are flimsy.</li>
            <li> ok puff. fabric is not that soft....a little stiff.</li>
            <li> they are make up sponges! Powder puffs are big and puffy and used for body powder- the description of this product should change to describe it better!</li>
            <li> I like these puffs for my pressed powder, feels nice on my face and seem to hold up quite well.</li>
            <li> These are velour, not cotton velour, which is far better for applying loose face powder. And there is no strap across them for you to put your fingers under to apply the powder. Considering they were over $5 for just two, I&#x27;m disappointed. I&#x27;ll be exchanging these for cotton velour powder puffs, and ones with a strap.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description very well as I was expecting a 5&amp;#34; wide product and this is half that size.</li>
            <li> These are the best powder puffs.  I&#x27;m so impressed with quality,price &amp; delivery that I&#x27;m ordering again!</li>
            <li> I can not find these in stores anywhere. This size. They fit in my powder box and is nice and soft. If your a user of powder puffs in powder boxes I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Overpriced, these are very small. I should have read description about 1.25 inches of flat surface. I just threw them out.</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time as stated and are very soft and durable. They are quality make-up powder puffs that performed as expected.</li>
            <li> Love these!  Was sick of the cheap powder puffs you get with compacts.  These are good quality and are holding up very well (I&#x27;ve had them for a few months now).  I also love that they&#x27;re double-sided - will last twice as long!  Will definitely be coming back to these when I need new ones (hopefully they&#x27;re still available five years from now)! ;)</li>
            <li> In sure the puffs are fine. I thought I was ordering body powder puffs so they are not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> These powder puffs are sufficient. Not as puffy as I imagined/hoped they would be. Just keep in mind these are flat.</li>
            <li> When I made this purchase I was looking for replacement puffs for my powder compact. These are too big to fit in the compact. They are constructed well, but weren&#x27;t what I needed.</li>
            <li> They were smaller than I thought and I don&#x27;t have any use for them.</li>
            <li> I thought they were beauty powder puffs, but instead, they were make-up puffs.  They&#x27;re very nice but not what I thought they were.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and affordable and just what I needed.  Can&#x27;t find these locally at an affordable price unless I go to the mall makeup store where I have to park and walk a mile - and pay 3x as much. Love these.</li>
            <li> Thicker than I had hoped, doesnt fit in my compact</li>
            <li> Some puffs fall apart. I have only used these a few times so far but the quality seems to be excellent. The puffs are plush on both sides, and I believe they are most likely stitched together unlike the onside puffs that have a stuffing and backing glued on.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> I love these for my pressed powder foundation. Gives me nice coverage and they are thick. I love how soft they feel on my face too.</li>

This has been true of a variety of powder compacts I&#x27;ve tried). These puffs are quite a bit bigger than the one that&#x27;s included with my powder. As such, the Total Beauty Double Velour Powder Puff doesn&#x27;t really fit into my compact, but I like it so much that I just leave the compact partway open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about these puffs is that they provide a way to smoothly apply and blend your powder.

            <li> Will never use any other puff again. These are so fluffy and soft, applies powdered makeup nice and even. I recommed these puffs nice value!</li>
            <li> They are sooooo soft and so much easier to apply compact powder lightly to your face areas.&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can wash them, also.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Gives the most flawless finish to your makeup! Whenever I use this to apply my powder (either loose or pressed) over my foundation, I always get compliments on how perfect my skin looks (even though it&#x27;s far from perfect!).

            <li> they are exactly as small as they say they are.  don&#x27;t know how I missed that.  they are more for face powder than body powder, although they wouldn&#x27;t work in a compact as they are too thick.  and I even bought 2 packs thinking I&#x27;d found what I was after.  oh well, back to the search process again.</li>
            <li> Nice quality puff. Same size as the previous one I replaced</li>
            <li> smaller than I wanted.</li>
            <li> It works but I was expecting it to be fluffier for a light application of powder not &amp;#34;patted&amp;#34; on coverage.</li>
            <li> I should read more detail to know size, just for your face! Hope this will others to know they are small.</li>
