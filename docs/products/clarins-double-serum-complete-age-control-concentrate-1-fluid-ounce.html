            <li>Great for older thinning skin.</li>
            <li>Love it and it does keep fine lines at bay.</li>
            <li>and at 1 oz, goes very quickly if you use it morning and night.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 4 weeks, and although it goes on easily and leaves no sticky&lt;br /&gt;residue</li>
            <li>I like the product just fine.</li>
            <li>It does not get rid of fine lines nor wrinkles, nor brown spots, however.</li>
            <li>quick delivery!</li>
            <li>great, although have only used 3 days.</li>
            <li>I have to say that this stuff is fantastic.</li>

            <li>skin has remained flake free with out a humidifier!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>If its too cheap to sound true</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>however would buy it at the higher price as it does all it claims and more.</li>
            <li>It goes on tacky, but absorbs quickly and leaves a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>It is very oily, and it just seems to sit on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>there are a lot of products out there that make bold claims.  </li>
            <li>After doing more research I found it had a plant based irritant in it and had to stop using it and sure enough the rash went away.</li>
            <li>Great an the price was much less than in stores.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will do!  </li>
            <li>She wants it - she gets it!!</li>
            <li>Clarins has reformulated its Double Serum and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite serum.  </li>
            <li>It looks similar but the formula is not as effective.</li>
            <li>(I still have a lot of product left and will finish it; if my skins starts to improve appreciably, I will gladly update my review.)</li>
            <li>Of course, everybody&#x27;s skin reacts differently to treatment, so others may get more out of this product than I did.</li>
            <li>This product works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>THis is the first time i am using this product.</li>
            <li>Amazon should be aware of this.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product since it really did not do anything for me except throw my money away!</li>
            <li>I have used serums for years and this is the first one I have recommended.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT, BUT IT ONLY LASTED ME 1 MONTH.</li>
            <li>Have noticed distinct fading of brown sun damage refined pores and overall fine textured skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it long enough yet to say I absolutely love it and would buy more.</li>
            <li>Gently patting it on your face, neck and upper chest does make it feel more luxurious.</li>
            <li>, I have yet to see any positive results to my skin texture or pores.</li>
            <li>This seems to work good,  still have wrinkles,  haven&#x27;t used it long enough for anything to happen there.  </li>
            <li>The sales clerk showed me how the product can become even more absorbent simply by adding a small amount of your own moisturizer to the face.  </li>
            <li>Really can see improvement in my skin</li>
            <li>Really like this product .., have ordered this 3 times already and once purchased in the store.</li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with the day cream works very well.</li>
            <li>This product really cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li>but you dont need much to cover your face and neck.</li>
            <li>Really like and recommend it.</li>
            <li>I really like the stuff and think it improves my skin</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s 63 and its helping her from getting too much wrinkles</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very supple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 months and really see improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really think it will control that much,</li>
            <li>I went to a department store to check this whole line of product out before I purchased any online.  </li>
            <li>She then applied the product by placing her hands to gently press in the serum instead of rubbing.  </li>
            <li>it probably isn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li>Pricey but nice, using it 2 times daily and seeing results especially around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li>They seem to do more for me than other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it supposed to do:  restores your skin to its natural glow without making it oily or drying it out.  </li>
            <li>Cant live with out it!</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of the double serum and my skin is softer, more even and hopefully will be less wrinkled :)</li>
            <li>It gives decent results.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can breakout from using certain products.  </li>
            <li>My skin is a compbination type, and this serum make it look normal.</li>
            <li>Also, the clerk put only one pump&#x27;s worth of product in  her palm and then rubbed her hands together.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, your pores stay open and it doesn&#x27;t look very good.</li>
            <li>Clarins has a long history and a huge following for a reason.  </li>
            <li>but so expensive I was having second thoughts until I found this great deal.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone having adult acne problem.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this product calms and hydrates.</li>
            <li>I was still having issues with adult acne when I heard about this serum.</li>
            <li>Go the natural route,  please.</li>
            <li>I recently started using the whole line of Clarins face products.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be the same exact Clarins Double Serum that I usually pay a lot more for.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this stuff works for me.</li>
            <li>I only have been using this serum for a few days, but already fell in love with the way it feels on my face after mixing two serums in one.</li>
            <li>It is also ideal if you live in cold dry climate as it helps decrease any redness.</li>
            <li>For my money there are several other serums on Amazon, such as the OZ product I mentioned above, that perform better for my particular needs.</li>
            <li>The stuff shoots out of the bottle really fast and your whole hand will be more likely to catch it all as opposed to the mega expensive stuff ending up on the floor or mirror.</li>
            <li>I am in my 30s and started using this serum daily my skin looks even, firm and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product looks different and smells different than the real one</li>
            <li>The last one I bought have different consistency, the perfume was too strong, and make my skin irritated and dried.</li>
            <li>a small amount goes a long way &amp; be sure to mix the serum with your hands prior to putting it on.</li>
            <li>I can barely see them at all.  </li>
            <li>Clarins once again proved the reason behind its iconic cult status.</li>

            <li> This serum is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> skin has remained flake free with out a humidifier!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> If its too cheap to sound true</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> however would buy it at the higher price as it does all it claims and more.</li>
            <li> It goes on tacky, but absorbs quickly and leaves a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> It is very oily, and it just seems to sit on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> there are a lot of products out there that make bold claims.  </li>
            <li> After doing more research I found it had a plant based irritant in it and had to stop using it and sure enough the rash went away.</li>
            <li> Great an the price was much less than in stores.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do!  </li>
            <li> She wants it - she gets it!!</li>
            <li> Clarins has reformulated its Double Serum and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite serum.  </li>
            <li> It looks similar but the formula is not as effective.</li>
            <li> (I still have a lot of product left and will finish it; if my skins starts to improve appreciably, I will gladly update my review.)</li>
            <li> Of course, everybody&#x27;s skin reacts differently to treatment, so others may get more out of this product than I did.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> THis is the first time i am using this product.</li>
            <li> Amazon should be aware of this.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product since it really did not do anything for me except throw my money away!</li>
            <li> I have used serums for years and this is the first one I have recommended.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT, BUT IT ONLY LASTED ME 1 MONTH.</li>
            <li> Have noticed distinct fading of brown sun damage refined pores and overall fine textured skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it long enough yet to say I absolutely love it and would buy more.</li>
            <li> Gently patting it on your face, neck and upper chest does make it feel more luxurious.</li>
            <li> , I have yet to see any positive results to my skin texture or pores.</li>
            <li> This seems to work good,  still have wrinkles,  haven&#x27;t used it long enough for anything to happen there.  </li>
            <li> The sales clerk showed me how the product can become even more absorbent simply by adding a small amount of your own moisturizer to the face.  </li>
            <li> Really can see improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> Really like this product .., have ordered this 3 times already and once purchased in the store.</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with the day cream works very well.</li>
            <li> This product really cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li> but you dont need much to cover your face and neck.</li>
            <li> Really like and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like the stuff and think it improves my skin</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s 63 and its helping her from getting too much wrinkles</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very supple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 months and really see improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really think it will control that much,</li>
            <li> I went to a department store to check this whole line of product out before I purchased any online.  </li>
            <li> She then applied the product by placing her hands to gently press in the serum instead of rubbing.  </li>
            <li> it probably isn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li> Pricey but nice, using it 2 times daily and seeing results especially around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li> They seem to do more for me than other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it supposed to do:  restores your skin to its natural glow without making it oily or drying it out.  </li>
            <li> Cant live with out it!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of the double serum and my skin is softer, more even and hopefully will be less wrinkled :)</li>
            <li> It gives decent results.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can breakout from using certain products.  </li>
            <li> My skin is a compbination type, and this serum make it look normal.</li>
            <li> Also, the clerk put only one pump&#x27;s worth of product in  her palm and then rubbed her hands together.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, your pores stay open and it doesn&#x27;t look very good.</li>
            <li> Clarins has a long history and a huge following for a reason.  </li>
            <li> but so expensive I was having second thoughts until I found this great deal.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone having adult acne problem.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this product calms and hydrates.</li>
            <li> I was still having issues with adult acne when I heard about this serum.</li>
            <li> Go the natural route,  please.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the whole line of Clarins face products.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be the same exact Clarins Double Serum that I usually pay a lot more for.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this stuff works for me.</li>
            <li> I only have been using this serum for a few days, but already fell in love with the way it feels on my face after mixing two serums in one.</li>
            <li> It is also ideal if you live in cold dry climate as it helps decrease any redness.</li>
            <li> For my money there are several other serums on Amazon, such as the OZ product I mentioned above, that perform better for my particular needs.</li>
            <li> The stuff shoots out of the bottle really fast and your whole hand will be more likely to catch it all as opposed to the mega expensive stuff ending up on the floor or mirror.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30s and started using this serum daily my skin looks even, firm and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product looks different and smells different than the real one</li>
            <li> The last one I bought have different consistency, the perfume was too strong, and make my skin irritated and dried.</li>
            <li> a small amount goes a long way &amp; be sure to mix the serum with your hands prior to putting it on.</li>
            <li> I can barely see them at all.  </li>
            <li> Clarins once again proved the reason behind its iconic cult status.</li>
            <li> This product opens your poor to allow your other products to absorb better.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid I would feel it even more oily</li>
            <li> I hope to get long term visible results by using it for a month.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way, gives a healthy,youthful suppleness to the skin...</li>
            <li> My skin gets unbelievably dry and flaky during the winter /heating</li>
            <li> One last thing, be careful with the price shown on Amazon,  and read the amount carefully.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, and those dark spots that return in the same spot time and time again, are fading away.  </li>
            <li> I think its fake, the box wasnt sealed, the serum is oily and the box is full of typos</li>
            <li> The bottle even looks and feel a little different.</li>
            <li> I never really got into the Clarins line of skincare, but after my OZ Naturals Vitamin C serum ran out, I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I used to use Arbonne skin products and spent over $200 on their age-ing skin line…Now I just buy this.</li>
            <li> It makes sense to me, if you continually rub product in with your fingers you may be too rough.  </li>
            <li> I had &amp;#34;damaged dry skin&amp;#34; around my eyes due to extreme dryness</li>
            <li> Aa little pricey, but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> All as expected!</li>
            <li> I was not aware of at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy from a third party seller cos Amazon policy is not competent to prevent fakes</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum due to all the hype and also because i trust clarins.</li>
            <li> had in a few months</li>
            <li> Although just using it for a few days I already see some results.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and skin feels smoother just after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> aleady notice less wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I use it only at night though before my night cream.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little expensive</li>
            <li> For the past couple of years, I&#x27;ve been all about serums since they started to become a &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; in the skincare space.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but a few drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Be Careful of fake product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, but not surprised.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it smells like granny&#x27;s perfume.  </li>
            <li> It might be a fake product.</li>
            <li> Because this Clarins is&lt;br /&gt;an expensive investment, I don&#x27;t know if I would re-purchase.</li>
            <li> This is actually a fake.</li>
            <li> I use this serum as a base</li>
            <li> Why do these manufacturers think that adding all the nasty floral fragrance will make people think it works?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I hope it williams work</li>
            <li> Excellent! All as expected!</li>
            <li> Amazing serum. The best! This is my third bottle. It helped me solve my acne problem, and I only bought it for the anti age properties. This was like a side effect I was not aware of at the time of purchase. I recommend it to everyone having adult acne problem. And it makes my skin looks much younger.</li>
            <li> aleady notice less wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Aaaamazing products. Cant live with out it!</li>
            <li> I had &amp;#34;damaged dry skin&amp;#34; around my eyes due to extreme dryness and they seemed beyond repair. I used this serum with my routine moisturizers, and the difference is miraculous! My skin is getting better. I wouldn&#x27;t buy from a third party seller cos Amazon policy is not competent to prevent fakes</li>
            <li> great, although have only used 3 days.</li>
            <li> For the past couple of years, I&#x27;ve been all about serums since they started to become a &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; in the skincare space. I never really got into the Clarins line of skincare, but after my OZ Naturals Vitamin C serum ran out, I decided to give this product a try. The Double Serum comes in a sturdy, easy-to-grip plastic bottle with a reliable dispensing mechanism. It goes on tacky, but absorbs quickly and leaves a smooth finish. The fragrance is assertive and vegetal, but doesn&#x27;t linger and is not offensive (to me). I like the product just fine. But given the rave reviews others gave this serum, I was expecting better results. After more than a month of using it twice a day, I haven&#x27;t noticed any discernible difference in my complexion. (I still have a lot of product left and will finish it; if my skins starts to improve appreciably, I will gladly update my review.) Of course, everybody&#x27;s skin reacts differently to treatment, so others may get more out of this product than I did. For my money there are several other serums on Amazon, such as the OZ product I mentioned above, that perform better for my particular needs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum due to all the hype and also because i trust clarins.But each time i use this serum my facebreaks out with a spots each time. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It did take several weeks to see results. My skin is more even toned and looks refreshed.  It smells great and absorbs into the skin without looking oily.  I have sensitive skin and can breakout from using certain products.  I have not had any issues with this serum.  FYI... a small amount goes a long way &amp; be sure to mix the serum with your hands prior to putting it on. Great Anti-Aging Serum!</li>
            <li> I only have been using this serum for a few days, but already fell in love with the way it feels on my face after mixing two serums in one. It makes skin hydrated, even, and well prepared for the daily moisturizer and sunscreen application. My skin is a compbination type, and this serum make it look normal. I have also noticed pores reduction in T-Zone area. Clarins once again proved the reason behind its iconic cult status. I hope to get long term visible results by using it for a month. Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product opens your poor to allow your other products to absorb better. Unfortunately, your pores stay open and it doesn&#x27;t look very good. Also makes my products stronger so have had reactions to the increased strength.</li>
            <li> saved 35.00 on the same item .</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly. Packaging was great. This product works exactly as advertised. I have extremely sensitive skin and this product calms and hydrates. A must have if you are over 40</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are happy and wil go away</li>
            <li> Love this great experience</li>
            <li> make my skinn look younger</li>
            <li> Really can see improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> THE ULTIMATE OVERNIGHT SKIN CREAM!!!! THIS IS THE ONE!!!!</li>
            <li> I think its fake, the box wasnt sealed, the serum is oily and the box is full of typos</li>
            <li> Really like this product .., have ordered this 3 times already and once purchased in the store. Really fills your wrinkles good and gives it a nice glow after some use!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. I am a happy guy.</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with the day cream works very well. It moisturizes, feels great, and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> This product really cleared up my skin. I was still having issues with adult acne when I heard about this serum. My face looks so much better after two months. The only issue is that it&#x27;s quite pricey (great deal on Amazon!) and at 1 oz, goes very quickly if you use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> I love Clarins!  Great ingredients and great products!  I use a variety of products from Clarins and all of them are great!</li>
            <li> Clarins has reformulated its Double Serum and this stuff is amazing. It makes me look as if I have always had a great night&#x27;s rest. I just love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect just want I wanted</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do!  My skin is brighter, and those dark spots that return in the same spot time and time again, are fading away.  I can barely see them at all.  I love this stuff!!! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is expensive, but a few drops goes a long way. It makes my skin softer and more even toned. It does not get rid of fine lines nor wrinkles, nor brown spots, however.</li>
            <li> THis is the first time i am using this product. love the way this feels on my skin. Great product</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok.  Unfortunately it smells like granny&#x27;s perfume.  Why do these manufacturers think that adding all the nasty floral fragrance will make people think it works? Go the natural route,  please.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this stuff is fantastic. It helps my 50 plus skin look much younger. I used to use Arbonne skin products and spent over $200 on their age-ing skin line…Now I just buy this. It&#x27;s pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about one month and I do see a difference on my skin. I have oily skin and I was afraid I would feel it even more oily but it doesn&#x27;t. I use it only at night though before my night cream.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little expensive but you dont need much to cover your face and neck.</li>
            <li> Love love!!!! Continual improvement in tone, texture, tightness!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of the double serum and my skin is softer, more even and hopefully will be less wrinkled :)</li>
            <li> It might be a fake product. I have been using this Clarins double serum for 1.5 years and my skin never felt this way. The last one I bought have different consistency, the perfume was too strong, and make my skin irritated and dried. Be Careful of fake product. Amazon should be aware of this.</li>
            <li> Great base in my routone of night time treatment.</li>
            <li> You almost feel like you can skip moisturizer with this serum (but don&#x27;t!). It goes on very well and feels incredible. My skin feels more taut and even. It&#x27;s nicely scented as well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...haven&#x27;t had in a few months and it just works wonders. In one day I look better!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product since it really did not do anything for me except throw my money away!</li>
            <li> Really love thus product.. it helps maintain my skin glow. A lot of people have noticed my smooth face since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the whole line of Clarins face products.  This does a wonderful job and is used both in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> very nice serum for any skin type. I am in my 30s and started using this serum daily my skin looks even, firm and smooth. Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling clogged or oily. Love this product and the price on Amazon is the best deal around.</li>
            <li> there are a lot of products out there that make bold claims.  The prices range but all make the same promises. Clearer, tighter, more youthful skin.  Clarins has a long history and a huge following for a reason.  Their products work and the double serum is no exception.  I recommend pairing this with one of their moisturizers that best complements your age and skin needs, and after 4 weeks you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> Have tried every anti-aging product on the market, and this one is truly amazing.  People actually stop in mid-converstions with me to say how great my skin looks.  Really.&lt;br /&gt;I am now on my third repeat purchase!</li>
            <li> This product is oily on the skin so I need to put on another moisturizer to remove the shiness.</li>
            <li> Excellent product the name says it all.</li>
            <li> My face just drinks this serum up!  It feels so good and my face actually looks healthier!  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Good price for an item from Clarins....quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Although just using it for a few days I already see some results. Really like and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the same exact Clarins Double Serum that I usually pay a lot more for.  I really like the stuff and think it improves my skin but so expensive I was having second thoughts until I found this great deal.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS. LOVE IT, NOW I LOOK FOR THE BEST PRICE TO MAKE MY PURCHASE</li>
            <li> My mom loves this stuff. Works wonders for her wrinkles. She&#x27;s 63 and its helping her from getting too much wrinkles</li>
            <li> Great an the price was much less than in stores.  Love the way my skin look.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this stuff works for me. Aa little pricey, but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Broke me out but was a great deal and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and am happy that I have been able to find it so much cheaper here than in the department stores I used to buy it at.  Love the smell and how it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. It really works. My skin feels very supple. I am a repeat buyer!</li>
            <li> All I can say is try this serum!!!  It is &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34;!!  I have so many positive things to say about this serum, that &amp;#34;try it&amp;#34; is the most simplest!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this serum.  I save a great deal of money ordering from Amazon then when I purchase it outright from one of leading department stores. Could not be happier</li>
            <li> This is by far the best serum I have ever used. It has a good slip over the skin and I have seen a improvement. I have used serums for years and this is the first one I have recommended. I recently sent one to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 weeks, and although it goes on easily and leaves no sticky&lt;br /&gt;residue, I have yet to see any positive results to my skin texture or pores. Because this Clarins is&lt;br /&gt;an expensive investment, I don&#x27;t know if I would re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any change at all. I been used for a month already.</li>
            <li> I like the Clarins products.  They seem to do more for me than other products I have tried.  I use this serum as a base and then I use the moisturizer followed by facial sunscreen.  I feel that my face looks really good for my age!!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT, BUT IT ONLY LASTED ME 1 MONTH. I USED IT TWICE A DAY, SO I CANT AFFORD TO KEEP IT UP. ..</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite serum.  It does exactly what it supposed to do:  restores your skin to its natural glow without making it oily or drying it out.  It is not sticky and skin feels smoother just after a few minutes.  After using it for a month, I noticed a change in my skin. Even if I pulled an all-nighter, this serum helps erase any \\&quot;tired\\&quot; lines from my face.  It is also ideal if you live in cold dry climate as it helps decrease any redness.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, This is THE BEST!</li>
            <li> This product broke out my skin whenever I used it so I was restricted to using it under my eyes only.  And no, it didn&#x27;t diminish the signs of aging despite me using the entire bottle over several months.  One thing to note is that if you&#x27;re squirting the stuff out of the bottle, squirt it into the palm of your hand, not onto your fingertip.  The stuff shoots out of the bottle really fast and your whole hand will be more likely to catch it all as opposed to the mega expensive stuff ending up on the floor or mirror.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 months and really see improvement in my skin. I intend to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I cant notice any difference?</li>
            <li> After using the entire bottle, I don&#x27;t notice a bit of difference.  Disappointed, but not surprised.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, can tell a difference in my skin already!!</li>
            <li> This product looks different and smells different than the real one</li>
            <li> This seems to work good,  still have wrinkles,  haven&#x27;t used it long enough for anything to happen there.  Don&#x27;t really think it will control that much,</li>
            <li> I can feel a difference in my skin and see fewer of the tiny wrinkles that have surrounded my eyes and upper lip for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price.</li>
            <li> his is my second bottle. Using it morning and evening, it lasted 10 months.  It goes a long way, gives a healthy,youthful suppleness to the skin...I love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of the most excellent plant based &amp;#34;cosmesuticals&amp;#34; in my arsenal to look the most age appropriate as long as I can!</li>
            <li> The best serum I have ever used!!! Amazon&#x27; price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> Initially I loved the silky way it when on but into the 4th week I was getting an itchy irritated rash on my face.  After doing more research I found it had a plant based irritant in it and had to stop using it and sure enough the rash went away.</li>
            <li> I use it on the backs of my hands and neck. Amazing. It is anti-aging. I love it and won&#x27;t do without it. Great for older thinning skin.</li>
            <li> Pricey but nice, using it 2 times daily and seeing results especially around my eyes and mouth.  I love it</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Clarins products for years....and won&#x27;t use anything else.  I don&#x27;t know what it does for her skin or complexion, but I don&#x27;t have to understand it.  She wants it - she gets it!!</li>
            <li> Great product, keeps my skim moist and supple all day, smells pleasantly</li>
            <li> some really great stuff .</li>
            <li> I went to a department store to check this whole line of product out before I purchased any online.  The sales clerk showed me how the product can become even more absorbent simply by adding a small amount of your own moisturizer to the face.  Also, the clerk put only one pump&#x27;s worth of product in  her palm and then rubbed her hands together.  She then applied the product by placing her hands to gently press in the serum instead of rubbing.  It makes sense to me, if you continually rub product in with your fingers you may be too rough.  Gently patting it on your face, neck and upper chest does make it feel more luxurious.</li>
            <li> Been using for years.  Love it and it does keep fine lines at bay.</li>
            <li> I was a big fan of the Generation 6 Double Serum, but I don&#x27;t get the same results from this reboot.  It is very oily, and it just seems to sit on top of my skin.  I will not repurchase this.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling on face after I use this serum and the smell. It gives decent results. I didn&#x27;t use it long enough yet to say I absolutely love it and would buy more.</li>
            <li> 5 stars. Skin looks younger.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Definitely works.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, its transformed my skin!!:)</li>
            <li> This serum is absolutely fantastic. Have noticed distinct fading of brown sun damage refined pores and overall fine textured skin. Have received numerous compliments &amp;#34;wow you are looking younger&amp;#34; etc. Have bought 3 spare bottles on Amazon. It is way over priced in stores however would buy it at the higher price as it does all it claims and more.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product. My skin gets unbelievably dry and flaky during the winter /heating season. I use it 2x a day, in the AM out of the shower and evening after cleansing. You don&#x27;t need a lot,  1 pump should suffice, and it softens the skin on contact. I&#x27;m also a fan of layering... So after using the serum,  I use a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has remained flake free with out a humidifier!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!&lt;br /&gt; One last thing, be careful with the price shown on Amazon,  and read the amount carefully. They try to fool you, by not listing ounces, but millimeters only. Personally, I think Amazon, out of respect for American customers should make these companies list both, it would save everyone a lot of aggravation. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is actually a fake. I bought one from sephora and I matched it to this one. It looks similar but the formula is not as effective. The bottle even looks and feel a little different. If its too cheap to sound true it probably isn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li> This serum makes your face look and feel great within a couple of days.  Smells good, too! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> excellent performance from this serum. My skin texture and softness has greatly improved. will definitely purchase this on going</li>
