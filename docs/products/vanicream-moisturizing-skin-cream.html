            <li>I have just started using this product for exima(sp)with good results.</li>
            <li>Good stuff - highest rating by nationaleczema dot org.  </li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t know what it was, we just knew it didn&#x27;t make her feel good and made everything an ordeal for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of her conditions</li>
            <li>but I expect it to be good.</li>
            <li>could find a good  skin cream in the U.S.A.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This container works best with a pump, which is available.  </li>
            <li>That a a good thing...</li>
            <li>Therefore, definitely a good buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, buy one with pump dispenser:&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good for my allergies however</li>
            <li>It works as a good base/barrier for my makeup, too.</li>
            <li>Therefore, definitely a good buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, buy one with pump dispenser:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eat VERY healthy.  </li>

            <li>Great price, Speedy shipping from Amazon, fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>Nice price and good service</li>
            <li>The cream works perfectly when you put it on right after a shower or after you wash your hands because it keeps that moisture in.</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>

            <li>Buy it and love it!  </li>
            <li>and I trust Dr. Mercola more than my dermatologist!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>my mom is fine now, and I thank the makers of Vanicream for making a great product that worked for her.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly, does not leave any kind of greasy residue like some lotions, and has a very nice consistancy to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was also happy to learn that it is free of harmful chemicals and dyes.  </li>
            <li>I had all kinds of testing and trials, I paid huge sums of money for  fancy products at the mall with promises that now I would be happy.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been diagnosed with keratosis pilaris, which is kind of like eczema.  </li>
            <li>Awesome and gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s unscented.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not have to depend on yet another allergy medication to give her some relief.</li>
            <li>I use it to wash my face on a warm cloth.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this cream and shipped fast as well.</li>
            <li>She was thrilled.</li>
            <li>the cream is a bit thicker than normal moisturizers but it works great!</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive so this is a wonderful moisturizer for me.  </li>
            <li>Rubs in very easily without the greasiness.  </li>
            <li>I will get more of this for sure!</li>
            <li>It is very good and really excels with its claims.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>and this is by far the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to get it without the pump.  </li>
            <li>Vanicream by far is the greatest.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice lotion but cerave lotion is a lot better.</li>
            <li>best cream for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Best cream to use for sensitive skin during winter.  </li>
            <li>the expiration date is FINE!    </li>
            <li>That is very important...</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel very smooth and does not leave residue on clothing</li>
            <li>The pump version is nice to leave in a static location, but I prefer the screw lid since I can travel with it easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent for sensitive, easily irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine; however, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize quite as effectively.</li>
            <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Works for more than excema.</li>
            <li>For most people, it does not go away.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>For now, too many pharmaceutical companies are making money off of it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Dr. Crotty didn&#x27;t prescribe a lot of meds, but even the ones he prescribed we&#x27;ve mostly stopped using.</li>
            <li>Make your world mostly scentless (no perfumes, candles, etc).  </li>
            <li>Eat more healthy oils, like putting olive oil on salads.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from SEVERE eczema on my hands for many years.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so you know it is a worthwhile product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Problem spots like elbows and feet have been made much better by the use of this product.</li>
            <li>We just love it.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Simply the best cream moisturizer I have used.  </li>
            <li>My family uses this moisturizing skin cream for more than two years.</li>
            <li>The wetter you can keep the area the better.</li>
            <li>buy the squirt top- easier to use</li>
            <li>No sticky or greasy residue to deal with like many others have.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for years and find it so much more convenient to buy through amazon.</li>
            <li>Reusing is better for the environment.  </li>
            <li>but still some areas are still not getting better.</li>
            <li>I use the robathol bath oil followed by the vanicream then use vaniply on top of that.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it in a jar.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this cream better than anything I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Vanicream ended up making my mom&#x27;s condition much more bearable.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I found this to be one of the best moisturizes on the market, especially for people with eczema</li>
            <li>but I think its been helping more than anything.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>pleased</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite body cream.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This one is much better.</li>
            <li>Love it and wished I would have started using it sooner.</li>
            <li>I love this cream as it provides moisture without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I can tell that my Rx ointment works better when used along with this as opposed to alone</li>
            <li>I love this cream,I used to have a lot of problems with my skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a life saver! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Love their suntan lotion</li>
            <li>I think it is lovely.</li>
            <li>The texture is more of a sealant than a cream, in that it prevents moisture from escaping and keeps your skin from flaking off.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this body lotion.  </li>
            <li>That must be someone who has not been shopping in a drugstore for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love Vanicream.</li>
            <li>We continue to use all three, with Vanicream getting the most use during the day, and more Aquaphor to seal in moisture during the winter months.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>And shh, but I can buy it either on amazon or at Target, whichever is more convenient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure why that would be.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff - it was recommended by my allergist when I started getting hives.  </li>
            <li>I have found no product that I like better for moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li>and since it&#x27;s from Rochester, MN is even better.  </li>
            <li>There is a lot of information I want to share with you, but I want to mention this before I forget: sometimes amazon has a good price or some deal for vanicream, but I&#x27;ve found that dermadoctor usually has the best price.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and does a great job moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li>Walgreens and Wal-mart are both pretty good at it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, it&#x27;s non greasy and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>I would say this is a pretty good choice unless your eczema is severe</li>
            <li>It moisturizes the feet, ankles and toes and feels really wonderful all day long.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for dry itchy skin</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry itchy skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice lotion, not greasy, that blends in quickly.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this cream as  the best for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best thing we&#x27;ve found for dry skin in winter and eczema.</li>
            <li>but if you have very sensitive skin, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>She says that it is a great moisturizing cream for her very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is also a great moisturizer if you wash your hands a lot and works in to the skin and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Vanicream is excellent if you have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>TOWEL OFF LIGHTLY, just the water that&#x27;s sitting on top of the skin.  </li>
            <li>Most lotions cause it to burn, even if they are free of perfumes and dyes.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for babies or kids with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for real dry body parts.</li>
            <li>But great combination of not reddening sensitive skin, but also curing dryness.</li>
            <li>It is great for sensitive skin, I use this brand of sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li>Does leave you feeling greasy and works great on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>yes I am verry pleased with the results of my rash since I started using the vanicream , it works fantastic</li>
            <li>Thank heavens a good dermatologist, thank you Sarah, suggested Vani products to me and my whole life has changed.  </li>
            <li>Very mild and comforting.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t remove age spots or keep your skin from bruising easily, but it does restore moisture and improves the health of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasts forever with the easy to use pump, and with the pump you don&#x27;t contaminate the cream by dipping your hand into it.  </li>
            <li>This cream has a nice and thick consistency that is not greasy and it absorbs wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I found a better price on Amazon and it was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it absorbs quick!</li>
            <li>also applies to tanning oils and lotions--which many of you may be using right now with summer in full swing--as well as the baby oil or lotion that many parents unwittingly slather on their babies.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It came in a nice large jar (1 lb) and was quite a bargain here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my and my little one&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I can give this same review for Vanicream fragrance free soap as it is a great product too.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s in a huge container)</li>
            <li>We have tried every prescription and over the counter cream available.  </li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t contain harmful additives such as fragrances, parabems, or chemicals.  </li>
            <li>goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>and I was in search of a great daily moisturizer when I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s an important tip.</li>
            <li>I buy 2 or 3 tubs at a time to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li>Just thought I would check Amazon to see if it was available on line and voila</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and with no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is free from color additives, scents, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost blemish free.</li>
            <li>this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I use cutemol on him which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is unbelievably cheap for the quality.</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic, non-greasy cream that is ultra moisturizing and healing.</li>
            <li>Only one comment about the packaging that&#x27;s not so great...</li>
            <li>Eczema free since I started using it.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy smearing vaseline on your hands then you may enjoy this lotion.</li>
            <li>Overall a great lotion</li>
            <li>I completely love this cream, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it in relation to my child&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>I use it everywhere, including my incredibly sensitive lips, and nothing I&#x27;ve found it as good.  </li>
            <li>Vanicream is a good brand for moisturing cream, esp for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Vanicream is a good brand for moisturing cream, esp for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For me, Aveeno does provide moisture a bit longer than Vanicream, but there isn&#x27;t a significant difference at all.  </li>
            <li>Experience was excellent as usual.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Irradiated mice who were treated with the moisturizers exhibited a significant increase in their rate of tumor formation and increase in tumor size per mouse.</li>
            <li>but it is worth the money and really good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Its a great quick fix for dry skin...</li>
            <li>We like the pump (no dipping hands and fingers into the jar, so no worries about getting bacteria in it, which is a plus with eczema and any skin that is more infection-prone) and it is much easier to clean up than Eucerin or Aquaphor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This cream was made primarily for people with skin issues (for normal skin, the Lite Lotion is probably a better match).</li>
            <li>I found this at a better price, the supplier sent the product in ample time, thanks so much for having such a great product available for people like us.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my dermatologist as a good daily moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>I find it does as good a job as Curel, but has a richer feel and is priced about the same.  </li>
            <li>While it has a creamy texture, it is thick and provide excellent protection for the skin.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and no smell, just good basic lotion for the dryness of winter.</li>
            <li>, I am glad that I tried this and now subscribe it monthly for my whole family.</li>
            <li>I am VERY dissapointed that my dermatologist recommended this cream as SAFE</li>
            <li>Excellent cream for trouble spots that weren&#x27;t healed with anything else; no perfumey annoyances; large economical size; received very quickly .</li>
            <li>This is a very good product when you have had treatment for skin cancers on the face as it is very gentle and you do not have to have to worry about perfumes or fragrances that are in other products for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Does a great job at maintaining the skin moist and does not have all the additional chemicals other brands have.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion- great if you or your kids have sensitive or itchy dry</li>
            <li>His doctors recommended vanicream to us, and we love all their products, particularly this cream and the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try to get the ones without pumps, but Amazon said they couldn&#x27;t guarantee I would get the right one, so they just gave me a couple dollars back, which was good.</li>
            <li>I never heard of it before and just picked it up at the local walgreen&#x27;s and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love that we can get replacements tubs of vanicream without having to buy the new pumps.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and once absorbed is not sticky.</li>
            <li>and I suffer from very sensitive skin; glad I switched.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it works ten times better than anything else and isn&#x27;t so oily!</li>
            <li>I use Vanicream after the Free and Clear cleanser, and I tell you what it&#x27;s the best combo for my dry skin that I&#x27;ve used so far!  </li>
            <li>Our daughter really likes how smoothly Vanicream glides on, and how quickly her skin absorbs it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to cover up with body spray, though, and most people probably wouldn&#x27;t even notice it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is super safe and does not have ingredients that will irritate truly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you buy over a certain dollar amount (which I always do) they give you free shipping.  </li>
            <li>She is very fair, blue eyed blonde.</li>
            <li>The combination of these two (which I&#x27;ve only been using for a week now) has been amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy without being greasy and works great.</li>
            <li>This cream really does go on smooth and does not cause allergic reactions.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, as well as dye and fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>This means limiting junk food and take out and adding in lots and lots of fresh fruits and vegetables.  </li>
            <li>When used daily, there is zero eczema, minimal itching and a very happy child.</li>
            <li>The wrinkle have mostly disappeared, and the skin looks far healthier.  </li>
            <li>Most of them are more expensive and not as good  </li>
            <li>Minimal ingredients, good consistency.  </li>
            <li>Only \\&quot;Dermasmooth\\&quot; really helps the skin during exceptional flare-ups, otherwise it&#x27;s managing your diet and your environment.  </li>
            <li>It does sting on his legs if we use it right after a bath, but otherwise has moisturized well.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin just right.</li>
            <li>This cream is just the right thickness and creaminess for my sons&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>(The basic ingredient is petrolatum, the same as in most highly-moisturizing creams--it acts as a nice barrier to keep moisture locked in.)  </li>
            <li>Very nice product or sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>It certainly works for me!</li>
            <li>I was diagnosed with ezcema in junior high and have not had any significant problems since beginning to use Vanicream.  </li>
            <li>She liked it but after using it for 3 straight days, not only did I not see any improvements</li>
            <li>It becomes especially important in the winter when humidity drops to about 12% in our apartment, and even with multiple humidifiers going we can only get it up to about 32%.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt better, but also looked far better and more vital than any other product could produce.</li>
            <li>Right now, I&#x27;m using the Neosporin eczema essential and that seems to agree with him more.</li>
            <li>i purchased because of its good reviews hoping that it would calm my eczema, unfortunately, i found cetaphil to be more useful ;/</li>
            <li>and I thank Amazon for offering it at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>this is a huge irritant to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this huge jar because my dermatologist recommended I start using Vanicream products for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>You get no sleep, your aware of your skin all the time, you may be very self-conscious of your inflammations/wounds, while everyone else is sitting calmly, concentrating at work or in class, all you can think about is your skin, and so on.    </li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased to finally find the identical product here on Amazon at a dramatically discounted price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>First let me say that I am a label-reader: I read ingredients on everything from soup to nuts to skin creams.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist first recommended this cream for an eczema problem on my arm.  </li>
            <li>It soaks up fairly fast and works!</li>
            <li>My husband has tried many creams for his itchy rash that he has had for several years that no Dr. can identify or cure.  </li>
            <li>Truthfully, I&#x27;ve been getting tiny whiteheads here</li>
            <li>I have tried many, may creams and this is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li>Well, I would have rated it higher if it had arrived intact, however, when I opened the box, there was cream all through it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to save enough of the cream to use, about 1/4 of the jar to see if I would like it.  </li>
            <li>Once I got my first jar of Vanicream, I stopped looking elsewhere as this stuff is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, Vanicream Cream is a product that has a lot of value when most standard moisturizers do not work.</li>
            <li>However, if you put it on and stay in a hot environment, it will literally melt off your face.</li>
            <li>I was recommended this product by a dermatologist and it improved my skin to a better condition than anything else I have tried in over 30 years, to include topical and oral steroids.  </li>
            <li>You get a very generous amount so the price is well worth it.</li>
            <li>In fact I mix it equally with Aquaphor which I also get through Amazon and love them both.</li>
            <li>Many struggle to find a cure for this condition and we were blessed to break the eczema cycle on our daughter who itched constantly.  </li>
            <li>Not only is Vanicream affordable and great for dry skin, but my dermatologist is the one who introduced me to it.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and absorbs right into your skin.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product and have recommended it to other eczema sufferers.</li>
            <li>Lacks the creamy consistendy of other hand creams as is not quite as effective.</li>
            <li>Initially, I wasn&#x27;t using this cream on my daughter&#x27;s eczema frequently enough, so I didn&#x27;t think it was any good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different moisturizers over the years, and some very pricey.  </li>
            <li>Cost was very reasonable and the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I also bought Monkey Balm and that I found to be much better</li>
            <li>I think this is a good face cream, paticularly for those sensitive to perfumes and additives found in other creams.</li>
            <li>We then dressed her in wet pajamas soaked in warm water (ringed out) and put two layers of dried sweats on her to keep her warm.  </li>
            <li>Her skin had been extremely dry and cracked and is now becoming smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>After trying many low and ultra high priced moisturizers, I came across Vanicream during a routine doctor&#x27;s visit.</li>
            <li>I also bought California Baby Hair and Body Wash for Super Sensitive Skin.  </li>
            <li>This is an outstanding moisturizer often prescribed by physicians (which I am) for dry skin problems like eczema.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many body creams for winter dry skin without good or long lasting results.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s very true that Vanicream is a nice, non-irritating cream for sensitive skin, the list of ingredients is still made up of long-syllabled chemicals that are hard to pronounce.</li>
            <li>Buying a large container saves $$$$</li>
            <li>Finally, the product has a waxy texture that is great if you put it on within 3 minutes of exiting the shower and allow it to dry completely.  </li>
            <li>Based on reviews I thought this would be a good product for my dry, sensitive, mature skin.</li>
            <li>It has certainly worked very well.  </li>
            <li>We tend to stay away from creams that are perfumey or greasy, so when we don&#x27;t want to splurge financially on natural homeopathic creams with natural ingredients that are familiar and easy to pronounce, we always come back to Vanicream.</li>
            <li>These pots will last and last and the price is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was given samples of this brand from an allergy specialist and it is really the only option I found for truly unscented, paraben free, hypoallergenic hygiene products.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;water cleans\\&quot; advice comes from a very helpul book called HEALING ECZEMA by Christina Nevada.  </li>
            <li>If you are really suffering from eczema, you must read this book.     </li>
            <li>I bought it since I believed it was only available at the doc.  </li>
            <li>I find the pump applicator very efficient and allows one to meter out the correct amount needed.</li>
            <li>I go straight to the ingredients and make my decision from there</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it is unscented.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price too.</li>
            <li>It is very pricey but work every penny.  </li>
            <li>This product has really helped in the week we&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>It holds in the moisture really well.</li>
            <li>My whole family now uses it.</li>
            <li>but I an very optimistic.</li>
            <li>After bathing we apply the cream onto the whole body of our child.</li>
            <li>Also we use this cream for the whole family after visiting pools with chlorinated water.</li>
            <li>Very creamy.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I have purchased a jar for a family member</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin though.  </li>
            <li>The cream works very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no longer available locally without a pump, and once you have a pump, you don&#x27;t need another.  </li>
            <li>Really keeps him moisturized.</li>
            <li>really is non-comedogenic (doesn&#x27;t clog pores) for those of us with combination skin.  </li>
            <li>If applied immediately after bathing to moist skin, it really clears all his eczema spots up in a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li>I put it on myself and my kids immediately after getting out of the bath or shower and it locks in moisture really well.  </li>
            <li>They really need to do something about the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my tots exzema and it helped so much.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so fast, obit it started clearing in a day or 2.</li>
            <li>Whole family uses this.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t clog pores (you can use on your face).  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is really improving their quality of life.</li>
            <li>The jar design they use is also very convenient.</li>
            <li>She told us to use it after every bath - coat the whole body, including face.</li>
            <li>so I ended up not using the whole thing</li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>I have very severe eczema</li>
            <li>This product has really helped manage by 18mth olds eczema.  </li>
            <li>Vanicream can be very costly when you use as much as we do a year.</li>
            <li>Steriods were getting too much, nothing seemed to work</li>
            <li>Vanicream is the only face cream that I have been able to use near my eyes.  </li>
            <li>So if you have certain skin issues, chances are you will benefit from Vanicream more so than you will from other products.</li>
            <li>It is a bit thick when first applied, and just takes a little while to absorb into the skin, but once it does, I think you will be very impressed.  </li>
            <li>The closest product I found is cetaphil, but Vanicream is much less greasy, absorbs quickly and (when applied lightly)</li>
            <li>My child has head to toe eczema and after trying so many other products to restore moisture</li>
            <li>I have tried Cetaphil, Eucerin, Aveeno, Aquaphor, Vaseline, and many other creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other product for my skin.  </li>
            <li>but this helped it most of the other times.</li>
            <li>Once we found out the hives were apparently not from allergies, he suggested I smooth this all over myself after every shower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a thicker weight cream that applies easily, does not clog pores, and works for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Keep your house as clean as possible.  </li>
            <li>This product is high quality ant a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>But this product is the best our family has found in this, our tenth year, of dealing with this very difficult skin disorder.  </li>
            <li>Prior to, I had used at least 100 different products because none worked super great for me.</li>
            <li>After trying many different products this is the only thing that works on my son&#x27;s eczema!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick so the moisture really lasts.</li>
            <li>This is a decent cream</li>
            <li>Amazon has a decent price on it too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive than many lotions you find at the store</li>
            <li>Soak in the bathtub (or hands if that is only area affected) in as hot as water as tolerable for exactly 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This cream felt very sticky on my skin and also had a strange, kind of bitter smell.  </li>
            <li>Keri lotion works better, but does not last as long and is much greaser than this Vanicream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Vanicream.</li>
            <li>If you have problems with your skin, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried almost every bath, soap, lotion, and cream for sensitive and dry skin and this is by far my favorite non prescription product.</li>
            <li>It is pain free to apply to very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying a little more so that my skin can feel moist.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it costs a little bit more than grocery store convenience lotions</li>
            <li>Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Original Moisturizing Creme, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]],</li>
            <li>It is hard to find products for sensitive skin which are also fragrance free, and that&#x27;s important for us, as my son gets hives from anything with fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it and it works very well for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My son has been batteling ecezma &amp; the only thing that would calm it</li>
            <li>So far, it has really helped them to not break out.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the extra costs.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>Vanicream returned her skin to normal, though I myself don&#x27;t know what she was suffering from...</li>
            <li>but they can be messy to apply at daycare/school, and feel a bit more tacky on the skin.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product for any of you who have young children suffering from very dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li>The cream sits on top of my skin, no absorption, thus red and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Do not dry off, and on the hot spots, we dabbed a 1% steroid ointment---might have been elecon, but I can&#x27;t remember.  </li>
            <li>Being thicker, it takes a little while to work it in, but you ultimately save time given most other products will require significantly more reapplications than the Vanicream cream.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to eczema, bless you.  </li>
            <li>In reality, those who live with it know that it can consume your life.  </li>
            <li>This will be my new skin cream now.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and so do my kids and new baby.  </li>
            <li>Obviously it doesn&#x27;t cure the eczema, but it certainly keeps my skin moist and my itching at a minimum!</li>
            <li>We have both been using Vanicream for several years, after hand-washing throughout the day, but first and foremost right when we step from the shower, covering the entire body.  </li>
            <li>My one year old has had a bad case of ezema over the winter months and this is the best thing I have found for keeping it in check.</li>
            <li>We have taken my son to at least 10 dermatologists who mostly seemed to have a very lackadaisical attitude toward eczema.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;The results indicate that several commercially available moisturizing creams increase the rate of formation and number of tumors when applied topically to UVB-pretreated high-risk mice.</li>
            <li>My husband has dermatological skin issues as well, and we both have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My son has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My son has very sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have an issue with this because of what this does for my skin (and I have very sensitive skin:</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to everything.</li>
            <li>After using Vanicream for about 3 weeks, my face was completely clear and the itching was gone...forever!</li>
            <li>After using this for a couple weeks it is completely gone!</li>
            <li>If you have eczema, then you have to use this product pretty regularly to see any results.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s non-steroid and kid friendly, I tried it on my daughter too and her eczema patches were gone in just a couple days, after weeks of trying other products unsuccessfully.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to perfumes and chemicals normally found in moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;A study has found that topical applications of moisturizers such as Dermabase, Dermovan, Eucerin Original Moisturizing Cream, or Vanicream could increase skin cancer risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>makes my skin feel extremely soft !</li>
            <li>Cured my sensitive super dry skin immediately.</li>
            <li>My uncle has developed eczema in his mid-60s and has been self-conscious about his newly imperfect skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong moisturizer capable of helping your skin when most other products have failed to yield much or any improvement.</li>
            <li>but nothing compared to what I normally have, and actually, I&#x27;ve been using Proactive and the Clinique Acne Kit for quite sometime which never cleared up  my skin as much as it is now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it or Curel for very dry skin or dry regions; they are my two favorite face creams.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to chemicals, fragrances, and have lots of allergies to even natural products.</li>
            <li>The pump is probably a good idea, when the lid isn&#x27;t sealed tight it get&#x27;s a little goopy</li>
            <li>No heavy scent, goes on smooth and absorbs quickly- not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my grandson who had a dry itchy rash on his legs, it cleared it right up.</li>
            <li>It feels silky smooth on my hands and helps me overcome the tendency toward dryness and cracking skin.&lt;br /&gt;There is little fragrance and it does not bother my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works extremely well, has no odor, has no additives/allergens, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Tubes are so hard to empty and who can afford to waste this great cream!</li>
            <li>Dr.. prescribled...keeps skin moist and soft</li>
            <li>it helps it completely go away</li>
            <li>I have a 10 1/2 month old baby at home who has suffered from Exzema from month three.  </li>
            <li>It has no smell at all, and has caused no irritation or reactions in our sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>old every evening and douse him with vanicream afterward as per our allergist recommendation.  </li>
            <li>It a a terrific moisturizer for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>We use Vanicream twice a day, everyday, and it keeps her skin hydrated and eczema free.</li>
            <li>Used this on my 2yo, who has developed eczema.  </li>
            <li>he has exczema and sun sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am ready to do a vanicream commercial.</li>
            <li>This is also the least-irritating face cream I&#x27;ve ever used on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li>Try vanicream if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My two year old has it too.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as absorbent as some, but it is completely non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>A dermatologist recommended this to me for use with my 2 year old who has eczema.</li>
            <li>We have used it for years and now with a 2 year old with eczema, we have it as a staple in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>I occasionally get eczema breakouts and this lotion really helps keep it in check.</li>
            <li>After reading lots of reviews, I got Vanicream for my child with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>We have been battling with our 5 year old daughter&#x27;s eczema for years now.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to also use on her face.</li>
            <li>We use this on my Grandson who is 2 weeks old to my husband who is 60.</li>
            <li>Under those conditions we need to apply this at least once a day, twice is much better.</li>
            <li>They work well on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Research shows that a genetic flaw seems to be responsible for skin that doesn&#x27;t hold enough moisture, which can lead to skin problems.</li>
            <li>Looking for a replacemnt to my old lotion moisterel, this was ok but did not keep my skin moist  enough, it still dried out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, which I love.  </li>
            <li>The texture is really thick which I thought for sure was going break me out</li>
            <li>Vanicream was first recommended to us by my husband&#x27;s dermatologist for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It worked okay the first couple of times I used it, but like everything else, was useless afterwards.</li>
            <li>You only have to use a little bit, so I believe it will last quite a while, and the price was outstanding for this quality of product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much -- I use a whole lot less than with Eucerin, for example.     </li>
            <li>I now use it on my clients at the spa where I am employed and highly recommend it to anyone who needs to effectively restore dry or unhealthy skin.</li>
            <li>and my daughter has a little mild eczema too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thicker than regular skin lotion (thus the reason they call it skin cream) and its fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Most creams and lip balms have fragrances, and then there are some she told me labeled as fragrance free that will have a masking fragrance in them, which are just as bad.  </li>
            <li>Two days ago, my elbows were rough and peeling, and in less than 48 hours, the peeling has disappeared and I&#x27;m left with nothing but soft and healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>When we do use it, it really helps to keep dry skin issues at bay.</li>
            <li>Also, the size of this container is really too big for travel, so get the smaller size.  </li>
            <li>Pat skin with towel but do not dry completely.</li>
            <li>A quick bath/shower with a soft cloth is all that&#x27;s usually needed for eczema skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t actually heal they area as far as I can tell like straight vaseline might do, but it does take away the dry burnt stingy feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this product for almost a year now and while I think it does an pretty decent job for treating and covering my really dry skin, I use it in conjunction with 2 other lotions as well.</li>
            <li>I was quite pleased to find it at less than half the price they were asking.  </li>
            <li>Daily to twice daily use keeps skin soft and smooth, making atopic dermatitis breakouts much less likely.</li>
            <li>Most other creams work fine, too, but some are too thin to last very long.</li>
            <li>We live in a super dry climate and my little one gets eczema because of this.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s probably too heavy for use on a younger face, but it&#x27;s great at night, tough elbows/knees, and neck and chest areas</li>
            <li>My first reason for writing this review is to assure you that any bad reviews of this product are from (probably) nice, but uneducated-in-eczema individuals.  </li>
            <li>I generally use Aveeno, but decided to try Vanicream with the hope that it would become a staple lotion for me.  </li>
            <li>Here is a general treatment summary.  </li>
            <li>so glad she did, now my skin is silky smooth and hypoallergenic - try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li>For me, compassion is only second to \\&quot;really knowing your stuff\\&quot; in the medical profession.  </li>
            <li>My five year old son has suffered with eczema his entire life.  </li>
            <li>especially if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, it&#x27;s free of whatever you might worry about, it&#x27;s been recommended to be by two doctors, it goes on creamy and absorbs well and stays on tenaciously.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t eat fresh strawberries unless their organic (due to pesticides) and limit acidic foods such as oranges as they actually change your body&#x27;s chem. balance.  </li>
            <li>Rarely will you find a pharmacy that keeps it in-stock because it can&#x27;t sit on the shelf long, due to having no preservatives.  </li>
            <li>I am used to a very humid environment and have recently moved to a very dry climate, and my skin has not reacted well.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and Vanicream is the only product that really works for me.  </li>
            <li>Also, compare the price of this with other moisturizers, Vanicream is a real bargain.  </li>
            <li>I was very skeptic as all the other moisturizers flared up my kid&#x27;s eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>live in a dry</li>
            <li>I recommend it to all new parents and anyone with eczema and really dry skin.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new lotion product that would help my sometimes dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having extremely dry facial skin lately which nothing has been able to combat.</li>
            <li>The back of my hands, for example, looked like they belonged to a 90-year old, but I am only 70.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is thick and is the only thing that was able to help my dry skin and when used in conjunction with organic coconut oil it does wonders.</li>
            <li>Luckily the order had only this cream and a small set of glass stains,(wrapped in plastic)  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this for my extremely dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t dry, feels soft, and my eyes are happy!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This is thick, but soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has extremely sensitive, dry skin with red bumps and a \\&quot;rash.\\</li>
            <li>I have eczema and very dry sensitive skin (not helped by living at altitude in an arid climate).</li>
            <li>Really helps babies with very dry rough skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I expect it to be good.</li>

            <li> and I trust Dr. Mercola more than my dermatologist!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> my mom is fine now, and I thank the makers of Vanicream for making a great product that worked for her.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly, does not leave any kind of greasy residue like some lotions, and has a very nice consistancy to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> I was also happy to learn that it is free of harmful chemicals and dyes.  </li>
            <li> I had all kinds of testing and trials, I paid huge sums of money for  fancy products at the mall with promises that now I would be happy.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been diagnosed with keratosis pilaris, which is kind of like eczema.  </li>
            <li> Awesome and gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s unscented.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to not have to depend on yet another allergy medication to give her some relief.</li>
            <li> I use it to wash my face on a warm cloth.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with this cream and shipped fast as well.</li>
            <li> She was thrilled.</li>
            <li> the cream is a bit thicker than normal moisturizers but it works great!</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive so this is a wonderful moisturizer for me.  </li>
            <li> Rubs in very easily without the greasiness.  </li>
            <li> I will get more of this for sure!</li>
            <li> It is very good and really excels with its claims.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> and this is by far the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to get it without the pump.  </li>
            <li> Vanicream by far is the greatest.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice lotion but cerave lotion is a lot better.</li>
            <li> best cream for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Best cream to use for sensitive skin during winter.  </li>
            <li> the expiration date is FINE!    </li>
            <li> That is very important...</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very smooth and does not leave residue on clothing</li>
            <li> The pump version is nice to leave in a static location, but I prefer the screw lid since I can travel with it easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent for sensitive, easily irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine; however, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize quite as effectively.</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Works for more than excema.</li>
            <li> For most people, it does not go away.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> For now, too many pharmaceutical companies are making money off of it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Dr. Crotty didn&#x27;t prescribe a lot of meds, but even the ones he prescribed we&#x27;ve mostly stopped using.</li>
            <li> Make your world mostly scentless (no perfumes, candles, etc).  </li>
            <li> Eat more healthy oils, like putting olive oil on salads.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from SEVERE eczema on my hands for many years.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> so you know it is a worthwhile product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Problem spots like elbows and feet have been made much better by the use of this product.</li>
            <li> We just love it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Simply the best cream moisturizer I have used.  </li>
            <li> My family uses this moisturizing skin cream for more than two years.</li>
            <li> The wetter you can keep the area the better.</li>
            <li> buy the squirt top- easier to use</li>
            <li> No sticky or greasy residue to deal with like many others have.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for years and find it so much more convenient to buy through amazon.</li>
            <li> Reusing is better for the environment.  </li>
            <li> but still some areas are still not getting better.</li>
            <li> I use the robathol bath oil followed by the vanicream then use vaniply on top of that.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find it in a jar.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream better than anything I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Vanicream ended up making my mom&#x27;s condition much more bearable.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I found this to be one of the best moisturizes on the market, especially for people with eczema</li>
            <li> but I think its been helping more than anything.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> pleased</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body cream.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This one is much better.</li>
            <li> Love it and wished I would have started using it sooner.</li>
            <li> I love this cream as it provides moisture without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I can tell that my Rx ointment works better when used along with this as opposed to alone</li>
            <li> I love this cream,I used to have a lot of problems with my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a life saver! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Love their suntan lotion</li>
            <li> I think it is lovely.</li>
            <li> The texture is more of a sealant than a cream, in that it prevents moisture from escaping and keeps your skin from flaking off.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body lotion.  </li>
            <li> That must be someone who has not been shopping in a drugstore for many years.  </li>
            <li> Love Vanicream.</li>
            <li> We continue to use all three, with Vanicream getting the most use during the day, and more Aquaphor to seal in moisture during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> And shh, but I can buy it either on amazon or at Target, whichever is more convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure why that would be.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - it was recommended by my allergist when I started getting hives.  </li>
            <li> I have found no product that I like better for moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> and since it&#x27;s from Rochester, MN is even better.  </li>
            <li> There is a lot of information I want to share with you, but I want to mention this before I forget: sometimes amazon has a good price or some deal for vanicream, but I&#x27;ve found that dermadoctor usually has the best price.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly and does a great job moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> Walgreens and Wal-mart are both pretty good at it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, it&#x27;s non greasy and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> I would say this is a pretty good choice unless your eczema is severe</li>
            <li> It moisturizes the feet, ankles and toes and feels really wonderful all day long.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for dry itchy skin</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry itchy skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice lotion, not greasy, that blends in quickly.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream as  the best for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing we&#x27;ve found for dry skin in winter and eczema.</li>
            <li> but if you have very sensitive skin, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> She says that it is a great moisturizing cream for her very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is also a great moisturizer if you wash your hands a lot and works in to the skin and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is excellent if you have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> TOWEL OFF LIGHTLY, just the water that&#x27;s sitting on top of the skin.  </li>
            <li> Most lotions cause it to burn, even if they are free of perfumes and dyes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for babies or kids with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for real dry body parts.</li>
            <li> But great combination of not reddening sensitive skin, but also curing dryness.</li>
            <li> It is great for sensitive skin, I use this brand of sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li> Does leave you feeling greasy and works great on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> yes I am verry pleased with the results of my rash since I started using the vanicream , it works fantastic</li>
            <li> Thank heavens a good dermatologist, thank you Sarah, suggested Vani products to me and my whole life has changed.  </li>
            <li> Very mild and comforting.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t remove age spots or keep your skin from bruising easily, but it does restore moisture and improves the health of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts forever with the easy to use pump, and with the pump you don&#x27;t contaminate the cream by dipping your hand into it.  </li>
            <li> This cream has a nice and thick consistency that is not greasy and it absorbs wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I found a better price on Amazon and it was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> and it absorbs quick!</li>
            <li> also applies to tanning oils and lotions--which many of you may be using right now with summer in full swing--as well as the baby oil or lotion that many parents unwittingly slather on their babies.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It came in a nice large jar (1 lb) and was quite a bargain here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my and my little one&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can give this same review for Vanicream fragrance free soap as it is a great product too.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s in a huge container)</li>
            <li> We have tried every prescription and over the counter cream available.  </li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t contain harmful additives such as fragrances, parabems, or chemicals.  </li>
            <li> goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> and I was in search of a great daily moisturizer when I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s an important tip.</li>
            <li> I buy 2 or 3 tubs at a time to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li> Just thought I would check Amazon to see if it was available on line and voila</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly and with no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is free from color additives, scents, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost blemish free.</li>
            <li> this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I use cutemol on him which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is unbelievably cheap for the quality.</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic, non-greasy cream that is ultra moisturizing and healing.</li>
            <li> Only one comment about the packaging that&#x27;s not so great...</li>
            <li> Eczema free since I started using it.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy smearing vaseline on your hands then you may enjoy this lotion.</li>
            <li> Overall a great lotion</li>
            <li> I completely love this cream, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it in relation to my child&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I use it everywhere, including my incredibly sensitive lips, and nothing I&#x27;ve found it as good.  </li>
            <li> Vanicream is a good brand for moisturing cream, esp for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is a good brand for moisturing cream, esp for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For me, Aveeno does provide moisture a bit longer than Vanicream, but there isn&#x27;t a significant difference at all.  </li>
            <li> Experience was excellent as usual.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Irradiated mice who were treated with the moisturizers exhibited a significant increase in their rate of tumor formation and increase in tumor size per mouse.</li>
            <li> but it is worth the money and really good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Its a great quick fix for dry skin...</li>
            <li> We like the pump (no dipping hands and fingers into the jar, so no worries about getting bacteria in it, which is a plus with eczema and any skin that is more infection-prone) and it is much easier to clean up than Eucerin or Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This cream was made primarily for people with skin issues (for normal skin, the Lite Lotion is probably a better match).</li>
            <li> I found this at a better price, the supplier sent the product in ample time, thanks so much for having such a great product available for people like us.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist as a good daily moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I find it does as good a job as Curel, but has a richer feel and is priced about the same.  </li>
            <li> While it has a creamy texture, it is thick and provide excellent protection for the skin.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and no smell, just good basic lotion for the dryness of winter.</li>
            <li> , I am glad that I tried this and now subscribe it monthly for my whole family.</li>
            <li> I am VERY dissapointed that my dermatologist recommended this cream as SAFE</li>
            <li> Excellent cream for trouble spots that weren&#x27;t healed with anything else; no perfumey annoyances; large economical size; received very quickly .</li>
            <li> This is a very good product when you have had treatment for skin cancers on the face as it is very gentle and you do not have to have to worry about perfumes or fragrances that are in other products for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at maintaining the skin moist and does not have all the additional chemicals other brands have.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion- great if you or your kids have sensitive or itchy dry</li>
            <li> His doctors recommended vanicream to us, and we love all their products, particularly this cream and the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try to get the ones without pumps, but Amazon said they couldn&#x27;t guarantee I would get the right one, so they just gave me a couple dollars back, which was good.</li>
            <li> I never heard of it before and just picked it up at the local walgreen&#x27;s and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love that we can get replacements tubs of vanicream without having to buy the new pumps.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and once absorbed is not sticky.</li>
            <li> and I suffer from very sensitive skin; glad I switched.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it works ten times better than anything else and isn&#x27;t so oily!</li>
            <li> I use Vanicream after the Free and Clear cleanser, and I tell you what it&#x27;s the best combo for my dry skin that I&#x27;ve used so far!  </li>
            <li> Our daughter really likes how smoothly Vanicream glides on, and how quickly her skin absorbs it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to cover up with body spray, though, and most people probably wouldn&#x27;t even notice it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is super safe and does not have ingredients that will irritate truly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you buy over a certain dollar amount (which I always do) they give you free shipping.  </li>
            <li> She is very fair, blue eyed blonde.</li>
            <li> The combination of these two (which I&#x27;ve only been using for a week now) has been amazing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy without being greasy and works great.</li>
            <li> This cream really does go on smooth and does not cause allergic reactions.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, as well as dye and fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> This means limiting junk food and take out and adding in lots and lots of fresh fruits and vegetables.  </li>
            <li> When used daily, there is zero eczema, minimal itching and a very happy child.</li>
            <li> The wrinkle have mostly disappeared, and the skin looks far healthier.  </li>
            <li> Most of them are more expensive and not as good  </li>
            <li> Minimal ingredients, good consistency.  </li>
            <li> Only \\&quot;Dermasmooth\\&quot; really helps the skin during exceptional flare-ups, otherwise it&#x27;s managing your diet and your environment.  </li>
            <li> It does sting on his legs if we use it right after a bath, but otherwise has moisturized well.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin just right.</li>
            <li> This cream is just the right thickness and creaminess for my sons&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> (The basic ingredient is petrolatum, the same as in most highly-moisturizing creams--it acts as a nice barrier to keep moisture locked in.)  </li>
            <li> Very nice product or sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> It certainly works for me!</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with ezcema in junior high and have not had any significant problems since beginning to use Vanicream.  </li>
            <li> She liked it but after using it for 3 straight days, not only did I not see any improvements</li>
            <li> It becomes especially important in the winter when humidity drops to about 12% in our apartment, and even with multiple humidifiers going we can only get it up to about 32%.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt better, but also looked far better and more vital than any other product could produce.</li>
            <li> Right now, I&#x27;m using the Neosporin eczema essential and that seems to agree with him more.</li>
            <li> i purchased because of its good reviews hoping that it would calm my eczema, unfortunately, i found cetaphil to be more useful ;/</li>
            <li> and I thank Amazon for offering it at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> this is a huge irritant to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this huge jar because my dermatologist recommended I start using Vanicream products for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> You get no sleep, your aware of your skin all the time, you may be very self-conscious of your inflammations/wounds, while everyone else is sitting calmly, concentrating at work or in class, all you can think about is your skin, and so on.    </li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased to finally find the identical product here on Amazon at a dramatically discounted price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> First let me say that I am a label-reader: I read ingredients on everything from soup to nuts to skin creams.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist first recommended this cream for an eczema problem on my arm.  </li>
            <li> It soaks up fairly fast and works!</li>
            <li> My husband has tried many creams for his itchy rash that he has had for several years that no Dr. can identify or cure.  </li>
            <li> Truthfully, I&#x27;ve been getting tiny whiteheads here</li>
            <li> I have tried many, may creams and this is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li> Well, I would have rated it higher if it had arrived intact, however, when I opened the box, there was cream all through it.  </li>
            <li> I was able to save enough of the cream to use, about 1/4 of the jar to see if I would like it.  </li>
            <li> Once I got my first jar of Vanicream, I stopped looking elsewhere as this stuff is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, Vanicream Cream is a product that has a lot of value when most standard moisturizers do not work.</li>
            <li> However, if you put it on and stay in a hot environment, it will literally melt off your face.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by a dermatologist and it improved my skin to a better condition than anything else I have tried in over 30 years, to include topical and oral steroids.  </li>
            <li> You get a very generous amount so the price is well worth it.</li>
            <li> In fact I mix it equally with Aquaphor which I also get through Amazon and love them both.</li>
            <li> Many struggle to find a cure for this condition and we were blessed to break the eczema cycle on our daughter who itched constantly.  </li>
            <li> Not only is Vanicream affordable and great for dry skin, but my dermatologist is the one who introduced me to it.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and absorbs right into your skin.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product and have recommended it to other eczema sufferers.</li>
            <li> Lacks the creamy consistendy of other hand creams as is not quite as effective.</li>
            <li> Initially, I wasn&#x27;t using this cream on my daughter&#x27;s eczema frequently enough, so I didn&#x27;t think it was any good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different moisturizers over the years, and some very pricey.  </li>
            <li> Cost was very reasonable and the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I also bought Monkey Balm and that I found to be much better</li>
            <li> I think this is a good face cream, paticularly for those sensitive to perfumes and additives found in other creams.</li>
            <li> We then dressed her in wet pajamas soaked in warm water (ringed out) and put two layers of dried sweats on her to keep her warm.  </li>
            <li> Her skin had been extremely dry and cracked and is now becoming smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> After trying many low and ultra high priced moisturizers, I came across Vanicream during a routine doctor&#x27;s visit.</li>
            <li> I also bought California Baby Hair and Body Wash for Super Sensitive Skin.  </li>
            <li> This is an outstanding moisturizer often prescribed by physicians (which I am) for dry skin problems like eczema.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many body creams for winter dry skin without good or long lasting results.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s very true that Vanicream is a nice, non-irritating cream for sensitive skin, the list of ingredients is still made up of long-syllabled chemicals that are hard to pronounce.</li>
            <li> Buying a large container saves $$$$</li>
            <li> Finally, the product has a waxy texture that is great if you put it on within 3 minutes of exiting the shower and allow it to dry completely.  </li>
            <li> Based on reviews I thought this would be a good product for my dry, sensitive, mature skin.</li>
            <li> It has certainly worked very well.  </li>
            <li> We tend to stay away from creams that are perfumey or greasy, so when we don&#x27;t want to splurge financially on natural homeopathic creams with natural ingredients that are familiar and easy to pronounce, we always come back to Vanicream.</li>
            <li> These pots will last and last and the price is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I was given samples of this brand from an allergy specialist and it is really the only option I found for truly unscented, paraben free, hypoallergenic hygiene products.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;water cleans\\&quot; advice comes from a very helpul book called HEALING ECZEMA by Christina Nevada.  </li>
            <li> If you are really suffering from eczema, you must read this book.     </li>
            <li> I bought it since I believed it was only available at the doc.  </li>
            <li> I find the pump applicator very efficient and allows one to meter out the correct amount needed.</li>
            <li> I go straight to the ingredients and make my decision from there</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it is unscented.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> It is very pricey but work every penny.  </li>
            <li> This product has really helped in the week we&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> It holds in the moisture really well.</li>
            <li> My whole family now uses it.</li>
            <li> but I an very optimistic.</li>
            <li> After bathing we apply the cream onto the whole body of our child.</li>
            <li> Also we use this cream for the whole family after visiting pools with chlorinated water.</li>
            <li> Very creamy.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I have purchased a jar for a family member</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin though.  </li>
            <li> The cream works very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no longer available locally without a pump, and once you have a pump, you don&#x27;t need another.  </li>
            <li> Really keeps him moisturized.</li>
            <li> really is non-comedogenic (doesn&#x27;t clog pores) for those of us with combination skin.  </li>
            <li> If applied immediately after bathing to moist skin, it really clears all his eczema spots up in a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li> I put it on myself and my kids immediately after getting out of the bath or shower and it locks in moisture really well.  </li>
            <li> They really need to do something about the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my tots exzema and it helped so much.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so fast, obit it started clearing in a day or 2.</li>
            <li> Whole family uses this.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t clog pores (you can use on your face).  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is really improving their quality of life.</li>
            <li> The jar design they use is also very convenient.</li>
            <li> She told us to use it after every bath - coat the whole body, including face.</li>
            <li> so I ended up not using the whole thing</li>
            <li> It really helps.</li>
            <li> I have very severe eczema</li>
            <li> This product has really helped manage by 18mth olds eczema.  </li>
            <li> Vanicream can be very costly when you use as much as we do a year.</li>
            <li> Steriods were getting too much, nothing seemed to work</li>
            <li> Vanicream is the only face cream that I have been able to use near my eyes.  </li>
            <li> So if you have certain skin issues, chances are you will benefit from Vanicream more so than you will from other products.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick when first applied, and just takes a little while to absorb into the skin, but once it does, I think you will be very impressed.  </li>
            <li> The closest product I found is cetaphil, but Vanicream is much less greasy, absorbs quickly and (when applied lightly)</li>
            <li> My child has head to toe eczema and after trying so many other products to restore moisture</li>
            <li> I have tried Cetaphil, Eucerin, Aveeno, Aquaphor, Vaseline, and many other creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other product for my skin.  </li>
            <li> but this helped it most of the other times.</li>
            <li> Once we found out the hives were apparently not from allergies, he suggested I smooth this all over myself after every shower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a thicker weight cream that applies easily, does not clog pores, and works for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Keep your house as clean as possible.  </li>
            <li> This product is high quality ant a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> But this product is the best our family has found in this, our tenth year, of dealing with this very difficult skin disorder.  </li>
            <li> Prior to, I had used at least 100 different products because none worked super great for me.</li>
            <li> After trying many different products this is the only thing that works on my son&#x27;s eczema!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick so the moisture really lasts.</li>
            <li> This is a decent cream</li>
            <li> Amazon has a decent price on it too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive than many lotions you find at the store</li>
            <li> Soak in the bathtub (or hands if that is only area affected) in as hot as water as tolerable for exactly 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This cream felt very sticky on my skin and also had a strange, kind of bitter smell.  </li>
            <li> Keri lotion works better, but does not last as long and is much greaser than this Vanicream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Vanicream.</li>
            <li> If you have problems with your skin, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried almost every bath, soap, lotion, and cream for sensitive and dry skin and this is by far my favorite non prescription product.</li>
            <li> It is pain free to apply to very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying a little more so that my skin can feel moist.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it costs a little bit more than grocery store convenience lotions</li>
            <li> Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Original Moisturizing Creme, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]],</li>
            <li> It is hard to find products for sensitive skin which are also fragrance free, and that&#x27;s important for us, as my son gets hives from anything with fragrance.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it and it works very well for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My son has been batteling ecezma &amp; the only thing that would calm it</li>
            <li> So far, it has really helped them to not break out.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the extra costs.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin</li>
            <li> Vanicream returned her skin to normal, though I myself don&#x27;t know what she was suffering from...</li>
            <li> but they can be messy to apply at daycare/school, and feel a bit more tacky on the skin.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product for any of you who have young children suffering from very dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> The cream sits on top of my skin, no absorption, thus red and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Do not dry off, and on the hot spots, we dabbed a 1% steroid ointment---might have been elecon, but I can&#x27;t remember.  </li>
            <li> Being thicker, it takes a little while to work it in, but you ultimately save time given most other products will require significantly more reapplications than the Vanicream cream.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to eczema, bless you.  </li>
            <li> In reality, those who live with it know that it can consume your life.  </li>
            <li> This will be my new skin cream now.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and so do my kids and new baby.  </li>
            <li> Obviously it doesn&#x27;t cure the eczema, but it certainly keeps my skin moist and my itching at a minimum!</li>
            <li> We have both been using Vanicream for several years, after hand-washing throughout the day, but first and foremost right when we step from the shower, covering the entire body.  </li>
            <li> My one year old has had a bad case of ezema over the winter months and this is the best thing I have found for keeping it in check.</li>
            <li> We have taken my son to at least 10 dermatologists who mostly seemed to have a very lackadaisical attitude toward eczema.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;The results indicate that several commercially available moisturizing creams increase the rate of formation and number of tumors when applied topically to UVB-pretreated high-risk mice.</li>
            <li> My husband has dermatological skin issues as well, and we both have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have an issue with this because of what this does for my skin (and I have very sensitive skin:</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to everything.</li>
            <li> After using Vanicream for about 3 weeks, my face was completely clear and the itching was gone...forever!</li>
            <li> After using this for a couple weeks it is completely gone!</li>
            <li> If you have eczema, then you have to use this product pretty regularly to see any results.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s non-steroid and kid friendly, I tried it on my daughter too and her eczema patches were gone in just a couple days, after weeks of trying other products unsuccessfully.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to perfumes and chemicals normally found in moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;A study has found that topical applications of moisturizers such as Dermabase, Dermovan, Eucerin Original Moisturizing Cream, or Vanicream could increase skin cancer risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel extremely soft !</li>
            <li> Cured my sensitive super dry skin immediately.</li>
            <li> My uncle has developed eczema in his mid-60s and has been self-conscious about his newly imperfect skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong moisturizer capable of helping your skin when most other products have failed to yield much or any improvement.</li>
            <li> but nothing compared to what I normally have, and actually, I&#x27;ve been using Proactive and the Clinique Acne Kit for quite sometime which never cleared up  my skin as much as it is now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it or Curel for very dry skin or dry regions; they are my two favorite face creams.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to chemicals, fragrances, and have lots of allergies to even natural products.</li>
            <li> The pump is probably a good idea, when the lid isn&#x27;t sealed tight it get&#x27;s a little goopy</li>
            <li> No heavy scent, goes on smooth and absorbs quickly- not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my grandson who had a dry itchy rash on his legs, it cleared it right up.</li>
            <li> It feels silky smooth on my hands and helps me overcome the tendency toward dryness and cracking skin.&lt;br /&gt;There is little fragrance and it does not bother my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works extremely well, has no odor, has no additives/allergens, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Tubes are so hard to empty and who can afford to waste this great cream!</li>
            <li> Dr.. prescribled...keeps skin moist and soft</li>
            <li> it helps it completely go away</li>
            <li> I have a 10 1/2 month old baby at home who has suffered from Exzema from month three.  </li>
            <li> It has no smell at all, and has caused no irritation or reactions in our sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> old every evening and douse him with vanicream afterward as per our allergist recommendation.  </li>
            <li> It a a terrific moisturizer for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> We use Vanicream twice a day, everyday, and it keeps her skin hydrated and eczema free.</li>
            <li> Used this on my 2yo, who has developed eczema.  </li>
            <li> he has exczema and sun sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am ready to do a vanicream commercial.</li>
            <li> This is also the least-irritating face cream I&#x27;ve ever used on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li> Try vanicream if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My two year old has it too.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as absorbent as some, but it is completely non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended this to me for use with my 2 year old who has eczema.</li>
            <li> We have used it for years and now with a 2 year old with eczema, we have it as a staple in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I occasionally get eczema breakouts and this lotion really helps keep it in check.</li>
            <li> After reading lots of reviews, I got Vanicream for my child with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We have been battling with our 5 year old daughter&#x27;s eczema for years now.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to also use on her face.</li>
            <li> We use this on my Grandson who is 2 weeks old to my husband who is 60.</li>
            <li> Under those conditions we need to apply this at least once a day, twice is much better.</li>
            <li> They work well on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Research shows that a genetic flaw seems to be responsible for skin that doesn&#x27;t hold enough moisture, which can lead to skin problems.</li>
            <li> Looking for a replacemnt to my old lotion moisterel, this was ok but did not keep my skin moist  enough, it still dried out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, which I love.  </li>
            <li> The texture is really thick which I thought for sure was going break me out</li>
            <li> Vanicream was first recommended to us by my husband&#x27;s dermatologist for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It worked okay the first couple of times I used it, but like everything else, was useless afterwards.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a little bit, so I believe it will last quite a while, and the price was outstanding for this quality of product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much -- I use a whole lot less than with Eucerin, for example.     </li>
            <li> I now use it on my clients at the spa where I am employed and highly recommend it to anyone who needs to effectively restore dry or unhealthy skin.</li>
            <li> and my daughter has a little mild eczema too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than regular skin lotion (thus the reason they call it skin cream) and its fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Most creams and lip balms have fragrances, and then there are some she told me labeled as fragrance free that will have a masking fragrance in them, which are just as bad.  </li>
            <li> Two days ago, my elbows were rough and peeling, and in less than 48 hours, the peeling has disappeared and I&#x27;m left with nothing but soft and healthy skin.  </li>
            <li> When we do use it, it really helps to keep dry skin issues at bay.</li>
            <li> Also, the size of this container is really too big for travel, so get the smaller size.  </li>
            <li> Pat skin with towel but do not dry completely.</li>
            <li> A quick bath/shower with a soft cloth is all that&#x27;s usually needed for eczema skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t actually heal they area as far as I can tell like straight vaseline might do, but it does take away the dry burnt stingy feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for almost a year now and while I think it does an pretty decent job for treating and covering my really dry skin, I use it in conjunction with 2 other lotions as well.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased to find it at less than half the price they were asking.  </li>
            <li> Daily to twice daily use keeps skin soft and smooth, making atopic dermatitis breakouts much less likely.</li>
            <li> Most other creams work fine, too, but some are too thin to last very long.</li>
            <li> We live in a super dry climate and my little one gets eczema because of this.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s probably too heavy for use on a younger face, but it&#x27;s great at night, tough elbows/knees, and neck and chest areas</li>
            <li> My first reason for writing this review is to assure you that any bad reviews of this product are from (probably) nice, but uneducated-in-eczema individuals.  </li>
            <li> I generally use Aveeno, but decided to try Vanicream with the hope that it would become a staple lotion for me.  </li>
            <li> Here is a general treatment summary.  </li>
            <li> so glad she did, now my skin is silky smooth and hypoallergenic - try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> For me, compassion is only second to \\&quot;really knowing your stuff\\&quot; in the medical profession.  </li>
            <li> My five year old son has suffered with eczema his entire life.  </li>
            <li> especially if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, it&#x27;s free of whatever you might worry about, it&#x27;s been recommended to be by two doctors, it goes on creamy and absorbs well and stays on tenaciously.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t eat fresh strawberries unless their organic (due to pesticides) and limit acidic foods such as oranges as they actually change your body&#x27;s chem. balance.  </li>
            <li> Rarely will you find a pharmacy that keeps it in-stock because it can&#x27;t sit on the shelf long, due to having no preservatives.  </li>
            <li> I am used to a very humid environment and have recently moved to a very dry climate, and my skin has not reacted well.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and Vanicream is the only product that really works for me.  </li>
            <li> Also, compare the price of this with other moisturizers, Vanicream is a real bargain.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptic as all the other moisturizers flared up my kid&#x27;s eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> live in a dry</li>
            <li> I recommend it to all new parents and anyone with eczema and really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new lotion product that would help my sometimes dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having extremely dry facial skin lately which nothing has been able to combat.</li>
            <li> The back of my hands, for example, looked like they belonged to a 90-year old, but I am only 70.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is thick and is the only thing that was able to help my dry skin and when used in conjunction with organic coconut oil it does wonders.</li>
            <li> Luckily the order had only this cream and a small set of glass stains,(wrapped in plastic)  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my extremely dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t dry, feels soft, and my eyes are happy!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This is thick, but soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely sensitive, dry skin with red bumps and a \\&quot;rash.\\</li>
            <li> I have eczema and very dry sensitive skin (not helped by living at altitude in an arid climate).</li>
            <li> Really helps babies with very dry rough skin.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and it does get absorbed into his skin eventually.</li>
            <li> Wet your hands with warm water before using it and slather it around in a very thin layer.</li>
            <li> Other moisturizers often cause my sensitive skin to react with stinging and/or redness.  </li>
            <li> If what you need is unscented, hypoallergenic soap/shampoo/conditioner due to sensitive skin or an allergy, this is it.</li>
            <li> I had one from a previous purchase, so transferred it to the new container.  </li>
            <li> I find the tub to last quite a long time too</li>
            <li> It works well on the face because its formulation is made not to clog pores and not flare acne, facial blemishes, minor injuries, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pretty thick</li>
            <li> Since starting with this product, I have had little issues and lots of soft skin...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I only have two very minor complaints.</li>
            <li> Several members of our family have winter dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> With that said, this is the only winter I can remember where I never had any dry skin problems</li>
            <li> Typically, I&#x27;m oily and acne prone, so adding dryness to it was completely wreaking havoc on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this moisturizer to anyone who has been struggling with dry, ashy skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick that it really holds in the moisture, and keeps us from constantly itching.</li>
            <li> If you only use it on your face, a little goes a long way; I used the same container for 9 months and only used a third of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when the allergist gave us a free sample for my teen who uses acne creams that dry out her face.</li>
            <li> And if you are old like me, you want to add a little frill every once in a while.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and have had a condition on my hands for years where they are dry, red, rashly and sore.</li>
            <li> For extra dry skin in the winter I recommend supplementing vanicream with pure grapeseed oil - seriously, it sounds strange but</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and am constantly told I look at least 10 years younger</li>
            <li> My son has had small eczema patches here and there on his body since he was born and his skin was sensitive overall.</li>
            <li> You have a long road ahead.  </li>
            <li> You DO want to get water in the skin, but don&#x27;t stay in the water so long that it washes out any moisture that may be there.  </li>
            <li> Non greasy, cooling and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it actually healed my rough patches and</li>
            <li> My dermatologist actually prescribed it (it&#x27;s stocked at some military pharmacies)</li>
            <li> The jar has lasted me quite a long time, but planning to buy again.</li>
            <li> my doc recommended because I was having trouble with my old moisturizer</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick, but absorbs really well, and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At nighttime, we tried to have her sleep in the wet clothes as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> It is a gentle, but thick cream that I can use on my face and body.  </li>
            <li> A very helpful website (including educating your child&#x27;s school on how difficult it is to live with eczema)</li>
            <li> I have severe dry skin and nothing seemed to help for long.  </li>
            <li> It helps some by preventing my dry heals from getting any drier and hurt, but it does not completely alleviate the dry heels.  </li>
            <li> lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s dermatologist recommended he use Vanicream Skin Cream for dry patches on his legs</li>
            <li> I also use it on dry spots.  </li>
            <li> And, if you&#x27;re buying vanicream for dry skin, you&#x27;ll want to keep this in stock anyway.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> but the vanicream has prevented excess dry skin by trapping the moisture in.  </li>
            <li> It is dry, cracked, and flaky.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and eczema</li>
            <li> If u have dry skin this will help.</li>
            <li> I already have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you know of someone with eczema or dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Until about 15 years ago when a dermatologist advised me to use Vanicream, my face was so dry in the winter, that no matter how well I moisturized at night</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and need to moisturize my face morning and night.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I still have a stubborn dry spot on my forehead but nothing compared to what it was before.</li>
            <li> I struggle with severe dry skin on my face in the winter.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a physician recommended it to my daughter for her child&#x27;s dry skin.  </li>
            <li> eczema, dry skin and breakouts).</li>
            <li> but it works wonders and she no longer has that scaly feeling or dry marks all over her skin.</li>
            <li> TOday she is 15 and just has dry skin at times.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, because I have tried at least a dozen different</li>
            <li> I live in the east coast so the 2013-2014 winter has been pretty fricken crazy.  </li>
            <li> It can be purchased in some stores but it is not easy to find and it is more expensive.</li>
            <li> However, my eyes usually react (allergic) to creams that I use near them.  </li>
            <li> It does provide relief for dry skin!</li>
            <li> I also have hyper-pigmentation---this cream is healing my dry skin &amp; has lightened my hyper-pigmentation!</li>
            <li> Our special needs little guy has very dry skin on the inside of his hands, the winter months are awful and we use the Vanicream to soften the skin up 6 or more times a day.</li>
            <li> , I saw dry patches, little red bumps all over my kids&#x27; bodies.</li>
            <li> My hands are very dry and</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me due to my chronically dry skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is free of artificial scent and color.  </li>
            <li> It is especially helpful to the feet and after exposure to harsh sun.</li>
            <li> It is one of the only lotions I can use all year round.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a cure-all; I still use it in combination with derma-smoothe and triamcinolone for eczema trouble, but it definitely helps prevent eczema by keeping skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist who covered my back in these allergy circle patch thingys to wear for a few days, and she told me she knew I would be allergic to fragrances.  </li>
            <li> My mom suffered from some curious blood condition that compromised her immune system.  </li>
            <li> With these simple changes our son has less rashes and is a happier baby for it!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, I bought 2 containers but now know those will probably last me a few months.  </li>
            <li> The second small complaint I have is that even though it isn&#x27;t supposed to have a fragrance, it does have a slight odor that I don&#x27;t particularly care for.</li>
            <li> I thank Vanicream for this, as all the other women in my family have wrinkled badly and pretty early.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> We found that other lotions that were doctor recommended clogged his pores and made him break out into a heat rash.  </li>
            <li> We bathe our son every other night and lather him in it.  </li>
            <li> So, he has rashes due to chilli weather and dryness.</li>
            <li> (my face use to react to other lotions I tried).</li>
            <li> Soak in a bath (not hot) or shower for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> #34;Steriods is the answer and &amp;#34;It is a tough disease that she will have to live with&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Put it on after a morning shower while the area is still very wet.</li>
            <li> Just know that eczema is affecting your child on an emotional level and have compassion over their lack of sleep and inability to concentrate (both of which gets them in trouble at school sometimes), as well as the irritability that they feel but can&#x27;t explain, which gets them in trouble with you.  </li>
            <li> Per my dermatologist, I apply to my face prior to applying my makeup base, it makes my makeup go on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> Also, my husband, who had poor circulation and paper thin skin on his lower legs, used this after trying many other brands over the years with no good results, and it has been the only product that restored elasticity and moisture to his skin making it healthier and less prone to injury.</li>
            <li> Also, for those who have said it&#x27;s a bit too thick, try applying it right after showering - it locks in moisture and a the water helps thin it</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my skin hydrated and it burns less than other brands that claim to be hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, we did much research and came upon Vanicream.  </li>
            <li> It usually saves us a few cents and helps keep extra plastic out of landfills.</li>
            <li> so you need your beauty bath at least daily followed by an application.  </li>
            <li> We use it at least 3 times daily.</li>
            <li> This product is thick enough yet goes on and soaks in your skin.</li>
            <li> so I even water it down to a 60cream/40 water mix and still plenty moisturizing for me.</li>
            <li> Due to the amount I use the product, I don&#x27;t like the pump since it&#x27;s easier and less messy for me to use the lid.  </li>
            <li> Vanicream has helped both in soothing his itching and helping to [slightly] fade the marks on his skin.</li>
            <li> From water to toweling to Vanicream should be less than three minutes.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had previously reviewed the products thanking the maker for saving my life.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and a lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you put this cream on dry skin it will be hard to spread and will not work as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and soothing to dry eczema-prone skin without burning, itching, or clogging pores.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this really thick lotion will cure my dry cracking heels.  </li>
            <li> The texture is a little gummy, so need to massage in skin for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> It also does not sting if I get a little in my eyes and has no taste, so i even use it around my mouth and lips.</li>
            <li> I have bought others that say no smell but had a little bit.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy for the summer, but could still be used.</li>
            <li> We have serious dry skin and eczema issues at our house and this lotion works.  </li>
            <li> When you factor in wind and harsh swimming pool chemicals, it looks and feels like her face is sunburned.  </li>
            <li> There are still the exzema trouble spots that we have to treat with a prescription</li>
            <li> I have diabetes and use cream on the tops of my feet and on my ankles and legs to stop skin from the itching caused by poor circulation and the extremely low Colorado humidity.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vanicream for a few years now.</li>
            <li> but leaves a tacky feeling which my son disliked, and did nothing to alleviate his itchy skin, so we stopped using it all together.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face in the winter as is but, in the warmer months I add a few drops of water to the product in my hand and apply on the face.</li>
            <li> After snowboarding, my skin cracked and dried up to the point where it got flaky.</li>
            <li> so I recommend this to people with REALLY REALLY dried skin.</li>
            <li> After awhile, I didn&#x27;t have too dried skin</li>
            <li> The cream is a bit heavy for my kids (twenty somethings)</li>
            <li> This product contains no fragrances, dyes, or harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I tried the soap too which really dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> This has a sweaty, heavy feeling on the skin and felt like I was smearing vaseline on it.</li>
            <li> to the study, as reported by Green Med Info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not at the same time, but some days ill use this and other days</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any different results than any other brand I have tried and it was expensive</li>
            <li> and we went to Cleveland Clinic, and at least 10 other doctors and all we heard was &amp;</li>
            <li> The results after using this stuff are nothing short of dramatic.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, cracked skin &amp; it gets worse in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Eucerin, but it was not helping it, so I looked online and found Vanicream.  </li>
            <li> This cream is thick and fairly heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, EVERYthing out there for eczema for the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Even though this does have petroleum products which I usually avoid, I have had no problems with this cream.</li>
            <li> I initially thought it was one of those vaporous products they sell to women, but I was proven wrong.  </li>
            <li> Got a small sample tube, tried it out on my face, and oh my goodness does it work.</li>
            <li> because I had no fragrance or slick feel.</li>
            <li> I feel that the other products were probably irritating my skin to the point that they&#x27;d create acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to come by</li>
            <li> I bought this for my five month old&#x27;s really bad eczema.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really not that expensive.</li>
            <li> was a steriod cream which I do not like using on his delicate skin.</li>
            <li> on her face and my older daughter has horrible itchy dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that one of the reviews complained about the price.  </li>
            <li> She has eczema and suffers from hives and rashes and this is the only product that we have found that does not burn her skin.</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> This is a thick, creamy lotion</li>
            <li> Goes on feeling somewhat thick</li>
            <li> Then apply a thick, unscented cream like Vanicream to seal in moisture.</li>
            <li> and when I&#x27;m done, use them on the less expensive ones without pumps.  </li>
            <li> I seriously don&#x27;t see myself using anything else besides this.</li>
            <li> Haven’t had a serious break out since I started using it</li>
            <li> even in the cold, dry wintertime!</li>
            <li> We learned from a local school counselor whose son had eczema bad.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but it also doesn&#x27;t feel thin and watery.</li>
            <li> After Vanicream use, I found the difference to be dramatic.</li>
            <li> Within 24 hours of using it, I noticed a dramatic improvement in the eczema, and in 48 hours it was gone.  </li>
            <li> it has made a dramatic difference in my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and have noticed dramatic improvement.  </li>
            <li> just keeps things stabilized which can be difficult to do with dry weather and base issues.</li>
            <li> Use as a base for layering other products for moisturized winter skin.</li>
            <li> It helped me get through the brutal winter as my skin starts cracking when it gets dry.</li>
            <li> Never having had it themselves, they must imagine it to be just an annoying little condition.      </li>
            <li> ill use something else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so expensive that when I see a deal, I buy a bunch.  </li>
            <li> Useless in winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, including expensive concoctions of shea butter</li>
            <li> I have really bad eczema and psoriasis.</li>
            <li> skin doesn&#x27;t hate me anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i hate oily lotions that take a while to soak into your skin.</li>

            <li> Soda/pop/cola/soft-drink is HORRIBLE for people with eczema.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My uncle has developed eczema in his mid-60s and has been self-conscious about his newly imperfect skin. Vanicream has helped both in soothing his itching and helping to [slightly] fade the marks on his skin.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s dermatologist recommended he use Vanicream Skin Cream for dry patches on his legs and he&#x27;s been using it for years.  I also use it on dry spots.  It works extremely well, has no odor, has no additives/allergens, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Works for more than excema. I was skeptical when the allergist gave us a free sample for my teen who uses acne creams that dry out her face. When you factor in wind and harsh swimming pool chemicals, it looks and feels like her face is sunburned.  She&#x27;s tried the dermatologi$$$t recommended creams and they sting and swell the area.  This cream does not.  It is pain free to apply to very dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t actually heal they area as far as I can tell like straight vaseline might do, but it does take away the dry burnt stingy feeling.</li>
            <li> Nice price and good service</li>
            <li> The product name obviously had a lot of thought put into it.  The creators basically took two unrelated things, and made them into one.  Vani, coming from Vanil Noir is a mountain of the Fribourg Prealps, located on the border between the cantons of Fribourg and Vaud in western Switzerland. With a height of 2,389 metres above sea level, the Vanil Noir is the highest summit of the canton of Fribourg and of the range lying north of the Saanenmöser Pass...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and cream!  as soon as this cream touched my babys face, I could almost smell the Shire!</li>
            <li> I completely love this cream, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it in relation to my child&#x27;s skin. My child has head to toe eczema and after trying so many other products to restore moisture this is the only product that&#x27;s compatible.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to eczema, bless you.  You have a long road ahead.  For most people, it does not go away.  But this product is the best our family has found in this, our tenth year, of dealing with this very difficult skin disorder.  My first reason for writing this review is to assure you that any bad reviews of this product are from (probably) nice, but uneducated-in-eczema individuals.  There is no miracle product out there -- that we&#x27;ve found -- that makes eczema disappear.  Some people have found products that keeps their eczema under control, but that is not what Vanicream is for.      Vanicream is called a moisturizing skin cream.  But with eczema, the key is to put moisture in the skin and trap it there.  That&#x27;s where vanicream comes in.  I absolutely love this product.  But don&#x27;t expect it to cure eczema.    The day someone finds a cure for eczema, and one that works for everyone, it will be all over the news.  I assure you.  For now, too many pharmaceutical companies are making money off of it&#x27;s \\&quot;treatment,\\&quot; so I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath if I were you.    There is a lot of information I want to share with you, but I want to mention this before I forget: sometimes amazon has a good price or some deal for vanicream, but I&#x27;ve found that dermadoctor usually has the best price.  If you buy over a certain dollar amount (which I always do) they give you free shipping.  That&#x27;s sometimes 1/3 of the price of the product.  And, if you&#x27;re buying vanicream for dry skin, you&#x27;ll want to keep this in stock anyway.  So go ahead and buy several at a time.    Use Vanicream 1 - 3 minutes after exiting a VERY brief bath/shower.  You do not have to use soap except in \\&quot;certain\\&quot; areas.  And for that, use Vanicream&#x27;s soap.  You DO want to get water in the skin, but don&#x27;t stay in the water so long that it washes out any moisture that may be there.  One of the best pieces of advice I read in all of the eczema research I did is this: Water cleans.  And it does.  So don&#x27;t think you haveto use soap or scrubbing.  A quick bath/shower with a soft cloth is all that&#x27;s usually needed for eczema skin.  TOWEL OFF LIGHTLY, just the water that&#x27;s sitting on top of the skin.  IMMEDIATELY put on the Vanicream.  From water to toweling to Vanicream should be less than three minutes.  This is crucial.    The \\&quot;water cleans\\&quot; advice comes from a very helpul book called HEALING ECZEMA by Christina Nevada.  If you are really suffering from eczema, you must read this book.     A very helpful website (including educating your child&#x27;s school on how difficult it is to live with eczema) [...]    We have taken my son to at least 10 dermatologists who mostly seemed to have a very lackadaisical attitude toward eczema.  Never having had it themselves, they must imagine it to be just an annoying little condition.      In reality, those who live with it know that it can consume your life.  You get no sleep, your aware of your skin all the time, you may be very self-conscious of your inflammations/wounds, while everyone else is sitting calmly, concentrating at work or in class, all you can think about is your skin, and so on.    We finally did find a doctor that has compassion. For me, compassion is only second to \\&quot;really knowing your stuff\\&quot; in the medical profession.  Dr. Crotty didn&#x27;t prescribe a lot of meds, but even the ones he prescribed we&#x27;ve mostly stopped using. Only \\&quot;Dermasmooth\\&quot; really helps the skin during exceptional flare-ups, otherwise it&#x27;s managing your diet and your environment.  We have also found it helpful to take an antihistamine to control the itching.  But no prescription is needed for that. We just use Benadryl.    Make your world mostly scentless (no perfumes, candles, etc).  Keep your house as clean as possible.  Change a/c filters often.  Eat more healthy oils, like putting olive oil on salads.  Eat VERY healthy.  This means limiting junk food and take out and adding in lots and lots of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Don&#x27;t eat fresh strawberries unless their organic (due to pesticides) and limit acidic foods such as oranges as they actually change your body&#x27;s chem. balance.  Soda/pop/cola/soft-drink is HORRIBLE for people with eczema.  A book called \\&quot;The Acid Alkaline Food Guide\\&quot; by Dr. Susan E. Brown explains why.    But the number one thing I have found to be helpful in dealing with this condition is God.  Whether you believe in Him or not is not the issue.  I&#x27;m just telling you what has worked for our family.    Lastly, to parents of eczema sufferers:    Just know that eczema is affecting your child on an emotional level and have compassion over their lack of sleep and inability to concentrate (both of which gets them in trouble at school sometimes), as well as the irritability that they feel but can&#x27;t explain, which gets them in trouble with you.  Be patient with them.    And be patient with yourself.  Realize that this is affecting you too.  But know that you and your child are in this together.  Research, read, learn, and grow through this experience together.      P.S. Stay out of the sun whenever possible. And when you are in the sun, wear sensitive-skin sunscreen.  Vanicream makes one of those too.</li>
            <li> In Arizona, skin moisture dehydration/desiccation is problem #1. Locals who don&#x27;t moisturize in the 6% relative humidity, all resemble reptiles.  After trying many low and ultra high priced moisturizers, I came across Vanicream during a routine doctor&#x27;s visit. After Vanicream use, I found the difference to be dramatic. My skin felt better, but also looked far better and more vital than any other product could produce. My local derm doctor sold Vanicream in his office for premium dollars. I bought it since I believed it was only available at the doc.  I was extremely pleased to finally find the identical product here on Amazon at a dramatically discounted price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase it with or without the pump. I find the pump applicator very efficient and allows one to meter out the correct amount needed. I highly recommend Vanicream.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I am a label-reader: I read ingredients on everything from soup to nuts to skin creams. I never buy a product because of the package design or the celebrity that is marketing it. I go straight to the ingredients and make my decision from there (for all the Aquaphor-users out there, read the label - it&#x27;s Vaseline).    While it&#x27;s very true that Vanicream is a nice, non-irritating cream for sensitive skin, the list of ingredients is still made up of long-syllabled chemicals that are hard to pronounce. This doesn&#x27;t sit well with me, but my daughter&#x27;s dermatologist recommended it so that&#x27;s why I purchased this product. Vanicream looks, feels, and smells (there is no smell) just like Cetaphil cream. In fact, we alternate between the two depending which is on sale at the time. We tend to stay away from creams that are perfumey or greasy, so when we don&#x27;t want to splurge financially on natural homeopathic creams with natural ingredients that are familiar and easy to pronounce, we always come back to Vanicream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two years.  My dermatologist recommended it and it works very well for my sensitive skin.  I really like the fact that it is unscented.</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely sensitive, dry skin with red bumps and a \\&quot;rash.\\&quot;  She&#x27;s been diagnosed with keratosis pilaris, which is kind of like eczema.  We have tried every prescription and over the counter cream available.  The only thing that ever worked well was Aquaphor, but she doesn&#x27;t like the greasy feel and has started to refuse to have it applied.  After some research, I tried Vanicream.  I also bought California Baby Hair and Body Wash for Super Sensitive Skin.  The combination of these two (which I&#x27;ve only been using for a week now) has been amazing.  Her legs feel smoother and softer than they have since she was a baby -- literally.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Its a great quick fix for dry skin...the cream is a bit thicker than normal moisturizers but it works great!</li>
            <li> Dr.. prescribled...keeps skin moist and soft</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding moisturizer often prescribed by physicians (which I am) for dry skin problems like eczema. It does not produce acne and is terrific to use after showering. Also has no smell. Terrific.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from SEVERE eczema on my hands for many years. I have tried Cetaphil, Eucerin, Aveeno, Aquaphor, Vaseline, and many other creams and lotions. This is by far the best one. The cream works perfectly when you put it on right after a shower or after you wash your hands because it keeps that moisture in. It&#x27;s not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t just stay on the surface of your skin. Obviously it doesn&#x27;t cure the eczema, but it certainly keeps my skin moist and my itching at a minimum! This is now my daily moisturizer for my body AND my face. I love it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist first recommended this cream for an eczema problem on my arm.  It is also a great moisturizer if you wash your hands a lot and works in to the skin and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, who has dry skin. It works! He no longer has itching rashes!</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and finally found a lotion that definitely helps- he had it in the creases of his arms and legs and it helps it completely go away and we have tried a lot of lotions .</li>
            <li> Recommended by my doctor, I was allergic to everything you can buy for creams except for this.  It is definitely worth the extra costs.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t contain harmful additives such as fragrances, parabems, or chemicals.  It is very soothing and absorbs right into your skin.  It helps to heal damaged skin.  Reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> My daughter with eczema uses this, and flare ups occur if we forget to use it every day.  We love it!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and this moisturizer is applied before I go to bed and it replenishes the skin.  It is especially helpful to the feet and after exposure to harsh sun.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry itchy skin</li>
            <li> I have a 10 1/2 month old baby at home who has suffered from Exzema from month three.  We found that other lotions that were doctor recommended clogged his pores and made him break out into a heat rash.  The Vanicream was recommended by a friend and a pharmacist.  It is very pricey but work every penny.  We bathe our son every other night and lather him in it.  There are still the exzema trouble spots that we have to treat with a prescription but the vanicream has prevented excess dry skin by trapping the moisture in.  Another word of advice... if you have well water and use rust remover salt this is a huge irritant to sensitive skin.  A pharmacist recommended mixing the rust remover salt and regular salt together.  With these simple changes our son has less rashes and is a happier baby for it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that was recommended by&lt;br /&gt;my dermotologist so you know it is a worthwhile product.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product!</li>
            <li> very amazing cream. lasts a very long time. goes on smooth. does not leave face feeling greasy. i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream for trouble spots that weren&#x27;t healed with anything else; no perfumey annoyances; large economical size; received very quickly .</li>
            <li> Does what it says it is going to do. i had some dermatitis on my elbow. After using this for a couple weeks it is completely gone! yay.</li>
            <li> This product was prescribed to me by my dermatologist and its excellent, emollient without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I have skin problems and so does my husband. I am used to a very humid environment and have recently moved to a very dry climate, and my skin has not reacted well. It is dry, cracked, and flaky. My husband has dermatological skin issues as well, and we both have very sensitive skin. This product has really helped in the week we&#x27;ve used it. Problem spots like elbows and feet have been made much better by the use of this product. It has no smell at all, and has caused no irritation or reactions in our sensitive skin. It absorbs very quickly, does not leave any kind of greasy residue like some lotions, and has a very nice consistancy to it. If you have problems with your skin, I would highly recommend this product. You only have to use a little bit, so I believe it will last quite a while, and the price was outstanding for this quality of product.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and I was in search of a great daily moisturizer when I purchased this product.  This cream felt very sticky on my skin and also had a strange, kind of bitter smell.  It did moisturize well, though.  I ended up exchanging this for the Cetaphil cream, which I love!!</li>
            <li> Great staple in the battle against baby eczema.  We bathe our 11 mo. old every evening and douse him with vanicream afterward as per our allergist recommendation.  Great product.  We just love it.</li>
            <li> We live in a super dry climate and my little one gets eczema because of this. When used daily, there is zero eczema, minimal itching and a very happy child. It is thick and a lot goes a long way. It soaks up fairly fast and works!</li>
            <li> If you have eczema, then you have to use this product pretty regularly to see any results.</li>
            <li> I had terrible ezcema until discovering this product. I tried everything under the sun growing up (including oatmeal baths and saltwater baths). I was diagnosed with ezcema in junior high and have not had any significant problems since beginning to use Vanicream.  The easiest way to get it is to order it through your local pharmacy (unless you want to pay shipping). Walgreens and Wal-mart are both pretty good at it. Rarely will you find a pharmacy that keeps it in-stock because it can&#x27;t sit on the shelf long, due to having no preservatives.  I strongly recommend this product for any of you who have young children suffering from very dry, irritated skin. Stick them in a lukewarm bath (or preferably a shower) for maybe 10 minutes and then \\&quot;grease\\&quot; them up with vanicream. It holds in the moisture really well.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. No heavy scent, goes on smooth and absorbs quickly- not greasy at all. It is one of the only lotions I can use all year round. The pump version is nice to leave in a static location, but I prefer the screw lid since I can travel with it easily.</li>
            <li> I have eczema every winter.  I got it on my face this year, GREAT! I usually use Eucerin, but it was not helping it, so I looked online and found Vanicream.  Within 24 hours of using it, I noticed a dramatic improvement in the eczema, and in 48 hours it was gone.  This will be my new skin cream now.</li>
            <li> I use Vanicream after the Free and Clear cleanser, and I tell you what it&#x27;s the best combo for my dry skin that I&#x27;ve used so far!  This cream has a nice and thick consistency that is not greasy and it absorbs wonderfully! I will get more of this for sure!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s pediatrician recommended this for my grandson.  Thank goodness!!!  I have suffered with excema for years, and this is the only product I can use.  My whole family now uses it.</li>
            <li> Simply the best cream moisturizer I have used.  Use as a base for layering other products for moisturized winter skin.</li>
            <li> I was told by our dermatologist that Vanicream is the best moisturizer for us as it does not have preservatives like formaldehye etc that can cause severe skin reactions.  It a a terrific moisturizer for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive so this is a wonderful moisturizer for me.  It is absorbed quickly and does a great job moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product for exima(sp)with good results. It has only been two weeks but I an very optimistic.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and it meets my needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for almost a year now and while I think it does an pretty decent job for treating and covering my really dry skin, I use it in conjunction with 2 other lotions as well. not at the same time, but some days ill use this and other days ill use something else. I think my skin may have gotten use to it and i may seek another brand eventually.</li>
            <li> My family uses this moisturizing skin cream for more than two years. We started using it when my child had got eczema caused by overdrying. Since then eczema never returned. After bathing we apply the cream onto the whole body of our child. Also we use this cream for the whole family after visiting pools with chlorinated water. The cream does not block your skin - you don&#x27;t feel it - you just feel that the skin is moisturized.</li>
            <li> Works for me! I have diabetes and use cream on the tops of my feet and on my ankles and legs to stop skin from the itching caused by poor circulation and the extremely low Colorado humidity. Most other creams work fine, too, but some are too thin to last very long. This cream is thick and fairly heavy. It lasts all day and night. Absorbs quickly and once absorbed is not sticky. It feels sticky going on. It is not greasy at all.     Here&#x27;s an important tip. Put it on after a morning shower while the area is still very wet. Don&#x27;t use too much -- I use a whole lot less than with Eucerin, for example.     Wet your hands with warm water before using it and slather it around in a very thin layer. The wetter you can keep the area the better. Add water when needed while applying. The stuff will last forever using it this way. If you put this cream on dry skin it will be hard to spread and will not work as well.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion- great if you or your kids have sensitive or itchy dry skin- buy the squirt top- easier to use</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my extremely dry and sensitive skin. It&#x27;s heavy without being greasy and works great. My skin has cleared up wonderfully since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I used this cream before ordering from Amazon.  I found a better price on Amazon and it was shipped quickly.  I have dry skin and eczema and it works well for both on me.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist so glad she did, now my skin is silky smooth and hypoallergenic - try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> This cream really does go on smooth and does not cause allergic reactions.  It is virtually odorless and leaves a silky feel to the skin.  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  I use it on my face and body.  Very creamy.  No allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> We use Vanicream on my daughters eczema. The skin specialist recommended Vanicream as it contains no perfumes. We use Vanicream twice a day, everyday, and it keeps her skin hydrated and eczema free. This product is high quality ant a reasonable cost. I buy 2 or 3 tubs at a time to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li> I have severe dry skin and nothing seemed to help for long.  The results after using this stuff are nothing short of dramatic.  It&#x27;s amazing.  No sticky or greasy residue to deal with like many others have.  I find the tub to last quite a long time too so it&#x27;s really not that expensive. I have to admit, it&#x27;s a bit tricky to find locally, thankfully it can be ordered online though!</li>
            <li> This left my skin feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> When I visited my dermatologist they recommended this cream for my super-sensitive skin.  They had it for sale in the office.  I used it until I was scraping the jar for the last bit hanging on the sides.  Just thought I would check Amazon to see if it was available on line and voila - there it was and some $8.00 a jar cheaper than at the doctor&#x27;s office.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist as a good daily moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy. I generally use Aveeno, but decided to try Vanicream with the hope that it would become a staple lotion for me.  I like it. Moisturizing my hand was the test. My hands are very dry and almost every lotion I have tried has filed to provide moisture for any length of time. Vanicream passed the test. For me, Aveeno does provide moisture a bit longer than Vanicream, but there isn&#x27;t a significant difference at all.  I really like this product. I like it so much that I have purchased a jar for a family member so they can experience it and it will be one of my stole products.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - highest rating by nationaleczema dot org.  No smell at all.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to formaldihyde and this is one product that does not have it.  I have used it for years and find it so much more convenient to buy through amazon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion! I have dry, sensitive skin and this is by far the best lotion I have ever used. It&#x27;s a little thicker than regular skin lotion (thus the reason they call it skin cream) and its fragrance free. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> i purchased because of its good reviews hoping that it would calm my eczema, unfortunately, i found cetaphil to be more useful ;/</li>
            <li> If u have dry skin this will help. Very mild and comforting. Non greasy, cooling and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, it&#x27;s free of whatever you might worry about, it&#x27;s been recommended to be by two doctors, it goes on creamy and absorbs well and stays on tenaciously. Don&#x27;t hesitate - this is the moisturizer of your dreams.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and so do my kids and new baby.  I heard about this cream, saw the reviews and tried it out.  It&#x27;s pretty good, it&#x27;s non greasy and stays on all day.  I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin though.  I also bought Monkey Balm and that I found to be much better and it actually healed my rough patches and my baby&#x27;s too.  I&#x27;ll stick with that one instead!</li>
            <li> The cream works very well.  It applies smoothly and with no greasy feel.  I have no skin issues using it.</li>
            <li> It does provide relief for dry skin! One needs to remember though to re-apply. No burning or stinging of the skin was associated with each application.</li>
            <li> I get this for my daughter&#x27;s severe ezcema. It works great! You have to apply every night after baths...</li>
            <li> My wife uses Vanicream for our son who has eczema. Does a great job at maintaining the skin moist and does not have all the additional chemicals other brands have.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this cream and what a great deal. I have been using it for months now and love it!</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended by an allergy specialist and it is excellent.  Very moisturizing, as well as dye and fragrance free.  I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to get it without the pump.  It&#x27;s no longer available locally without a pump, and once you have a pump, you don&#x27;t need another.  Reusing is better for the environment.  Will definitely order from this company again.  Excellent service, excellent price, excellent product.</li>
            <li> Used this on my 2yo, who has developed eczema.  Rubs in very easily without the greasiness.  It does sting on his legs if we use it right after a bath, but otherwise has moisturized well.</li>
            <li> Looking for a replacemnt to my old lotion moisterel, this was ok but did not keep my skin moist  enough, it still dried out.</li>
            <li> My 3-year-old daughter has severe eczema, and I was hoping this cream would give her some relief. It worked okay the first couple of times I used it, but like everything else, was useless afterwards. I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Works well at a great price! Would order it again! Used it on baby. Seems to be helping her eczema but still some areas are still not getting better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! After trying many different products this is the only thing that works on my son&#x27;s eczema! I use the robathol bath oil followed by the vanicream then use vaniply on top of that. Really keeps him moisturized.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Great moisturizer. No perfume smell. I even use it on my face.</li>
            <li> I already have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;Winter comes.&lt;br /&gt;My skin hates me.&lt;br /&gt;Then I use Vanicream.&lt;br /&gt;My skin doesn&#x27;t hate me anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also,  I used this for about a year before trying it on my face. It works wonders for the dryness on my forehead, cheeks, and around my nose.</li>
            <li> the dermatologist recommended this for my child, but it caused his skin to peel. he has exczema and sun sensitive skin. we switched back to eucerin. on the bonus side, this product is lightweight.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product when you have had treatment for skin cancers on the face as it is very gentle and you do not have to have to worry about perfumes or fragrances that are in other products for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love Vanicream!!!! I have tried many other product for my skin.  Vanicream by far is the greatest.  I always buy this product for others that I know have skin problems.  They always end up feeling the same way that I do.  If you know of someone with eczema or dry skin.  Please have them to give this product a try.  I don&#x27;t mind paying a little more so that my skin can feel moist.  I am ready to do a vanicream commercial. I love it.</li>
            <li> Until about 15 years ago when a dermatologist advised me to use Vanicream, my face was so dry in the winter, that no matter how well I moisturized at night, I&#x27;d wake up with itchy red patches all over my face.  After using Vanicream for about 3 weeks, my face was completely clear and the itching was gone...forever! Per my dermatologist, I apply to my face prior to applying my makeup base, it makes my makeup go on smoothly and evenly.  After washing my face before going to bed, I use Vanicream again, on my face and neck, using extra around my eyes &amp; even rub some into my eyelashes, to keep them conditioned.  I am 60 years old and am constantly told I look at least 10 years younger (I have almost no wrinkles).  I thank Vanicream for this, as all the other women in my family have wrinkled badly and pretty early.  Also, compare the price of this with other moisturizers, Vanicream is a real bargain.  Without a doubt, this is the best \\&quot;cosmetic\\&quot; product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, EVERYthing out there for eczema for the past 20 years.  And Vanicream definitely takes the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and soothing to dry eczema-prone skin without burning, itching, or clogging pores.  My dermatologist actually prescribed it (it&#x27;s stocked at some military pharmacies) but I couldn&#x27;t find it in any local stores.  Thank goodness for Amazon.  The closest product I found is cetaphil, but Vanicream is much less greasy, absorbs quickly and (when applied lightly) really is non-comedogenic (doesn&#x27;t clog pores) for those of us with combination skin.  The pump is probably a good idea, when the lid isn&#x27;t sealed tight it get&#x27;s a little goopy and Then it can clog pores. Also, for those who have said it&#x27;s a bit too thick, try applying it right after showering - it locks in moisture and a the water helps thin it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a cure-all; I still use it in combination with derma-smoothe and triamcinolone for eczema trouble, but it definitely helps prevent eczema by keeping skin moisturized.  For extra dry skin in the winter I recommend supplementing vanicream with pure grapeseed oil - seriously, it sounds strange but even the kitchen variety works well.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and need to moisturize my face morning and night.  However, my eyes usually react (allergic) to creams that I use near them.  It is a very unpleasant feeling and then I have to wash my face, remoisturize and keep it away from my eyes.  Other moisturizers often cause my sensitive skin to react with stinging and/or redness.  Vanicream is the only face cream that I have been able to use near my eyes.  My skin isn&#x27;t dry, feels soft, and my eyes are happy!&lt;br /&gt;Also I was so glad to find it in a jar.  Tubes are so hard to empty and who can afford to waste this great cream!</li>
            <li> My five year old son has suffered with eczema his entire life.  His doctors recommended vanicream to us, and we love all their products, particularly this cream and the sunscreen.  It is hard to find products for sensitive skin which are also fragrance free, and that&#x27;s important for us, as my son gets hives from anything with fragrance.  Even lots of the naturals lines which advertise that they are for kids with eczema, have herbs and things in them which kids with allergies tend to be bothered by.  This is thick, but soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  If applied immediately after bathing to moist skin, it really clears all his eczema spots up in a couple of uses.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this product literally every day. It&#x27;s great. I have really dry skin and this product helps me hydrate.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and have had a condition on my hands for years where they are dry, red, rashly and sore. Most lotions cause it to burn, even if they are free of perfumes and dyes. This is turkey the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used.. It doesn&#x27;t cause any burning and has finally cleared up the problem that has plagued me for years. I&#x27;ve used it on my grandson who had a dry itchy rash on his legs, it cleared it right up. It&#x27;s nice and thick so the moisture really lasts. Love it.</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin. So, he has rashes due to chilli weather and dryness. this cream helps him a lot.</li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist who covered my back in these allergy circle patch thingys to wear for a few days, and she told me she knew I would be allergic to fragrances.  My lips and skin break out with almost any creams or lipsticks.  Most creams and lip balms have fragrances, and then there are some she told me labeled as fragrance free that will have a masking fragrance in them, which are just as bad.  Vanicream has neither, so I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  It&#x27;s so expensive that when I see a deal, I buy a bunch.  I save the ones with pumps and when I&#x27;m done, use them on the less expensive ones without pumps.  I use it everywhere, including my incredibly sensitive lips, and nothing I&#x27;ve found it as good.  It&#x27;s thick, which I love.  When you find a good deal (anything under $12), load up!  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many body creams for winter dry skin without good or long lasting results. Great for  feet, hands &amp; cuticles too.  Also, my husband, who had poor circulation and paper thin skin on his lower legs, used this after trying many other brands over the years with no good results, and it has been the only product that restored elasticity and moisture to his skin making it healthier and less prone to injury. I now use it on my clients at the spa where I am employed and highly recommend it to anyone who needs to effectively restore dry or unhealthy skin.</li>
            <li> Several members of our family have winter dry skin and eczema. Vanicream is a life saver. It&#x27;s so thick that it really holds in the moisture, and keeps us from constantly itching. Plus, because it is a thicker moisturizer, we don&#x27;t use buckets of it, like we do with cheaper lotions.  It was actually recommended to us by our allergist.</li>
            <li> I live in the east coast so the 2013-2014 winter has been pretty fricken crazy.  With that said, this is the only winter I can remember where I never had any dry skin problems and I give all credit to Vanicream.  It is a gentle, but thick cream that I can use on my face and body.  And even then, has never caused any breakouts on me.  I seriously don&#x27;t see myself using anything else besides this.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to chemicals, fragrances, and have lots of allergies to even natural products. Even though this does have petroleum products which I usually avoid, I have had no problems with this cream. It has no smell at all, and does not make my skin itch or burn. I love this cream better than anything I have ever used.  I can give this same review for Vanicream fragrance free soap as it is a great product too.</li>
            <li> My mom suffered from some curious blood condition that compromised her immune system.  We didn&#x27;t know what it was, we just knew it didn&#x27;t make her feel good and made everything an ordeal for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of her conditions was her skin was suffering and it was basically dehydrating, getting itchy and cracking.  Needless to say, we did much research and came upon Vanicream.  I initially thought it was one of those vaporous products they sell to women, but I was proven wrong.  Vanicream ended up making my mom&#x27;s condition much more bearable.  Vanicream returned her skin to normal, though I myself don&#x27;t know what she was suffering from...one of those things you have to deal with living have the country away and working 40+ hours a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my mom is fine now, and I thank the makers of Vanicream for making a great product that worked for her.</li>
            <li> This cream is free of artificial scent and color.  It&#x27;s substantial without being goopy.  I was introduced to it by a friend whose son has severe eczema.  I put it on myself and my kids immediately after getting out of the bath or shower and it locks in moisture really well.  This is also the least-irritating face cream I&#x27;ve ever used on my sensitive skin.  They make sunscreen too, which I&#x27;ve yet to try but I expect it to be good.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried many creams for his itchy rash that he has had for several years that no Dr. can identify or cure.  Vanicream has been a life saver for him!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eczema prone skin. Vanicream provides the soothing, hydrating my skin needs without any allergic reactions . I have been using it and the sunscreen product for more than a year with great results .</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a dermatologist.  It has certainly worked very well.  The back of my hands, for example, looked like they belonged to a 90-year old, but I am only 70.  The wrinkle have mostly disappeared, and the skin looks far healthier.  This doesn&#x27;t remove age spots or keep your skin from bruising easily, but it does restore moisture and improves the health of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is free from color additives, scents, etc.  It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes.  I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
            <li> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++ Product</li>
            <li> I love that we can get replacements tubs of vanicream without having to buy the new pumps. It usually saves us a few cents and helps keep extra plastic out of landfills.</li>
            <li> I found it finally.&lt;br /&gt;I could find a good  skin cream in the U.S.A.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. And my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Initially, I wasn&#x27;t using this cream on my daughter&#x27;s eczema frequently enough, so I didn&#x27;t think it was any good. However, after consulting with a doctor and being told to apply it 6-8 times a day it has made a dramatic difference in my daughter&#x27;s skin. Her skin had been extremely dry and cracked and is now becoming smooth and soft. I am thrilled with this product and have recommended it to other eczema sufferers.</li>
            <li> I found this to be one of the best moisturizes on the market, especially for people with eczema</li>
            <li> This is a great product for babies or kids with sensitive skin. My son has had small eczema patches here and there on his body since he was born and his skin was sensitive overall. My doctor recommended this brand and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful chemicals. Used it for about 4 years until my son grew out the eczema.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having extremely dry facial skin lately which nothing has been able to combat. Typically, I&#x27;m oily and acne prone, so adding dryness to it was completely wreaking havoc on my skin. Got a small sample tube, tried it out on my face, and oh my goodness does it work. The texture is really thick which I thought for sure was going break me out but I think its been helping more than anything. Truthfully, I&#x27;ve been getting tiny whiteheads here and there but nothing compared to what I normally have, and actually, I&#x27;ve been using Proactive and the Clinique Acne Kit for quite sometime which never cleared up  my skin as much as it is now. I&#x27;m almost blemish free. I feel that the other products were probably irritating my skin to the point that they&#x27;d create acne. I still have a stubborn dry spot on my forehead but nothing compared to what it was before. Love, love, love it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for real dry body parts. Especially hands!</li>
            <li> My son has been batteling ecezma &amp; the only thing that would calm it was a steriod cream which I do not like using on his delicate skin. Applying Vanicream in the am &amp; pm has resulted in the steriod cream use going from 80% to 10%!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased</li>
            <li> I have eczema and a fragrance allergy.  This lotion has been great for my hands.  I am also a nurse who washes her hands often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from eczema all my life.  Now, I&#x27;m 52 still have some breakouts; it can be embarrassing when you&#x27;re a kid.  I didn&#x27;t where sleeveless shirts or backless dresses.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me this is the best product and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and Vanicream is the only product that really works for me.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Life saver of a product. Cured my sensitive super dry skin immediately. The texture is a little gummy, so need to massage in skin for a couple of minutes. But great combination of not reddening sensitive skin, but also curing dryness. Also doesn&#x27;t leave skin too moist. Leaves skin just right.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body cream.  Excellent for dry itchy skin and it absorbs quick! Not sticky.</li>
            <li> this is mandatory for our sons skin, buy every month faithfully, LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!  :)</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!  Works for even the driest, troublesome skin conditions.  A little goes a long way.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is truly UNSCENTED.  It&#x27;s a nice lotion, not greasy, that blends in quickly.  This container works best with a pump, which is available.  I had one from a previous purchase, so transferred it to the new container.  I have been using this for a while.  Don&#x27;t be tempted by the \\&quot;Vanicream Light\\&quot; product.  This one is much better.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is great for my son&#x27;s eczema. I was sceptical to use it because nothing esle worked so why would vanicream? Anyway, it works ten times better than anything else and isn&#x27;t so oily! Love it and wished I would have started using it sooner.</li>
            <li> I struggle with severe dry skin on my face in the winter. I love this cream as it provides moisture without feeling greasy. It also does not sting if I get a little in my eyes and has no taste, so i even use it around my mouth and lips. I have tried many, may creams and this is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this cream and it is a wonderful product for moisturizing.  The price and quality are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this as a sort of pre-treatment for my psoriasis medication.  I can tell that my Rx ointment works better when used along with this as opposed to alone</li>
            <li> I love this cream,I used to have a lot of problems with my skin but no anymore</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Vanicream to me several years ago and I have been using it since then.  I have very dry skin and it works wonders on my skin</li>
            <li> It is a nice lotion but cerave lotion is a lot better. I tried both for my son&#x27;s exzema and was happier with cerave</li>
            <li> This cream is just the right thickness and creaminess for my sons&#x27; skin. Both of them tend to get eczema and this cream was recommended by our allergist. So far, it has really helped them to not break out. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but it also doesn&#x27;t feel thin and watery. It&#x27;s just right. I also like that it has no dyes or fragrance.</li>
            <li> i hate oily lotions that take a while to soak into your skin. this product is fantastic. it is super safe and does not have ingredients that will irritate truly sensitive skin. i&#x27;ve tried almost every bath, soap, lotion, and cream for sensitive and dry skin and this is by far my favorite non prescription product. i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after my derm recommended it.  I was quite pleased to find it at less than half the price they were asking.  And yes, I checked...the expiration date is FINE!    I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and have noticed dramatic improvement.  I life in Colorado and suffer from Ichthyosis Vulgaris and find that EVERYTHING else burns and this does not.    It&#x27;s been a life saver! :)</li>
            <li> Works just like is supposed to. That a a good thing...</li>
            <li> Vanicream is a good brand for moisturing cream, esp for my sensitive skin. Price is a lot cheaper than in my country. Therefore, definitely a good buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, buy one with pump dispenser:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NWGCZ2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;213733&amp;creative&#x3D;393177&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B000NWGCZ2&amp;linkCode&#x3D;shr&amp;tag&#x3D;swiclu-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;JHR2WFGTHR4VVTBE&amp;refRID&#x3D;1XG2BKXRJYJ0GHW1RJMA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> Well, I would have rated it higher if it had arrived intact, however, when I opened the box, there was cream all through it.  The container was similar to the ones used for Icing or frosting.  Plastic with plastic seal and lid.  It looked like it exploded, since the blue lid and the seal were beside the jar.  Luckily the order had only this cream and a small set of glass stains,(wrapped in plastic)  so nothing else was damaged.  They really need to do something about the packaging.  I was able to save enough of the cream to use, about 1/4 of the jar to see if I would like it.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my tots exzema and it helped so much. I was so impressed, I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so fast, obit it started clearing in a day or 2.</li>
            <li> The only moisturizer that will not make my face break out. I use it in the evening and morning. I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers. Most of them are more expensive and not as good  Try vanicream if you have sensitive skin. Love their suntan lotion</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this brand as face lotion for 6 years, ever since my dermatologist recommended it. It is great for sensitive skin, I use this brand of sunscreen as well. Haven’t had a serious break out since I started using it (my face use to react to other lotions I tried).</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I use it on my feet before going to bed and it&#x27;s especially good.</li>
            <li> best cream for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I bought this for my five month old&#x27;s really bad eczema. My two year old has it too. It worked on my toddler because his wasn&#x27;t as severe. But it did nothing for my baby. I use cutemol on him which is fantastic. We have been through several lotions and steroid treatment.  I would say this is a pretty good choice unless your eczema is severe and then it probably won&#x27;t show the results you want.</li>
            <li> Whole family uses this.  Awesome and gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended to me by a Dermatologist I work with.  Very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t clog pores (you can use on your face).  Buying a large container saves $$$$</li>
            <li> This is a decent cream and it&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s unscented. It isn&#x27;t as absorbent as some, but it is completely non-irritating.  I find it does as good a job as Curel, but has a richer feel and is priced about the same.  (The basic ingredient is petrolatum, the same as in most highly-moisturizing creams--it acts as a nice barrier to keep moisture locked in.)  Amazon has a decent price on it too.  I&#x27;d recommend it or Curel for very dry skin or dry regions; they are my two favorite face creams.</li>
            <li> We have been battling eczema in my youngest daughter since 6 mo. on her face and my older daughter has horrible itchy dry skin.  This moisturizer is really improving their quality of life. &lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vanicream for a few years now. Prior to, I had used at least 100 different products because none worked super great for me. Once I got my first jar of Vanicream, I stopped looking elsewhere as this stuff is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanicream makes two general-use skin moisturizer: this (the standard cream) and the Lite Lotion, which is a thinner weight moisturizer. If you have skin problems like me, this product (the cream) is what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a thicker weight cream that applies easily, does not clog pores, and works for a very long time. Being thicker, it takes a little while to work it in, but you ultimately save time given most other products will require significantly more reapplications than the Vanicream cream. It works well on the face because its formulation is made not to clog pores and not flare acne, facial blemishes, minor injuries, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream was made primarily for people with skin issues (for normal skin, the Lite Lotion is probably a better match). Given skin issues often go along with allergies, this product is formulated so that it does not contain the ingredients that can inflame both skin and allergies (ex: scents). It also does not both asthma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Vanicream Cream is a product that has a lot of value when most standard moisturizers do not work. It&#x27;s a strong moisturizer capable of helping your skin when most other products have failed to yield much or any improvement. The jar design they use is also very convenient. So if you have certain skin issues, chances are you will benefit from Vanicream more so than you will from other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream per my dermatologist recommendation for a number of years. .  ordering it on line is a great convenience.</li>
            <li> I have really bad eczema and psoriasis. This stuff keeps my skin hydrated and it burns less than other brands that claim to be hypoallergenic. Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I have dry, cracked skin &amp; it gets worse in the winter.  I also have hyper-pigmentation---this cream is healing my dry skin &amp; has lightened my hyper-pigmentation!</li>
            <li> but leaves a tacky feeling which my son disliked, and did nothing to alleviate his itchy skin, so we stopped using it all together.</li>
            <li> I use it as a body moisturizer after shaowering</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by a friend. Its a cream, which is great for the winter.I still have to get used to that. I think it is lovely.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful blend.  It moisturizes the feet, ankles and toes and feels really wonderful all day long.  It is not greasy, but it does build up over use so you need your beauty bath at least daily followed by an application.  Use it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product recently after reading the reviews here at Amazon.com, and have only been using it for two days.  I&#x27;ve tried so many different moisturizers over the years, and some very pricey.  I can honestly say, Vanicream is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve purchased!  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been this enthused over a moisturizing cream.  It is a bit thick when first applied, and just takes a little while to absorb into the skin, but once it does, I think you will be very impressed.  Two days ago, my elbows were rough and peeling, and in less than 48 hours, the peeling has disappeared and I&#x27;m left with nothing but soft and healthy skin.  My chapped hands are no longer chapped, and they feel and look great.  What else can I say?  I will definitely continue buying this product.  It came in a nice large jar (1 lb) and was quite a bargain here on Amazon.  I was also happy to learn that it is free of harmful chemicals and dyes.  That is very important...especially if you have sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent cream and well meets my expectations. It is very good and really excels with its claims.</li>
            <li> I have several allergies and have been using this cream for years.  Minimal ingredients, good consistency.  Not greasy.  Dermatologist introduced these products to me.  I use their shampoo/conditioner/sunscreen/soap.</li>
            <li> Vanicream was first recommended to us by my husband&#x27;s dermatologist for dry skin.  We have both been using Vanicream for several years, after hand-washing throughout the day, but first and foremost right when we step from the shower, covering the entire body.  It is the best, most effective we have ever used!</li>
            <li> I like this cream for my face and body. While it has a creamy texture, it is thick and provide excellent protection for the skin. I use this on my face in the winter as is but, in the warmer months I add a few drops of water to the product in my hand and apply on the face.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Vanicream while I was on a medicine that severely dries your skin out, and it was a godsend.  The texture is more of a sealant than a cream, in that it prevents moisture from escaping and keeps your skin from flaking off.  If you only use it on your face, a little goes a long way; I used the same container for 9 months and only used a third of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  This product has no smell, is not greasy, and will not cause breakouts.  It was the only thing that kept my face from peeling off while I was on isotretinoin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: If you are only using it on your face, you should get the version with sunscreen in it.  Also, the size of this container is really too big for travel, so get the smaller size.  Finally, the product has a waxy texture that is great if you put it on within 3 minutes of exiting the shower and allow it to dry completely.  However, if you put it on and stay in a hot environment, it will literally melt off your face.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended this to me for use with my 2 year old who has eczema. She told us to use it after every bath - coat the whole body, including face. When we do use it, it really helps to keep dry skin issues at bay. It doesn&#x27;t cure eczema - just keeps things stabilized which can be difficult to do with dry weather and base issues.</li>
            <li> One of the best creams for most skin conditions. We have used it for years and now with a 2 year old with eczema, we have it as a staple in the medicine cabinet. I recommend it to all new parents and anyone with eczema and really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely hit or miss.  Seems to work for a week or two then we have flare ups.  I like the feel of this better than aquaphor, but this won&#x27;t touch stubborn spots, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This si the best cream ever... unscented and so moisturizing... I have VERY sensitive skin and I can use only this!</li>
            <li> The best moisturizing skin cream my wife has ever used regardless of price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. I used to get dryness around my eyebrow/eyelids in the winter and this took care of it. Goes on thick, but absorbs really well, and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally find this stuff too concentrated so I even water it down to a 60cream/40 water mix and still plenty moisturizing for me. Lasts a loooong time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No fragrance/smell as advertised.</li>
            <li> This cream has virtually halted the itching of my eczema prone skin in its tracks. It is the best product that I have ever used to combat the symptoms of eczema (I have tried dozens, literally).</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream as  the best for dry skin. Not greasy and no smell, just good basic lotion for the dryness of winter. it does work.</li>
            <li> After snowboarding, my skin cracked and dried up to the point where it got flaky. I went to the dermatologist and they recommended this to me. It is pretty thick so I recommend this to people with REALLY REALLY dried skin. After awhile, I didn&#x27;t have too dried skin so I ended up not using the whole thing (it&#x27;s in a huge container) so it will last you forEVER. Anyways, I feel like my skin recovered so I don&#x27;t use it anymore but I do recommend it if you had same skin issues like I did.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and have found it to be the best of its type.  Cost was very reasonable and the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> This lotion is thick and is the only thing that was able to help my dry skin and when used in conjunction with organic coconut oil it does wonders.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this cream to me, after it was recommended to her to use for her daughter with eczema. She liked it but after using it for 3 straight days, not only did I not see any improvements, I saw dry patches, little red bumps all over my kids&#x27; bodies. So i just stopped using it, going back to Eucerin Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body lotion.  It is thick and creamy.  It&#x27;s excellent for sensitive, easily irritated skin.  Vanicream contains no preservatives.  The one pound jar lasts a month for me with daily application on arms, legs, back and chest. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a reorder, therefore I fell it is not necessary to go into detail.</li>
            <li> Lacks the creamy consistendy of other hand creams as is not quite as effective. It is good for my allergies however</li>
            <li> I thought I had previously reviewed the products thanking the maker for saving my life.  My face suddenly became allergic to everything 2 years ago.  I had all kinds of testing and trials, I paid huge sums of money for  fancy products at the mall with promises that now I would be happy.  Thank heavens a good dermatologist, thank you Sarah, suggested Vani products to me and my whole life has changed.  I can actually put on some eye makeup now!  And if you are old like me, you want to add a little frill every once in a while.  The cream is a bit heavy for my kids (twenty somethings) but if you massage it in a bit, it is gone and you don&#x27;t feel it.  These pots will last and last and the price is amazing.  Do we want the manufacturer to know this or is s/he already making millions off of us?</li>
            <li> This cream works well for children with eczema but it needs to be applied multiple times a day to keep the skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> Great product, moisturizes and does not break me out (and everything seems to).  The jar has lasted me quite a long time, but planning to buy again.</li>
            <li> my doc recommended because I was having trouble with my old moisturizer and I suffer from very sensitive skin; glad I switched.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a physician recommended it to my daughter for her child&#x27;s dry skin.  If you have ANY type of allergy, this is the perfect product for you.  And what a great price!  It lasts forever with the easy to use pump, and with the pump you don&#x27;t contaminate the cream by dipping your hand into it.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that one of the reviews complained about the price.  That must be someone who has not been shopping in a drugstore for many years.  It is unbelievably cheap for the quality.</li>
            <li> This has been a healing miracle for my daughter! She has eczema and suffers from hives and rashes and this is the only product that we have found that does not burn her skin. It is a fantastic, non-greasy cream that is ultra moisturizing and healing.</li>
            <li> Love Vanicream. My son has very sensitive skin and eczema. Vanicream is the only lotion we&#x27;ve found that keeps him from getting flare-ups. He uses it after every shower.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested to us by the outpatient care program my daughter attended for her atopic dermatitis. It really helps.</li>
            <li> I have very severe eczema and my daughter has a little mild eczema too.  I was recommended this product by a dermatologist and it improved my skin to a better condition than anything else I have tried in over 30 years, to include topical and oral steroids.  Since it&#x27;s non-steroid and kid friendly, I tried it on my daughter too and her eczema patches were gone in just a couple days, after weeks of trying other products unsuccessfully.  Only one comment about the packaging that&#x27;s not so great... The tubs with pumps are listed separately than those without pumps, and although I ordered the product without the pump, it came with the pump.  Due to the amount I use the product, I don&#x27;t like the pump since it&#x27;s easier and less messy for me to use the lid.  I wanted to try to get the ones without pumps, but Amazon said they couldn&#x27;t guarantee I would get the right one, so they just gave me a couple dollars back, which was good.</li>
            <li> I occasionally get eczema breakouts and this lotion really helps keep it in check. I also have a lot of allergies and therefore can&#x27;t use fragrant lotion or lotion with additives. This lotion is really gentle on my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> After reading lots of reviews, I got Vanicream for my child with extremely sensitive skin. I was very skeptic as all the other moisturizers flared up my kid&#x27;s eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am glad that I tried this and now subscribe it monthly for my whole family. I prefer the one with the pump though. The pump lid works with the regular 16 ounce container - so I switch it when needed.</li>
            <li> We have been battling with our 5 year old daughter&#x27;s eczema for years now. Name the product, odds are we&#x27;ve tried it! We tried Vanicream because her allergist recommended it, and we have been using it since. We like [[ASIN:B000HGUAW0 Aquaphor Healing Ointment, 14 oz (396 g) (Pack of 2)]]and [[ASIN:B000FKGIPQ Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Original Moisturizing Creme, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]], but they can be messy to apply at daycare/school, and feel a bit more tacky on the skin. Our daughter really likes how smoothly Vanicream glides on, and how quickly her skin absorbs it. We call it the \\&quot;invisible goop\\&quot; because we can apply it just before school and her friends can&#x27;t tell that there is anything on her face or arms. We like the pump (no dipping hands and fingers into the jar, so no worries about getting bacteria in it, which is a plus with eczema and any skin that is more infection-prone) and it is much easier to clean up than Eucerin or Aquaphor. We continue to use all three, with Vanicream getting the most use during the day, and more Aquaphor to seal in moisture during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I have a child with eczema.  It worked for awhile but he was bothered by the sticky, greasy feel. It is thick and it does get absorbed into his skin eventually. Right now, I&#x27;m using the Neosporin eczema essential and that seems to agree with him more.</li>
            <li> We have serious dry skin and eczema issues at our house and this lotion works.  It was recommended both by our dermatologist and allergist.  Yes, it costs a little bit more than grocery store convenience lotions but it is worth the money and really good for sensitive skin. We use it on the baby, toddler and adults.</li>
            <li> It feels silky smooth on my hands and helps me overcome the tendency toward dryness and cracking skin.&lt;br /&gt;There is little fragrance and it does not bother my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it works as well for you.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new lotion product that would help my sometimes dry skin.  Vanicream was a wonderful surprise. I never heard of it before and just picked it up at the local walgreen&#x27;s and was very pleased with the results. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ...because I had no fragrance or slick feel. Now I realize that all of that was part of the problem. Since starting with this product, I have had little issues and lots of soft skin...even in the cold, dry wintertime!</li>
            <li> This cream helped babies eczema like no others (tried eucerin and Desitin with no help)  also Tripple paste for diaper rash also helped, but we use Vanicream for arms/body.  Our case was severe and required some prescription ointments but this helped it most of the other times.</li>
            <li> Experience was excellent as usual.</li>
            <li> Only thing I can use from head to toe for my ezcema. Love</li>
            <li> Helps only during summer months. Useless in winter.</li>
            <li> Not only is Vanicream affordable and great for dry skin, but my dermatologist is the one who introduced me to it. Yeah, it&#x27;s probably too heavy for use on a younger face, but it&#x27;s great at night, tough elbows/knees, and neck and chest areas that might be getting a bit older-looking. I&#x27;ve tried everything, including expensive concoctions of shea butter and I still go back to Vanicream. And shh, but I can buy it either on amazon or at Target, whichever is more convenient. Nice.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped manage by 18mth olds eczema.  A little bit goes a long way, I bought 2 containers but now know those will probably last me a few months.  Great price, Speedy shipping from Amazon, fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> Recommended by our pediatrician and love it!  Does leave you feeling greasy and works great on sensitive skin.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have a lot of skin allergies and sensitivities and this is a great moisture cream. It works as a good base/barrier for my makeup, too. You get a very generous amount so the price is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I was given samples of this brand from an allergy specialist and it is really the only option I found for truly unscented, paraben free, hypoallergenic hygiene products. If what you need is unscented, hypoallergenic soap/shampoo/conditioner due to sensitive skin or an allergy, this is it. It&#x27;s hard to come by and it&#x27;s nothing glamorous but it fits the bill when you&#x27;re trying to avoid potential allergens. It can be purchased in some stores but it is not easy to find and it is more expensive. This is a thick, creamy lotion but it definitely works. It&#x27;s more expensive than many lotions you find at the store but if you have very sensitive skin, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It works for my daughter.</li>
            <li> The hospital I work for uses this and I have had the best compliments on my skin.  I have been told that I look 8 years younger than I am!  Very nice and it has worked for the patients for years.  Buy it and love it!  Goes on feeling somewhat thick but I don&#x27;t have an issue with this because of what this does for my skin (and I have very sensitive skin:eczema, dry skin and breakouts).</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me due to my chronically dry skin. Within a matter of days, my skin no longer had that &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; look. It&#x27;s a miracle, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, because I have tried at least a dozen different so-called moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have two very minor complaints. The first is if I happen to put even a small amount of this on my face, I break out. I&#x27;m not quite sure why that would be. I use Vanicream LIte for my face and it&#x27;s fine; however, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize quite as effectively. The second small complaint I have is that even though it isn&#x27;t supposed to have a fragrance, it does have a slight odor that I don&#x27;t particularly care for. It&#x27;s easy enough to cover up with body spray, though, and most people probably wouldn&#x27;t even notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this moisturizer to anyone who has been struggling with dry, ashy skin. It certainly works for me!</li>
            <li> This brand was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s  Dr, an allergist. It is not intended to cure her eczema. It does, however, control it and ease the itching. It&#x27;s nice to not have to depend on yet another allergy medication to give her some relief. Gentle enough to also use on her face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - it was recommended by my allergist when I started getting hives.  Once we found out the hives were apparently not from allergies, he suggested I smooth this all over myself after every shower.  My skin loves it.  In fact I mix it equally with Aquaphor which I also get through Amazon and love them both.</li>
            <li> This  is the best moisturizing cream I have ever used. It has no smell at all. I have bought others that say no smell but had a little bit. We use this on my Grandson who is 2 weeks old to my husband who is 60.</li>
            <li> I got this because my allergist recommended it for my eczema. It is very effective, non-comdegenic, and has no fragrance. Would suggest to anyone with skin conditions or otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream for several years.  It is the best moisturizing product on the market!  I have very fair and sensitive skin.  This product contains no fragrances, dyes, or harsh chemicals.  I use it to wash my face on a warm cloth.  Then I apply some to my face before makeup.  It keeps my skin from drying out even in the Winter.  I would be lost without this product. My skin is sensitive to perfumes and chemicals normally found in moisturizers.  This product is not greasy or oily and does not cause acne.  I highly recommend this product and I thank Amazon for offering it at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing we&#x27;ve found for dry skin in winter and eczema.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this cream and shipped fast as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this huge jar because my dermatologist recommended I start using Vanicream products for my sensitive skin.  I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good face cream, paticularly for those sensitive to perfumes and additives found in other creams.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Based on reviews I thought this would be a good product for my dry, sensitive, mature skin. Not so. I tried the soap too which really dried my skin out. The cream sits on top of my skin, no absorption, thus red and dry skin. I have no wrinkles at 65 and receive compliments on my skin all the time. I have used Cetaphil for years and am going back to it today.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vanicream for three years and it really is great.  My Derm told me to start using it for my Eczema and it worked.  Eczema free since I started using it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended vanicream years ago and I still use it daily. I have found no product that I like better for moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice product or sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> This has a sweaty, heavy feeling on the skin and felt like I was smearing vaseline on it. Don&#x27;t even think about using it on your face. My face was sticky, shiny and almost felt like it couldn&#x27;t breathe. If you enjoy smearing vaseline on your hands then you may enjoy this lotion.</li>
            <li> This cream was great at moisturising but not as great as E 45 cream.</li>
            <li> Best cream to use for sensitive skin during winter.  Makes my skin feel very smooth and does not leave residue on clothing</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this stuff so we always have a couple tubs of it laying around for our daughters who have eczema.  It becomes especially important in the winter when humidity drops to about 12% in our apartment, and even with multiple humidifiers going we can only get it up to about 32%.  Under those conditions we need to apply this at least once a day, twice is much better.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this really thick lotion will cure my dry cracking heels.  It helps some by preventing my dry heals from getting any drier and hurt, but it does not completely alleviate the dry heels.  Keri lotion works better, but does not last as long and is much greaser than this Vanicream.</li>
            <li> I am VERY dissapointed that my dermatologist recommended this cream as SAFE and I trusted him -- and then I decided to research it and I trust Dr. Mercola more than my dermatologist! This is from Dr. Mercola&#x27;s website:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;A study has found that topical applications of moisturizers such as Dermabase, Dermovan, Eucerin Original Moisturizing Cream, or Vanicream could increase skin cancer risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irradiated mice who were treated with the moisturizers exhibited a significant increase in their rate of tumor formation and increase in tumor size per mouse. Treatment of the mice with Dermabase, Dermovan, Eucerin, or Vanicream for 17 weeks increased the total number of histologically characterized tumors by 69 percent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the study, as reported by Green Med Info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The results indicate that several commercially available moisturizing creams increase the rate of formation and number of tumors when applied topically to UVB-pretreated high-risk mice. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of topical applications of moisturizing creams ... in humans.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also applies to tanning oils and lotions--which many of you may be using right now with summer in full swing--as well as the baby oil or lotion that many parents unwittingly slather on their babies.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to everything. This is the only lotion I can use.</li>
            <li> Hey it&#x27;s Vanicream,..the stuff is great!  I like getting it without the pump because then it come sealed....</li>
            <li> Vanicream is a good brand for moisturing cream, esp for my sensitive skin. Price is a lot cheaper than in my country. Therefore, definitely a good buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, buy one with pump dispenser:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NWGCZ2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;213733&amp;creative&#x3D;393177&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B000NWGCZ2&amp;linkCode&#x3D;shr&amp;tag&#x3D;nealo10a-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;JHR2WFGTHR4VVTBE&amp;refRID&#x3D;1XG2BKXRJYJ0GHW1RJMA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> I can stop itching thru the winter.  This is the best cream for those who spend the cooler months dreading the pain of cracking skin.  Not greasy, no fragrance, no water.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Really helps babies with very dry rough skin.  We use it at least 3 times daily.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer! My Dermatologist told me about it. I will never use anything else. I even use it on my face.  Terrific product!</li>
            <li> My one year old has had a bad case of ezema over the winter months and this is the best thing I have found for keeping it in check. We have to put it on her morning and night but it works wonders and she no longer has that scaly feeling or dry marks all over her skin. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is thick enough yet goes on and soaks in your skin. Perfect for my and my little one&#x27;s eczema. I keep it by the bedside and put it on before bed.</li>
            <li> Vanicream can be very costly when you use as much as we do a year. Our special needs little guy has very dry skin on the inside of his hands, the winter months are awful and we use the Vanicream to soften the skin up 6 or more times a day. I found this at a better price, the supplier sent the product in ample time, thanks so much for having such a great product available for people like us.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is excellent if you have very dry skin. It helped me get through the brutal winter as my skin starts cracking when it gets dry. It is a little heavy for the summer, but could still be used. Overall a great lotion and it lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> No fragrance or dyes great for skin if you have allergys..Give it a try you will not regret it ..</li>
            <li> The price and the product are excellent.  They work well on my sensitive skin.  Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer for those who have issues with chemicals and fragrances.  I can use it on my face and have no problems at all.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Vanicream for years.  This was a great price.  It did not have a pump, but I just saved the one I had already and reused.  Great deal!</li>
            <li> I read the review about eczema and felt compelled to write.  Many struggle to find a cure for this condition and we were blessed to break the eczema cycle on our daughter who itched constantly.  We still use Vanicream today to help moisturize her skin.  It had been 9 years and I do not remember all of the details, but here is what I can tell you.  We learned from a local school counselor whose son had eczema bad.  She visited the National Jewish Hospital in Colorado who specializes in auto immune diseases.  Here is a general treatment summary.  Soak in the bathtub (or hands if that is only area affected) in as hot as water as tolerable for exactly 20 minutes.  Do not dry off, and on the hot spots, we dabbed a 1% steroid ointment---might have been elecon, but I can&#x27;t remember.  Do not rub in. On the rest of the skin, we smothered in Vanicream.  We then dressed her in wet pajamas soaked in warm water (ringed out) and put two layers of dried sweats on her to keep her warm.  She kept the clothes on for two hours minimum and when we took off, layered again in vanicream and rubbed it in this time and put on regular clothes.  Do this three or four times a day (yes, it takes a commitment) At nighttime, we tried to have her sleep in the wet clothes as long as possible.  We did this for 5 days and IT BROKE HER ECZEMA CYCLE.  It is the only treatment I have ever heard of that worked.  Steriods were getting too much, nothing seemed to work and we went to Cleveland Clinic, and at least 10 other doctors and all we heard was &amp;#34;Steriods is the answer and &amp;#34;It is a tough disease that she will have to live with&amp;#34;  TOday she is 15 and just has dry skin at times.  I still buy vanicream and I would recommend anyone who is struggling with eczema to try the above.....can&#x27;t hurt and could change your life.  It changed hers and ours  dfortner17@gmail.com</li>
            <li> I work at a hospital in Denver specializing in treating allergies and skin conditions. They sell this in the gift shop and it&#x27;s wonderful. I have eczema and very dry sensitive skin (not helped by living at altitude in an arid climate). The dermatologists here recommend the &amp;#34;soak and seal&amp;#34; method of skin care. Soak in a bath (not hot) or shower for 10-15 minutes. Pat skin with towel but do not dry completely. Then apply a thick, unscented cream like Vanicream to seal in moisture. Research shows that a genetic flaw seems to be responsible for skin that doesn&#x27;t hold enough moisture, which can lead to skin problems. This method works great!</li>
            <li> Best out there and since it&#x27;s from Rochester, MN is even better.  Have used it since my best friend in Rochester sent me some.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any different results than any other brand I have tried and it was expensive</li>
            <li> it is a great product.  thank you, amazon delivered in a great manner.</li>
            <li> Not greasy!  great for psorisis!</li>
            <li> yes I am verry pleased with the results of my rash since I started using the vanicream , it works fantastic I plan to keep on using it daily makes my skin feel extremely soft !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks Jane</li>
            <li> Daily to twice daily use keeps skin soft and smooth, making atopic dermatitis breakouts much less likely. No irritants! Only problem is everyone uses it and it runs out . . .</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to a friend because I know that she uses it. She was thrilled. She says that it is a great moisturizing cream for her very sensitive skin. She is very fair, blue eyed blonde.</li>
