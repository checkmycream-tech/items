            <li>and you don&#x27;t get that many in a package - we won&#x27;t be running out any time soon!</li>
            <li>yes I love it!</li>

            <li>I use Organic Morracon Rose water (which is amazing both in smell and skin moisturizing), and i have to use 3 of these balls to even start to clog the top when soaking.</li>
            <li>Not expensive, good quality for so many!</li>
            <li>We needed non-sterile cotton balls for a project as these fit the bill!</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT IS GOOD,BUT YOU DO USE MORE IF YOU PLAN ON USING IT WITH ALCOHOL</li>
            <li>This big bag is a great value!</li>
            <li>I love these cotton balls.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Way more than I needed.</li>
            <li>I use these to protect the tips of the bassoon reeds I make and find them to be good quality cotton that is consistent in size.  </li>
            <li>I love this huge bag of cotton balls and I&#x27;m ordering another bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thought I was saving money, but really not all that impressed with these.</li>
            <li>They are a bit small, but perfect for what I needed them for :)</li>
            <li>They do the job just fine</li>
            <li>Great price for this many cotton balls, nice and fluffy too!</li>
            <li>Thats a lot more that i expected wich make me happy</li>
            <li>Throw in the bulk and the free shipping and this one&#x27;s a no brainer for me.  </li>
            <li>Very economical way to buy cotton balls.</li>
            <li>The description says the bag contains 2,000 cotton balls, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s closer to 2</li>
            <li>The toner I use (Thayer&#x27;s Cucumber Witch Hazel) has a small hole in the lid to squirt it out of and this size is perfect.</li>
            <li>We use them in a grooming salon and have to use two together each time we clean one ear of an animal.</li>
            <li>If seller can be more clearly put a measurement out on the product page would help more...</li>
            <li>Smaller balls than I thought but good quality.</li>
            <li>thats why they are such a good price.</li>
            <li>One use I have for cotton balls is cleaning my dogs (Golden Retriever) ears out.  </li>
            <li>Read reviews before purchasing, made the right decision.</li>
            <li>The size is just exactly right, not too fuzzy, hold fluids well and does not fall apart.</li>
            <li>Perfect for me because I usually end up tearing a jumbo cotton ball in half, so I love the size of these.</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Cotton balls are cotton balls for the most part, but these are tiny.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as described.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as advertised though...</li>
            <li>If I need a bigger cotton ball, I just grab more than one.</li>
            <li>The fingertips&#x27; first brush with these spheres of heavenly delight quickens the heart rate, producing a fire in the loins and a blush of wicked modesty in the cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always bought them at the regular store in bags of 100 and paid much much more than I did for these.</li>
            <li>I suppose these might be ok to use for medical reasons (after a shot?</li>
            <li>This is exactly what i need in my acupuncture practise.</li>
            <li>Great for use on small areas!</li>
            <li>Very good, the balls are maybe a little smaller than I&#x27;d wanted.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fine, no other issues, wish I&#x27;d known.</li>
            <li>But, they hold their own like any other cotton ball should.</li>
            <li>Smaller cotton balls than what I have purchased at Walmart, but worth the price!!</li>
            <li>Good price for quantity however Cotton Balls are fairly small.</li>
            <li>I use them to clean the skin folds of my french bulldog, so these are just the right size.  </li>
            <li>but... these cotton balls are amazingly soft and super absorbent.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect to get the large or jumbo size cotton balls you&#x27;re used to.</li>
            <li>Large quantity.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive and do what a cotton ball is designed to do.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say about them except we bought more.</li>
            <li>I really dig these.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I didn&#x27;t realize how much I was buying.</li>
            <li>I love being able to save money and get enough to last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Cotton balls are size Small not Medium, make sure that&#x27;s what you would like to purchase; similar size as a nickel, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Girlfriend uses for makeup removal and seems to use more due to size.</li>
            <li>They last a long time (cost effective).</li>
            <li>The cotton balls seem to be of decent quality, but they are about half-size.</li>
            <li>As many have already pointed out, these are some pretty small cotton balls.  </li>
            <li>they are super tiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>exactly as shown in picture! will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>Normal sized doesn&#x27;t go in as far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If i use one, i waste rose water drooling from the sides and the same with two, three seems to work but really?</li>
            <li>We were trying to use them in an office setting and they were very small and seemed to fall apart much more readily than Target&#x27;s cotton balls.  </li>
            <li>I like the large bag but sadly the cotton balls are not a medium size they are at best a small cotton ball.</li>
            <li>they are not like mommas cotton balls, these are more like cotton strands strung together, they hardly keep form, even in bag, untouched.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast enough.</li>
            <li>Just double or triple up on them to get a real sized cotton ball experience.</li>
            <li>price verses quality and quantity makes for an epic deal</li>
            <li>they lasted a long time and the cotton is nice firm cotton!</li>
            <li>I can see myself going through it reasonably fast, since I use cotton balls regularly, both for beauty and deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>Wanted regular, full size cotton balls, these were half size.</li>
            <li>I have to use twice as many to accomplish the same task, so it was not a good buy.</li>
            <li>they are as advertised, a bit smaller than the normal ones in the store, but then again i wanted then for fire starting not make up, and they work well for that.</li>
            <li>You get just enough product and effective removal of any make-up left behind.</li>
            <li>Also have very little volume so they collapse quickly when removing makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super small and falls apart.</li>
            <li>The balls are small not excessively large which is important for me (no waste)</li>
            <li>These cotton balls are small as expected but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>While some might consider these to be on the small side, they are perfect for my acupuncture practice and less expensive than the TIDI mediums I used to use.</li>
            <li>Wife uses them heavily for polish remover and they&#x27;ve certainly done their job.</li>

            <li> Wife uses them heavily for polish remover and they&#x27;ve certainly done their job.</li>
            <li> I mean, heck, if bunny tails are anywhere near as heavenly as these cotton balls, then I now know why they must breed so fast.</li>
            <li> I thought 2000 might be too much to ever go through in my lifetime, but this is volume-wise about the same size as a small throw pillow.</li>
            <li> Just enough to swab a little alcohol or clean up small blood drops.  </li>
            <li> Big size for family usage,perfect cotton balls to last us a very long time.  </li>
            <li> put under a bandaid), but since they are  &amp;#34;non-sterile&amp;#34; this is clearly not the intent.</li>
            <li> The actual fiber size was small to medium which indicates that they are significantly smaller to the ones with larger cotton fibers.</li>
            <li> This cotton balls are very tiny, and not very useful for anything!</li>
            <li> With this size, it went down in there a little far and almost got stuck.  </li>
            <li> a little big for my needs (makeup removal).</li>
            <li> I was wanting a little bit larger but they work</li>
            <li> it was about 115g, minus the bag.</li>
            <li> These are extra small cotton balls, not medium.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the point of buying a bulk bag if the actual cotton balls are so small you have to use handfuls at a time?</li>
            <li> so the cotton balls (which are actually quite small like other reviewers say) are probably about 400g.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I only rate this product with 4 stars because the size of each cotton ball is a little bit small than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Look, the price isn&#x27;t all that low, but the bag is big enough and they should last for some time...not a bad purchase for what you get....</li>

            <li> I like the large bag but sadly the cotton balls are not a medium size they are at best a small cotton ball. So a lot of them have been wasted just because you have to have a lot of them for coverage. They have been used in the spa for makeup and nail care.</li>
            <li> These cotton balls are very small.  Perhaps half or even 1/3rd the size of what I would call a standard cotton ball.  One use I have for cotton balls is cleaning my dogs (Golden Retriever) ears out.  With this size, it went down in there a little far and almost got stuck.  Normal sized doesn&#x27;t go in as far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought I was saving money, but really not all that impressed with these.</li>
            <li> The description says the bag contains 2,000 cotton balls, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s closer to 2 trillion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Seinfeld says, women do seem to need a lot of cotton balls. I&#x27;m one of these women. I put them through horrible experiences every morning and night. But still. I bought this bag a year ago and have hardly made a dent in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now wondering which child to leave it to in my will.</li>
            <li> awesome for injections for a family member and for another child that got her ears pierced and uses these to clean her earlobes.</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you pay for. These are a little small for &amp;#34;medium.&amp;#34; But, they hold their own like any other cotton ball should. Wife uses them heavily for polish remover and they&#x27;ve certainly done their job.</li>
            <li> I use these to protect the tips of the bassoon reeds I make and find them to be good quality cotton that is consistent in size.  I&#x27;d recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product with good price. However, I only rate this product with 4 stars because the size of each cotton ball is a little bit small than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Thats a lot more that i expected wich make me happy</li>
            <li> Tiny balls, it&#x27;s not the size you buy in the store</li>
            <li> Very tiny cotton balls worthless</li>
            <li> you get lots of cotton balls, but they are cut smaller than any I&#x27;ve seen before. I&#x27;ve ended up using three to take the place of one standard cotton ball.</li>
            <li> Wanted regular, full size cotton balls, these were half size. Shipping was fine, no other issues, wish I&#x27;d known. Maybe next time...</li>
            <li> The cotton balls seem to be of decent quality, but they are about half-size. I have to use twice as many to accomplish the same task, so it was not a good buy.</li>
            <li> Soooo many balls!  O ordered these for my clinic, and OMG so many! LOL  Great price for this many cotton balls, nice and fluffy too!</li>
            <li> Cotton balls are cotton balls for the most part, but these are tiny. Several must be used to replace one or two store bought cotton balls. Less of a deal than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> These are so perfect for craft projects. Cotton Balls aren&#x27;t cheep and you don&#x27;t get that many in a package - we won&#x27;t be running out any time soon!</li>
            <li> As many have already pointed out, these are some pretty small cotton balls.  I use them to clean the skin folds of my french bulldog, so these are just the right size.  The price is very nice as well, so no complaints from me!</li>
            <li> Got these for toddler crafts, work great, HUGE bag!!!  They are a bit small, but perfect for what I needed them for :)</li>
            <li> While some might consider these to be on the small side, they are perfect for my acupuncture practice and less expensive than the TIDI mediums I used to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect for gel nail polish removal.  Small.. The size of an average nail bed.  Great for use on small areas!</li>
            <li> Very small rounds, not medium size.</li>
            <li> We needed non-sterile cotton balls for a project as these fit the bill! Not expensive, good quality for so many!</li>
            <li> They are exactly as described. Very inexpensive and do what a cotton ball is designed to do. Not much else to say about them except we bought more.</li>
            <li> Read reviews before purchasing, made the right decision. Cotton balls are size Small not Medium, make sure that&#x27;s what you would like to purchase; similar size as a nickel, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed on that the product description is misleading. These are extra small cotton balls, not medium. They do the job just fine but I find myself having to use more unfortunately.</li>
            <li> These cotton balls are small as expected but it works just fine. Shipping was fast enough. Just use it for lil things.</li>
            <li> Will not run out of cotton balls any time soon. I would have preferred a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still can use for taking off nail polish. Also good for protection to keep water out of ear while showering. Just apply Vaseline to one side , put in ear and you have a waterproof seal for ear. Got that tidbit from my ent doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 3 rating because this should have been listed under SMALL size not medium.</li>
            <li> Good price for quantity however Cotton Balls are fairly small. Girlfriend uses for makeup removal and seems to use more due to size.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS GOOD,BUT YOU DO USE MORE IF YOU PLAN ON USING IT WITH ALCOHOL</li>
            <li> Very small and poor quality. Not worth the price</li>
            <li> Very economical way to buy cotton balls.</li>
            <li> Great value! I am an acupuncturist and use a lot of cotton balls!</li>
            <li> I really dig these.  They suite my needs at my acupuncture clinic.  Just enough to swab a little alcohol or clean up small blood drops.  Throw in the bulk and the free shipping and this one&#x27;s a no brainer for me.  No more shopping at Walmart for cotton balls.</li>
            <li> This was misleading. The only thing JUMBO was the bag. the cotton balls are so tiny they are useless. Even when you put several together, they don&#x27;t work because they fall apart.  I WOULD LIKE A REFUND FOR THIS ITEM.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> they lasted a long time and the cotton is nice firm cotton!</li>
            <li> excellent product! used for arts and crafts.</li>
            <li> The size is just exactly right, not too fuzzy, hold fluids well and does not fall apart. The actual fiber size was small to medium which indicates that they are significantly smaller to the ones with larger cotton fibers. The only con was that after counting and checking three times I only received 1999 cotton balls. If you are reading this review for cotton balls you need to get a life. FOR CRIPES SAKE.... THESE A RE COTTON BALLS........</li>
            <li> exactly as shown in picture! will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this huge bag of cotton balls and I&#x27;m ordering another bag. They are exactly as advertised though...size Medium. Think Jumbo cotton ball, cut in half. That&#x27;s about what size they are. Perfect for me because I usually end up tearing a jumbo cotton ball in half, so I love the size of these. If I need a bigger cotton ball, I just grab more than one. Just don&#x27;t expect to get the large or jumbo size cotton balls you&#x27;re used to. This big bag is a great value!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for use in my acupuncture practice.</li>
            <li> Great!  Will start using it as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> I mean, heck, if bunny tails are anywhere near as heavenly as these cotton balls, then I now know why they must breed so fast. Upon delicately opening the plastic bag with precision shears, the smell of freshly minted cotton balls overwhelms the olfaction, producing a rapture seldom witnessed on this mortal coil. The fingertips&#x27; first brush with these spheres of heavenly delight quickens the heart rate, producing a fire in the loins and a blush of wicked modesty in the cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for those with little self control.</li>
            <li> Big size for family usage,perfect cotton balls to last us a very long time.  I like to buy in bulk to save money</li>
            <li> I use these as part of my facial toning process at night. I use Organic Morracon Rose water (which is amazing both in smell and skin moisturizing), and i have to use 3 of these balls to even start to clog the top when soaking. If i use one, i waste rose water drooling from the sides and the same with two, three seems to work but really?.. Thats why it is 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus they are not like mommas cotton balls, these are more like cotton strands strung together, they hardly keep form, even in bag, untouched. Not balls, strands.</li>
            <li> Great Price for the money.</li>
            <li> Teeny Tiny cotton balls.  Would not order this size again.  We use them in a grooming salon and have to use two together each time we clean one ear of an animal.</li>
            <li> I love these cotton balls. I&#x27;ve been diabetic all my life and have used probably millions of cotton balls. I&#x27;ve always bought them at the regular store in bags of 100 and paid much much more than I did for these. I love being able to save money and get enough to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Cotton balls extremely small. Do not buy this size if you want it for make up removal.</li>
            <li> Smaller cotton balls than what I have purchased at Walmart, but worth the price!!</li>
            <li> The cotton swabs are tiny, think the size of a penny. I thought these would be larger - but I can&#x27;t even use one of these to take off nail polish. I end up grabbing 4-5 and mush them together and use as one. What&#x27;s the point of buying a bulk bag if the actual cotton balls are so small you have to use handfuls at a time? I suppose these might be ok to use for medical reasons (after a shot? put under a bandaid), but since they are  &amp;#34;non-sterile&amp;#34; this is clearly not the intent. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> they are as advertised, a bit smaller than the normal ones in the store, but then again i wanted then for fire starting not make up, and they work well for that.</li>
            <li> They were the very small type, about the size of a nickel.</li>
            <li> This cotton balls are very tiny, and not very useful for anything! If seller can be more clearly put a measurement out on the product page would help more...If I have known this cotton balls&#x27; size, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered this...  This size is like a joke!</li>
            <li> I use these to tone my face after removing my make-up, and I find that they are absolutely perfect. The toner I use (Thayer&#x27;s Cucumber Witch Hazel) has a small hole in the lid to squirt it out of and this size is perfect. You get just enough product and effective removal of any make-up left behind. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I thought 2000 might be too much to ever go through in my lifetime, but this is volume-wise about the same size as a small throw pillow. I can see myself going through it reasonably fast, since I use cotton balls regularly, both for beauty and deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> These cotton balls are perfect size not to mention that the bag is huge but best of all is the price. Cotton balls in convenience stores are way over priced!</li>
            <li> 200 for a buck - or here on amazong 2,000 for ten bucks.  Heck yes I love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived  promptly. Large quantity. Smaller balls than I thought but good quality. A good deal. Will buy again and recommend.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there to say? They&#x27;re cotton balls, but they&#x27;re the size I need along with a great deal !!!</li>
            <li> We were trying to use them in an office setting and they were very small and seemed to fall apart much more readily than Target&#x27;s cotton balls.  Do yourself a favor and buy the jumbo version!</li>
            <li> I thought cotton balls were cotton balls but... these cotton balls are amazingly soft and super absorbent.</li>
            <li> The bald are tiny. Not worth jt</li>
            <li> they are super tiny. thats why they are such a good price. Just double or triple up on them to get a real sized cotton ball experience.</li>
            <li> nice plump cotton balls. a little big for my needs (makeup removal). standard issue CBs (balls o&#x27;cotton). yes, sir, yes ma&#x27;am.</li>
            <li> What a rip-off. A real disappointment. Also have very little volume so they collapse quickly when removing makeup.</li>
            <li> These cotton balls are very small.  I was wanting a little bit larger but they work okay.  I use them for removing eye makup.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i need in my acupuncture practise. The balls are small not excessively large which is important for me (no waste) They last a long time (cost effective). Thank you</li>
            <li> Great price. Not only do my daughter and I use these for our nails and face, I use them on my dogs too. My great dane has had chromic ear infections, so I have to clean her ears ever couple days. I leave a couple of these in to soak back up the medicine. It works well. She hasn&#x27;t had an episode in months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money. It&#x27;s super small and falls apart. I can&#x27;t even use it. . . . .</li>
            <li> is what it says.&lt;br /&gt;but cheaper to just get cotton balls from ralph&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;this bag weighs about 425g. so the cotton balls (which are actually quite small like other reviewers say) are probably about 400g.&lt;br /&gt;i weighed a bag of cotton balls from ralphs, 200 count, and much bigger size. it was about 115g, minus the bag. and at $2, makes them about $1.75 per 100g cotton balls.&lt;br /&gt;following the same calculation, these cotton balls are about $2.50 per 100g.&lt;br /&gt;so make your own conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i&#x27;ve been using these for over a year now. you get used to the small size. i stopped using 2-3 at a time, now just use 1 at a time. which means they are great value. unless you get bigger cotton balls and tediously break each of them down into smaller pieces so they go further. goes to show how useless customer reviews are!</li>
            <li> I needed cotton balls for my office and these are perfect for what I need.  Look, the price isn&#x27;t all that low, but the bag is big enough and they should last for some time...not a bad purchase for what you get....a tad-bit small, but not too bad...recommended...</li>
            <li> Way more than I needed. Perhaps I didn&#x27;t realize how much I was buying.</li>
            <li> These were tiny seriously about 4-5 to make 1 that you buy in like Walmart. Gave them to the Kindergarten teacher for crafts</li>
            <li> Cotton Balls, Non-Sterile, Medium, 2000/Bag ...;  Item comes as describe;  price verses quality and quantity makes for an epic deal</li>
            <li> Very good, the balls are maybe a little smaller than I&#x27;d wanted.</li>
