            <li>it has a nice fragrance, but thats about it.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product, I was losing a lot of hair because of the chemicals that I put into my hair, but with the vitamins shampoo, I stopped losing hair really!</li>
            <li>Very pleased :-)</li>

            <li>I was so happy it was a miracle a dream come true</li>
            <li>After thinking about it for a minute I realized my hair was clean!!</li>
            <li>The sellers is great and quick to respond when you send them feedback.</li>
            <li>Very happy to get a good result even if it didn&#x27;t grow any back, we&#x27;ll take it!</li>

            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent shampoo, complete with ingredients....  </li>
            <li>So far, the NOURISH shampoo and vitamins have been awesome for my husband.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased &amp; loving my look fuller hair.</li>
            <li>the shampoo is light and smells good.  </li>
            <li>With the first shampooing I noticed my hair had a beautiful sheen and a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to be proven effective!!</li>
            <li>I decided to try VITAMINS shampoo as I have very fine hair and hoped it would boost the texture.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and have to color every two weeks.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally very fine</li>
            <li>I am over 50 and have very fine hair and am concerned about losing my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have growing strong and where it belongs- on my head!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>shampoo smells amazing and lathers better than most shampoos.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and goes on the hair easy.</li>
            <li>I was happy to read all the positive reviews and then I got my bottle and an email</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so maybe it would be better for someone that had thicker hair than I do.</li>
            <li>and I wished that I had a better opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>I have to color my hair more often.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love the vitamin hair growth shampoo, I have bought it for all 4 of my kids</li>
            <li>Motor oil would work better.  </li>
            <li>If the shampoo really does stimulate hair growth by 121% and reduce hair loss by 46%, I’d be happy.  </li>
            <li>I’m at the point where the cost of a good shampoo is worth it.  </li>
            <li>The best in its category after trying several</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a truly healthy hair product this ain&#x27;t it.    </li>
            <li>I love the lightness of the product, and the way it leaves the hair in a condition I have not seen in years.</li>
            <li>Oh, I almost forgot to mention the smell; it smells LOVELY.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see more results from this hair loss shampoo.</li>
            <li>, I have falling in shampoo love or heaven either</li>
            <li>The more I proceeded to touch my hair the more it bugged me.</li>
            <li>better yet, invest in this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this,  </li>
            <li>The shampoo seems to have a more drying effect on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to return and say how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping for more.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle of this Vitamins shampoo and I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>but I may need to keep using the product to see better results</li>
            <li>The only thing to watch out for is that this contains sulfates, which are not always the best for color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I had thicker strands, I would love it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell though.</li>
            <li>looks like 1&amp;#34; (maybe a bit more).  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser said my hair looked better.</li>
            <li>and i am getting many compliments in how my hair looks</li>
            <li>love love this product</li>
            <li>Excellent customer service after an initial issue</li>
            <li>The claim to help hair loss is too soon to review, however, I love the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many oils, shampoos and treatments but nothing worked for me.</li>
            <li>I have more fuller hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I would recommend this shampoo for more volume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>It makes it look more frizzy then anything.</li>
            <li>and I love the way my hair feels after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>OK, let&#x27;s do this.</li>
            <li>Hair looks healthy and shinier but did not improve the growth.</li>
            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>My hair immediately felt better and looked better using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair has grown so much I don&#x27;t have fly away hair anymore.</li>
            <li>It really leaves your hair smelling and looking great.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that I don&#x27;t have to use as many hair products as this shampoo gives my hair more texture and gives it a fuller, healthier look.</li>
            <li>or it would smell fruity (a concern for most guys).</li>
            <li>A lady saw me at the grocery store, and she said oh I love your hair</li>
            <li>I never had better if i get more money on my account</li>
            <li>i want to buy more i like it</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get better than that unless you&#x27;re talking about a federal barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shampoo received for sincere review.</li>
            <li>I think I have more body also</li>
            <li>I have lupus, more specifically systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease with ride-ranging effects and no known cure.</li>
            <li>bread &amp; butter of VITAMINS® shampoo is its claim that the ingredients used will promote hair growth; thus, without meeting this criteria, VITAMINS® would become nothing more than an overpriced shampoo.</li>
            <li>Most likely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>By week two, however, my hair felt thicker and had more body.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Before I used the product my hair was falling out where the top of my head was balding.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have tried many shampoos that claim they will help stop hair loss and help with thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Product was received for free in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Thus began my search that I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>I  Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>would say the overall texture and effect of the Vitamin shampoo is awesome.</li>
            <li>hair are more manageable.</li>
            <li>The hair are more smoother and softer once you apply in your hair and rinse it.</li>
            <li>I just want to keep touching my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>absolutely love the Vitamins Hair loss shampoo</li>
            <li>i felt my hair really healthy .I</li>
            <li>My hair is falling more than I would like.  </li>
            <li>Hair has more body.  </li>
            <li>Still, when I realized that I needed to invest in a better shampoo, after doing research, I came across this product.  </li>
            <li>, the fact that some of the proceeds goes to St. Jude Children&#x27;s Hospital is a plus and makes it all worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I’m glad I listened to my instincts because this stuff works and the way I see</li>
            <li>so glad I discovered this product.</li>
            <li>Anything you put on your body that is made to absorb needs to be just as safe as anything you ingest.</li>
            <li>My order arrived very promptly and the shampoo is packaged in an attractive bottle.  </li>
            <li>Love how my hair has gotten stronger, feels better and looks better</li>
            <li>I love the way this shampoo smells.</li>
            <li>My hair hadn&#x27;t been this healthy in years.  </li>
            <li>Ahhh I love this product.</li>
            <li>My research lead me to this product and it sounded reputable.</li>
            <li>It is better than Wen.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I don&#x27;t lose as many hair as I did before though</li>
            <li>but it might be because I am on a healthy diet</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I tried it</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t buy it any more</li>
            <li>I seriously love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair feels thicker and has more body but my favorite benefit is the shine.</li>
            <li>If you try this, just remember that the longer you use it then the more it helps.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not shedding all over the place and my hair has become more manageable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to continue to use with confidence I will see even better results.</li>
            <li>Oh also, I love that you don&#x27;t need a conditioner with it either</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love it it does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>I have had so many comments about my hair, just after 3 uses.</li>
            <li>I am very happy and relieved to find a product that is finally working out for me!  </li>
            <li>I really love how this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Again, love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a couple weeks now, and love it.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with Vitamins Shampoo.</li>
            <li>It also held the style better.  </li>
            <li>but I really love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more and I got an email from the company saying they are coming out with a volumizing conditioner to go with it</li>
            <li>I doubt if all the reviews posted here are authentic.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo and it made my hair grow</li>
            <li>I Love it please read my review on the vitamins.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident I will reach my hair goals using NOURISH BEAUTE Shampoo and Vitamins.  </li>
            <li>I love the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a picture of my hair, it looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love how it made my hair feel after one wash.</li>
            <li>When hair loss is happening more rapidly than replacement, we start to see thinning.</li>
            <li>I decided to keep taking it, mostly to see whether in combination, they would have any effect.  </li>
            <li>As a curly girl, I don&#x27;t use a brush, so most of my &amp;#34;hair loss&amp;#34; is visible in the shower -- the way some people would notice the build up in their hair brush.</li>
            <li>My stylist used to remark how healthy my hair looked as a result of no shampoo and no blow drying.</li>
            <li>Much better shampoo than I was expecting for price.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>HAS A NICE LIGHT SMELL</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I love that it lingers in my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping on better results as I continue using it.</li>
            <li>and we both love the way it makes our hair smell and feel and</li>
            <li>I use it three times a week and just love it.</li>
            <li>I got a trim at the beauty shop yesterday and they commented on how well my hair was growing out over the incisions and that i could still have bangs and the grown out side bangs still hide the shaved area which is 3/4 of an inch and more.</li>
            <li>we have not noticed a difference in hair length or texture yet, but it&#x27;s too soon to tell, so we will post again after a couple more months of use.  </li>
            <li>, they feel more manageable</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt more healthier.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT WORTH THE $</li>
            <li>The more i used i had like a film on my hair.</li>
            <li>i love the smell and the ease of putting it in my hair.</li>
            <li>It is pricey though but keys see the results  once use this more.</li>
            <li>I have been using for two weeks, my hair feels better as it is damaged.  </li>
            <li>My hair, skin and nails do feel stronger and my complexion looks a lot better.  </li>
            <li>so he gets it cut more often than before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad some people had results with it</li>
            <li>what a service and to top it</li>
            <li>It looks healthy, shiny and has stop falling quite a bit</li>
            <li>And I love love love this product.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping and good product</li>

            <li>Almost no perfumed fragrance, just a nice neutral smell, which is nice since I am sensitive to perfumes  CONs: --</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to those who are not too far along the balding process who are looking for something safe and fairly priced.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this is too good to be true</li>
            <li>He strongly approves of</li>
            <li>The scent is strong but not obnoxious.  </li>
            <li>Still a bit strong for me.  </li>

            <li>but with Vitamins Shampoo my hair was smooth and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Nourish Beaute has create a mindful and fine beauty and health product in VITAMINS Hair Loss Shampoo.</li>
            <li>He quickly reversed his opinion, probably sensing I didn&#x27;t want to be blamed for more stuff.</li>
            <li>received this super product in order to review it from the company--thank you!</li>
            <li>To me, it smells mildly of cedar!  </li>
            <li>Just as described and quick shipping!</li>
            <li>and I have noticed huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>As soon as I switched to another shampoo, I noticed a huge difference in the body of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I need to use it longer to make an accurate assessment.  </li>
            <li>It has made a huge turnaround in my hair FILLING OUT rather than FALLING OUT.  </li>
            <li>but I received this item free of charge in return for a review</li>
            <li>This has been such a great product for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting for the sulfate free shampoo, but will continue using this product until then.</li>
            <li>While I do not feel that this influenced me in any capacity, I am legally obligated to disclose this fact so that you can come to your own conclusions about the merit of this analysis.</li>
            <li>saying I could get a free bottle by giving a review.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if I&#x27;ll still get a free bottle?</li>
            <li>and now i get this Shampoo for free again in exchange of a review..</li>
            <li>The extra space won&#x27;t make anyone happy.</li>
            <li>Also, the free vitamins offer was no longer available even though I had bought the shampoo, so I can&#x27;t offer any comments on that.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and seems working, but feels greasy, so from time to time I need to wash hair again with different shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>And the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I hope this shampoo continues to be available forever.  </li>
            <li>So far si good.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light feel, and my hair hasn&#x27;t been breaking as much since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>

            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>

            <li>so far she likes the product, its light fragrance and good lather.  </li>
            <li>HELLO MY BEAUTIFUL SILKY LONG HAIR.</li>
            <li>Thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping me stop losing so much hair!!!</li>
            <li>this leaves a nice vibrant shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells very fresh and clean, it&#x27;s not flowery or fruity</li>
            <li>I am taking supplements for it and it has helped, BUT even with supplements, I still have to find a good quality shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry or add more damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>The product itself makes your hair feel clean,looks of a healthy shine, and smells pretty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the progress I will update.</li>
            <li>I noticed so much more hair lost within my first month of using it.</li>
            <li>Any woman out there going through this knows that you start to notice hair thinning significantly.  </li>
            <li>worth a try!</li>
            <li>I love how this shampoo and how it improved the feel of my hair since I first use.</li>
            <li>Rich.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soon for any hair growth, but I have already noticed a significant decrease in hair loss.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo  used first time today.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try it after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>First off I love the smell of it</li>
            <li>I was told to just wash it normally and let the glue come out on its own.</li>
            <li>and I have treated a lot of animals with significant wounds that could result in hair loss.</li>
            <li>Idk how long i have to used this to get great results.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>My hair brush was almost clean.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hair but by clean</li>
            <li>but they need to mention how clean it makes your hair.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>So is didn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean</li>
            <li>My hair is clean, and vey manageable.”</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and “earthy”, a cross between sandalwood, roses, and coconut.</li>
            <li>but I saw this lady with long hair.&amp;#34; Now, I cannot say, for sure, that this shampoo stopped my hair from falling out, and it has not stopped it completely--but it sure stopped falling out the way it was before!</li>
            <li>VITAMINS Hair Loss Shampoo is specially designed to promote hair growth and help prevent thinning and hair loss as well.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely soft and it makes my hair smells nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to try the product because this shampoo is packed with vitamins</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to use much to get a lather, and it smells very appealing.</li>
            <li>Thus, due to this aspect as well as the $40 price tag that is a smidgen too rich for my blood, I am happy to grant 4 stars to VITAMINS® shampoo by Nourish Beaut&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li>Thus, due to this aspect as well as the $40 price tag that is a smidgen too rich for my blood, I am happy to grant 4 stars to VITAMINS® shampoo by Nourish Beauté.</li>
            <li>so obviously that&#x27;s good for your hair and hair growth.</li>
            <li>I am a 45 year old woman trying to find any kind of shampoo that will help with my hair loss.</li>
            <li>Ordered this in May. Had been losing handfuls and brushes full of hair ever day for 4 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the results so far.</li>
            <li>After worked into a lather, the shampoo is pleasantly cool on the scalp, although milder than some eucalyptus oil-derived products.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much improvement and seems like I was having more hair come out in the shower.</li>
            <li>Still what shampoo does is good enough.</li>
            <li>I have used it once and after washing my hair the texture was nice and soft so that is a bonus.</li>
            <li>On those days my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as full.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a full head of hair</li>
            <li>, I searched for something like this and payed full price..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only fair to the product and to those reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>The time of year is more conducive to shedding (end of winter) and my diet is absolutely unchanged</li>
            <li>, therefore I&#x27;m gonna continue buying it till I see the full results.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have used it only one week--</li>
            <li>I will give it a 5 stars when I take both and see the full result</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;So far I am loving the products.</li>
            <li>Not bad....</li>
            <li>Not sure everyone would find this a good kind of body though.</li>
            <li>I opened the bottle and sniffed…hmmm, not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad quality product</li>
            <li>Of course dealing with unruly new growth isn&#x27;t really fun, it was nice to see that it does help with growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s like all the any other shampoo that&#x27;s  out there great smell but doesn&#x27;t make my hair grow or glow</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my hair loss has diminished tremendously.  </li>
            <li>ok I have been using this for about 4 months and the bottle is empty, It does smell nice</li>
            <li>I feel so lucky that I found VITAMINS.</li>
            <li>He was pressured from my older sister &amp; his wife to under go treatment against his better judgement &amp; mine.</li>
            <li>Any way ; when I took my shower and the strainer I placed in the drain of our RV quickly got clogged from all my hair</li>
            <li>It smells great and my hair is not only growing quicker but softer and much healthier</li>
            <li>Since using this shampoo, my hair has tremendously improved and is thicker.  </li>
            <li>The main ingredients include coconut oil, castor oil, Biotin, and Procapil (which I googled to learn more about).</li>
            <li>I was so excited, so I used the shampoo and took the vitamin right away.</li>
            <li>AS A MATTER OF FACT, MY HAIR WAS SHEDDING MORE THAN NORMAL.  </li>
            <li>It also appears to have more body then it normally does &amp;#60;- for this reason I have stated 4 stars.</li>
            <li>no heavy perfume scent just a clean refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>Hope they are able to come up with new formula.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very certain its not working at all for me and will be asking a full refund on it .</li>
            <li>Thank you much!!</li>
            <li>Have not had it long enough to see results but my hair has a better shine to it and shampoo smells great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, I rinsed forever thinking it wasn&#x27;t all out!</li>
            <li>I love the pleasant smell AND with fairly long hair, I have found no need for cream rinse like many other products.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Let me tell you when it came in the mail i washed my hair right away and after the first wash, my hair felt different in a good way.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it really did not do anything for me.</li>
            <li>It may contain too many oils especially if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely feel my hair has gotten stronger and the texture makes my fine hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>No more fly away hair, instead you get volume, shininess, and a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I thought it lathered nicely, quarter size I massage mainly focusing on the scalp, condition with my normal conditioner ( Dove ) .</li>
            <li>I was given a bottle to review because i have a thyroid condition (a LOT of hair loss) on top of being a woman of a certain age and my hair had really begun thinning out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for 2 months and the difference in my hair is not only noticeable but amazing</li>
            <li>Which is always fun to get.  </li>
            <li>Of course there are a lot of reasons for this, but one of them is that your hair has a natural growth cycle (which, for most people, lasts from 2-6 years).  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m really in love with it.</li>
            <li>How exciting is that?</li>
            <li>but I believe is worth it.</li>
            <li>I found it to be totally worth the money...</li>
            <li>Too early to tell, update after more use.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of hair care products and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so thrilled that VITAMINS shampoo helped regrow some of the recent loss.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and will purchase again.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m 54 and color my hair</li>
            <li>this is worth nevery penny,it works.</li>
            <li>I am completely surprised and pleased.</li>
            <li>it was safe and not harsh on my hair even with me dying it.</li>
            <li>I was worth buying</li>
            <li>It smells like old men cologne, made my hair come out even more and tangle up, and bottle was not filled(missing like 5 washes).</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait at least 6 months before writing anything so that I could be more sure, and I can honestly say that I have a new &amp;#34;crop&amp;#34; of hair on my head!  </li>
            <li>Well sure, it covered my stitches in a major artery!  </li>
            <li>I usually use NIOXIN shampoo as it claims to be good for fine thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>When i used the shampoo for the first time i didn&#x27;t use conditioner after and sure enough my hair was silky smooth.</li>
            <li>The order didn&#x27;t ship right away</li>
            <li>but right away I saw a difference.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>and I used it right away.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and gets my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>And I could honestly say that on the first use I saw a big difference  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been pretty satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Using to help hair grow back after chemotherapy, smells good, hair growing back is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so economical because just a small amount to damp would create bubbles right away, plus I love the scent too!!</li>
            <li>Combined with a formulation that only uses a small amount for each shampoo, the pleasant smell, and the undeniable effect of having thicker hair, I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who wants gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li>Combined with a formulation that only uses a small amount for each shampoo, the pleasant smell, and the undeniable effect of having thicker hair, I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who wants gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would really make my hair bouncy and full.</li>
            <li>and it had made my hair thick, beautiful, shiny, and reduced my split ends...</li>
            <li>I LOVE the fragrance and gentle cleansing it offers!</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean, smells nice, great lather, less breakage, but not a whole lot of new growth to</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful because there is a significant difference and my thick voluminous hair is now coming back to me.  </li>
            <li>I had a new primary physician who insisted on me having an MIR of my breast.</li>
            <li>Since I have medium-long hair that is all one length, I was able to check for new growth relatively easily; sliding my hands through it just now resulted in finding several strands that were shorter than the hairs around it.</li>
            <li>His hair is not quite as thick as with the Progain but definately the best alternative I have found so far.</li>
            <li>My hair was neither oily or dry after using this product, which was nice.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this stuff definitely works, it has really made a difference for me</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase again when need as I already see great result and it has only been a month.</li>
            <li>The shampoo makes my hair feel very soft and light weight.</li>
            <li>, I think this product is going to be best for people who have noticed a little thinning hair or want a little more length (but who are not at the point where they need prescription-strength help), and who are willing to give it a couple of weeks to really take</li>
            <li>I very much appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t contain hormones and is made in a USA FDA approved lab.</li>
            <li>I feel more comfortable using this hair growth shampoo over the other options out there.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for hard to grow hair.  </li>
            <li>Its better then being super flat but a bit much.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend so much on a shampoo but this one delivers!  </li>
            <li>Hopefully the ingredients will be of higher quality.</li>
            <li>After washing my hair, my hair feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel thicker the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I thought to myself my hair felt funny.</li>
            <li>This product actually didn&#x27;t do anything for me, but make me lose even more hair.</li>
            <li>Your hair absorbs the vitamins it needs while cleaning your hair at the same time...leaving it full-bodied and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair a lot easier to manage :) will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping my hair grows now ;)</li>
            <li>My hair is thicker in the back and front, but no regrowth occurred at the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on how shining and healthy my hair looks daily.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li>At his most recent haircut, he came home with his hair shorter but realized he didn&#x27;t have to worry about thinness showing - some had started to fill in; in fact, his hair seems thicker.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting them to respond that fast!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell about the hair growth yet will update with more information later.</li>
            <li>.women, not so much!</li>
            <li>and I am still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li>I will be using it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li>Btw, the item arrived as promised &amp; was packaged very well with NO leaking!</li>
            <li>what am I willing to do.</li>
            <li>It leathers up pretty well.</li>
            <li>am willing to re purchase.</li>
            <li>but my has not only been drier but seems to be coming out more.  </li>
            <li>It seems like the best method for hair loss are the &amp;#34;Big Three&amp;#34; unfortunately...</li>
            <li>This shampoo really works!</li>
            <li>With me, it is more age related</li>
            <li>I used the entire contents of the bottle and was pleased with the results; however, the cost of the shampoo made me hesitant to purchase again</li>
            <li>This absolutely doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>First things first:  </li>
            <li>I got my shampoo yesterday and I tried today morning for the first time.</li>
            <li>No smell, no collor, 10/10 for the first wash.</li>
            <li>I am still on my first bottle of using  this product  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that my hair was softer and shiner.</li>
            <li>Now I buy it regularly, and I my hair looks much better than 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo I will definitely be purchasing this again.  </li>
            <li>so you can well imagine how much research I must have done!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much thicker now!</li>
            <li>Thanks NOURISH Beauté!</li>
            <li>It is also shiny and healthy and for the first time in my life it actually has bounce.  </li>
            <li>First, I have curly hair, so I don&#x27;t wash it every day.</li>
            <li>and it looks (and behaves) exactly as it did without shampoo...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo for anyone trying to grow out their hair!!</li>
            <li>also the shine came back , I just feel My hair getting healthy as it was before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am surrounded by the pretty fragrance of VITAMINS shampoo, as I type this review.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>I think this is the first time I&#x27;ve written a product review.</li>
            <li>from the first time I used it my hair felt softer, fuller healthier</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle :)&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>left my hair greasy at the top of my scalp.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products that billed themselves as anti-hair-loss shampoos, and none made a significant change until this one.  </li>
            <li>I also use an after-shampoo conditioner with silk protein called Silk 18 Natural Conditioner By Maple Holistics which is Sulfate Free and has 18 Silk Amino Acids, Argan, Jojoba, and Keratin that may be helping eliminate hair breakage as well.  </li>
            <li>All-in-all the packaging and physical aspects of VITAMINS® shampoo are professional, pleasant, and does not sacrifice too much space in the valuable real estate of a bath/shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have long hair, very fine.</li>
            <li>It is VERY perfumey, so be aware if you have sensitive skin or do not like strong smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have purchased products from Amazon--from cereal to vacuum cleaner bags to shoes--for many years.</li>
            <li>I just love trying new and natural shampoos.</li>
            <li>The smell and the rich later if this shampoo with the other amazing benefits are well worth it!</li>
            <li>I was very depressed that I had bold stops that where very visible Infront of my hair</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s only two weeks in, so I&#x27;m very excited to see what it looks like in three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I asked for 1 bottled as a gift and received a total of 4, I&#x27;m soooooo glad that I did as I am positive</li>
            <li>After one week of daily use (daily use is probably too much for me now), I found my hair to be softer and more brush able</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthier although there is a lot of static when I use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>One other thing, I almost didn’t get this because of the one star reviews but after reading them I noticed that they looked kind of bogus.</li>
            <li>only it&#x27;s more lush and full.  </li>
            <li>Having seen much growth yet but it leaves my hair so soft and easy to manage, which I must say sometimes wasn&#x27;t easy with a short Afro.</li>
            <li>I am writing this review to receive future offers for giving my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is used as a treatment for men and women that is clinically proven to get results- naturally - with healthy patented ingredients plus natural biotin, coconut oil and castor oil.</li>
            <li>and I am finding  less hair loss and more shine!</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a pleasant scent &amp; lathered very well with a small amount being used.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this product after reading positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any positive change in my hairs.  </li>
            <li>From the first time I used it my hair was sooooooo much softer.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural product and has been the only thing that has actually worked.</li>
            <li>i like it because it is clear colour and clean really well without drying the</li>
            <li>Now when I blow dry my hair, it has much more volume.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say the amount of hair in the shower drain is about 75-80% less than before.  </li>
            <li>The first couple days my hair looked shiny and smooth but after using it for almost one month; I noticed that my falling hair issue is back.</li>
            <li>Definitely creates bias on whether or not this product is worth buying for others who pay full price.</li>
            <li>I tend to only review products I feel strongly about.  </li>
            <li>Their vitamins were a bit too strong - they contain 4000 mcg daily.</li>
            <li>but it certainly looks fuller.</li>
            <li>but certainly didn&#x27;t help any.</li>
            <li>Not a bad funny just funny as in different.</li>
            <li>Seriously this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>the first week, showering every other day, while my hair felt clean and my scalp had a cool sensation even a couple of hours post-application, I really did not notice any difference with my hair.</li>
            <li>My fine hair can&#x27;t take daily shampooing, so the effects may not be so immediate.</li>
            <li>It smells really really nice; however, I feel like the price should be a little bit lower.</li>
            <li>As far as results, too soon to tell, as I have only been using for a couple of weeks, but so far, love it!</li>
            <li>When I received this bottle of shampoo for review, I was surprised at how little shampoo it took to lather up a good amount.  </li>
            <li>Yes it is a bit more expensive but the product really is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and I was seeing huge clumps of hair every time I brushed or washed my hair.</li>
            <li>I waited before writing a review as I wanted to see if it actually worked and I have to say I feel this shampoo has been a HUGE help for me.</li>
            <li>So this morning when I was combing my hair I only saw about 4-5 strands come out and that for me is a huge difference from before.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect to see such a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>The result was huge vertical scars necessary for diagnosis of a life threatening illness.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>thanks anyways for letting me try it out</li>
            <li>Cost way too much.</li>
            <li>It really helps with growth while making it stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m real hopeful.</li>
            <li>Except it is very overpriced.  </li>
            <li>(the picture with straight hair is the updated one).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it helping that much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 2 months and there isn&#x27;t much of a difference</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.weeks to really take</li>
            <li>Have not seen much difference yet</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Still hair in my brush, but again, not as much.  </li>
            <li>This product has done so much for my hair</li>
            <li>I can really see a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>but my hair feels and looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really make my hair grow longer.</li>
            <li>The company is really customer service driven as I asked a question on their website and received an answer to my question within an hour of asking the question.</li>
            <li>AT ALL after using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>and I get complements all the time on how much hair I have.</li>
            <li>Thanks for listening.</li>
            <li>Gave it a four because haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement on my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this along with taking hair vitamins, and my hair has grown much faster.</li>
            <li>This product really does work well.</li>
            <li>It cleansed my hair very well...</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews of this shampoo I was really exited to try it out.</li>
            <li>hey, &amp;#34;point this light at your head, and hair will grow&amp;#34; is not much different from &amp;#34;rub</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My dermatologist didn&#x27;t really say much about whether or not I can regrow my hair, but I am hoping that this shampoo improves my hair thickness when I have used it longer.</li>
            <li>I am also not seeing much of a change with the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>but almost 6 months ago I felt I am losing to much hair.</li>
            <li>I see a whole a lot of hair there.</li>
            <li>My hair are growing fast.</li>
            <li>If it really makes my hair grow faster</li>
            <li>so I did not expect much of the miracle.  </li>
            <li>My hair still continues to fall out, this year has thinned out too much.</li>
            <li>Vitamiins Noursh Beate Hair growth shampoo Really works.</li>
            <li>My hair was thinning out so much</li>
            <li>My hair is not falling as much.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>but it is a very sleek bottle and</li>
            <li>It really seems to make my hair feel fuller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning this shampoo, $40 is just too much to throw in the garbage.</li>
            <li>Well worth it so far.  </li>
            <li>So after much research on Amazon I decided to buy Nourish Vitamins hair growth support SHAMPOO......</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy, wax covered or as if I&#x27;ve used too much product, so no worries there, just an observation during use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied</li>
            <li>I  only use chemical free products.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much as it used to.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>really have to try this.</li>
            <li>I notice my hair is not falling out as much</li>
            <li>and I feel that it is much thicker and fuller when I style my hair.</li>
            <li>BUT, my hair feels and looks so much thicker, and I didn&#x27;t expect this.</li>
            <li>I really like how this shampoo leaves my hair.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely works.</li>
            <li>I know that the product must not be anything but gentle.</li>
            <li>the owner of the company has been very helpful in email communication about the product.</li>
            <li>Cosmeseutical  grow fast shampoo, cost $9.00 dollar.</li>
            <li>so I can can start and really see the effect on both.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much fullness in my hair yet</li>
            <li>It works ok but not what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s continually growing and I haven&#x27;t even consumed the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of change.</li>
            <li>I advise anyone who wants to buy it don&#x27;t be hesitant..</li>
            <li>Shipping is fast....</li>
            <li>I am now near the end of the bottle and since using this shampoo my hair has totally changed for the better.  </li>
            <li>Let me first say that I have slightly more knowledge about hair loss than the average person.</li>
            <li>I also have a rare form of alopecia which causes total pigment loss and baldness in one spot of my head- right in front!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did a good job cleaning scalp and hair;I only wish you made a healthier formula without the sodium laurel sulphates,phtlates and other chemical additives.</li>
            <li>To have a product gentle enough to heal a significant incision and still get growth amazed me</li>
            <li>So...to get the best results from this shampoo, I recommend washing your hair every day or at least every other day.</li>
            <li>I have had no negative effects-but I&#x27;m not 100% positive yet.</li>
            <li>It was also kind of straw like and wouldnt grow past a certain point.</li>
            <li>The thing about long hair is, though, that it&#x27;s much thicker at the top and by the time you get to the ends, it has thinned out considerably.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be checking back to read some of your success stories!</li>
            <li>This product caused extreme snarls, lost more hair by using this.</li>
            <li>it looks a lot better and It feels like it was cleaner than what it was getting with other shampoos</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is assisting with faster growth, but happy to have hair start growing back.</li>
            <li>I used to have to clean out my hair brushes CONSTANTLY.</li>
            <li>I was under the impression that the active ingredients in the shampoo (coupled with the Biotin) would do more to stimulate growth rather than stave off loss.</li>
            <li>It seriously hasnt looked this good in years.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for these products since my hair has been thinning and the reviews seemed promising.</li>
            <li>I was in crisis, so I bought this, but I also started taking the herb, saw palmetto, and in the beginning I used some well-reviewed hair growth oils, regularly, as well as aloe, and rosemary rinses (which I would leave in for hours at a time), and I made special treatments, and I rinsed with organic apple cider vinegar, baking soda, and I took biotin and Vitamin D and C, and all kinds of maca powder, gelatin, supplements</li>
            <li>I have tried a few of these shampoos and this one is the best in my experience, i can see a difference and the bottle is only 1/2 way empty</li>
            <li>So Thank you for making this Available to us,as long as this is around i will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li>and I have dark hair and am seeing more gray faster.  </li>
            <li>but you just need a small dab, it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>So far, this is the first thing that has lived up to its promise.</li>
            <li>or is the SLS the main ingredient?</li>
            <li>As we grow older,  out hair is one to experience changes too.  </li>
            <li>As a shampoo it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>At this point I&#x27;m going to give the shampoo to a female relative who has a MUCH more severe hair thinning issue.</li>
            <li>was lucky enough to get the vitamins hair loss shampoo as part of a promotion in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ll update my review later), but I&#x27;ve used this product for a few days now and my hair smells really good and does seem shinier than normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My fair was fuller and healthier after using the product only a few times.</li>
            <li>Hair now much shinier and soft...makes ageing hair look young again!</li>
            <li>and I hadn&#x27;t really noticed how drastic my results were until I looked at my before pic, wow!</li>
            <li>In fact, the FDA approval of the lupus medication Benlysta® in 2011 marked the first time since 1955 that a new treatment for lupus came to be; in the interim, patients deal with the myriad symptoms through a combination of therapies.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these products and I will keep using myself.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I was on beta-blocker high blood pressure medication for 3 years.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those who are experiencing  hair loss.</li>
            <li>I recommended highly to man and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a little bit of a difference - glad</li>
            <li>My hair now looks like it did a decade ago, with little visible thinning at the top or the crown.  </li>
            <li>My hair is noticeably more manageable, and perhaps a little thicker.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really has helped my 60 year old thinning hair regrow itself.</li>
            <li>and I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing much or any change so far.</li>
            <li>is dry, so I have to wash them every day to make me feel like I have clean hair;&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It really leaves my hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>(It&#x27;ll take awhile to see the full effects, though, because my hair is so long.)  </li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t had trouble in that regard, but many people with color-treated hair avoid sulfates.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got my long hair back</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft and smooth in a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you and I wish you a big success ,&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good, only a few days using and can see a decrease in hair loss after washing.  </li>
            <li>But after a few weeks, when I saw that it was much better, I stopped most of the other treatments and just kept using this shampoo, and I kept taking the saw palmetto, biotin, and some multiple vitamins, and it has continued to grow fast and stay very thick, full, and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes for new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well, and gives my hair a little bit more shine and fullness, as well as making it very soft.</li>
            <li>MaximumHair.com reports that SLS also affects the rate of new hair growth, which occurs at a rate about eight times slower than normal.</li>
            <li>he pulled his hand away, saying something like &amp;#34;ulllUGH!&amp;#34; I literally had to wash my hair right after using it because I couldn&#x27;t leave my house with my hair looking that gross.</li>
            <li>The picture on the left was taken today and the one on the right was taken the day I got the shampoo</li>
            <li>There is always a search for the next great shampoo that helps with weak or receding hair problems.  </li>
            <li>He had also given me free perks other (products).</li>
            <li>The only thing I disliked was that the shampoo bottle does not come completely filled, it was about 8/10ths full and for a $50 bottle</li>
            <li>and I see new hair growing.</li>
            <li>Will be keeping my eye out for the new formula.</li>
            <li>I do have some new hair come in, but not where I need it to.  </li>
            <li>I DIDN&#x27;T SEE ANY NEW GROWTH,</li>
            <li>I think, I do have new hair growth</li>
            <li>My stylist said she can tell I have some new growth.</li>
            <li>and i have new baby hairs growing out as well</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any new hair growth at this point.</li>
            <li>I live in the non-moisture land of Colorado.  </li>
            <li>After one month of using the shampoo I can feel new hair coming in the front.  </li>
            <li>I will give it time to see if there is any new hair growth.</li>
            <li>Also I see new hair growing.</li>
            <li>Brought this shampoo hoping for new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>and I have new growth coming in all over.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for new growth</li>
            <li>I have new regrowth in the crown area and my hair has grown substantially within the pass 30 days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if I get new hair growth.</li>
            <li>My crown is fuller with baby hair, which is a sign of new hair regrowth.</li>
            <li>As of today, I am one month into new hair growth (two weeks using the VITAMINS brand).  </li>
            <li>i could see new Hairs on my Scalp.</li>
            <li>I truly didn&#x27;t realize how well this shampoo worked but am glad I spent the extra money to purchase it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially since I&#x27;m pregnant and instead of my hair actually growing it fell out and got very stringy.</li>
            <li>and if I have seen any new growth as it is still early to comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this combination of Nourish Shampoo and Vitamins to anyone who is loosing hair.....</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell, does leave my hair feeling very soft and manageable but did not stop me from loosing hair.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work and perhaps in the long run it would have been beneficial but simply did not wash out clean.</li>
            <li>I wrote a review several months ago when I first received this product.  </li>
            <li>Well, although I do not wash my hair daily, like bottle states, I noticed the first week of use, that when I combed my hair, NOTHING came out.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spring for other hair regrowth products because so many people mention hair falling out in clumps or, once they stopped using the product, their hair just reverted back to pre-treatment, if not worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus It made my hair completely soft!</li>
            <li>I ordered my first bottle through Amazon about 6 months ago, and my hair salon stylist said my last 3 visits, girl your hair is growing a lot!!!</li>
            <li>Let me first say two things; I&amp;#34;m only 6 weeks into my usage</li>
            <li>makes my hair seem fuller and is not harsh!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>but so far it has my highest praise!</li>
            <li>First off my hair was thinning too because of all my red dye I was doing</li>
            <li>We can shed more hair than usual because of age, stress, diet, or hormones.</li>
            <li>her hair is healthy but does not grow past jaw length.  </li>
            <li>much less hair loss and the texture of my hair is so soft and full of body!</li>
            <li>yet I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is not dry, slightly fuller, shinier, but mostly healthier.</li>
            <li>There was also less hair in my hair brush, and I stopped finding individual strands of hair that had fallen out of my head in between shampoos (my hair is more than 2 feet long, so it&#x27;s easy to notice individual strands when they&#x27;re not attached to my head).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on ANYTHING, but thought I would for this product due to the quick difference I noticed with my hair.  </li>
            <li>There have been times when I have been out of town and had to use other shampoo and conditioner and that&#x27;s when I could really tell how much VHLS really works.</li>
            <li>And new hairs grow naturally.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to make a HUGE difference, but I do feel stubble where I didn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li>but I just put a little leave in conditioner and I am fine.</li>
            <li>It is pure white.</li>
            <li>I would certainly purchase from him again in the near future.</li>
            <li>but surely it&#x27;s getting back to normal, and my bald cow lick is getting smaller as well!</li>
            <li>The fact that it was wielded by a neurosurgeon, guided by ultrasound was completely reassuring medically but hair considerations, not so much.</li>
            <li>So far my husband likes it.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients in this bottle are natural oils that are moisturizing for your hair WITHOUT damaging your hair.</li>
            <li>(And yes, I lathered very well for several minutes, let it sit a while, rinsed well, and didn&#x27;t use conditioner after.)</li>
            <li>and he was completely grossed out...</li>
            <li>I am a 50 year old woman who is going through menopause.  </li>
            <li>Ive just started using it, it makes my hair frizzy so far.</li>
            <li>I will always stick to natural remedies instead of prescription pills.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young woman in her 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had noticeable regrowth (nor do I expect it so early in)</li>
            <li>(Not that much has grown back already!</li>
            <li>So far been using it a couple weeks</li>
            <li>my hair was soft and manageable after it dryied it wasn&#x27;t oily at all.  </li>
            <li>But now it finally grew there thanks to the product.</li>
            <li>I did not know this lady ,but wow that shampoo must be working for me.</li>
            <li>So why are we dying young and suffer from diabetes,  fibromyalgia,  lupus and autism?</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>® shampoo surprised me; it truly does work.</li>
            <li>® shampoo surprised me; it truly does work.</li>
            <li>One week later, when I saw her, her hair is thicker than it really is.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell about that.</li>
            <li>So far it has been 4 weeks</li>
            <li>It is a bit early to tell</li>
            <li>Soft, shiny, moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt with the effect I have seen so far that my hair will continue grow</li>
            <li>Mske hair soft and silky</li>
            <li>Was almost wondering if I needed conditioner after because of how soft my hair felt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavily scented or medicinal smelling either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I cannot tell amy difference,.</li>
            <li>is has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>My hair has thinned considerably since I&#x27;ve done keratin to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Early on, when I would condition my hair, I would end up with A LOT of hair in my hands after running the conditioner out.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft and shiny, just what I wanted</li>
            <li>To early to tell if it will help hair growth</li>
            <li>this product was purchased for my daughter, who is 12 and has had short hair her whole life.  </li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s the nicest shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I didnt notice much growth and my hair still look the same.</li>
            <li>So far I like how it smells and how it leaves my hair feeling.</li>
            <li>As someone with sensitive skin and recognizing that what you put on your skin (scalp) goes into your bloodstream, I want to avoid these chemicals.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>I have to give this shampoo a three only because I do not wash my everyday as stated, but I am hoping that it will eventually help with getting my hair healthy and help it grow.</li>
            <li>It started to thin very noticeably around my temples and the front top.</li>
            <li>about 3 + weeks after I can surely say that I am seeing less and less hair fall, which is a big deal for me, as anyone who is loosing hair knows how much it hurts to see your hair on the comb and on the pillow case!!  </li>
            <li>What a great experience I had with vitamin shampoo , I try different shampo in the past none works for me, finally I got what I was looking for for a long time !!</li>
            <li>Due to IV medications i have noticed that the Hair strainer in my Tub was filling up fast ,i started to get very upset .I</li>
            <li>Finally, I wanted to use it for a long enough period of time that I could accurately assess any changes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed with the thickness and texture it leaves my normally limp, dry, thin hair in.</li>
            <li>In one week of use, I have noticed a steady decline in the amount of hair loss when I shampoo, to the point of no loss during the last shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It took a few days of really scrubbing this into my scalp, but pretty soon, I noticed fewer hairs coming out as I shampooed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m approaching 50 and have notice my hair mainly in the crown area thinning and falling out rapidly.  </li>
            <li>As you have no doubt surmised, all forms of lupus are known to cause hair loss in some patients, and while not as horrific as other aspects of the disease, having beautiful hair is very important for self-confidence, as well as a positive mental outlook, possibly more so than having scars, rashes, or other noticeable physical symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it may be due to me thyroid medication being lowered to keep my thyroid at the right level.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes, but didn&#x27;t see any difference from regular shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was sending out a major Ethan-Hawke-in-the-90s vibe!</li>
            <li>Spent over 45 Dollars for this shampoo and so far I have not received any positive results.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading my long winded kudos for this product.</li>
            <li>I got this product because my husband likes long hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t grow very well.</li>
            <li>Now they are all longer and my daily hair loss is once again normal.</li>
            <li>I first started using this product to assess its performance, I was careful to include my boyfriend’s “analysis” of my hair to curtail the “Placebo Effect”.</li>
            <li>and I got this shampoo to help with getting my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had fine hair all through my life, but it only started giving me trouble in college</li>
            <li>Certainly he has stopped losing hair when brushing it, anyway, which was a big enough difference to encourage him.  </li>
            <li>I have hypothyroidism, and for several years a large amount of hair would be left in my comb when combing it out after shampooing.  </li>
            <li>After just a few shampoos, and 5 days of taking 1 NOURISH vitamin a day, I honestly wondered if I was imagining what I saw because the changes in my hair were so immediate and noticeable; thicker, shinier and little to no hair loss in the shower drain or after combing.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on several new shampoos and chose this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and definitely see lots of new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Me and my son are using the product, but only time will tell with new products.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>I definitely  notice new hair growth on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li>I have no idea what the long-term effects will be (new hair growth, I hope?), but the short-term impact is terrific.</li>
            <li>While I do not feel that this influenced me in any capacity, I am legally obligated to disclose this fact so that you can come to your own conclusions about the merit of this analysis.**me want to embrace my “natural” hair and just live with the painful effects of my lupus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While some of these are no doubt from “regular” growth patterns, the sheer number have me convinced that VITAMINS® shampoo really does work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also wear my hair up in a tight bun for work and don&#x27;t wash my hair every day and after the second day of no wash my hair still looked and felt just as clean.</li>
            <li>Those other shampoos that promise volume really have no idea!</li>
            <li>Follow the diretions and only use a little bit for a rich lather.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this shampoo, I had a lot of appointments to go to, so I was washing my hair every other day.  </li>
            <li>In short, hair loss is a function of two things: the natural shedding of hair that each person goes through daily and the degree to which new hair grows to take its place.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is gentle on my scalp, which is really sensitive due to the fact that I have seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>started using this and within two weeks my shower was no longer clogging, the clumps were no longer running down my leg and by the end of the month my temples were no longer looking so bare and the top was looking a little fuller.</li>
            <li>One is looking for a positive result based on other reviews and what the owner is promoting.  </li>
            <li>After approximately 4 weeks I noticed fine new hairs staring to sprout.</li>
            <li>the reason for 4 stars is I have not used it long enough to know if it will really work.</li>
            <li>Here are some observations: it is a clear shampoo and comes in a simple bottle so the money goes into the product and not into fancy marketing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 years old and my hair is starting to thing.</li>
            <li>Got to try this for a reduce price and in return I would provide an host review; I&#x27;ve only used this shampoo a fews times so far</li>
            <li>My barber said I was in the early stages of male pattern baldness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used once so far, but will update this review after a couple of months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times, so I&#x27;m not seeing anything as far as hair thickness yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second day (for the shampoo) and so far I see the difference of my hair already</li>
            <li>This product actually works, I bought it for my boyfriend and he&#x27;s liking it so far</li>
            <li>I had to try something and choose this product I tried this because all the ingredients where natural so at the end it did work everybody started to notice a big difference and made my self esteem go up</li>
            <li>I barely even need to use conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am sure time will tell how it does on helping any hair loss, I have a thyroid issue and even though I do not have an issue with baldness, my hair does thin out.  </li>
            <li>He mentioned how thick, full, and soft his hair is now.</li>
            <li>I see new hair growing in my hair line and my wife tells me the spot in the back is growing back too.  </li>
            <li>However,  lately my hair has been starting to fall out again, but more its been flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li>Husband was very cynical about this natural product, but just asked me to reorder because it has greatly reduced the amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li>but I did not like many of the unnecessary chemical ingredients such as sulfates damaging and drying to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Contacted them for refund based on their 100% Money Back guarantee, and thus far they have ignored my request.</li>
            <li>a result of the thinning of my hair due to my disease, it wasn’t unusual for me to see decently-sized clumps coming out with every shower.</li>
            <li>how much of this DHT blocker is being used as an active ingredient?</li>
            <li>Normally, that is very difficult to remove, but this shampoo gets it out quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair - kind of expensive</li>
            <li>The shampoo does not dry it out at all</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling a little sticky at first.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to use this shampoo, my hair&#x27;s texture is soft and less tangle.</li>
            <li>The lather is rich; a little bit goes a VERY long way, which is especially beneficial as each bottle costs $40.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to explain this, because my assumption, in fact, was that my hair would GROW MORE, not that I would SHED LESS.</li>
            <li>The first week i noticed less Hair in the Tub strainer by the second week</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy, dry, medium coarse hair; lately, I have also experienced hair loss.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural, no harsh chemicals like other hair growth shampoos.</li>
            <li>My hair is fairly long and naturally wavy.</li>
            <li>In the first few months of that joyous ride, I lost about 2/3rds of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I noticed I didn&#x27;t even have to use my detangle because I didn&#x27;t have all the snags and knots that I normally get with my hair when it is wet.</li>
            <li>EmbelLASH or NaturalLASH by Protege at Amazon (which has made a major difference in my eyebrows growing back in after hypothyroidism resulted in loosing the outer one third).</li>
            <li>I been using this product for a little over a month and just realized that the length is cut off when I first bought the product already grew back!!!!</li>
            <li>I mean for once all of the product was out of my hair and all that was left was clean hair, instead of washed hair with product still in it,</li>
            <li>My hair was very damaged from bleaching it and doing the ombr&amp;eacute; and then back to dark etc...</li>
            <li>The shampoo worked in the first few days only, then for the rest, it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>so, clearly, I have no new hair growth already.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shinier and far, far less prone to frizziness.</li>
            <li>and that is far, far less.</li>
            <li>It took many weeks of use, but slowly I started to notice less hair ending up in my hands after conditioning.</li>
            <li>my hair is thin and fine</li>
            <li>I have really short/fine hair that has thinned a little after three babies.  </li>
            <li>My Hair , thin and fine under regular circumstances was worn shoulder length blunt cut.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very thick and shiny - makes it feel fantastic</li>
            <li>I had so much hair regrowth that I had short little hairs growing like a halo.</li>

            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> it is great, my hair becomes more shinier and has more balance.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t even read the bottle when I received it just put in in my tub</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how it got so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> it has a nice fragrance, but thats about it.</li>
            <li> but honestly I have not seen a difference.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice smell which is a plus</li>
            <li> Either way, I end up spending a lot of money trying to disguise the fine/thin combo and honestly, it&#x27;s taken</li>
            <li> shampoo has nice consistency.</li>
            <li> It has nice scent into.</li>
            <li> It has a nice mountain sent.</li>
            <li> In that sense I felt kind of cheated, if the quantity that is in there is 10 oz</li>
            <li> I was honestly getting nervous.</li>
            <li> I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo, leaves my hair with a nice feel.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo</li>

            <li> The shampoo has a nice lather and does not leave residue in my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It is one of a kind.</li>
            <li> I feel as if I am being treated at a spa and that my hair is being gently coaxed to its best condition.&lt;br /&gt;The phenomenon of not losing my hair is amazing.</li>
            <li> When you put it on it lathers up nicely</li>

            <li> It would be nice if the manufacturers would re-formulate.</li>
            <li> I am very Greatful for the seller of this wonderful Shampoo</li>
            <li> I use it every three days, and honestly, I have not noticed any changes.  </li>
            <li> but none is effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, I was losing a lot of hair because of the chemicals that I put into my hair, but with the vitamins shampoo, I stopped losing hair really!</li>
            <li> Very pleased :-)</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a lot of very famous ingredients for healthy hair and prevention of hair loss.</li>
            <li> I was so happy it was a miracle a dream come true</li>
            <li> After thinking about it for a minute I realized my hair was clean!!</li>
            <li> The sellers is great and quick to respond when you send them feedback.</li>
            <li> Very happy to get a good result even if it didn&#x27;t grow any back, we&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any real significant growth yet, but</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and wonderful.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo, complete with ingredients....  </li>
            <li> So far, the NOURISH shampoo and vitamins have been awesome for my husband.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased &amp; loving my look fuller hair.</li>
            <li> the shampoo is light and smells good.  </li>
            <li> With the first shampooing I noticed my hair had a beautiful sheen and a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to be proven effective!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try VITAMINS shampoo as I have very fine hair and hoped it would boost the texture.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and have to color every two weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very fine</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have very fine hair and am concerned about losing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have growing strong and where it belongs- on my head!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> shampoo smells amazing and lathers better than most shampoos.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and goes on the hair easy.</li>
            <li> I was happy to read all the positive reviews and then I got my bottle and an email</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> so maybe it would be better for someone that had thicker hair than I do.</li>
            <li> and I wished that I had a better opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> I have to color my hair more often.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love the vitamin hair growth shampoo, I have bought it for all 4 of my kids</li>
            <li> Motor oil would work better.  </li>
            <li> If the shampoo really does stimulate hair growth by 121% and reduce hair loss by 46%, I’d be happy.  </li>
            <li> I’m at the point where the cost of a good shampoo is worth it.  </li>
            <li> The best in its category after trying several</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a truly healthy hair product this ain&#x27;t it.    </li>
            <li> I love the lightness of the product, and the way it leaves the hair in a condition I have not seen in years.</li>
            <li> Oh, I almost forgot to mention the smell; it smells LOVELY.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see more results from this hair loss shampoo.</li>
            <li> , I have falling in shampoo love or heaven either</li>
            <li> The more I proceeded to touch my hair the more it bugged me.</li>
            <li> better yet, invest in this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this,  </li>
            <li> The shampoo seems to have a more drying effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to return and say how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping for more.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this Vitamins shampoo and I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li> but I may need to keep using the product to see better results</li>
            <li> The only thing to watch out for is that this contains sulfates, which are not always the best for color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I had thicker strands, I would love it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell though.</li>
            <li> looks like 1&amp;#34; (maybe a bit more).  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser said my hair looked better.</li>
            <li> and i am getting many compliments in how my hair looks</li>
            <li> love love this product</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service after an initial issue</li>
            <li> The claim to help hair loss is too soon to review, however, I love the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many oils, shampoos and treatments but nothing worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have more fuller hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I would recommend this shampoo for more volume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> It makes it look more frizzy then anything.</li>
            <li> and I love the way my hair feels after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> OK, let&#x27;s do this.</li>
            <li> Hair looks healthy and shinier but did not improve the growth.</li>
            <li> Love love love it.</li>
            <li> My hair immediately felt better and looked better using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair has grown so much I don&#x27;t have fly away hair anymore.</li>
            <li> It really leaves your hair smelling and looking great.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that I don&#x27;t have to use as many hair products as this shampoo gives my hair more texture and gives it a fuller, healthier look.</li>
            <li> or it would smell fruity (a concern for most guys).</li>
            <li> A lady saw me at the grocery store, and she said oh I love your hair</li>
            <li> I never had better if i get more money on my account</li>
            <li> i want to buy more i like it</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get better than that unless you&#x27;re talking about a federal barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shampoo received for sincere review.</li>
            <li> I think I have more body also</li>
            <li> I have lupus, more specifically systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease with ride-ranging effects and no known cure.</li>
            <li> bread &amp; butter of VITAMINS® shampoo is its claim that the ingredients used will promote hair growth; thus, without meeting this criteria, VITAMINS® would become nothing more than an overpriced shampoo.</li>
            <li> Most likely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> By week two, however, my hair felt thicker and had more body.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Before I used the product my hair was falling out where the top of my head was balding.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I have tried many shampoos that claim they will help stop hair loss and help with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Product was received for free in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Thus began my search that I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> I  Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> would say the overall texture and effect of the Vitamin shampoo is awesome.</li>
            <li> hair are more manageable.</li>
            <li> The hair are more smoother and softer once you apply in your hair and rinse it.</li>
            <li> I just want to keep touching my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> absolutely love the Vitamins Hair loss shampoo</li>
            <li> i felt my hair really healthy .I</li>
            <li> My hair is falling more than I would like.  </li>
            <li> Hair has more body.  </li>
            <li> Still, when I realized that I needed to invest in a better shampoo, after doing research, I came across this product.  </li>
            <li> , the fact that some of the proceeds goes to St. Jude Children&#x27;s Hospital is a plus and makes it all worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I’m glad I listened to my instincts because this stuff works and the way I see</li>
            <li> so glad I discovered this product.</li>
            <li> Anything you put on your body that is made to absorb needs to be just as safe as anything you ingest.</li>
            <li> My order arrived very promptly and the shampoo is packaged in an attractive bottle.  </li>
            <li> Love how my hair has gotten stronger, feels better and looks better</li>
            <li> I love the way this shampoo smells.</li>
            <li> My hair hadn&#x27;t been this healthy in years.  </li>
            <li> Ahhh I love this product.</li>
            <li> My research lead me to this product and it sounded reputable.</li>
            <li> It is better than Wen.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I don&#x27;t lose as many hair as I did before though</li>
            <li> but it might be because I am on a healthy diet</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I tried it</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t buy it any more</li>
            <li> I seriously love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair feels thicker and has more body but my favorite benefit is the shine.</li>
            <li> If you try this, just remember that the longer you use it then the more it helps.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not shedding all over the place and my hair has become more manageable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to continue to use with confidence I will see even better results.</li>
            <li> Oh also, I love that you don&#x27;t need a conditioner with it either</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Love it it does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I have had so many comments about my hair, just after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> I am very happy and relieved to find a product that is finally working out for me!  </li>
            <li> I really love how this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Again, love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a couple weeks now, and love it.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with Vitamins Shampoo.</li>
            <li> It also held the style better.  </li>
            <li> but I really love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more and I got an email from the company saying they are coming out with a volumizing conditioner to go with it</li>
            <li> I doubt if all the reviews posted here are authentic.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and it made my hair grow</li>
            <li> I Love it please read my review on the vitamins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident I will reach my hair goals using NOURISH BEAUTE Shampoo and Vitamins.  </li>
            <li> I love the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a picture of my hair, it looks fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love how it made my hair feel after one wash.</li>
            <li> When hair loss is happening more rapidly than replacement, we start to see thinning.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep taking it, mostly to see whether in combination, they would have any effect.  </li>
            <li> As a curly girl, I don&#x27;t use a brush, so most of my &amp;#34;hair loss&amp;#34; is visible in the shower -- the way some people would notice the build up in their hair brush.</li>
            <li> My stylist used to remark how healthy my hair looked as a result of no shampoo and no blow drying.</li>
            <li> Much better shampoo than I was expecting for price.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> HAS A NICE LIGHT SMELL</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I love that it lingers in my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping on better results as I continue using it.</li>
            <li> and we both love the way it makes our hair smell and feel and</li>
            <li> I use it three times a week and just love it.</li>
            <li> I got a trim at the beauty shop yesterday and they commented on how well my hair was growing out over the incisions and that i could still have bangs and the grown out side bangs still hide the shaved area which is 3/4 of an inch and more.</li>
            <li> we have not noticed a difference in hair length or texture yet, but it&#x27;s too soon to tell, so we will post again after a couple more months of use.  </li>
            <li> , they feel more manageable</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt more healthier.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT WORTH THE $</li>
            <li> The more i used i had like a film on my hair.</li>
            <li> i love the smell and the ease of putting it in my hair.</li>

            <li> I would recommend this to those who are not too far along the balding process who are looking for something safe and fairly priced.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this is too good to be true</li>
            <li> He strongly approves of</li>

            <li> Whatever new shampoo you are using, stay with it!&amp;#34;  My hair is in good shape....</li>

            <li> but with Vitamins Shampoo my hair was smooth and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Nourish Beaute has create a mindful and fine beauty and health product in VITAMINS Hair Loss Shampoo.</li>

            <li> To me, it smells mildly of cedar!  </li>
            <li> Just as described and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> and I have noticed huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> As soon as I switched to another shampoo, I noticed a huge difference in the body of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I need to use it longer to make an accurate assessment.  </li>
            <li> It has made a huge turnaround in my hair FILLING OUT rather than FALLING OUT.  </li>
            <li> but I received this item free of charge in return for a review</li>
            <li> This has been such a great product for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting for the sulfate free shampoo, but will continue using this product until then.</li>
            <li> While I do not feel that this influenced me in any capacity, I am legally obligated to disclose this fact so that you can come to your own conclusions about the merit of this analysis.</li>
            <li> saying I could get a free bottle by giving a review.  </li>

            <li> and now i get this Shampoo for free again in exchange of a review..</li>
            <li> The extra space won&#x27;t make anyone happy.</li>
            <li> Also, the free vitamins offer was no longer available even though I had bought the shampoo, so I can&#x27;t offer any comments on that.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and seems working, but feels greasy, so from time to time I need to wash hair again with different shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> And the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I hope this shampoo continues to be available forever.  </li>

            <li> Thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping me stop losing so much hair!!!</li>
            <li> this leaves a nice vibrant shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells very fresh and clean, it&#x27;s not flowery or fruity</li>
            <li> I am taking supplements for it and it has helped, BUT even with supplements, I still have to find a good quality shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry or add more damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> The product itself makes your hair feel clean,looks of a healthy shine, and smells pretty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the progress I will update.</li>
            <li> I noticed so much more hair lost within my first month of using it.</li>
            <li> Any woman out there going through this knows that you start to notice hair thinning significantly.  </li>
            <li> worth a try!</li>
            <li> I love how this shampoo and how it improved the feel of my hair since I first use.</li>
            <li> Rich.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon for any hair growth, but I have already noticed a significant decrease in hair loss.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo  used first time today.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try it after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> First off I love the smell of it</li>
            <li> I was told to just wash it normally and let the glue come out on its own.</li>
            <li> and I have treated a lot of animals with significant wounds that could result in hair loss.</li>
            <li> Idk how long i have to used this to get great results.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li> My hair brush was almost clean.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair but by clean</li>
            <li> but they need to mention how clean it makes your hair.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> So is didn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean</li>
            <li> My hair is clean, and vey manageable.”</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and “earthy”, a cross between sandalwood, roses, and coconut.</li>
            <li> but I saw this lady with long hair.&amp;#34; Now, I cannot say, for sure, that this shampoo stopped my hair from falling out, and it has not stopped it completely--but it sure stopped falling out the way it was before!</li>
            <li> VITAMINS Hair Loss Shampoo is specially designed to promote hair growth and help prevent thinning and hair loss as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely soft and it makes my hair smells nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited to try the product because this shampoo is packed with vitamins</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need to use much to get a lather, and it smells very appealing.</li>
            <li> Thus, due to this aspect as well as the $40 price tag that is a smidgen too rich for my blood, I am happy to grant 4 stars to VITAMINS® shampoo by Nourish Beaut&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li> Thus, due to this aspect as well as the $40 price tag that is a smidgen too rich for my blood, I am happy to grant 4 stars to VITAMINS® shampoo by Nourish Beauté.</li>
            <li> so obviously that&#x27;s good for your hair and hair growth.</li>
            <li> I am a 45 year old woman trying to find any kind of shampoo that will help with my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Ordered this in May. Had been losing handfuls and brushes full of hair ever day for 4 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with the results so far.</li>
            <li> After worked into a lather, the shampoo is pleasantly cool on the scalp, although milder than some eucalyptus oil-derived products.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much improvement and seems like I was having more hair come out in the shower.</li>
            <li> Still what shampoo does is good enough.</li>
            <li> I have used it once and after washing my hair the texture was nice and soft so that is a bonus.</li>
            <li> On those days my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as full.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a full head of hair</li>
            <li> , I searched for something like this and payed full price..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only fair to the product and to those reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> The time of year is more conducive to shedding (end of winter) and my diet is absolutely unchanged</li>
            <li> , therefore I&#x27;m gonna continue buying it till I see the full results.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have used it only one week--</li>
            <li> I will give it a 5 stars when I take both and see the full result</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;So far I am loving the products.</li>
            <li> Not bad....</li>
            <li> Not sure everyone would find this a good kind of body though.</li>
            <li> I opened the bottle and sniffed…hmmm, not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad quality product</li>
            <li> Of course dealing with unruly new growth isn&#x27;t really fun, it was nice to see that it does help with growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s like all the any other shampoo that&#x27;s  out there great smell but doesn&#x27;t make my hair grow or glow</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair loss has diminished tremendously.  </li>
            <li> ok I have been using this for about 4 months and the bottle is empty, It does smell nice</li>
            <li> I feel so lucky that I found VITAMINS.</li>
            <li> He was pressured from my older sister &amp; his wife to under go treatment against his better judgement &amp; mine.</li>
            <li> Any way ; when I took my shower and the strainer I placed in the drain of our RV quickly got clogged from all my hair</li>
            <li> It smells great and my hair is not only growing quicker but softer and much healthier</li>
            <li> Since using this shampoo, my hair has tremendously improved and is thicker.  </li>
            <li> The main ingredients include coconut oil, castor oil, Biotin, and Procapil (which I googled to learn more about).</li>
            <li> I was so excited, so I used the shampoo and took the vitamin right away.</li>
            <li> AS A MATTER OF FACT, MY HAIR WAS SHEDDING MORE THAN NORMAL.  </li>
            <li> It also appears to have more body then it normally does &amp;#60;- for this reason I have stated 4 stars.</li>
            <li> no heavy perfume scent just a clean refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> Hope they are able to come up with new formula.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very certain its not working at all for me and will be asking a full refund on it .</li>
            <li> Thank you much!!</li>
            <li> Have not had it long enough to see results but my hair has a better shine to it and shampoo smells great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, I rinsed forever thinking it wasn&#x27;t all out!</li>
            <li> I love the pleasant smell AND with fairly long hair, I have found no need for cream rinse like many other products.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Let me tell you when it came in the mail i washed my hair right away and after the first wash, my hair felt different in a good way.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it really did not do anything for me.</li>
            <li> It may contain too many oils especially if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely feel my hair has gotten stronger and the texture makes my fine hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> No more fly away hair, instead you get volume, shininess, and a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I thought it lathered nicely, quarter size I massage mainly focusing on the scalp, condition with my normal conditioner ( Dove ) .</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle to review because i have a thyroid condition (a LOT of hair loss) on top of being a woman of a certain age and my hair had really begun thinning out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 2 months and the difference in my hair is not only noticeable but amazing</li>
            <li> Which is always fun to get.  </li>
            <li> Of course there are a lot of reasons for this, but one of them is that your hair has a natural growth cycle (which, for most people, lasts from 2-6 years).  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m really in love with it.</li>
            <li> How exciting is that?</li>
            <li> but I believe is worth it.</li>
            <li> I found it to be totally worth the money...</li>
            <li> Too early to tell, update after more use.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of hair care products and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so thrilled that VITAMINS shampoo helped regrow some of the recent loss.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money and will purchase again.  </li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m 54 and color my hair</li>
            <li> this is worth nevery penny,it works.</li>
            <li> I am completely surprised and pleased.</li>
            <li> it was safe and not harsh on my hair even with me dying it.</li>
            <li> I was worth buying</li>
            <li> It smells like old men cologne, made my hair come out even more and tangle up, and bottle was not filled(missing like 5 washes).</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait at least 6 months before writing anything so that I could be more sure, and I can honestly say that I have a new &amp;#34;crop&amp;#34; of hair on my head!  </li>
            <li> Well sure, it covered my stitches in a major artery!  </li>
            <li> I usually use NIOXIN shampoo as it claims to be good for fine thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> When i used the shampoo for the first time i didn&#x27;t use conditioner after and sure enough my hair was silky smooth.</li>
            <li> The order didn&#x27;t ship right away</li>
            <li> but right away I saw a difference.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> and I used it right away.</li>
            <li> It lathers very well and gets my hair clean.  </li>
            <li> And I could honestly say that on the first use I saw a big difference  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been pretty satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Using to help hair grow back after chemotherapy, smells good, hair growing back is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so economical because just a small amount to damp would create bubbles right away, plus I love the scent too!!</li>
            <li> Combined with a formulation that only uses a small amount for each shampoo, the pleasant smell, and the undeniable effect of having thicker hair, I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who wants gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li> Combined with a formulation that only uses a small amount for each shampoo, the pleasant smell, and the undeniable effect of having thicker hair, I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who wants gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would really make my hair bouncy and full.</li>
            <li> and it had made my hair thick, beautiful, shiny, and reduced my split ends...</li>
            <li> I LOVE the fragrance and gentle cleansing it offers!</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean, smells nice, great lather, less breakage, but not a whole lot of new growth to</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful because there is a significant difference and my thick voluminous hair is now coming back to me.  </li>
            <li> I had a new primary physician who insisted on me having an MIR of my breast.</li>
            <li> Since I have medium-long hair that is all one length, I was able to check for new growth relatively easily; sliding my hands through it just now resulted in finding several strands that were shorter than the hairs around it.</li>
            <li> His hair is not quite as thick as with the Progain but definately the best alternative I have found so far.</li>
            <li> My hair was neither oily or dry after using this product, which was nice.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this stuff definitely works, it has really made a difference for me</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase again when need as I already see great result and it has only been a month.</li>
            <li> The shampoo makes my hair feel very soft and light weight.</li>
            <li> , I think this product is going to be best for people who have noticed a little thinning hair or want a little more length (but who are not at the point where they need prescription-strength help), and who are willing to give it a couple of weeks to really take</li>
            <li> I very much appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t contain hormones and is made in a USA FDA approved lab.</li>
            <li> I feel more comfortable using this hair growth shampoo over the other options out there.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for hard to grow hair.  </li>
            <li> Its better then being super flat but a bit much.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend so much on a shampoo but this one delivers!  </li>
            <li> Hopefully the ingredients will be of higher quality.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair, my hair feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel thicker the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I thought to myself my hair felt funny.</li>
            <li> This product actually didn&#x27;t do anything for me, but make me lose even more hair.</li>
            <li> Your hair absorbs the vitamins it needs while cleaning your hair at the same time...leaving it full-bodied and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair a lot easier to manage :) will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping my hair grows now ;)</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker in the back and front, but no regrowth occurred at the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on how shining and healthy my hair looks daily.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li> At his most recent haircut, he came home with his hair shorter but realized he didn&#x27;t have to worry about thinness showing - some had started to fill in; in fact, his hair seems thicker.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting them to respond that fast!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell about the hair growth yet will update with more information later.</li>
            <li> .women, not so much!</li>
            <li> and I am still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I will be using it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li> Btw, the item arrived as promised &amp; was packaged very well with NO leaking!</li>
            <li> what am I willing to do.</li>
            <li> It leathers up pretty well.</li>
            <li> am willing to re purchase.</li>
            <li> but my has not only been drier but seems to be coming out more.  </li>
            <li> It seems like the best method for hair loss are the &amp;#34;Big Three&amp;#34; unfortunately...</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works!</li>
            <li> With me, it is more age related</li>
            <li> I used the entire contents of the bottle and was pleased with the results; however, the cost of the shampoo made me hesitant to purchase again</li>
            <li> This absolutely doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> First things first:  </li>
            <li> I got my shampoo yesterday and I tried today morning for the first time.</li>
            <li> No smell, no collor, 10/10 for the first wash.</li>
            <li> I am still on my first bottle of using  this product  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that my hair was softer and shiner.</li>
            <li> Now I buy it regularly, and I my hair looks much better than 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo I will definitely be purchasing this again.  </li>
            <li> so you can well imagine how much research I must have done!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much thicker now!</li>
            <li> Thanks NOURISH Beauté!</li>
            <li> It is also shiny and healthy and for the first time in my life it actually has bounce.  </li>
            <li> First, I have curly hair, so I don&#x27;t wash it every day.</li>
            <li> and it looks (and behaves) exactly as it did without shampoo...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo for anyone trying to grow out their hair!!</li>
            <li> also the shine came back , I just feel My hair getting healthy as it was before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am surrounded by the pretty fragrance of VITAMINS shampoo, as I type this review.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I think this is the first time I&#x27;ve written a product review.</li>
            <li> from the first time I used it my hair felt softer, fuller healthier</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle :)&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> left my hair greasy at the top of my scalp.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products that billed themselves as anti-hair-loss shampoos, and none made a significant change until this one.  </li>
            <li> I also use an after-shampoo conditioner with silk protein called Silk 18 Natural Conditioner By Maple Holistics which is Sulfate Free and has 18 Silk Amino Acids, Argan, Jojoba, and Keratin that may be helping eliminate hair breakage as well.  </li>
            <li> All-in-all the packaging and physical aspects of VITAMINS® shampoo are professional, pleasant, and does not sacrifice too much space in the valuable real estate of a bath/shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long hair, very fine.</li>
            <li> It is VERY perfumey, so be aware if you have sensitive skin or do not like strong smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have purchased products from Amazon--from cereal to vacuum cleaner bags to shoes--for many years.</li>
            <li> I just love trying new and natural shampoos.</li>
            <li> The smell and the rich later if this shampoo with the other amazing benefits are well worth it!</li>
            <li> I was very depressed that I had bold stops that where very visible Infront of my hair</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s only two weeks in, so I&#x27;m very excited to see what it looks like in three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I asked for 1 bottled as a gift and received a total of 4, I&#x27;m soooooo glad that I did as I am positive</li>
            <li> After one week of daily use (daily use is probably too much for me now), I found my hair to be softer and more brush able</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthier although there is a lot of static when I use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> One other thing, I almost didn’t get this because of the one star reviews but after reading them I noticed that they looked kind of bogus.</li>
            <li> only it&#x27;s more lush and full.  </li>
            <li> Having seen much growth yet but it leaves my hair so soft and easy to manage, which I must say sometimes wasn&#x27;t easy with a short Afro.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review to receive future offers for giving my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is used as a treatment for men and women that is clinically proven to get results- naturally - with healthy patented ingredients plus natural biotin, coconut oil and castor oil.</li>
            <li> and I am finding  less hair loss and more shine!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a pleasant scent &amp; lathered very well with a small amount being used.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product after reading positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any positive change in my hairs.  </li>
            <li> From the first time I used it my hair was sooooooo much softer.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural product and has been the only thing that has actually worked.</li>
            <li> i like it because it is clear colour and clean really well without drying the</li>
            <li> Now when I blow dry my hair, it has much more volume.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say the amount of hair in the shower drain is about 75-80% less than before.  </li>
            <li> The first couple days my hair looked shiny and smooth but after using it for almost one month; I noticed that my falling hair issue is back.</li>
            <li> Definitely creates bias on whether or not this product is worth buying for others who pay full price.</li>
            <li> I tend to only review products I feel strongly about.  </li>
            <li> Their vitamins were a bit too strong - they contain 4000 mcg daily.</li>
            <li> but it certainly looks fuller.</li>
            <li> but certainly didn&#x27;t help any.</li>
            <li> Not a bad funny just funny as in different.</li>
            <li> Seriously this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> the first week, showering every other day, while my hair felt clean and my scalp had a cool sensation even a couple of hours post-application, I really did not notice any difference with my hair.</li>
            <li> My fine hair can&#x27;t take daily shampooing, so the effects may not be so immediate.</li>
            <li> It smells really really nice; however, I feel like the price should be a little bit lower.</li>
            <li> As far as results, too soon to tell, as I have only been using for a couple of weeks, but so far, love it!</li>
            <li> When I received this bottle of shampoo for review, I was surprised at how little shampoo it took to lather up a good amount.  </li>
            <li> Yes it is a bit more expensive but the product really is amazing.  </li>
            <li> and I was seeing huge clumps of hair every time I brushed or washed my hair.</li>
            <li> I waited before writing a review as I wanted to see if it actually worked and I have to say I feel this shampoo has been a HUGE help for me.</li>
            <li> So this morning when I was combing my hair I only saw about 4-5 strands come out and that for me is a huge difference from before.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t expect to see such a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> The result was huge vertical scars necessary for diagnosis of a life threatening illness.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> thanks anyways for letting me try it out</li>
            <li> Cost way too much.</li>
            <li> It really helps with growth while making it stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m real hopeful.</li>
            <li> Except it is very overpriced.  </li>
            <li> (the picture with straight hair is the updated one).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it helping that much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 2 months and there isn&#x27;t much of a difference</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.weeks to really take</li>
            <li> Have not seen much difference yet</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Still hair in my brush, but again, not as much.  </li>
            <li> This product has done so much for my hair</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> but my hair feels and looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really make my hair grow longer.</li>
            <li> The company is really customer service driven as I asked a question on their website and received an answer to my question within an hour of asking the question.</li>
            <li> AT ALL after using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> and I get complements all the time on how much hair I have.</li>
            <li> Thanks for listening.</li>
            <li> Gave it a four because haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement on my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with taking hair vitamins, and my hair has grown much faster.</li>
            <li> This product really does work well.</li>
            <li> It cleansed my hair very well...</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews of this shampoo I was really exited to try it out.</li>
            <li> hey, &amp;#34;point this light at your head, and hair will grow&amp;#34; is not much different from &amp;#34;rub</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> My dermatologist didn&#x27;t really say much about whether or not I can regrow my hair, but I am hoping that this shampoo improves my hair thickness when I have used it longer.</li>
            <li> I am also not seeing much of a change with the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> but almost 6 months ago I felt I am losing to much hair.</li>
            <li> I see a whole a lot of hair there.</li>
            <li> My hair are growing fast.</li>
            <li> If it really makes my hair grow faster</li>
            <li> so I did not expect much of the miracle.  </li>
            <li> My hair still continues to fall out, this year has thinned out too much.</li>
            <li> Vitamiins Noursh Beate Hair growth shampoo Really works.</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning out so much</li>
            <li> My hair is not falling as much.</li>
            <li> and I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> but it is a very sleek bottle and</li>
            <li> It really seems to make my hair feel fuller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning this shampoo, $40 is just too much to throw in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Well worth it so far.  </li>
            <li> So after much research on Amazon I decided to buy Nourish Vitamins hair growth support SHAMPOO......</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy, wax covered or as if I&#x27;ve used too much product, so no worries there, just an observation during use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied</li>
            <li> I  only use chemical free products.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much as it used to.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> really have to try this.</li>
            <li> I notice my hair is not falling out as much</li>
            <li> and I feel that it is much thicker and fuller when I style my hair.</li>
            <li> BUT, my hair feels and looks so much thicker, and I didn&#x27;t expect this.</li>
            <li> I really like how this shampoo leaves my hair.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely works.</li>
            <li> I know that the product must not be anything but gentle.</li>
            <li> the owner of the company has been very helpful in email communication about the product.</li>
            <li> Cosmeseutical  grow fast shampoo, cost $9.00 dollar.</li>
            <li> so I can can start and really see the effect on both.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much fullness in my hair yet</li>
            <li> It works ok but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s continually growing and I haven&#x27;t even consumed the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of change.</li>
            <li> I advise anyone who wants to buy it don&#x27;t be hesitant..</li>
            <li> Shipping is fast....</li>
            <li> I am now near the end of the bottle and since using this shampoo my hair has totally changed for the better.  </li>
            <li> Let me first say that I have slightly more knowledge about hair loss than the average person.</li>
            <li> I also have a rare form of alopecia which causes total pigment loss and baldness in one spot of my head- right in front!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did a good job cleaning scalp and hair;I only wish you made a healthier formula without the sodium laurel sulphates,phtlates and other chemical additives.</li>
            <li> To have a product gentle enough to heal a significant incision and still get growth amazed me</li>
            <li> So...to get the best results from this shampoo, I recommend washing your hair every day or at least every other day.</li>
            <li> I have had no negative effects-but I&#x27;m not 100% positive yet.</li>
            <li> It was also kind of straw like and wouldnt grow past a certain point.</li>
            <li> The thing about long hair is, though, that it&#x27;s much thicker at the top and by the time you get to the ends, it has thinned out considerably.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be checking back to read some of your success stories!</li>
            <li> This product caused extreme snarls, lost more hair by using this.</li>
            <li> it looks a lot better and It feels like it was cleaner than what it was getting with other shampoos</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is assisting with faster growth, but happy to have hair start growing back.</li>
            <li> I used to have to clean out my hair brushes CONSTANTLY.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that the active ingredients in the shampoo (coupled with the Biotin) would do more to stimulate growth rather than stave off loss.</li>
            <li> It seriously hasnt looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for these products since my hair has been thinning and the reviews seemed promising.</li>
            <li> I was in crisis, so I bought this, but I also started taking the herb, saw palmetto, and in the beginning I used some well-reviewed hair growth oils, regularly, as well as aloe, and rosemary rinses (which I would leave in for hours at a time), and I made special treatments, and I rinsed with organic apple cider vinegar, baking soda, and I took biotin and Vitamin D and C, and all kinds of maca powder, gelatin, supplements</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of these shampoos and this one is the best in my experience, i can see a difference and the bottle is only 1/2 way empty</li>
            <li> So Thank you for making this Available to us,as long as this is around i will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> and I have dark hair and am seeing more gray faster.  </li>
            <li> but you just need a small dab, it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the first thing that has lived up to its promise.</li>
            <li> or is the SLS the main ingredient?</li>
            <li> As we grow older,  out hair is one to experience changes too.  </li>
            <li> As a shampoo it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> At this point I&#x27;m going to give the shampoo to a female relative who has a MUCH more severe hair thinning issue.</li>
            <li> was lucky enough to get the vitamins hair loss shampoo as part of a promotion in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll update my review later), but I&#x27;ve used this product for a few days now and my hair smells really good and does seem shinier than normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My fair was fuller and healthier after using the product only a few times.</li>
            <li> Hair now much shinier and soft...makes ageing hair look young again!</li>
            <li> and I hadn&#x27;t really noticed how drastic my results were until I looked at my before pic, wow!</li>
            <li> In fact, the FDA approval of the lupus medication Benlysta® in 2011 marked the first time since 1955 that a new treatment for lupus came to be; in the interim, patients deal with the myriad symptoms through a combination of therapies.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these products and I will keep using myself.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I was on beta-blocker high blood pressure medication for 3 years.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those who are experiencing  hair loss.</li>
            <li> I recommended highly to man and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a little bit of a difference - glad</li>
            <li> My hair now looks like it did a decade ago, with little visible thinning at the top or the crown.  </li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably more manageable, and perhaps a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo really has helped my 60 year old thinning hair regrow itself.</li>
            <li> and I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing much or any change so far.</li>
            <li> is dry, so I have to wash them every day to make me feel like I have clean hair;&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It really leaves my hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> (It&#x27;ll take awhile to see the full effects, though, because my hair is so long.)  </li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t had trouble in that regard, but many people with color-treated hair avoid sulfates.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got my long hair back</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft and smooth in a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you and I wish you a big success ,&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good, only a few days using and can see a decrease in hair loss after washing.  </li>
            <li> But after a few weeks, when I saw that it was much better, I stopped most of the other treatments and just kept using this shampoo, and I kept taking the saw palmetto, biotin, and some multiple vitamins, and it has continued to grow fast and stay very thick, full, and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes for new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well, and gives my hair a little bit more shine and fullness, as well as making it very soft.</li>
            <li> MaximumHair.com reports that SLS also affects the rate of new hair growth, which occurs at a rate about eight times slower than normal.</li>
            <li> he pulled his hand away, saying something like &amp;#34;ulllUGH!&amp;#34; I literally had to wash my hair right after using it because I couldn&#x27;t leave my house with my hair looking that gross.</li>
            <li> The picture on the left was taken today and the one on the right was taken the day I got the shampoo</li>
            <li> There is always a search for the next great shampoo that helps with weak or receding hair problems.  </li>
            <li> He had also given me free perks other (products).</li>
            <li> The only thing I disliked was that the shampoo bottle does not come completely filled, it was about 8/10ths full and for a $50 bottle</li>
            <li> and I see new hair growing.</li>
            <li> Will be keeping my eye out for the new formula.</li>
            <li> I do have some new hair come in, but not where I need it to.  </li>
            <li> I DIDN&#x27;T SEE ANY NEW GROWTH,</li>
            <li> I think, I do have new hair growth</li>
            <li> My stylist said she can tell I have some new growth.</li>
            <li> and i have new baby hairs growing out as well</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any new hair growth at this point.</li>
            <li> I live in the non-moisture land of Colorado.  </li>
            <li> After one month of using the shampoo I can feel new hair coming in the front.  </li>
            <li> I will give it time to see if there is any new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Also I see new hair growing.</li>
            <li> Brought this shampoo hoping for new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> and I have new growth coming in all over.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for new growth</li>
            <li> I have new regrowth in the crown area and my hair has grown substantially within the pass 30 days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if I get new hair growth.</li>
            <li> My crown is fuller with baby hair, which is a sign of new hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> As of today, I am one month into new hair growth (two weeks using the VITAMINS brand).  </li>
            <li> i could see new Hairs on my Scalp.</li>
            <li> I truly didn&#x27;t realize how well this shampoo worked but am glad I spent the extra money to purchase it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially since I&#x27;m pregnant and instead of my hair actually growing it fell out and got very stringy.</li>
            <li> and if I have seen any new growth as it is still early to comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this combination of Nourish Shampoo and Vitamins to anyone who is loosing hair.....</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell, does leave my hair feeling very soft and manageable but did not stop me from loosing hair.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work and perhaps in the long run it would have been beneficial but simply did not wash out clean.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review several months ago when I first received this product.  </li>
            <li> Well, although I do not wash my hair daily, like bottle states, I noticed the first week of use, that when I combed my hair, NOTHING came out.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spring for other hair regrowth products because so many people mention hair falling out in clumps or, once they stopped using the product, their hair just reverted back to pre-treatment, if not worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus It made my hair completely soft!</li>
            <li> I ordered my first bottle through Amazon about 6 months ago, and my hair salon stylist said my last 3 visits, girl your hair is growing a lot!!!</li>
            <li> Let me first say two things; I&amp;#34;m only 6 weeks into my usage</li>
            <li> makes my hair seem fuller and is not harsh!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> but so far it has my highest praise!</li>
            <li> First off my hair was thinning too because of all my red dye I was doing</li>
            <li> We can shed more hair than usual because of age, stress, diet, or hormones.</li>
            <li> her hair is healthy but does not grow past jaw length.  </li>
            <li> much less hair loss and the texture of my hair is so soft and full of body!</li>
            <li> yet I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is not dry, slightly fuller, shinier, but mostly healthier.</li>
            <li> There was also less hair in my hair brush, and I stopped finding individual strands of hair that had fallen out of my head in between shampoos (my hair is more than 2 feet long, so it&#x27;s easy to notice individual strands when they&#x27;re not attached to my head).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on ANYTHING, but thought I would for this product due to the quick difference I noticed with my hair.  </li>
            <li> There have been times when I have been out of town and had to use other shampoo and conditioner and that&#x27;s when I could really tell how much VHLS really works.</li>
            <li> And new hairs grow naturally.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to make a HUGE difference, but I do feel stubble where I didn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li> but I just put a little leave in conditioner and I am fine.</li>
            <li> It is pure white.</li>
            <li> I would certainly purchase from him again in the near future.</li>
            <li> but surely it&#x27;s getting back to normal, and my bald cow lick is getting smaller as well!</li>
            <li> The fact that it was wielded by a neurosurgeon, guided by ultrasound was completely reassuring medically but hair considerations, not so much.</li>
            <li> So far my husband likes it.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients in this bottle are natural oils that are moisturizing for your hair WITHOUT damaging your hair.</li>
            <li> (And yes, I lathered very well for several minutes, let it sit a while, rinsed well, and didn&#x27;t use conditioner after.)</li>
            <li> and he was completely grossed out...</li>
            <li> I am a 50 year old woman who is going through menopause.  </li>
            <li> Ive just started using it, it makes my hair frizzy so far.</li>
            <li> I will always stick to natural remedies instead of prescription pills.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young woman in her 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had noticeable regrowth (nor do I expect it so early in)</li>
            <li> (Not that much has grown back already!</li>
            <li> So far been using it a couple weeks</li>
            <li> my hair was soft and manageable after it dryied it wasn&#x27;t oily at all.  </li>
            <li> But now it finally grew there thanks to the product.</li>
            <li> I did not know this lady ,but wow that shampoo must be working for me.</li>
            <li> So why are we dying young and suffer from diabetes,  fibromyalgia,  lupus and autism?</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> ® shampoo surprised me; it truly does work.</li>
            <li> ® shampoo surprised me; it truly does work.</li>
            <li> One week later, when I saw her, her hair is thicker than it really is.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell about that.</li>
            <li> So far it has been 4 weeks</li>
            <li> It is a bit early to tell</li>
            <li> Soft, shiny, moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt with the effect I have seen so far that my hair will continue grow</li>
            <li> Mske hair soft and silky</li>
            <li> Was almost wondering if I needed conditioner after because of how soft my hair felt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavily scented or medicinal smelling either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I cannot tell amy difference,.</li>
            <li> is has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My hair has thinned considerably since I&#x27;ve done keratin to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Early on, when I would condition my hair, I would end up with A LOT of hair in my hands after running the conditioner out.</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft and shiny, just what I wanted</li>
            <li> To early to tell if it will help hair growth</li>
            <li> this product was purchased for my daughter, who is 12 and has had short hair her whole life.  </li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s the nicest shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice much growth and my hair still look the same.</li>
            <li> So far I like how it smells and how it leaves my hair feeling.</li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive skin and recognizing that what you put on your skin (scalp) goes into your bloodstream, I want to avoid these chemicals.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> I have to give this shampoo a three only because I do not wash my everyday as stated, but I am hoping that it will eventually help with getting my hair healthy and help it grow.</li>
            <li> It started to thin very noticeably around my temples and the front top.</li>
            <li> about 3 + weeks after I can surely say that I am seeing less and less hair fall, which is a big deal for me, as anyone who is loosing hair knows how much it hurts to see your hair on the comb and on the pillow case!!  </li>
            <li> What a great experience I had with vitamin shampoo , I try different shampo in the past none works for me, finally I got what I was looking for for a long time !!</li>
            <li> Due to IV medications i have noticed that the Hair strainer in my Tub was filling up fast ,i started to get very upset .I</li>
            <li> Finally, I wanted to use it for a long enough period of time that I could accurately assess any changes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with the thickness and texture it leaves my normally limp, dry, thin hair in.</li>
            <li> In one week of use, I have noticed a steady decline in the amount of hair loss when I shampoo, to the point of no loss during the last shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It took a few days of really scrubbing this into my scalp, but pretty soon, I noticed fewer hairs coming out as I shampooed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m approaching 50 and have notice my hair mainly in the crown area thinning and falling out rapidly.  </li>
            <li> As you have no doubt surmised, all forms of lupus are known to cause hair loss in some patients, and while not as horrific as other aspects of the disease, having beautiful hair is very important for self-confidence, as well as a positive mental outlook, possibly more so than having scars, rashes, or other noticeable physical symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it may be due to me thyroid medication being lowered to keep my thyroid at the right level.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes, but didn&#x27;t see any difference from regular shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was sending out a major Ethan-Hawke-in-the-90s vibe!</li>
            <li> Spent over 45 Dollars for this shampoo and so far I have not received any positive results.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading my long winded kudos for this product.</li>
            <li> I got this product because my husband likes long hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t grow very well.</li>
            <li> Now they are all longer and my daily hair loss is once again normal.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product to assess its performance, I was careful to include my boyfriend’s “analysis” of my hair to curtail the “Placebo Effect”.</li>
            <li> and I got this shampoo to help with getting my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had fine hair all through my life, but it only started giving me trouble in college</li>
            <li> Certainly he has stopped losing hair when brushing it, anyway, which was a big enough difference to encourage him.  </li>
            <li> I have hypothyroidism, and for several years a large amount of hair would be left in my comb when combing it out after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> After just a few shampoos, and 5 days of taking 1 NOURISH vitamin a day, I honestly wondered if I was imagining what I saw because the changes in my hair were so immediate and noticeable; thicker, shinier and little to no hair loss in the shower drain or after combing.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on several new shampoos and chose this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and definitely see lots of new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Me and my son are using the product, but only time will tell with new products.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> I definitely  notice new hair growth on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what the long-term effects will be (new hair growth, I hope?), but the short-term impact is terrific.</li>
            <li> While I do not feel that this influenced me in any capacity, I am legally obligated to disclose this fact so that you can come to your own conclusions about the merit of this analysis.**me want to embrace my “natural” hair and just live with the painful effects of my lupus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While some of these are no doubt from “regular” growth patterns, the sheer number have me convinced that VITAMINS® shampoo really does work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also wear my hair up in a tight bun for work and don&#x27;t wash my hair every day and after the second day of no wash my hair still looked and felt just as clean.</li>
            <li> Those other shampoos that promise volume really have no idea!</li>
            <li> Follow the diretions and only use a little bit for a rich lather.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this shampoo, I had a lot of appointments to go to, so I was washing my hair every other day.  </li>
            <li> In short, hair loss is a function of two things: the natural shedding of hair that each person goes through daily and the degree to which new hair grows to take its place.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is gentle on my scalp, which is really sensitive due to the fact that I have seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> started using this and within two weeks my shower was no longer clogging, the clumps were no longer running down my leg and by the end of the month my temples were no longer looking so bare and the top was looking a little fuller.</li>
            <li> One is looking for a positive result based on other reviews and what the owner is promoting.  </li>
            <li> After approximately 4 weeks I noticed fine new hairs staring to sprout.</li>
            <li> the reason for 4 stars is I have not used it long enough to know if it will really work.</li>
            <li> Here are some observations: it is a clear shampoo and comes in a simple bottle so the money goes into the product and not into fancy marketing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old and my hair is starting to thing.</li>
            <li> Got to try this for a reduce price and in return I would provide an host review; I&#x27;ve only used this shampoo a fews times so far</li>
            <li> My barber said I was in the early stages of male pattern baldness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used once so far, but will update this review after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times, so I&#x27;m not seeing anything as far as hair thickness yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second day (for the shampoo) and so far I see the difference of my hair already</li>
            <li> This product actually works, I bought it for my boyfriend and he&#x27;s liking it so far</li>
            <li> I had to try something and choose this product I tried this because all the ingredients where natural so at the end it did work everybody started to notice a big difference and made my self esteem go up</li>
            <li> I barely even need to use conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am sure time will tell how it does on helping any hair loss, I have a thyroid issue and even though I do not have an issue with baldness, my hair does thin out.  </li>
            <li> He mentioned how thick, full, and soft his hair is now.</li>
            <li> I see new hair growing in my hair line and my wife tells me the spot in the back is growing back too.  </li>
            <li> However,  lately my hair has been starting to fall out again, but more its been flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> Husband was very cynical about this natural product, but just asked me to reorder because it has greatly reduced the amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li> but I did not like many of the unnecessary chemical ingredients such as sulfates damaging and drying to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Contacted them for refund based on their 100% Money Back guarantee, and thus far they have ignored my request.</li>
            <li> a result of the thinning of my hair due to my disease, it wasn’t unusual for me to see decently-sized clumps coming out with every shower.</li>
            <li> how much of this DHT blocker is being used as an active ingredient?</li>
            <li> Normally, that is very difficult to remove, but this shampoo gets it out quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair - kind of expensive</li>
            <li> The shampoo does not dry it out at all</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling a little sticky at first.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to use this shampoo, my hair&#x27;s texture is soft and less tangle.</li>
            <li> The lather is rich; a little bit goes a VERY long way, which is especially beneficial as each bottle costs $40.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to explain this, because my assumption, in fact, was that my hair would GROW MORE, not that I would SHED LESS.</li>
            <li> The first week i noticed less Hair in the Tub strainer by the second week</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, dry, medium coarse hair; lately, I have also experienced hair loss.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural, no harsh chemicals like other hair growth shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly long and naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> In the first few months of that joyous ride, I lost about 2/3rds of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I noticed I didn&#x27;t even have to use my detangle because I didn&#x27;t have all the snags and knots that I normally get with my hair when it is wet.</li>
            <li> EmbelLASH or NaturalLASH by Protege at Amazon (which has made a major difference in my eyebrows growing back in after hypothyroidism resulted in loosing the outer one third).</li>
            <li> I been using this product for a little over a month and just realized that the length is cut off when I first bought the product already grew back!!!!</li>
            <li> I mean for once all of the product was out of my hair and all that was left was clean hair, instead of washed hair with product still in it,</li>
            <li> My hair was very damaged from bleaching it and doing the ombr&amp;eacute; and then back to dark etc...</li>
            <li> The shampoo worked in the first few days only, then for the rest, it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> so, clearly, I have no new hair growth already.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shinier and far, far less prone to frizziness.</li>
            <li> and that is far, far less.</li>
            <li> It took many weeks of use, but slowly I started to notice less hair ending up in my hands after conditioning.</li>
            <li> my hair is thin and fine</li>
            <li> I have really short/fine hair that has thinned a little after three babies.  </li>
            <li> My Hair , thin and fine under regular circumstances was worn shoulder length blunt cut.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very thick and shiny - makes it feel fantastic</li>
            <li> I had so much hair regrowth that I had short little hairs growing like a halo.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much growth but my hair looks and feels thicker and less falls out!</li>
            <li> so right there you are saving money at least i am.</li>
            <li> The first double pic is where i never grew hair due to my head cracking open there due to a monkey bars collapsing on me when I was 7.</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself is clear and of a decent consistency, not too watery and not as thick as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I will say I need to use a bit of conditioner due to where I am and the bozo naturally curly hair I have.  </li>
            <li> I am 29 years old, dealing with hair thinning due to thyroid/birth control issues.</li>
            <li> Then I stumbled across Vitamins Hair loss shampoo, and honestly I have to say I was skeptical, because I have tried everything under the sun!</li>
            <li> Yes, my hair is important to me, but the cost of each bottle makesme want to embrace my “natural” hair and just live with the painful effects of my lupus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far my hair looks fuller but it may be just bushier; I am waiting for at least another month to see if there is new growth.</li>
            <li> Seriously no Biolage,  Pantene,  Nexxus, paul Mitchell, or any other useless lying product has done what this simple labeled,  sweet smelling shampoo has done for me.</li>
            <li> I did not have to use as much conditioner as I usually do.  </li>
            <li> Update as of APRIL 22: I forgot to update this picture of my hair after flat ironing it (this was about a month ago).</li>
            <li> After shampooing and blow drying my hair would be flat</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to know if there is regrowth.</li>
            <li> My hair also became flat instead of voluminous.</li>
            <li> My hair looked oily and was just flat.</li>
            <li> My hair loss has slowed down considerably.</li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo occasionally if need be.</li>
            <li> I had PRP and laser treatments a couple years ago, which made a big difference, but my hair had started to get dry and break.</li>
            <li> My plan was not to really judge until I hit the 4 month mark, but I think I&#x27;ve had a visible enough level of progress to at least post some pics.</li>
            <li> I have noticed stronger hair that does grow faster and there less hair near the drain, there is no doubt about that.  </li>
            <li> Yes this product is expensive, but so far it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> We did some research on products and this one appeared to have the least side affects and also had a lot of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Just kept it loose as possible to see if that would solve the issue.</li>
            <li> After using several other products, I think I&#x27;ve finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my hair was extremely shiny and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered with alopecia for years, and I can see small hairs beginning to grow.</li>
            <li> After two-thirds of a bottle of this shampoo (used every other or every third day over 3 months), I definitely see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I mainly got it to help with the excessive hair shedding since giving birth 15 months ago.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes for this product, look forward to using it everyday!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kinda hard to tell when you have so MUCH hair.</li>
            <li> After hearing the insurance company wouldn&#x27;t let me do a PET SCAN to see how bad the rest of me is I began my own holistic approach.  </li>
            <li> I missed having long locks.  </li>
            <li> (I have crinkly grey</li>
            <li> I want to keep those longer/older hairs for as long as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my hair is obviously long aswell...</li>
            <li> Also do not need a bunch of conditioner, just a dime size (my hair is long) and all tangles are prevented.  </li>
            <li> The long answer?</li>
            <li> I see only minimal come off.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for the long term effects of this product yet</li>
            <li> a few months I will post an update and photos of my wild hair.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> my hair is quite long.....</li>
            <li> i just wish i knew about this long ago.</li>
            <li> Two week results are in and my hair has already grown half an inch and the hair loss has decreased tremendously!</li>
            <li> But the shampoo left my hair oily, weighted down, and just felt like I couldn&#x27;t get it rinsed out of my hair enough.</li>
            <li> After my 3rd week, I noticed when I rung out my hair, I need to go further down to get it all; not measured but by eye</li>
            <li> I also want to mention this will last a long time you don&#x27;t need much,like i mentioned i still have half a Bottle and have another for back up but</li>
            <li> and i am really seeing the difference little by little.</li>
            <li> ’s noted that there are sulfites in this shampoo but the company is changing that due to public concerns.  </li>
            <li> Neither seem to recommend daily use, so my regiment became every other day for both-just alternating the two.</li>
            <li> Not much much better than regular shampoo but 10 times more expensive.  </li>
            <li> and I was washing my hair with it every other day and to my utter astonishment</li>
            <li> I have used other products to stop my hairfall or grow hair back</li>
            <li> Still trying and my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Even after drying my hair, it does not feel nor does it look dry.</li>
            <li> My hair would be dry because of all the coloring.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has ended all my breakage and my dry hair.</li>
            <li> do recommend to use the conditioner if you have extremely dry hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I realize it was a limited time offer</li>
            <li> (single process) about four times per year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it would take this long if you used the shampoo daily, but I simply cannot wash my hair that often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 20 days and my hair is sooooo dry!</li>
            <li> It only gave it a slight effect of thickness.</li>
            <li> Seeing less shedding after only two weeks!  </li>
            <li> and I still have half a bottle with only a months use!</li>
            <li> Ever since I had chemo, my hair has grown back oddly</li>
            <li> And recently I&#x27;ve noticed MUCH LESS.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I re-purchased this shampoo to try to correct the damage that had occurred and much to my surprise (and delight), it not only achieved that goal but exceeded it by restoring my hair (though shorter) to its state prior to the other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair was bridle and very dry.</li>
            <li> New hairs around my forehead that would never seem to grow past a half inch before before are now growing longer --</li>
            <li> Need only a little.  </li>
            <li> it is I can spend a little money or I can lose my hair - and chances are once it&#x27;s gone, it&#x27;s not coming back.</li>
            <li> I am thankful that in my mid 40&#x27;s I still have a head of hair but it is thinning a little in areas, so I am looking for both strengthening and prevention.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make any difference other than dry your scalp out and itch.</li>
            <li> Too highly concentrated for my thin long strands.</li>
            <li> Normally it is difficult to tame my fine wavy hair</li>
            <li> My thin hair hadn&#x27;t changed much after 3 months.   </li>
            <li> noticed not much hair is falling out.</li>
            <li> Although I was impatient and for a couple of months I only noticed a reduction in the loss--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 Weeks and not much growth.</li>
            <li> I really am not.</li>
            <li> Every few days I use a different shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was very self conscious of how much my hair had been thinning and was afraid it was going to get worse.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;scientific&amp;#34; self study was not very scientific, but I&#x27;ll share with you what I did notice.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s what caused having some empty spaces in the front</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but have noticed some decrease on the amount of hair lost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a rough couple of years and stress took its toll on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Not much on the 120% growth.  </li>
            <li> all the vitamin shampoos 3 of them arrived way before the arrival time I expected.</li>
            <li> My wide part is starting narrow</li>
            <li> Sorry to be so negative, but when you pay this much for a bottle of shampoo one would at least expect your hair to look and feel clean.  </li>
            <li> Avoid, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> ; But I&#x27;m a black guy with long hair (not dreaded)</li>
            <li> I have long black damaged dyed hair.</li>
            <li> Although this product may help with hair loss, I would never buy it due to the numerous harsh chemicals including the preservatives, perfumes and lathering agents.</li>
            <li> Only down side a little pricey but</li>
            <li> It did not show increase in growth , and it left my hair feeling unclean, limp and weighed down.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it for the people who have thin hair, falling or  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that I loose less hair in the shower and my hair seems to be thicker.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo every other day and use WEN on the days in between.  </li>
            <li> i use it in combination with coconut oil and wash every other day and it has lasted me quit some time</li>
            <li> A regular mammogram was inconclusive as all those from the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> and I wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> Just extremely overpriced shampoo.  </li>
            <li> After a week I noticed a decrease on my hair loss, I don’t have dandruff that other shampoos caused.</li>
            <li> (I shampoo every other day.)  </li>
            <li> I was interested in purchasing one of these products but all the reviews seem made up and fake...</li>
            <li> then the other reviews</li>
            <li> However, I figured I&#x27;d give this a go since my hair falls out a lot due to my thyroid condition.</li>
            <li> When I used to get my hair cut, my stylist used to sprinkle this dark brown stuff onto my scalp so my part didn&#x27;t seem so wide and gaping.</li>
            <li> I have hair loss due to a thyroid problem and heredity, and am trying everything--vitamins, minoxidil, shampoos, you name it.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that I didn&#x27;t have a lot of hair that was brushed out and that I lost like usual.</li>
            <li> My hair had been thinning out due to hair fall.</li>
            <li> Hair seemed little dry after washing, so maybe I need to add a moisturizing conditioner to my routine??  </li>
            <li> My hair has never been soooo dry!!!</li>
            <li> (Though you always have some active follicles, unless you have lost all your hair.)  </li>
            <li> But what I notice is that my hair being dry and limp using this shampoo improved texture.  </li>
            <li> I had a cow lick that had become about a 5 inch circle of fading hair...</li>
            <li> No strong smell and only a little is needed each shampoo.</li>
            <li> Due to a Thyroid condition my hair was going down the drain every shower and on my bathroom floor every time I blew out my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this product, though it is a little expensive!</li>
            <li> -reductase inhibitors are commonly used for the treatment of two DHT-related conditions, male pattern baldness (MPB), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).</li>
            <li> Stay away not worth all the money.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything I could think of to grow out my hair and bring back thickness, from thickening products, using high end expensive products to drug store products and NOTHING was working NOTHING!</li>
            <li> The hammer came down and I am in for the ride of my life.</li>
            <li> I also feel that my hair was flatter and weighed down when I was using this product.  </li>
            <li> I would shower and I could feel clumps run down my leg, it was scary.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It seemed to way my hair down and made it less full.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well since I started using this one week ago less shedding -just 1-2 hairs.</li>
            <li> Hair feels fuller and a bit less shedding.</li>
            <li> The process of hair loss is less, however I have not seen any softening or hair growth yet.</li>
            <li> I feel like the thickness still isn&#x27;t where I want it,  but it is getting slightly thicker.</li>
            <li> , I still have over half a bottle.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed less hair every shower.</li>
            <li> I have even noticed less breakage.</li>
            <li> agree with the video reviewers about how with this shampoo there is less hair loss.</li>
            <li> Less hair is falling out.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that I am losing less hair and my hair looks and feels fuller.</li>
            <li> I have less hair fall.</li>
            <li> I see less hair fall with every use, While brushing and styling my hair</li>
            <li> SAW LESS BREAKAGE AFTER 1 - 2 APPLICATIONS.  </li>
            <li> I see less thinning of my hair.</li>
            <li> After a couple uses I noticed that I was cleaning less hair from the drain of my tub.</li>
            <li> its been 3 and a half weeks that I am using this shampoo</li>
            <li> I started to see less hair fall...</li>
            <li> I also noticed less breakage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb and say that a conservative estimate is that I&#x27;m now shedding less than 25 percent of what I was shedding three months ago.  </li>
            <li> and I also saw less hair loss.</li>
            <li> I start shampooing only my head not my entire length of hair (this will help u use less of this expensive shampoo) and leave it on while I do the rest of my shower probably 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> My hair is falling out less</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s like others that cost less.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a while before doing a review,I have been been using this for about a month now while the bottle is still half way through</li>
            <li> it sheds less and less.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this profuct but was so sad it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> because it is (what I thought) was impossible at the time, it was well, normal for left over product to be in my hair.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to try and what I got was disappointment.</li>
            <li> I thought it was very expensive, but I have concluded that it is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> But I will say this product is very expensive, and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> maybe a little less hair fall.</li>
            <li> Less hair falling out...but dried out my scalp.</li>
            <li> PROs: -- Hardly have any loose hairs in my comb now --</li>
            <li> I often get tired of reading false claims of products doing certain jobs, expecting it, and being let down.</li>
            <li> Let me just give you a little understanding about my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair a little too silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for a little over a month</li>
            <li> Will use a little longer and see.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried about using the shampoo since I have course hair.  </li>
            <li> now with my Husband using this i will probably go through it a little faster.</li>
            <li> Hoping the shampoo will cause my hair to grow a little longer before summer.</li>
            <li> my hair loss  has gone down 70%!</li>
            <li> None of us have money to throw away on things that don&#x27;t work but you won&#x27;t be disappointed with VITAMINS, I&#x27;m not and I&#x27;m placing another order right now!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste it</li>
            <li> I had my fiancé touch my hair after I dried it</li>
            <li> Mine never changed and actually got worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Over the next week or two, the number decreased yet again.  </li>
            <li> I use few times a week</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday so it may have taken longer for me</li>
            <li> I knew I was in trouble.</li>
            <li> Being disabled, I cannot afford the price of this shampoo; even if I could, I wince at the price.</li>
            <li> Not surejust been useing it a few weeks..</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo 3x in a week and took the vitamin everyday.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and vitamin are not cheap</li>
            <li> I used this for a few months and haven&#x27;t seen any hair growth nor has it stopped the my hair from thinning.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s about $10 missing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for about a month</li>
            <li> i have been seeing baby hair growing across the hair line within few weeks of trying the shampoo.</li>
            <li> In a few weeks I noticed a difference and hairs stopped falling.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work and broke after a few weeks...</li>
            <li> A lot of shampoos leave my hair feeling dried out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me a while to evaluate this shampoo for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> This shampoo I&#x27;ve used doesn&#x27;t work as described , I&#x27;ve been using it since I bought it everyday</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo for just a few weeks, my hair feels fuller and healthier.  </li>
            <li> Tried this shampoo for a few weeks but had to discontinue use because of my seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> i hope in a few days</li>
            <li> , it took a few weeks for him to see results</li>
            <li> Realizing it takes a while to regrown hair, I ordered 2 of these expensive bottles, plus vitamins, and have used these products consistently for approximately 5 months with no success (no thyroid problems).  </li>
            <li> GOODBYE WASTE OF MONEY,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday as this product suggests.  </li>
            <li> I cut off about 1-2 inches of dead hair</li>
            <li> Not to mention I put some on my eyebrows and my eyebrows are looking thicker and spots that I had missing now have hair.</li>
            <li> Last a long time , all you need is a little !!!!!</li>
            <li> and I will have less hair loss permanently!  </li>
            <li> I bought it in November and after about two weeks much less hair in the drain,love it!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic increase in growth but have only been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> it was stiff and oily.</li>
            <li> No more false promises shampoos, this is my one and only.</li>
            <li> I usually go 2-4 days in between washes, so I&#x27;m used to my hair getting a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Initially the price for the shampoo was intimidating but much less expensive than a trip to the hairdresser or a keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li> This past year I noticed my hair falling out in handfuls everyday.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use conditioner everyday</li>
            <li> and there was no irritation over the raw incisions.</li>
            <li> It had a bounce and the frizzy, limp sad hair I have had finally felt</li>
            <li> and I can see little hairs pushing their way out and GROWING!</li>
            <li> It lathers with very little product</li>
            <li> If I am not impressed I move on to the next product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it helps hair growth</li>
            <li> NOT SURE ABOUT THIS.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;M NOT SURE</li>
            <li> Oh oh, the bottle looks small.</li>
            <li> So, I am not sure if the cure was the combination of intensive treatments</li>
            <li> Would not recommend it - after all when one is trying to treat thinning hair to boost their self-esteem, the last thing they need is an expensive shampoo that actually makes their hair look worse!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not completely sure on the regrowth, but I think it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> so I tried a lesser expensive brand.  </li>
            <li> I am a guy and my hair is receding and thinning in the usual places.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use it at least a few times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure my hair has grown</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not overwhelming but will stay with you all day.</li>
            <li> My hair has been excessively falling for the past 1 year</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s helpful inyour decision making, but I thought I would just put it out there.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is working, but we will see.  </li>
            <li> THIS WAS A GIFT, SO I AM NOT SURE IF IT WORKS FOR HER YET.</li>
            <li> No more hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> Not chemical smelling like some other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried for thin hair or hair growth.</li>
            <li> While I have not run out of the shampoo nor stopped using it long enough to verify the veracity of this statement, I will admit that I am disappointed in this fact.</li>
            <li> Too bad - I had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> reasoning behind me using this shampoo is that if I can keep my hair growing past the typical 2-6 year cycle and maintain the length.  </li>
            <li> If no new hair regrowth will&lt;br /&gt;discontinue because of price...very expensive</li>
            <li> I just ordered the triple pack as is a little less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product weighed my hair down and it was limp and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> I got the Vitamins Hair Loss Shampoo because I my hair was dull and lifeless, and maybe thinning.</li>
            <li> Makes it hard to brush through my hair and I am still having alot of shedding.</li>
            <li> hard to tell,</li>
            <li> I feel that I&#x27;ve already passed the hard part which is find a product that I can trust.</li>
            <li> I used to have very thick and heavy hair</li>
            <li> IF IT WORKS, AT LEAST NOT FOR ME.</li>
            <li> I have been using since late Nov</li>
            <li> At least, that&#x27;s how it seems to be with me.  </li>
            <li> Even with skepticism, it is still possible to succumb to inflated perceptions while using a product when you are desperate for results.</li>
            <li> Seller recommend that this should be used at least for 2-3 months for visible effects in 30- 90 days.</li>
            <li> Once negative aspect I&#x27;ve noticed is that my hair seems to feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and gets oily on my neck between shampoos.  </li>
            <li> It’s thick and thoroughly cleans the hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair grows slowly -</li>
            <li> Thick.</li>
            <li> Slowly</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that when I ordered two of them, one of them was half used and obviously a return.</li>
            <li> My hair was such a disgusting, greasy MESS after using this shampoo that even dry shampoo couldn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean it wont for you.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not sure it has helped my shedding hair (I shed a lot!)</li>
            <li> It must be bad enough for men but at least bald is a style for them…</li>
            <li> False advertising, dangerous ingredients like sles not listed here, instead this company decided to show picture of models with the bottle than an actual close up of the bottle showing the ingredients.</li>
            <li> But,  if you have serious issues, going through life&#x27;s changes that affect your body,  get this shampoo....  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with how small the bottle was for a big price.</li>
            <li> I did the directions and rinsed it out for about 2 minutes because it always left my hair nasty and greasy feeling in the back.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Needless to say when everything else failed, with no optimism left, I started to use this shampoo</li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone experiencing hair loss or if you have thin dull hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how a hair growth and vitamin shampoo contains sulfate, it was my mistake in ordering it, but never would I guess it has sulfate which is not good for hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair has also never grown fast which I always hated.</li>
            <li> I expected another disappointment.</li>
            <li> First ingredient was sodium lauryl sulfate which is terrible for your hair and health.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the shampoo has not done anything, in fact I feel as though my hair loss/shedding has increased over the past months.</li>
            <li> My friends are SHOCKED at how long my hair is getting!</li>
            <li> According to the NTEF, hair loss can be the result of poor rinsing that leaves SLS deposits in your hair follicles.</li>
            <li> Thin and aweful.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo approximately a month ago.  </li>
            <li> Too make matters worse</li>
            <li> I am 68 yo and and beginning to thin.  </li>
            <li> Also I cannot find any thin spots.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with thin hair.</li>
            <li> —maybe the stress caused it to thin out.</li>
            <li> and my hair was always a tad thin.</li>
            <li> I slept my vacation days away &amp; silently cried to myself from the excrusiating pain I had in my breasts, lymph nodes,  bones, &amp; the base of my brain grew with masses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the products.</li>
            <li> It felt like a thin coat of wax almost.</li>
            <li> my hair started to get thin and fall out.</li>
            <li> It made my thinning hair worse.</li>
            <li> this shampoo i always have had thin hair</li>
            <li> *FALSE ADVERTISING</li>
            <li> This shampoo has made a dramatic difference for my hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way too expensive to be so poor.</li>
            <li> I started taking medicine which unfortunately could thin your hair</li>
            <li> Already noticing little hairs!!!!</li>
            <li> So yeah, a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> SORRY TO SAY THIS DID NOT WORK FOR ME.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry guys</li>
            <li> And I know it seems weird, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way to expensive also.</li>
            <li> My husband thinks the shampoo is expensive</li>
            <li> Rather expensive for an 8 oz.</li>
            <li> I have a thyroid issue I have been dealing with and unfortunately with that my hair has thinned and fallen out.</li>
            <li> I do not know how you could go wrong though with all the vitamins that are in this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how expensive it is , what matter to me is the result.</li>
            <li> Yes the price is expensive but I truly believe you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s working, ill recommend it..</li>
            <li> Ill still use this just change the way i use it.   </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bald spots, just very thin areas.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair.</li>
            <li> but it is still very thin.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product and was very disappointed - especially due to the expensive price.  </li>
            <li> I was getting desperate</li>
            <li> Disappointing results.</li>
            <li> Disappointingly overrated.  </li>
            <li> Expensive piece of nonsense!</li>
            <li> This made me very sad.</li>
            <li> Very expensive shampoo.  </li>
            <li> one week of shampoos proved to be a bad idea.</li>
            <li> My hair has been thinning so bad since I had my baby.</li>
            <li> I had breakage that was so bad.</li>
            <li> I was really frustrated with my hair</li>
            <li> I hate to leave a bad review</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is about dht blockers:[</li>
            <li> I was desperate!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for me.  :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed to find that this shampoo contains sulfates which strip hair color.</li>
            <li> After using this product for 6 weeks I have to say that I am very unhappy with it.  </li>
            <li> I have bought two bottles of this CRAP</li>
            <li> Very scary!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in it and don&#x27;t recommend it to any one.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is the WORST shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Did I mention the hair I did have was in horrible condition?</li>
            <li> The damage that brand did to my hair was shocking.  </li>
            <li> It was terrible!</li>
            <li> This is terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible product!.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend so much on a shampoo but this one delivers!  Plus it smells great!  A+</li>
            <li> Love it!  Heard it from a friend&#x27;s post on FB and I said &amp;#34;what the hell, I&#x27;ll give a try&amp;#34; it&#x27;s great!  My hair fells great and I have dark hair and am seeing more gray faster.  This is good, my hair is growing faster.  Will have it colored sooner!  LOL.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Frank the owner displayed great compassion and professionalism regarding this product. He took the time to call me regarding the shipment and make sure I was happy with the product.i recieved my product in a timely fashion.  He had also given me free perks other (products). Which is always fun to get.  I would certainly purchase from him again in the near future. The product itself makes your hair feel clean,looks of a healthy shine, and smells pretty. I love it. Highly recommended. Thank you.</li>
            <li> False advertising, dangerous ingredients like sles not listed here, instead this company decided to show picture of models with the bottle than an actual close up of the bottle showing the ingredients. Avoid, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I decided to try VITAMINS shampoo as I have very fine hair and hoped it would boost the texture. After just a few shampoos, and 5 days of taking 1 NOURISH vitamin a day, I honestly wondered if I was imagining what I saw because the changes in my hair were so immediate and noticeable; thicker, shinier and little to no hair loss in the shower drain or after combing. Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I hate to leave a bad review but I received this item free of charge in return for a review and it just didn&#x27;t work out for me. I was super excited to try the product because this shampoo is packed with vitamins so obviously that&#x27;s good for your hair and hair growth. But the shampoo left my hair oily, weighted down, and just felt like I couldn&#x27;t get it rinsed out of my hair enough. my hair is thin and fine so maybe it would be better for someone that had thicker hair than I do. I appreciate the opportunity to try out this product and I wished that I had a better opinion of the product. thanks anyways for letting me try it out</li>
            <li> Good shampoo didn&#x27;t even need conditioner just the shampoo</li>
            <li> Using to help hair grow back after chemotherapy, smells good, hair growing back is nice and soft. Not sure if it is assisting with faster growth, but happy to have hair start growing back.</li>
            <li> I have had the same hair length for years and have noticed thinning over the years.  I missed having long locks.  This is my second purchase of the product from this dealer and there is a reason why. I noticed a thickness to my hair. I have had growth of 1 1/2 inches (took approx. 2 + months).  How do I know this?  I have to color my hair more often.  I now have heathy shiny hair. My patients tell me they have &amp;#34;Hair Envy&amp;#34; when they see me. My hair dresser is wowed by my hair. I used to have to clean out my hair brushes CONSTANTLY. My hair brush was almost clean.  When I have the means I treat myself to a product if it has great reviews.  If I am not impressed I move on to the next product.  When you find a good thing you stick with it.  I found my good thing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see Any difference</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me. doesn&#x27;t mean it wont for you. I gave it a neutral rating.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen any visible  improvement. maybe a little less hair fall.</li>
            <li> This is amazing shampoo!  Makes my hair very thick and shiny - makes it feel fantastic and it IS growing!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I decided that its best that give it tried to contiune  using the product. Its all good thanks</li>
            <li> So far si good.  I purchased this for my husband when i could no longer find Pogain in stores (I guess it stopped being produced).  So far my husband likes it.  His hair is not quite as thick as with the Progain but definately the best alternative I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the shampoo.  Makes my hair look nice and scalp feel great!  Product arrived on time too! Laurie G.</li>
            <li> I love the vitamin hair growth shampoo, I have bought it for all 4 of my kids and they feel that their hair is thicker and softer.&lt;br /&gt;Kathy G</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo I have ever used.  Motor oil would work better.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this...it&#x27;s way too expensive to be so poor.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review several months ago when I first received this product.  Now that i have been using it for some time, my thoughts are the same.  It is a great product.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and wonderful.  I&#x27;ve had hair growth in the last month but I also use the vitamins.  The sellers is great and quick to respond when you send them feedback.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes, but didn&#x27;t see any difference from regular shampoos.  Cost way too much. It seemed to way my hair down and made it less full.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell good, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Hair was stretching from an overload protein treatment. This stopped the breakage after 1-2 uses.  It&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle. i use this as a hair treatment. It really helps with growth while making it stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 50&#x27;s and my hair started thinning about 45 where you can see the scalp. Take shower and lots of hair in brush or sink on clothes thru the day. Well since I started using this one week ago less shedding -just 1-2 hairs. I&#x27;m real hopeful. When my laptop gets fix I&#x27;ll update with pictures. My wide part is starting narrow and I see new hair growing. I&#x27;m excited to see the progress I will update.</li>
            <li> In one week of use, I have noticed a steady decline in the amount of hair loss when I shampoo, to the point of no loss during the last shampoo.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I wish I would have bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 4 wks and it is still too soon to evaluate.  I only wash hair every 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> I usually use NIOXIN shampoo as it claims to be good for fine thinning hair.  When I received this bottle of shampoo for review, I was surprised at how little shampoo it took to lather up a good amount.  It’s thick and thoroughly cleans the hair.  After one week of daily use (daily use is probably too much for me now), I found my hair to be softer and more brush able (I have crinkly grey hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s noted that there are sulfites in this shampoo but the company is changing that due to public concerns.  I had no problems.  If the shampoo really does stimulate hair growth by 121% and reduce hair loss by 46%, I’d be happy.  Just the fact that my hair does feel thicker (they call it follicle anchoring), is a big plus.  I’m at the point where the cost of a good shampoo is worth it.  I’m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> it is great, my hair becomes more shinier and has more balance. i&#x27;m going to purchase this shampoo next time.</li>
            <li> I bought this, and now I am returning it. here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Improper use of shampoos containing SLS can lead to hair loss, according to the National Toxic Encephalopathy Foundation. According to the NTEF, hair loss can be the result of poor rinsing that leaves SLS deposits in your hair follicles. These deposits penetrate your scalp and corrode the hair follicle, causing hair loss. MaximumHair.com reports that SLS also affects the rate of new hair growth, which occurs at a rate about eight times slower than normal. In addition, Personal Health Facts reports that NaCL, the salt used as a thickening agent is drying to your hair and, by increasing the potential for breakage, also contributes to hair loss.\\&quot; this is from the livestrong website... the company states to use the shampoo every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is about dht blockers:[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wikipedia states: \\&quot;5α-reductase inhibitors are commonly used for the treatment of two DHT-related conditions, male pattern baldness (MPB), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Dutasteride is approved for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and is prescribed off-label for the treatment of male pattern baldness, whereas finasteride is approved for both conditions. However, 5α-reductase inhibitors are thought to have persistent side effects that can continue after quitting the treatment, including diminished libido, erectile dysfunction and male breast cancer, and are suspected to have persistent cognitive side effects, including depression, brain fog and memory loss.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so how much of this DHT blocker is being used as an active ingredient? enough to warrant this a medicated shampoo? or is the SLS the main ingredient? you decide. but be informed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also including a photo of the ingredients list as I don&#x27;t see this listed in the description.</li>
            <li> The best in its category after trying several</li>
            <li> The ingredients were not listed anywhere but with it&#x27;s reviews I thought it would be a good product. Nope! First ingredient was sodium lauryl sulfate which is terrible for your hair and health. If you&#x27;re looking for a truly healthy hair product this ain&#x27;t it.    UPDATE:    Received a follow up from Frank who works for this company thanking me for my opinion and letting me know that they would be altering the formula. I appreciate the effort and thoughtfulness of the company and will update to a 3 star. Will be keeping my eye out for the new formula. Hopefully the ingredients will be of higher quality.</li>
            <li> I got the Vitamins Hair Loss Shampoo because I my hair was dull and lifeless, and maybe thinning. Well, after using this product several times, I find my hair is not tinning, but now has life and luster again. I love the lightness of the product, and the way it leaves the hair in a condition I have not seen in years. I definitely will be a return customer.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo and vitamins about 2 months ago and I love the shampoo!!  It smells great and my hair does appear to be healthier and has more body.  I would highly recommend these products and I will keep using myself.</li>
            <li> Hair feels healthier and softer just after the second use.</li>
            <li> Have noticed no difference.  Except it is very overpriced.  Still trying and my hair is dry. Thin and aweful.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of these shampoos and this one is the best in my experience, i can see a difference and the bottle is only 1/2 way empty, im going to buy more and see what happens!</li>
            <li> Update as of APRIL 22: I forgot to update this picture of my hair after flat ironing it (this was about a month ago). Notice: The only product I used on my hair is this shampoo and did not use any styling products on my hair. (the picture with straight hair is the updated one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy and satisfied with this shampoo! Amazing how this shampoo ALONE moisturizes and hydrates my hair. Let me just give you a little understanding about my hair. I have thick, wavy, dry, medium coarse hair; lately, I have also experienced hair loss. I am taking supplements for it and it has helped, BUT even with supplements, I still have to find a good quality shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry or add more damage to my hair. Well I received this complimentary hair loss shampoo for reviewing and testing purposes and after just one wash, I am very pleased with the results. After washing my hair, my hair feels so soft and smooth. As you can see in the picture, that&#x27;s my hair after washing with this hair loss shampoo. I did not add any product to my hair except for drying it with a towel. Even after drying my hair, it does not feel nor does it look dry. I can&#x27;t wait to style it tomorrow morning. Overall, I highly recommend this product. The ingredients in this bottle are natural oils that are moisturizing for your hair WITHOUT damaging your hair. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the smell; it smells LOVELY. I can&#x27;t wait to see more results from this hair loss shampoo.</li>
            <li> I did like the shampoo.  It made my hair feel thicker the first time I used it.  I did get the shampoo thru a promotional purchase.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not sure it has helped my shedding hair (I shed a lot!), I have falling in shampoo love or heaven either is very likely! Honestly, I didn&#x27;t even read the bottle when I received it just put in in my tub so it was there for me next time I needed it. I often get tired of reading false claims of products doing certain jobs, expecting it, and being let down. I proceeded to wash my hair later that day and as I was blow drying my hair I thought to myself my hair felt funny. Not a bad funny just funny as in different. The more I proceeded to touch my hair the more it bugged me. After thinking about it for a minute I realized my hair was clean!! Yeah I wash my hair but by clean I mean for once all of the product was out of my hair and all that was left was clean hair, instead of washed hair with product still in it, because it is (what I thought) was impossible at the time, it was well, normal for left over product to be in my hair. For the next day I kept thinking to myself &amp;#34;well I&#x27;m not sure if it helps hair growth but they need to mention how clean it makes your hair.&amp;#34; Well tonight I went to wash my hair again and decided to read the bottle and of course the bottle even claimed on it to get rid of the build up. I will forever be a lifetime user of this Vitamins Hair Growth Shampoo! So glad I discovered this product!</li>
            <li> improved my hair texture.  too soon to determine if it helped any growth.</li>
            <li> Bogus claim that it can grow 121%.   My thin hair hadn&#x27;t changed much after 3 months.   I don&#x27;t understand how it got so many good reviews.  I guess it works for them.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product after reading positive reviews on Amazon. I&#x27;m 25 years old and my hair is starting to thing. I decided I needed something that might help because I didn&#x27;t want intake any chemicals or pills. Soo I ended up purchasing this. This product actually didn&#x27;t do anything for me, but make me lose even more hair. I noticed so much more hair lost within my first month of using it. I followed all the instructions AND applied it regularly, but it was of NO use. I am very disappointed in it and don&#x27;t recommend it to any one. Would like to speak to someone from Nourish Beaute. Please contact or comment on post.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Hair feels fuller and a bit less shedding.</li>
            <li> As the body ages, so brings changes to the hair.  This is an excellent shampoo, complete with ingredients....  the VITAMINS needed for hair rejuvenation, hair loss,  brittle hair, split ends,  etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, shampoos on the market are not geared toward saving and restoring the hair.  But,  if you have serious issues, going through life&#x27;s changes that affect your body,  get this shampoo....  better yet, invest in this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have color-treated hair, and when I shampoo,  I always need conditioner.  I tried this without conditioner to make as assessment.  I washed my hair, and did not have to use conditioner.  The hair was softer.  Plus, this has a good smell that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this,  I need all the vitamins I can get for my hair.  As we grow older,  out hair is one to experience changes too.  Product for Review....Rizzo</li>
            <li> it has a nice fragrance, but thats about it. i wont be using the rest of the bottle. one week of shampoos proved to be a bad idea. it left my hair greasy and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product free/at a substantial discount for my opinions and review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 weeks now. The process of hair loss is less, however I have not seen any softening or hair growth yet. The shampoo seems to have a more drying effect on my hair. I will give it 2 to 3 months as recommended before I decide whether to give up or not.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo approximately a month ago.  I have noticed that my hair loss has diminished tremendously.  I am definitely going to reorder again and will order extra for my sister who is also dealing with hair loss as well.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t all it was cracked up to be like everyone says. I was disappointed with how small the bottle was for a big price. Every time I used the shampoo I did the directions and rinsed it out for about 2 minutes because it always left my hair nasty and greasy feeling in the back. I didn&#x27;t want to waste it so I just finished with it. The plus side is that it smells good but I did NOT see NO hair growth what so ever. My hair remained the same length and that was my purpose for buying this. So is didn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean and it didn&#x27;t make my hair grow. So yeah, a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh. This is the WORST shampoo I have ever used. I usually go 2-4 days in between washes, so I&#x27;m used to my hair getting a little greasy. I use dry shampoo occasionally if need be. My hair was such a disgusting, greasy MESS after using this shampoo that even dry shampoo couldn&#x27;t help. (And yes, I lathered very well for several minutes, let it sit a while, rinsed well, and didn&#x27;t use conditioner after.) I had my fiancé touch my hair after I dried it and he was completely grossed out...he pulled his hand away, saying something like &amp;#34;ulllUGH!&amp;#34; I literally had to wash my hair right after using it because I couldn&#x27;t leave my house with my hair looking that gross. I was sending out a major Ethan-Hawke-in-the-90s vibe! Maybe if you have short hair (mine is shoulder length) or always wear a baseball cap (and don&#x27;t care if it gets destroyed by oil) this shampoo would work for you. But if you wanna leave the house and not look like a total grease ball, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works Just as advertised! Will definitely purchase again and again and will recommend to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! My hair is getting thicker and shiny</li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo! Your hair absorbs the vitamins it needs while cleaning your hair at the same time...leaving it full-bodied and beautiful. Great product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it helping that much.  I do have some new hair come in, but not where I need it to.  It lasts quite a while.  I bought another bottle and giving it another try.</li>
            <li> Did not care for it, leaves hair oily</li>
            <li> NOT SURE ABOUT THIS.  I DIDN&#x27;T SEE ANY NEW GROWTH, AS A MATTER OF FACT, MY HAIR WAS SHEDDING MORE THAN NORMAL.  I DONT THINK I WILL PURCHASE THIS AGAIN.  I&#x27;M NOT SURE IF IT WORKS, AT LEAST NOT FOR ME.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Makes my hair a lot easier to manage :) will definitely buy again! I&#x27;m hoping my hair grows now ;)</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this shampoo and my hair seems to be reaping the benefits! I just ordered the triple pack as is a little less expensive.  I will continue to use it!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo did help my hair become thicker, but don&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;re trying to fill in a bald spot. Mine never changed and actually got worse. My hair is thicker in the back and front, but no regrowth occurred at the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to return and say how much I love this product.  I have been using since late Nov I think, I do have new hair growth and I&#x27;m hoping for more.  My hair grows slowly - so here&#x27;s HOPING!!  :)</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this Vitamins shampoo and I am very impressed.  I am in my 40s and I was starting to show signs of thinning hair and I wanted to change it.  I did a lot of research and found this product on Amazon.  Yes it is a bit more expensive but the product really is amazing.  I get compliments on how shining and healthy my hair looks daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 2 months and there isn&#x27;t much of a difference but I may need to keep using the product to see better results</li>
            <li> My hair has been thinning so bad since I had my baby. I feel like the thickness still isn&#x27;t where I want it,  but it is getting slightly thicker. Also, I have only used it for a month, and this shampoo goes along way, I still have over half a bottle. I think it smells good and leaves my frizzy hair a lot smoother.  I am going to continue using this and hope that it continues to thicken my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine and has no body.  Too make matters worse I am 68 yo and and beginning to thin.  After shampooing and blow drying my hair would be flat and I had to check to see if my scalp was covered. I don&#x27;t have bald spots, just very thin areas.  I have been using this for over a month and am elated with the results.  Now when I blow dry my hair, it has much more volume.  Also I cannot find any thin spots.  I thought it was very expensive, but I have concluded that it is well worth the price.  I did follow the directions and shampoo for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Great lather and scent.</li>
            <li> I have waist-length hair.  The thing about long hair is, though, that it&#x27;s much thicker at the top and by the time you get to the ends, it has thinned out considerably.  Of course there are a lot of reasons for this, but one of them is that your hair has a natural growth cycle (which, for most people, lasts from 2-6 years).  As this ends, individual hairs stop growing.  (Though you always have some active follicles, unless you have lost all your hair.)  Over time, longer/older hairs fall out.  At least, that&#x27;s how it seems to be with me.  I want to keep those longer/older hairs for as long as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reasoning behind me using this shampoo is that if I can keep my hair growing past the typical 2-6 year cycle and maintain the length.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m already starting to notice a change.  (It&#x27;ll take awhile to see the full effects, though, because my hair is so long.)  It took a few days of really scrubbing this into my scalp, but pretty soon, I noticed fewer hairs coming out as I shampooed.  Over the next week or two, the number decreased yet again.  I won&#x27;t say that all hairs have stopped falling out yet, but I have definitely seen improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a good shampoo.  It lathers very well and gets my hair clean.  It has a pleasant scent that would be suitable for either men or women to use.  Once a week, I deep condition my hair with coconut oil.  Normally, that is very difficult to remove, but this shampoo gets it out quite nicely.  The only thing to watch out for is that this contains sulfates, which are not always the best for color-treated hair.  (I haven&#x27;t had trouble in that regard, but many people with color-treated hair avoid sulfates.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I think this product is going to be best for people who have noticed a little thinning hair or want a little more length (but who are not at the point where they need prescription-strength help), and who are willing to give it a couple of weeks to really take effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.weeks to really take effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> Less hair falling out...but dried out my scalp. My ENTIRE scalp flaked off. Grossest experience!</li>
            <li> Rich Shampoo !!! Last a long time , all you need is a little !!!!!</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any benefits (cost vs results).  It is VERY perfumey, so be aware if you have sensitive skin or do not like strong smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li> Too highly concentrated for my thin long strands. I&#x27;m sure if I had thicker strands, I would love it.</li>
            <li> SORRY TO SAY THIS DID NOT WORK FOR ME.  HAD TO GET A REFUND</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how a hair growth and vitamin shampoo contains sulfate, it was my mistake in ordering it, but never would I guess it has sulfate which is not good for hair.  so I won&#x27;t use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> ok I have been using this for about 4 months and the bottle is empty, It does smell nice but honestly I have not seen a difference. I have fine hair and it really did not do anything for me. I would not recommend this product....I went back to Pantene...</li>
            <li> Still working on the results. Love the smell though.</li>
            <li> Have not seen much difference yet</li>
            <li> I had PRP and laser treatments a couple years ago, which made a big difference, but my hair had started to get dry and break. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple months now. It has a nice light feel, and my hair hasn&#x27;t been breaking as much since I&#x27;ve been using it. My stylist said she can tell I have some new growth. I plan to continue using it. I&#x27;ve tried everything there is, and this is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have to give this shampoo a three only because I do not wash my everyday as stated, but I am hoping that it will eventually help with getting my hair healthy and help it grow. So I will update my review in a month and hopefully can give it 5 stars....</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle. Lasted for about 3 months. The shampoo smells great but I couldn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair. Too bad - I had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> My husband would love to use this shampoo regularly, but it&#x27;s a bit too expensive.</li>
            <li> Im a guy and i been using the shampoo for a couple days now.. i don&#x27;t want to over exaggerate, but i feel like its working.. I&#x27;m sorry guys i can&#x27;t really explain, its only been a few days, but i Like it.. i think everyone should definitely try this shampoo.. I&#x27;m going to write another review in a couple months</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and have to color every two weeks. My hair would be dry because of all the coloring. It&#x27;s only been a month yet I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is not dry, slightly fuller, shinier, but mostly healthier. I will continue to use this shampoo in hopes that results continue. Very pleased :-)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on ANYTHING, but thought I would for this product due to the quick difference I noticed with my hair.  I am a 50 year old woman who is going through menopause.  Any woman out there going through this knows that you start to notice hair thinning significantly.  Well, I tried taking biotin daily, using those stinky hair growth shampoos, even taking pre-natal vitamins to help stop the loss.  This was to no avail.  I would comb my hair after washing it, and strands would inevitably come out.&lt;br /&gt;3 weeks ago I started to use vitamins shampoo (thought well if cancer patients gain regain hair growth, this must be good); what did I have to lose.  Well, although I do not wash my hair daily, like bottle states, I noticed the first week of use, that when I combed my hair, NOTHING came out.  Went to get hair trimmed after using shampoo for 2 weeks and my hair dresser commented, that my hair felt thicker and silkier (she did not know I changed my shampoo).  After my 3rd week, I noticed when I rung out my hair, I need to go further down to get it all; not measured but by eye looks like 1&amp;#34; (maybe a bit more).  This has been such a great product for me.  I have recommended it to a friend of mine whom was complaining to me today about her thinning hair (she is much younger than I).  She is ordering today, and we will be monitoring her progress.  Will try to come back to update you on how it worked for her.  I would highly recommend.  Thanks for reading my long winded kudos for this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait at least 6 months before writing anything so that I could be more sure, and I can honestly say that I have a new &amp;#34;crop&amp;#34; of hair on my head!  My hair is naturally very fine so when I had begun to lose it, I began to panic a bit.  I use this shampoo every other day and use WEN on the days in between.  After using several other products, I think I&#x27;ve finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> Well I have been using for over a month and I can honestly say the amount of hair in the shower drain is about 75-80% less than before.  Still hair in my brush, but again, not as much.  My hairdresser said my hair looked better. It is pricey, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Ive just started using it, it makes my hair frizzy so far. I was on beta-blocker high blood pressure medication for 3 years. This past year I noticed my hair falling out in handfuls everyday. I thought it was the water in the shower drying out my hair, so I got a filtered shower head. That helped alittle but the problem remained. Then I started getting dandruff, oh my god&#x27;d I&#x27;ve never had dandruff before! I didn&#x27;t know what was going on so I started putting unrefined coconut oil on my head and wrapping it with a shower cap overnight. That helped for a day but as soon as I washed my hair the same problems occurred. I&#x27;ve gotten off of the HBP medication and have been eating 3 tablespoons a day of unrefined coconut oil along with my vitamins, the problem seems to have stopped, now I wait for my hair to grow back in. I will always stick to natural remedies instead of prescription pills.</li>
            <li> This is the second time i write a review on amazon.This product has done so much for my hair and i am getting many compliments in how my hair looks i use it in combination with coconut oil and wash every other day and it has lasted me quit some time already i wish i could have taken before and after pictures.It also has a nice smell which is a plus and i have new baby hairs growing out as well thats how i noticed it was working and my hair is obviously long aswell...love love this product</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in my hair.  My hairdresser asked me what I was doing because she said my hair felt and looked thicker.  That is great news and so easy to use and good for my hair all at the same time!  I would recommend this product to anyone with thin hair.</li>
            <li> So, background. I&#x27;m a young woman in her 20&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve had fine hair all through my life, but it only started giving me trouble in college—maybe the stress caused it to thin out. Either way, I end up spending a lot of money trying to disguise the fine/thin combo and honestly, it&#x27;s taken it&#x27;s toll. I didn&#x27;t want to spring for other hair regrowth products because so many people mention hair falling out in clumps or, once they stopped using the product, their hair just reverted back to pre-treatment, if not worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about two weeks now. So far, I&#x27;m really in love with it. You really don&#x27;t need to use much to get a lather, and it smells very appealing. I haven&#x27;t had noticeable regrowth (nor do I expect it so early in) but my hair feels and looks so much healthier. It&#x27;s shinier and far, far less prone to frizziness. If anything, it feels and looks thicker. And that&#x27;s only two weeks in, so I&#x27;m very excited to see what it looks like in three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect it to be a cure-all, but I&#x27;m optimistic. Will update as things progress.</li>
            <li> Not bad....noticed not much hair is falling out.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo! Love the scent! Gives my hair body and bounce. Haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic increase in growth but have only been using it a few weeks. Also wish there was a conditioner to go with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service after an initial issue and I was given some shampoo to try. Although I was impatient and for a couple of months I only noticed a reduction in the loss-- I finally noticed signs of regrowth! Definitely worth a shot!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is luxurious. The claim to help hair loss is too soon to review, however, I love the way my hair feels. It&#x27;s fuller and stronger to my touch. I&#x27;m waiting for the sulfate free shampoo, but will continue using this product until then. I hope to have a fuller head of hair by then.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really has helped my 60 year old thinning hair regrow itself. I had so much hair regrowth that I had short little hairs growing like a halo. Now they are all longer and my daily hair loss is once again normal. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have hair loss issue. I have tried so many oils, shampoos and treatments but nothing worked for me. Then I got the biotin hair loss Shampoo. I use few times a week and I have noticed less hair every shower. I have more fuller hair.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has nice consistency. It has nice scent into. The shampoo is transparent white. It has all natural ingredients which are great for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;It makes hair shiny and strong. I would recommend this shampoo for more volume.&lt;br /&gt;I received this shampoo as a sample to try and give unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reordered my hair feels fuller....</li>
            <li> So far, the NOURISH shampoo and vitamins have been awesome for my husband. We purchased these about a month ago while he was noticing some thinning. At his most recent haircut, he came home with his hair shorter but realized he didn&#x27;t have to worry about thinness showing - some had started to fill in; in fact, his hair seems thicker. Certainly he has stopped losing hair when brushing it, anyway, which was a big enough difference to encourage him.  We&#x27;ll be reordering the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a little bit of a difference - glad I have short hair - kind of expensive</li>
            <li> I am a 45 year old woman trying to find any kind of shampoo that will help with my hair loss. After reading many reviews I decided to try it. It gives your hair body for sure! Not sure everyone would find this a good kind of body though. It makes it look more frizzy then anything. Its better then being super flat but a bit much. It leaves your hair feeling a little sticky at first. Makes it hard to brush through my hair and I am still having alot of shedding. I gave it 3 stars for the body it gives me. Otherwise, looking for another shampoo now.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really make my hair grow longer. It only gave it a slight effect of thickness. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 Weeks and not much growth.</li>
            <li> So far so good, only a few days using and can see a decrease in hair loss after washing.  Also do not need a bunch of conditioner, just a dime size (my hair is long) and all tangles are prevented.  Ponytail feels thicker.  Will update when bottle is used up.</li>
            <li> My hair stopped falling out so profusely immediately.  Also makes my hair feel great!  I will continue to use this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I just recently started using this product and I really like it so far. It has a really pleasant smell to it and I love the way my hair feels after using this shampoo. The company is really customer service driven as I asked a question on their website and received an answer to my question within an hour of asking the question. Wasn&#x27;t expecting them to respond that fast! I look forward to continual use of the product and seeing results.</li>
            <li> Got to try this for a reduce price and in return I would provide an host review; I&#x27;ve only used this shampoo a fews times so far and I have no complaints; smells good and leaves my hair feeling soft can&#x27;t tell about the hair growth yet will update with more information later.</li>
            <li> Might work for some- but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference AT ALL after using the whole bottle. Eh- worth a try! As a shampoo it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> I love how this shampoo and how it improved the feel of my hair since I first use. My hair was softer and easier to manage. I have even noticed less breakage.</li>
            <li> I have been losing my hair. It must be bad enough for men but at least bald is a style for them….women, not so much! I looked, read, talked to people, all to no avail. One day while just goofing around I saw an ad for VITAMINS shampoo. I was getting desperate so I ordered and included the bottle of vitamins to boost my chances. The order didn&#x27;t ship right away so I was almost at my wits end when it finally arrived. Oh oh, the bottle looks small. I opened the bottle and sniffed…hmmm, not bad. OK, let&#x27;s do this. Did I mention the hair I did have was in horrible condition? I always had beautiful, strong, shiny hair. Well not then! I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday so it may have taken longer for me but I LOVE this shampoo! The stylist doing my last cut told me I have &amp;#34;all kinds of baby hair growing in&amp;#34;! How exciting is that? You don&#x27;t need a lot of shampoo and no conditioner, you can comb with no problem. My hair is shiny again and I get complements all the time on how much hair I have. (Not that much has grown back already! It&#x27;s the volume.) Those other shampoos that promise volume really have no idea! I feel so lucky that I found VITAMINS. I came on to give my review so you could know that this isn&#x27;t just hype but a real honest to goodness product that works. None of us have money to throw away on things that don&#x27;t work but you won&#x27;t be disappointed with VITAMINS, I&#x27;m not and I&#x27;m placing another order right now! Thanks for listening. I&#x27;ll be checking back to read some of your success stories!</li>
            <li> Hair looks healthy and shinier but did not improve the growth.</li>
            <li> Love love love it. My hair has never been thicker, fuller, nor has it grown faster. My sister did not recognize me when I picked her up at Union Station. She said, &amp;#34;I thought it was your car but I saw this lady with long hair.&amp;#34; Now, I cannot say, for sure, that this shampoo stopped my hair from falling out, and it has not stopped it completely--but it sure stopped falling out the way it was before! I was in crisis, so I bought this, but I also started taking the herb, saw palmetto, and in the beginning I used some well-reviewed hair growth oils, regularly, as well as aloe, and rosemary rinses (which I would leave in for hours at a time), and I made special treatments, and I rinsed with organic apple cider vinegar, baking soda, and I took biotin and Vitamin D and C, and all kinds of maca powder, gelatin, supplements, you name it . . . I was desperate! So, I am not sure if the cure was the combination of intensive treatments but my hair stopped falling out and believe me it was coming out almost in bunches before this. Very scary!  But after a few weeks, when I saw that it was much better, I stopped most of the other treatments and just kept using this shampoo, and I kept taking the saw palmetto, biotin, and some multiple vitamins, and it has continued to grow fast and stay very thick, full, and healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthier although there is a lot of static when I use a flat iron. I have not noticed any new hair growth at this point.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair a little too silky. It may contain too many oils especially if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely creates bias on whether or not this product is worth buying for others who pay full price.</li>
            <li> Seeing less shedding after only two weeks!  It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to know if there is regrowth.</li>
            <li> So far been using it a couple weeks and I noticed I don&#x27;t have hair in the drain anymore.  It does make my hair look thicker and feel great.</li>
            <li> I tend to only review products I feel strongly about.  I Started thyroid meds 9 years ago.  In the first few months of that joyous ride, I lost about 2/3rds of my hair.  The only reason I still have hair I believe is because of Nioxin.  It has been my partner for all those years.  However,  lately my hair has been starting to fall out again, but more its been flat and lifeless.  I read the reviews on several new shampoos and chose this one.  I live in the non-moisture land of Colorado.  My hair immediately felt better and looked better using this shampoo.  I will say I need to use a bit of conditioner due to where I am and the bozo naturally curly hair I have.  We shall see how this goes as the year progresses.</li>
            <li> The smell is WONDERFUL! I have a hair condition, and thought this was the answer. I am having my husband&lt;br /&gt;use it for hair growth now instead, plus, sometimes I use it. He comes out of the shower smelling great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and was very disappointed - especially due to the expensive price.  It did not show increase in growth , and it left my hair feeling unclean, limp and weighed down.  Sorry to be so negative, but when you pay this much for a bottle of shampoo one would at least expect your hair to look and feel clean.  I hung onto it and tried it several times, but had the same results.  Would not recommend it - after all when one is trying to treat thinning hair to boost their self-esteem, the last thing they need is an expensive shampoo that actually makes their hair look worse!  One is looking for a positive result based on other reviews and what the owner is promoting.  I should&#x27;ve returned it within the time frame.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, doesn&#x27;t even burn your eyes if you get any in there! Can&#x27;t wait to get the conditioner</li>
            <li> My hair has grown so much I don&#x27;t have fly away hair anymore.</li>
            <li> We did some research on products and this one appeared to have the least side affects and also had a lot of positive reviews.  My wife and I have been using it for a couple months now and are seeing encouraging signs of our hair making some growth.  It&#x27;s good for both men and women.  We have both noticed a decrease in hair loss.  I would recommend this to those who are not too far along the balding process who are looking for something safe and fairly priced.</li>
            <li> I was really frustrated with my hair it was stiff and oily. I straighten my hair once a week and I don&#x27;t put anything on my hair to style. Also I have thinning hair so it was a number of issues I had. So I decided to try Vitamins hair shampoo. And I could honestly say that on the first use I saw a big difference  my hair was soft and manageable after it dryied it wasn&#x27;t oily at all.  Happy with my purchase. Gave it a four because haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement on my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> This is really awesome stuff. It really leaves your hair smelling and looking great. I have been using this along with taking hair vitamins, and my hair has grown much faster. I highly recommend this shampoo.  I have also noticed that I don&#x27;t have to use as many hair products as this shampoo gives my hair more texture and gives it a fuller, healthier look.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a wonderful product. At first I thought this is too good to be true or it would smell fruity (a concern for most guys). It has a nice mountain sent. After approximately 4 weeks I noticed fine new hairs staring to sprout. This product really does work well. If you are hesitating because of the cost, don&#x27;t. I have been using this shampoo for about 2 months and I am still on my first bottle. Yes I have short hair but you just need a small dab, it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> SO my 20th birthday is tomorrow and i finally ran out of the shampoo after two months. The first double pic is where i never grew hair due to my head cracking open there due to a monkey bars collapsing on me when I was 7. But now it finally grew there thanks to the product. and my hair was always a tad thin. but the shampoo made it grow a lot, made it thicker, and fuller! I&#x27;m glad I got my long hair back I needed forever! Plus It made my hair completely soft! Will buy more soon!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now. So far so good. I have noticed that I loose less hair in the shower and my hair seems to be thicker. I&#x27;m not completely sure on the regrowth, but I think it&#x27;s working. Yes this product is expensive, but so far it&#x27;s worth it. The bottle lasts a while.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair feel thicker and fuller.A lady saw me at the grocery store, and she said oh I love your hair did you just get it done. I did not know this lady ,but wow that shampoo must be working for me.</li>
            <li> I received a very courteous email from the seller, with added information about the Vitamins Shampoo. I will be using it for the first time tonight. Will follow up how my hair is reacting to the product, once I have used it for awhile. I&#x27;m excited and was very impressed with the informative and nice email from the seller. I have never had that happen before when I purchased a product, ever!!!!  Hey,we have talked/emailed before. I already use your shampoo. I just love it!!! I have to take thyroid medications, and have my levels checked about every 3 months. I ordered my first bottle through Amazon about 6 months ago, and my hair salon stylist said my last 3 visits, girl your hair is growing a lot!!! Made me smile!!!! I found this card in my last shipment of your shampoo, so I joined your VIP club, and looking so forward to it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping me stop losing so much hair!!! By the way, it smells wonderful!!! Keep up the good work, I saw your hair serum on your website, I believe I will have to try that too!!!  Warmest Regards- Your Faithful Customer</li>
            <li> Ordered this in May. Had been losing handfuls and brushes full of hair ever day for 4 years. Doctors couldn&#x27;t explain why. Then last May my husband &amp; I went away.  I slept my vacation days away &amp; silently cried to myself from the excrusiating pain I had in my breasts, lymph nodes,  bones, &amp; the base of my brain grew with masses. I said nothing to no one as cancer runs in my family &amp;  I just lost my mother to lung cancer.  Keeping it silent was my coping mechanism  as my only brother passed away at age 31 of a glioblastoma (brain cancer).  He was pressured from my older sister &amp; his wife to under go treatment against his better judgement &amp; mine. He was. end stage so why suffer for those who looked out for themselves. Any way ; when I took my shower and the strainer I placed in the drain of our RV quickly got clogged from all my hair I knew I was in trouble. A regular mammogram was inconclusive as all those from the past 15 years. I had a new primary physician who insisted on me having an MIR of my breast. The hammer came down and I am in for the ride of my life. After hearing the insurance company wouldn&#x27;t let me do a PET SCAN to see how bad the rest of me is I began my own holistic approach.  I began with this since my hair was my everything.  36&amp;#34; of it. Within 3 weeks my hair stopped falling out and all the research is paying off. Our government knows they are purposely poisoning us like using food grade peroxide on our meat to kill the germs. Peroxide is a cancer agent. So bleaching my teeth didn&#x27;t help.  Our ancestors lived longer and healthier.  So why are we dying young and suffer from diabetes,  fibromyalgia,  lupus and autism? Listen to your gut literally.  It never lies.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but leaves my hair too oily,</li>
            <li> This product did everything it said it would. After the first use, my hair was extremely shiny and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered with alopecia for years, and I can see small hairs beginning to grow. Would give 6 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Only have used product for about 3-4 weeks. So far my hair looks fuller but it may be just bushier; I am waiting for at least another month to see if there is new growth.</li>
            <li> I never had better if i get more money on my account i want to buy more i like it</li>
            <li> My barber said I was in the early stages of male pattern baldness. He quickly reversed his opinion, probably sensing I didn&#x27;t want to be blamed for more stuff. He gave me a lot of tips though including the value of really good shampoos. He strongly approves of this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like my barber knows shampoo. He has a state barber&#x27;s certificate and works as a barber for the state. You can&#x27;t get better than that unless you&#x27;re talking about a federal barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the video reviewers about how with this shampoo there is less hair loss. The proof is in the fact that I have been getting fewer hairs on my comb. And this is based on some days using the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo received for sincere review.</li>
            <li> After one month of using the shampoo I can feel new hair coming in the front.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the results so far. It leaves the hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Really clean my scalp and my hair is getting more shine each time I use it.  I think I have more body also but it is too soon to tell</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a pleasant scent &amp; lathered very well with a small amount being used. My hair was increased in volume after using. It cleansed my hair very well...Almost as if it were a clarifying shampoo! Hair seemed little dry after washing, so maybe I need to add a moisturizing conditioner to my routine??  I&#x27;ve only used once so far, but will update this review after a couple of months. I will give it time to see if there is any new hair growth. I am writing this review to receive future offers for giving my honest opinion. Btw, the item arrived as promised &amp; was packaged very well with NO leaking!</li>
            <li> Great product! It was delivered ahead of time.</li>
            <li> I have lupus, more specifically systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease with ride-ranging effects and no known cure. In fact, the FDA approval of the lupus medication Benlysta® in 2011 marked the first time since 1955 that a new treatment for lupus came to be; in the interim, patients deal with the myriad symptoms through a combination of therapies. This, of course, brings me to my review: VITAMINS® shampoo, designed to promote hair growth for women who have experienced loss/thinning. As you have no doubt surmised, all forms of lupus are known to cause hair loss in some patients, and while not as horrific as other aspects of the disease, having beautiful hair is very important for self-confidence, as well as a positive mental outlook, possibly more so than having scars, rashes, or other noticeable physical symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presentation, Packaging, and Appearance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VITAMINS® shampoo comes in a standard plastic bottle, however it is a bit thinner than others that you may see in stores. The shampoo itself is clear and of a decent consistency, not too watery and not as thick as a conditioner. The lather is rich; a little bit goes a VERY long way, which is especially beneficial as each bottle costs $40. The smell is pleasant and “earthy”, a cross between sandalwood, roses, and coconut. After worked into a lather, the shampoo is pleasantly cool on the scalp, although milder than some eucalyptus oil-derived products. All-in-all the packaging and physical aspects of VITAMINS® shampoo are professional, pleasant, and does not sacrifice too much space in the valuable real estate of a bath/shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Efficacy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bread &amp; butter of VITAMINS® shampoo is its claim that the ingredients used will promote hair growth; thus, without meeting this criteria, VITAMINS® would become nothing more than an overpriced shampoo. So, does it work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result of the thinning of my hair due to my disease, it wasn’t unusual for me to see decently-sized clumps coming out with every shower. Drano is a regular purchase for our household as a result. Thus, it was with a great deal of hope, not to mention skepticism, which I gladly accepted the opportunity to test out this product. So the burning question, then: does it work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short answer? Yes. The long answer? Most likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using this product to assess its performance, I was careful to include my boyfriend’s “analysis” of my hair to curtail the “Placebo Effect”. Even with skepticism, it is still possible to succumb to inflated perceptions while using a product when you are desperate for results. Thus, some of the opinion listed above is based upon his input.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first week, showering every other day, while my hair felt clean and my scalp had a cool sensation even a couple of hours post-application, I really did not notice any difference with my hair. By week two, however, my hair felt thicker and had more body. Week three further expanded this result, and my boyfriend said that running his fingers through my hair he definitely noticed a change. Since I have medium-long hair that is all one length, I was able to check for new growth relatively easily; sliding my hands through it just now resulted in finding several strands that were shorter than the hairs around it. While some of these are no doubt from “regular” growth patterns, the sheer number have me convinced that VITAMINS® shampoo really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer’s description indicates that stopping this shampoo will return my “productive” hair follicles back to their dormant activity. While I have not run out of the shampoo nor stopped using it long enough to verify the veracity of this statement, I will admit that I am disappointed in this fact. Being disabled, I cannot afford the price of this shampoo; even if I could, I wince at the price. Yes, my hair is important to me, but the cost of each bottle makesme want to embrace my “natural” hair and just live with the painful effects of my lupus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the End&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VITAMINS® shampoo surprised me; it truly does work. Combined with a formulation that only uses a small amount for each shampoo, the pleasant smell, and the undeniable effect of having thicker hair, I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who wants gorgeous hair. Note: this product is not a miracle hair-grower and maximizing the benefits of this shampoo will require time and continued usage. Thus, due to this aspect as well as the $40 price tag that is a smidgen too rich for my blood, I am happy to grant 4 stars to VITAMINS® shampoo by Nourish Beaut&amp;eacute;. In short, if you can afford to shell out $40 on a bottle of shampoo and will be diligent with its usage, you too can have thicker, shiny, and pleasant-smelling hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

            <li> I bought this shampoo as a gift to my friend. She loves this shampoo. One week later, when I saw her, her hair is thicker than it really is. My friend told me the shampoo leaves no residue and her hair is easy to style now. I am happy to buy it to her.</li>
            <li> Order arrived perfectly, thank you!</li>
            <li> Not surejust been useing it a few weeks..</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Before I used the product my hair was falling out where the top of my head was balding.  I used this product for a week now and I already notice a difference.  Less hair is falling out.  I am really happy that I joined this club.  Thank you Nourish Beaute for this wonderful product!  You have a customer for life.  :)</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair. I have tried many shampoos that claim they will help stop hair loss and help with thinning hair. None of those worked for my hair. This shampoo has made a dramatic difference for my hair. I have noticed that I am losing less hair and my hair looks and feels fuller.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews of this shampoo I was really exited to try it out. Unfortunately the shampoo has not done anything, in fact I feel as though my hair loss/shedding has increased over the past months. I have been using it has directed. Disappointing results.</li>
            <li> Product was received for free in exchange of my honest opinion. This shampoo has a lot of very famous ingredients for healthy hair and prevention of hair loss. This shampoo is used as a treatment for men and women that is clinically proven to get results- naturally - with healthy patented ingredients plus natural biotin, coconut oil and castor oil. Seller recommend that this should be used at least for 2-3 months for visible effects in 30- 90 days.</li>
            <li> Let me first say two things; I&amp;#34;m only 6 weeks into my usage and I&#x27;m also using a laser. I&#x27;m not here to review the laser so I wont be specific about the brand, but it&#x27;s one of those &amp;#34;laser combs&amp;#34; And I know it seems weird, but hey, &amp;#34;point this light at your head, and hair will grow&amp;#34; is not much different from &amp;#34;rub this stuff on your head, and hair will grow&amp;#34; in the believability department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for about...a year, I would say, I kept look at my forehead area hairline asking &amp;#34;is something going on? Is my hair getting thing?&amp;#34; But I&#x27;m a black guy with long hair (not dreaded) and it&#x27;s kinda hard to tell when you have so MUCH hair. And for a while I tried to ease up on the ponytails and/or braids. Just kept it loose as possible to see if that would solve the issue. It did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s when the panic set in because the thinning seemed to be accelerating. Thus began my search that I&#x27;m sure millions before have done-what can I do/what can I afford/what am I willing to do. My research come up with 2 solutions; DHT blocker and lasers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 6 weeks ago I started using both. Neither seem to recommend daily use, so my regiment became every other day for both-just alternating the two. And here we are (see pics). My plan was not to really judge until I hit the 4 month mark, but I think I&#x27;ve had a visible enough level of progress to at least post some pics. At this point I&#x27;m going to give the shampoo to a female relative who has a MUCH more severe hair thinning issue. She did not like the laser. So she will be doing shampoo only and I&#x27;ll update with her results. I have had no negative effects-but I&#x27;m not 100% positive yet.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t expect a miracle, and didn&#x27;t get one. Husband was very cynical about this natural product, but just asked me to reorder because it has greatly reduced the amount of hair loss. Very happy to get a good result even if it didn&#x27;t grow any back, we&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and its vitamin together in the beginning of August. I was so excited, so I used the shampoo and took the vitamin right away. I used the shampoo 3x in a week and took the vitamin everyday. I had high expectations for these products since my hair has been thinning and the reviews seemed promising. The first couple days my hair looked shiny and smooth but after using it for almost one month; I noticed that my falling hair issue is back. My hair also became flat instead of voluminous. I now again find my hair on my bath room floor all over. This made me very sad. The shampoo and vitamin are not cheap but I&#x27;m willing to try and what I got was disappointment. I&#x27;m not happy with the products. I really am not. The shampoo worked in the first few days only, then for the rest, it didn&#x27;t work at all. For that reason, I gave one star.</li>
            <li> Works. Seriously. All you need to know. Thick. Rich. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I  Love this shampoo. From the first time I used it my hair was sooooooo much softer. My hair was bridle and very dry. I had breakage that was so bad.This shampoo has ended all my breakage and my dry hair. Iam going to buy another bottle. Thanks</li>
            <li> I am writing to express appreciation for the customer service received from Nourish Beaute!!  Excellent customer service that exceeds your expectations.  Thank you much!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing much or any change so far. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for a little over a month and I am hoping to see something soon. I am 29 years old, dealing with hair thinning due to thyroid/birth control issues. My dermatologist didn&#x27;t really say much about whether or not I can regrow my hair, but I am hoping that this shampoo improves my hair thickness when I have used it longer. I am also not seeing much of a change with the texture of my hair. The shampoo actually seems to leave my hair a bit oily after a day, almost as if residue of the shampoo is left in it. I gave it only 2 stars, but I will post again after I have been using it for 3 months.</li>
            <li> I used to have very thick and heavy hair but almost 6 months ago I felt I am losing to much hair. Every time I glide my fingers through my hair I see a whole a lot of hair there. I was thinking the way I am losing hair I would be bald soon. Every hair wash I saw lot of hair breaking while I shampoo and conditioner my hair. I am using the Nourish Beaute Vitamins hair loss shampoo for over 2 weeks now and I wash my hair every other day and I have noticed huge difference in my hair. I have less hair fall. When I wash my hair I see less hair fall with every use, While brushing and styling my hair I see only minimal come off. My hair are growing fast. Also I see new hair growing. I have healthy, smooth and shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would say the overall texture and effect of the Vitamin shampoo is awesome. It smells really amazing and after wash my hair smell amazing too.&lt;br /&gt;My hair are more manageable. No frizzy hair any more.&lt;br /&gt;You would see the difference once you apply the shampoo on your hair. It leathers up pretty well. Cleans the scalp and hair from root to the tips. The hair are more smoother and softer once you apply in your hair and rinse it. I just want to keep touching my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the Vitamins Hair loss shampoo and I would highly recommend it for the people who have thin hair, falling or  hair loss problem.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend to use the conditioner if you have extremely dry hair like I do.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to get the vitamins hair loss shampoo as part of a promotion in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Very good. I like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been soooo dry!!! I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 20 days and my hair is sooooo dry!</li>
            <li> good hampoo , smells really really good. i like it because it is clear colour and clean really well without drying the hair.&lt;br /&gt;after using it i felt my hair really healthy .I am willing to re purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair feels thicker and looks thicker also.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> After using this product for 6 weeks I have to say that I am very unhappy with it.  Maybe its because it contains sulfate but my has not only been drier but seems to be coming out more.  I will now use a nonsulfate product such as those produced by Teva.</li>
            <li> I was happy to read all the positive reviews and then I got my bottle and an email saying I could get a free bottle by giving a review.  Unethical in my opinion.  Here is my review (months later).  This shampoo did nothing it claimed.  Just extremely overpriced shampoo.  I wonder if I&#x27;ll still get a free bottle?</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much improvement and seems like I was having more hair come out in the shower. Also made my scalp and neck break out. It&#x27;s way to expensive also.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. Definitely feel my hair has gotten stronger and the texture makes my fine hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few months and haven&#x27;t seen any hair growth nor has it stopped the my hair from thinning. It seems like the best method for hair loss are the &amp;#34;Big Three&amp;#34; unfortunately...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for the long term effects of this product yet (I&#x27;ll update my review later), but I&#x27;ve used this product for a few days now and my hair smells really good and does seem shinier than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo smells amazing and lathers better than most shampoos. My hair was neither oily or dry after using this product, which was nice.</li>
            <li> my wife used the NOURISH HAIR GROW VITAMINS and now i get this Shampoo for free again in exchange of a review..&lt;br /&gt;By taking a nourish hair grow vitamins and by applying a biotin hair loss shampoo at the same time, im sure that my wife will have a better out come, will have a beautiful and a healthy hair ,</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT! MOISTURIZING. ! SAW LESS BREAKAGE AFTER 1 - 2 APPLICATIONS.  SEEING SOME HAIR GROWTH AFTER 3 WEEKS.</li>
            <li> The shampoo makes my hair feel very soft and light weight. If it really makes my hair grow faster that&#x27;s another plus. The only thing I disliked was that the shampoo bottle does not come completely filled, it was about 8/10ths full and for a $50 bottle that&#x27;s about $10 missing. In that sense I felt kind of cheated, if the quantity that is in there is 10 oz then it should come in a 10 oz bottle. The extra space won&#x27;t make anyone happy.</li>
            <li> My hair is falling more than I would like.  With me, it is more age related so I did not expect much of the miracle.  But what I notice is that my hair being dry and limp using this shampoo improved texture.  I don&#x27;t have to use hair conditioner any more so hair stay clean looking longer. I don&#x27;t use instruction written on the container, to stop the hair falling.  Still what shampoo does is good enough.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for hard to grow hair.  It works!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it!  Hair has more body.  Need only a little.  Does a lot.  No conditioner needed.  I have high hopes for new hair growth.  Too early to tell about that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s benefits are hype&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s over priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nourish Beaute provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell, does leave my hair feeling very soft and manageable but did not stop me from loosing hair.  My hair still continues to fall out, this year has thinned out too much.</li>
            <li> I did not notice a difference in the amount of hair loss experienced.  I also feel that my hair was flatter and weighed down when I was using this product.  As soon as I switched to another shampoo, I noticed a huge difference in the body of my hair.  Maybe it works well for others, but I did experience see the advertised benefit of the product.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this shampoo. The owner of the company selling this product gave me instructions online for best results to acquired a healthy hair. I highly recommend to use this shampoo, my hair&#x27;s texture is soft and less tangle. I can see my hair has reduce falling off. My husband thinks the shampoo is expensive but I believe is worth it. I like quality no quantity.&lt;br /&gt;In a few months I will post an update and photos of my wild hair.</li>
            <li> until I purchased another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally spend a lot of money on shampoos even though my hair is not in great health.  Still, when I realized that I needed to invest in a better shampoo, after doing research, I came across this product.  I used the entire contents of the bottle and was pleased with the results; however, the cost of the shampoo made me hesitant to purchase again so I tried a lesser expensive brand.  The damage that brand did to my hair was shocking.  It left my hair in knots that I had to cut off because they wouldn&#x27;t comb out...even with a detangler.  Needless to say, I re-purchased this shampoo to try to correct the damage that had occurred and much to my surprise (and delight), it not only achieved that goal but exceeded it by restoring my hair (though shorter) to its state prior to the other shampoo.  I truly didn&#x27;t realize how well this shampoo worked but am glad I spent the extra money to purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fact that some of the proceeds goes to St. Jude Children&#x27;s Hospital is a plus and makes it all worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Hair now much shinier and soft...makes ageing hair look young again! So happy to find this product after trying so many that seem to strip my hair and make the gray kinky....this product relaxes hair and still gives body. No strong smell and only a little is needed each shampoo. Using for a week...will report back on hair growth...maybe brows and lashes will grow back too!</li>
            <li> **FALSE ADVERTISING** This absolutely doesn&#x27;t work! I have bought two bottles of this CRAP and I still look like a giant penis!</li>
            <li> I am a guy and my hair is receding and thinning in the usual places.  I was looking for something that would stop the thinning and actually help my hair grow back and this caught my eye because of the patented ingredients and studies. I went online and found the studies and it seemed legit so I went for it.  So far it has been 4 weeks and it is definitely working.  I see new hair growing in my hair line and my wife tells me the spot in the back is growing back too.  We both like the smell and it lathers good so it lasts a long time.  If you’re thinking about getting this do it, it works.  One other thing, I almost didn’t get this because of the one star reviews but after reading them I noticed that they looked kind of bogus. After looking closer I noticed none of them had actually bought the product.  I’m glad I listened to my instincts because this stuff works and the way I see it is I can spend a little money or I can lose my hair - and chances are once it&#x27;s gone, it&#x27;s not coming back.</li>
            <li> Just received Vitamins Shampoo and I have to say I give it a Five Star Rating.  I wanted to use it at least a few times but right away I saw a difference.  Due to a Thyroid condition my hair was going down the drain every shower and on my bathroom floor every time I blew out my hair.  This product is wonderful because there is a significant difference and my thick voluminous hair is now coming back to me.  Bravo so glad I discovered this product.</li>
            <li> Vitamiins Noursh Beate Hair growth shampoo Really works. Follow the diretions and only use a little bit for a rich lather. If you do not have hiar loss and looking for a fabolous shampoo I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Too soon to know if hair re growth is truly stimulated. My fine hair can&#x27;t take daily shampooing, so the effects may not be so immediate. I wash my hair only every three days. Also, the free vitamins offer was no longer available even though I had bought the shampoo, so I can&#x27;t offer any comments on that. I realize it was a limited time offer but I believed it was for the time frame in which a customer bought the shampoo. Otherwise, the vitamins cost $47.00+. I haven&#x27;t bought them.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say this is amazing shampoo and it had made my hair thick, beautiful, shiny, and reduced my split ends...but, it hasn&#x27;t.  However, it does smell wonderful, it works into a great lather, and I do think my hair has been encouraged to volumize with this new shampoo. I don&#x27;t adore it, but I like it. I will continue to use the entire bottle and see if I can provide any improved or furthered results, but after a week and a half of continuous use, I feel like I have a decent grasp on the results, though I can&#x27;t obviously attest to an increase in length or growth just yet.</li>
            <li> It smells really really nice; however, I feel like the price should be a little bit lower. I would continue to use this because it&#x27;s pretty effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo along with the Nourish vitamin supplements for about 2 weeks. I mainly got it to help with the excessive hair shedding since giving birth 15 months ago. My hair was thinning out so much and I was seeing huge clumps of hair every time I brushed or washed my hair. I was honestly getting nervous. It&#x27;s too soon for any hair growth, but I have already noticed a significant decrease in hair loss. My hair seems stronger already. The shampoo smells great and has done an amazing job of making my hair softer and healthier. I very much appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t contain hormones and is made in a USA FDA approved lab. Anything you put on your body that is made to absorb needs to be just as safe as anything you ingest. I feel more comfortable using this hair growth shampoo over the other options out there.  Disclosure: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated in any way, nor promised any future promotions. I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review. All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference soon after starting to use it. My hair feels fuller, soft &amp; smell sooo good.  I am so pleased &amp; loving my look fuller hair. If you have thinning hair, this is your solution. Highly recommend it. Also fassst shipping, thumb up.</li>
            <li> First things first:  My order arrived very promptly and the shampoo is packaged in an attractive bottle.  Now to the more important things:  the shampoo is light and smells good.  It also makes my hair look very good, evidenced by all the compliments I&#x27;m getting on how great my hair looks, compliments from both friends and strangers too.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love how my hair has gotten stronger, feels better and looks better</li>
            <li> Very good feeling shampoo, I can tell a good shampoo and this feels good, the reason for 4 stars is I have not used it long enough to know if it will really work.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been 3 weeks i am using this product (shampoo and vitamins) and i am really seeing the difference little by little.</li>
            <li> Have only used it for about 1 month. Nice shampoo, leaves my hair with a nice feel. Very healthy looking. and shiny when I style.</li>
            <li> This a really wonderful shampoo.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and definitely see lots of new hair growth.  Yea!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the way this shampoo smells. I see less thinning of my hair. My hair is not falling as much. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit early to tell but I do believe it is working.  It has a wonderful smell too!  It has greatly  improved my scalp.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo! My hair hadn&#x27;t been this healthy in years.  I bought it for my husband but used it myself and we are now fighting over its use.  I&#x27;m not sure my hair has grown but it certainly looks fuller.</li>
            <li> Ahhh I love this product. I have been using it for about 3 months now. My hair was very damaged from bleaching it and doing the ombr&amp;eacute; and then back to dark etc... I needed something to support fuller healthier hair! I read rave reviews online so I was excited to try this product, though it is a little expensive! I found it to be totally worth the money... It smells amazing and goes on the hair easy. I would definitely recommend it! Rinsing it out with cold(ish) water helps too!</li>
            <li> I have alopecia, and it has helped my hair grow longer, and feel stronger than before.</li>
            <li> I returned the product. Looking more closely at the reviews, I saw that the 5 and 4 stars looked fake.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo but certainly didn&#x27;t help any.</li>
            <li> Shampoo does make hair fuller but also feels drier</li>
            <li> Disappointingly overrated.  Not much much better than regular shampoo but 10 times more expensive.  I have not noticed any positive change in my hairs.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo that will help me to grow my hair faster and make it healthier. My research lead me to this product and it sounded reputable. I got my shampoo yesterday and I tried today morning for the first time. Hair feels wonderful. Soft, shiny, moisturized. It feels like both shampoo and conditioner at the same time I did not use any conditioner. It is better than Wen. Will see how it will effect hair growth but it is a wonderful revitalizing shampoo. No smell, no collor, 10/10 for the first wash.</li>
            <li> I Love this shampoo!! I am still on my first bottle of using  this product  and I am finding  less hair loss and more shine! I look forward to more  volume and thickness as my hair and scalp get used to the vitamins and ingredients in this product!. I have no doubt with the effect I have seen so far that my hair will continue grow and I will have less hair loss permanently!  It smells great and has wonderful lather.. I have made the switch to Vitamins and will continue to use it!  Very Happy with the results!!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo  used first time today.  Mske hair soft and silky w no frizz.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell, update after more use.</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning and depressed me. Everytime I looked in the mirror, all I saw was scalp.  I recently finished my 1st bottle of shampoo and ordered my 2nd.  While on line tonight to check the shipment I saw Buy 2 and get 40% off the 3rd bottle. I ordered them immediately.  This shampoo is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried for hair loss.  I&#x27;m even getting compliments on my hair now.  I always thought these reviews were  written by the sellers, but I promise, I&#x27;m a consumer only.  Try this product if you suffer from thinning hair.  You&#x27;ll be happy you did.  I just wish this company made a conditioner too.</li>
            <li> I got this product because my husband likes long hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t grow very well. It doesn&#x27;t look like it helps my hair to grow faster. I noticed that I don&#x27;t lose as many hair as I did before though but it might be because I am on a healthy diet right now.&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;-I like the smell;&lt;br /&gt;-Good ingredients;&lt;br /&gt;-Hair is stronger;&lt;br /&gt;-Less hair loss;&lt;br /&gt;-Hair shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;-Hair is dry, so I have to wash them every day to make me feel like I have clean hair;&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t help my hair to grow faster;&lt;br /&gt;-You have to find a very good conditioner to make hair soft;&lt;br /&gt;-Expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I tried it but I won&#x27;t buy it any more</li>
            <li> I seriously love this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for about a month and I can really tell a difference. I started using it because at 56, my hair was just blah. I went on a mission to find something that would help. After trying multiple products, I came across this. My hair feels thicker and has more body but my favorite benefit is the shine. I went ahead and ordered a second bottle. After telling my sister about it, she ordered her a bottle too and has been very pleased. If you try this, just remember that the longer you use it then the more it helps.</li>
            <li> Made my hair frizzy, greasy and unmanagable. I was excited to try it after reading all the reviews. When I got it, I didn&#x27;t care for the smell or texture either.</li>
            <li> There was a point in my life where I started to suffer because I noticed I was losing my hair. I started to try different items and none of them worked as Vitamins shampoo.  After a week I noticed a decrease on my hair loss, I don’t have dandruff that other shampoos caused. I have used this shampoo for four months and my hair looks fuller and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damian F</li>
            <li> I have been using this vitamin growth shampoo for about a month now.  The smell is great and it works!!  I am so happy with the product . The first thing I noticed was that my hair was softer and shiner. After a couple uses I noticed that I was cleaning less hair from the drain of my tub. i have been seeing baby hair growing across the hair line within few weeks of trying the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I waited before writing a review as I wanted to see if it actually worked and I have to say I feel this shampoo has been a HUGE help for me. I started taking medicine which unfortunately could thin your hair and it has for me. My hair is fairly long and naturally wavy. It started to thin very noticeably around my temples and the front top. I would shower and I could feel clumps run down my leg, it was scary.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this and within two weeks my shower was no longer clogging, the clumps were no longer running down my leg and by the end of the month my temples were no longer looking so bare and the top was looking a little fuller. My hairbrush is not filling up with hair like it once was, I&#x27;m not shedding all over the place and my hair has become more manageable. I can honestly say this stuff definitely works, it has really made a difference for me and I&#x27;m going to continue to use with confidence I will see even better results. I asked for 1 bottled as a gift and received a total of 4, I&#x27;m soooooo glad that I did as I am positive all 4 will be used.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo smells GREAT, it&#x27;s not overwhelming but will stay with you all day. It&#x27;s smells very fresh and clean, it&#x27;s not flowery or fruity no heavy perfume scent just a clean refreshing scent. I thought it lathered nicely, quarter size I massage mainly focusing on the scalp, condition with my normal conditioner ( Dove ) . I will definitely purchase again when need as I already see great result and it has only been a month.</li>
            <li> Have not had it long enough to see results but my hair has a better shine to it and shampoo smells great.</li>
            <li> I just received this so I cannot attest to the results but it is a very sleek bottle and the smell of the product is nice. I have used it once and after washing my hair the texture was nice and soft so that is a bonus. Was almost wondering if I needed conditioner after because of how soft my hair felt. I did apply my coconut conditioner anyway. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results.</li>
            <li> This product was offered to me to test try its quality, and together with the vitamins works great.  In a few weeks I noticed a difference and hairs stopped falling.  Now I buy it regularly, and I my hair looks much better than 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo I will definitely be purchasing this again.  It smells great and my hair is not only growing quicker but softer and much healthier then it was before.  I have tried a lot of hair care products and this is by far my favorite.  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for healthier, licker, longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer L</li>
            <li> makes my hair seem fuller and is not harsh!</li>
            <li> Very happy with product. A++</li>
            <li> Personally, I haven&#x27;t seen the results I had hoped for based on the reviews I read before purchasing this product.  Once negative aspect I&#x27;ve noticed is that my hair seems to feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and gets oily on my neck between shampoos.  (I shampoo every other day.)  Rather expensive for an 8 oz. bottle that hasn&#x27;t been what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> It really seems to make my hair feel fuller. I usually have to use conditioner everyday but I just put a little leave in conditioner and I am fine. I will say that I do think my hair is growing faster. I&#x27;ve always taken biotin to help with my hair skin and nails. Every few days I use a different shampoo and conditioner. On those days my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as full. I will definitely be reordering. The smell and the rich later if this shampoo with the other amazing benefits are well worth it!</li>
            <li> This item is basically a $40 bottle of regular shampoo. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a full head of hair but, I have seen no change after 1 month of daily use. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I LOVE this shampoo! I have a thyroid issue I have been dealing with and unfortunately with that my hair has thinned and fallen out. I have tried everything I could think of to grow out my hair and bring back thickness, from thickening products, using high end expensive products to drug store products and NOTHING was working NOTHING! Then I stumbled across Vitamins Hair loss shampoo, and honestly I have to say I was skeptical, because I have tried everything under the sun! Did I mention I even bought a vibrating brush that guaranteed hair growth...??It didn&#x27;t work and broke after a few weeks... So I ordered this shampoo because of the reviews. Let me tell you when it came in the mail i washed my hair right away and after the first wash, my hair felt different in a good way. Softer, more manageable and thicker! It had a bounce and the frizzy, limp sad hair I have had finally felt like life was put back into it...after each wash, more life! I have been using it for a couple of months now daily and I can see little hairs pushing their way out and GROWING! And the manageability and softness and shine continues with each wash. There have been times when I have been out of town and had to use other shampoo and conditioner and that&#x27;s when I could really tell how much VHLS really works. I recommend this product to anyone experiencing hair loss or if you have thin dull hair. IT WORKS! Thank you so much for this product and giving me hope again that my hair can be beautiful again! I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. It&#x27;s my shampoo for life! Oh also, I love that you don&#x27;t need a conditioner with it either and it&#x27;s all natural, no harsh chemicals like other hair growth shampoos. THANK YOU AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I have long hair, very fine. I brushed through my hair before shampooing. This product caused extreme snarls, lost more hair by using this. I&#x27;m returning this shampoo, $40 is just too much to throw in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this shampoo.  It really leaves my hair feeling soft.  I did not have to use as much conditioner as I usually do.  I am sure time will tell how it does on helping any hair loss, I have a thyroid issue and even though I do not have an issue with baldness, my hair does thin out.  I do not know how you could go wrong though with all the vitamins that are in this shampoo.  Well worth it so far.  I will write an update review of the results I get for hair loss after I use it for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Love it it does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I was interested in purchasing one of these products but all the reviews seem made up and fake...&lt;br /&gt;I think I will look for another brand.</li>
            <li> Wow! I am so in love with this shampoo! I read a review that said you don&#x27;t have to use conditioner after using this product and i didn&#x27;t believe that at all. I have long black damaged dyed hair. When i used the shampoo for the first time i didn&#x27;t use conditioner after and sure enough my hair was silky smooth. I have had so many comments about my hair, just after 3 uses. I also wear my hair up in a tight bun for work and don&#x27;t wash my hair every day and after the second day of no wash my hair still looked and felt just as clean. Seriously this stuff is amazing! I can&#x27;t say of any growth because i have only used it for aweek but so far it has my highest praise!</li>
            <li> So after much research on Amazon I decided to buy Nourish Vitamins hair growth support SHAMPOO......its been 3 and a half weeks that I am using this shampoo and I thought I would write my review today.  My hair has been excessively falling for the past 1 year so I started my pursuit of addressing the issue of my hair loss and tried everything that anybody suggested....this is the ninth product/treatment that I started so you can well imagine how much research I must have done!  Needless to say when everything else failed, with no optimism left, I started to use this shampoo and I was washing my hair with it every other day and to my utter astonishment I started to see less hair fall...so I also decided to start the Nourish hair growth support VITAMINS, as I wanted to treat my hair loss problem inside and out.&lt;br /&gt;Well about 3 + weeks after I can surely say that I am seeing less and less hair fall, which is a big deal for me, as anyone who is loosing hair knows how much it hurts to see your hair on the comb and on the pillow case!!  So this morning when I was combing my hair I only saw about 4-5 strands come out and that for me is a huge difference from before.  I am very happy and relieved to find a product that is finally working out for me!  These products have given me hope that I also can transform my falling, fine hair to healthy, strong hair!&lt;br /&gt;I am also going to write another review in a month to tell you guys how my hair are doing and if I have seen any new growth as it is still early to comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this combination of Nourish Shampoo and Vitamins to anyone who is loosing hair.....&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Nourish!!</li>
            <li> I am different then the other reviews, I searched for something like this and payed full price.. But its great! I had a cow lick that had become about a 5 inch circle of fading hair... It was terrible! However, I started using this the day I got it and oh my! First off my hair was thinning too because of all my red dye I was doing and it&#x27;s so much thicker now! Slowly but surely it&#x27;s getting back to normal, and my bald cow lick is getting smaller as well! I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about 2 inches now, but hair is growing in those two inches! Keep in mind that my hair goes all the way to my butt and I still have half a bottle with only a months use! I also got the vitamins hoping that they were ones I could just crack open and throw in a smoothie... But they aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I really love how this makes my hair feel. I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times, so I&#x27;m not seeing anything as far as hair thickness yet. But I am hopeful! Nice smell to this shampoo as well. Not chemical smelling like some other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried for thin hair or hair growth. Again, love the way it feels. My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft and smooth in a long time. Would have given 5 stars, but haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in thickness yet. I will update this post after I&#x27;ve used the product for a while.</li>
            <li> Expensive piece of nonsense!</li>
            <li> Nourish Beaute has created an awesome shampoo. VITAMINS Hair Loss Shampoo is specially designed to promote hair growth and help prevent thinning and hair loss as well. It&#x27;s not heavily scented or medicinal smelling either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a shampoo lover by any means. I&#x27;ve often used the no poo method and prefer it. However, I figured I&#x27;d give this a go since my hair falls out a lot due to my thyroid condition. I also have a rare form of alopecia which causes total pigment loss and baldness in one spot of my head- right in front!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so thrilled that VITAMINS shampoo helped regrow some of the recent loss. Of course dealing with unruly new growth isn&#x27;t really fun, it was nice to see that it does help with growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is waist length and pretty thick, but not incredibly so with the more recent hair loss. I found the volume to be quite dramatically effected, I still have to use conditioner to brush through though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I rinsed forever thinking it wasn&#x27;t all out! It felt like a thin coat of wax almost. But, that&#x27;s just how it is. My hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy, wax covered or as if I&#x27;ve used too much product, so no worries there, just an observation during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to have participated in reviewing this shampoo. Hair loss and thinning isn&#x27;t anything I look forward to, or even thought I&#x27;d have to consider! I&#x27;m happy to have found a product which will help keep the hair I have growing strong and where it belongs- on my head!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Hair is thicker and noticeably thicker after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Brought this shampoo hoping for new hair growth.  Have used daily for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;i like the shampoo...seems to promote&lt;br /&gt;Healthy hydrated hair.  Do not have to use conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;As for hair regrowth, not seeing it yet.  Will use a little longer and see.  If no new hair regrowth will&lt;br /&gt;discontinue because of price...very expensive</li>
            <li> Does exactly as indicated,  very happy.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product yet but just want to give a 5 star for customer service to NOURISH Beauté. They care about their customers and take pride of their product. Can&#x27;t wait to use it! Thanks NOURISH Beauté!</li>
            <li> So far I cannot tell amy difference,.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product weighed my hair down and it was limp and unmanageable.  I really wanted it to work and perhaps in the long run it would have been beneficial but simply did not wash out clean.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by this family owned company from the outset because of their very fast shipping. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a couple weeks now, and love it. My hair is clean, and vey manageable.” Give it a try, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Me and my son are using the product, but only time will tell with new products.&lt;br /&gt;Some growth in my own hair plus it feels wonderful after its washed. They suggest wash once a week. But we do every two weeks.</li>
            <li> Ever since I had chemo, my hair has grown back oddly and I got this shampoo to help with getting my hair back to normal. I also bought the vitamins to assist the shampoo and we shall see- so far so good!</li>
            <li> This is terrible. Did nothing for my hair. Very dissatisfied</li>
            <li> The product smells nice, and does a great job cleansing the scalp. It lathers well, and gives my hair a little bit more shine and fullness, as well as making it very soft. I give it four stars because I haven&#x27;t seen any results in actual hair growth, but I have only been using the product for a couple weeks now.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with Vitamins Shampoo. With the first shampooing I noticed my hair had a beautiful sheen and a lot of volume.  Normally it is difficult to tame my fine wavy hair but with Vitamins Shampoo my hair was smooth and easy to manage. It also held the style better.  I&#x27;ve used Vitamins Shampoo for a couple of shampoos and I expect my hair will continue to improve.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:74dc124e179399aef95e12a02d3334d1]] I have never done a review for a product before but I really love this shampoo.  I was given a bottle to review because i have a thyroid condition (a LOT of hair loss) on top of being a woman of a certain age and my hair had really begun thinning out.  It was also kind of straw like and wouldnt grow past a certain point. I am now near the end of the bottle and since using this shampoo my hair has totally changed for the better.  It seriously hasnt looked this good in years. It has stopped falling out and I have new growth coming in all over.  It is also shiny and healthy and for the first time in my life it actually has bounce.  My hair is around shoulder length and the bottle has lasted me around 2 months. I like that is has natural ingredients. I will be ordering more and I got an email from the company saying they are coming out with a volumizing conditioner to go with it so I will definitely use that too.</li>
            <li> Spent over 45 Dollars for this shampoo and so far I have not received any positive results. I doubt if all the reviews posted here are authentic.</li>
            <li> This item was received timely.  This is worth the money.  My hair is extremely soft and it makes my hair smells nice and clean.  I will be ordering another bottle or two.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and seems working, but feels greasy, so from time to time I need to wash hair again with different shampoo.  I am using it already for a month, and I think it may help.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and it made my hair grow but it is still very thin.  It is just longer.</li>
            <li> I Love it please read my review on the vitamins. I have been using the shampoo and vitamins for 1 week since 12/12/2014 and I can honestly say my hair feels thicker, healthier and well nourished.  The quality of my hair has changed in seven days. I  only use chemical free products. so I didn&#x27;t expect to see such a huge difference in my hair. I&#x27;m was fully and very happy after one use.  I have textured beautiful 3b 4c curly hair. I believe the all-natural ingredients: with  their cell renewing and antioxidant qualities, nourish the blood and stimulate the scalp. My results after one use is fuller, thicker healthier hair. I&#x27;m confident I will reach my hair goals using NOURISH BEAUTE Shampoo and Vitamins.  I will update my hair growth and progress in 90 days.  I have washed my hair 4 times. I will use the shampoo 4 times per week. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. Also it is PH Balanced. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for almost 2 months.  I like to take ample time to try a product before I give a review.  It&#x27;s only fair to the product and to those reading the reviews.  I love the shampoo.  It smells fantastic.  My hair has thinned considerably since I&#x27;ve done keratin to my hair.  Since using this shampoo, my hair has tremendously improved and is thicker.  My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much as it used to.  Here&#x27;s a picture of my hair, it looks fabulous!</li>
            <li> Initially the price for the shampoo was intimidating but much less expensive than a trip to the hairdresser or a keratin treatment.  Not only did it make my hair thicker it also left it shinier and with the bounce I remember from my youth.  Definitely worth the money and will purchase again.  Carol O</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this product along with the Nourish Vitamins before leaving a review. I have always had a problem with finding lots of hair around my home especially in my bathroom. My hair has also never grown fast which I always hated. Two week results are in and my hair has already grown half an inch and the hair loss has decreased tremendously! I was a little worried about using the shampoo since I have course hair.  A lot of shampoos leave my hair feeling dried out. This shampoo does not do that at all. I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner since it leaves my hair feeling silky. Will definitely continue to use these products!</li>
            <li> Love how it made my hair feel after one wash. Can&#x27;t wait for new growth</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked very well for me. My fair was fuller and healthier after using the product only a few times. I also noticed less breakage.</li>
            <li> Great product! my hair started to get thin and fall out. I was freaking out! I did some research and found out that my thyroid could be causing this. And it was. So in the meantime while my doctor and I were trying to get my thyroid straightened out, I decided to try the shampoo. It has worked great just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me a while to evaluate this shampoo for a few reasons. First, I have curly hair, so I don&#x27;t wash it every day. Second, I haven&#x27;t used shampoo for years, as I&#x27;ve found it too drying. I usually only use conditioner, so I had to reintroduce shampoo into my daily regimen. Finally, I wanted to use it for a long enough period of time that I could accurately assess any changes.  Let me first say that I have slightly more knowledge about hair loss than the average person. I&#x27;m a writer, and a year ago I wrote a brochure for a hair transplant doctor that explained the process by which we lose our hair and the various things we can do about it. In short, hair loss is a function of two things: the natural shedding of hair that each person goes through daily and the degree to which new hair grows to take its place. We can shed more hair than usual because of age, stress, diet, or hormones. And new hairs grow naturally. When hair loss is happening more rapidly than replacement, we start to see thinning. To combat this, we want to lessen the amount of shedding, or stimulate the regrowth, or both.  After two-thirds of a bottle of this shampoo (used every other or every third day over 3 months), I definitely see a difference in my hair. I&#x27;m not sure if it would take this long if you used the shampoo daily, but I simply cannot wash my hair that often. When I used to get my hair cut, my stylist used to sprinkle this dark brown stuff onto my scalp so my part didn&#x27;t seem so wide and gaping. I was very self conscious of how much my hair had been thinning and was afraid it was going to get worse. My hair now looks like it did a decade ago, with little visible thinning at the top or the crown.  I had been taking Biotin before starting the shampoo (4000 mcg/day) and that didn&#x27;t do anything alone. I&#x27;d taken it for a year and saw no improvement. I was going to stop the Biotin, in fact, but when I read about the vitamin supplement that is recommended with the shampoo (and the inclusion of Biotin) I decided to keep taking it, mostly to see whether in combination, they would have any effect.  My &amp;#34;scientific&amp;#34; self study was not very scientific, but I&#x27;ll share with you what I did notice. Early on, when I would condition my hair, I would end up with A LOT of hair in my hands after running the conditioner out. As a curly girl, I don&#x27;t use a brush, so most of my &amp;#34;hair loss&amp;#34; is visible in the shower -- the way some people would notice the build up in their hair brush. It took many weeks of use, but slowly I started to notice less hair ending up in my hands after conditioning. And recently I&#x27;ve noticed MUCH LESS. I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb and say that a conservative estimate is that I&#x27;m now shedding less than 25 percent of what I was shedding three months ago.  I&#x27;m not sure how to explain this, because my assumption, in fact, was that my hair would GROW MORE, not that I would SHED LESS. I was under the impression that the active ingredients in the shampoo (coupled with the Biotin) would do more to stimulate growth rather than stave off loss. And maybe they have. But the only thing I can objectively point to is the amount of hair in my hands when I shower -- and that is far, far less. The time of year is more conducive to shedding (end of winter) and my diet is absolutely unchanged so I can only attribute the lessening of shedding (and health of my hair) to this shampoo.  Years ago, I swore I would never use shampoo again. I found it drying and damaging to my hair. My stylist used to remark how healthy my hair looked as a result of no shampoo and no blow drying. I was given a bottle of Vitamins Hair Loss Shampoo to try and it was a big leap for me to even use shampoo at all. The shampoo does not dry it out at all and it looks (and behaves) exactly as it did without shampoo...only it&#x27;s more lush and full.  Yay!  For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m 54 and color my hair (single process) about four times per year. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s helpful inyour decision making, but I thought I would just put it out there.  Good luck. I&#x27;m buying another bottle!</li>
            <li> I have definately seen improvements in my hair growth. I would reccoment using with Hair Vitamins.</li>
            <li> There is always a search for the next great shampoo that helps with weak or receding hair problems.  I am thankful that in my mid 40&#x27;s I still have a head of hair but it is thinning a little in areas, so I am looking for both strengthening and prevention. I have had this for about two weeks and use it almost every day.  Here are some observations: it is a clear shampoo and comes in a simple bottle so the money goes into the product and not into fancy marketing.  The shampoo has a nice lather and does not leave residue in my scalp.  I have noticed stronger hair that does grow faster and there less hair near the drain, there is no doubt about that.  The scent is strong but not obnoxious.  They only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is the price.  It is just a 10 ounce bottle and the price is a bit steep.  I might re-visit and change to five stars if the shampoo continues to perform as it has.</li>
            <li> This shampoo I&#x27;ve used doesn&#x27;t work as described , I&#x27;ve been using it since I bought it everyday has a great smell but it&#x27;s like all the any other shampoo that&#x27;s  out there great smell but doesn&#x27;t make my hair grow or glow I&#x27;m going to finish this product but I&#x27;m very certain its not working at all for me and will be asking a full refund on it .</li>
            <li> Works great smells fantastic hair feels wonderful. Much better shampoo than I was expecting for price.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:cd20d05b4bb2db6cbe4506a225ef2f78]] I was sent this product to review and I love it! This shampoo is gentle on my scalp, which is really sensitive due to the fact that I have seborrheic dermatitis. My hair grew within the first month of using it also which is amazing. It also helped defrizz my hair. I highly recommend this shampoo for anyone trying to grow out their hair!!</li>
            <li> Not a review writer, but will say I like the shampoo and will be happy to try the promotional vitamins as well.  My hair is noticeably more manageable, and perhaps a little thicker.  Longer?  hard to tell, but I have not even been using the product for a month.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shampoo!  After using this shampoo for just a few weeks, my hair feels fuller and healthier.  I am over 50 and have very fine hair and am concerned about losing my hair.  I am really glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Already noticing little hairs!!!! Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> HAS A NICE LIGHT SMELL AND BECAUSE I JUST GOT THIS PRODUCT I CAN NOT GIVE A REVIEW ON HOW AFFECT IT IS YET.</li>
            <li> Hello, I would like to share with everyone my experience from using the vitamins hair loss shampoo. It&#x27;s a very good product, I was losing a lot of hair because of the chemicals that I put into my hair, but with the vitamins shampoo, I stopped losing hair really! I&#x27;m so exited about this product also the shine came back , I just feel My hair getting healthy as it was before.&lt;br /&gt;So as I mentioned before I use a lot of chemicals and that&#x27;s what caused having some empty spaces in the front, therefore I&#x27;m gonna continue buying it till I see the full results. It doesn&#x27;t matter how expensive it is , what matter to me is the result. I feel that I&#x27;ve already passed the hard part which is find a product that I can trust.</li>
            <li> I am surrounded by the pretty fragrance of VITAMINS shampoo, as I type this review. My hair feels exceptionally clean and wonderfully refreshed. The main ingredients include coconut oil, castor oil, Biotin, and Procapil (which I googled to learn more about). You can learn all you want here, however Procapil is going to amaze and impress you. Combined with the other ingredients, you will love this wonderful shampoo! Nourish Beaute has create a mindful and fine beauty and health product in VITAMINS Hair Loss Shampoo. It is one of a kind. I feel as if I am being treated at a spa and that my hair is being gently coaxed to its best condition.&lt;br /&gt;The phenomenon of not losing my hair is amazing. It is great.&lt;br /&gt;You really have to try this. There is nothing like it!&lt;br /&gt;I truly think that this is a remarkable shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;If you have hair problems (and who doesn&#x27;t), don&#x27;t just put a bandaid on whatever is going on. Instead, try VITAMINS! You will be happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this super product in order to review it from the company--thank you! Jean</li>
            <li> This shampoo is like food for my hair! I notice my hair is not falling out as much and I feel that it is much thicker and fuller when I style my hair. I definitely  notice new hair growth on the crown of my head. I highly recommend this product for those who are experiencing  hair loss.</li>
            <li> It did a good job cleaning scalp and hair;I only wish you made a healthier formula without the sodium laurel sulphates,phtlates and other chemical additives.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it. I started seeing a difference in about a week. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> this is worth nevery penny,it works.I bought it in November and after about two weeks much less hair in the drain,love it!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It arrived on time and I used it right away. I didn&#x27;t notice much growth but my hair looks and feels thicker and less falls out! It smells amazing and thus shampoo leaves your hair shiny and managable. Definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I have purchased products from Amazon--from cereal to vacuum cleaner bags to shoes--for many years. I think this is the first time I&#x27;ve written a product review. I have hair loss due to a thyroid problem and heredity, and am trying everything--vitamins, minoxidil, shampoos, you name it. So far, this is the first thing that has lived up to its promise. To be fair, I have used it only one week--so, clearly, I have no new hair growth already. BUT, my hair feels and looks so much thicker, and I didn&#x27;t expect this. I expected another disappointment. I have no idea what the long-term effects will be (new hair growth, I hope?), but the short-term impact is terrific. I am completely surprised and pleased. I now plan to try their supplements.</li>
            <li> A GREAT shampoo!  I had been using it for 2 weeks.  Went to my hairdresser for a trim....my hair is quite long.....he looked at my hair and told me...&amp;#34;this is it!  Whatever new shampoo you are using, stay with it!&amp;#34;  My hair is in good shape....I just love trying new and natural shampoos. And this product is wonderful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anne/atlanta</li>
            <li> OMG I absolutely love your shampoo! You can tell a big difference even just after one use. First off I love the smell of it has a great scent and I love that it lingers in my hair even my boyfriend had to ask what I changed and that he loves the smell of my hair. When you put it on it lathers up nicely and you can start to feel a difference. My hair feels fuller and healthier it looks a lot better and It feels like it was cleaner than what it was getting with other shampoos it was safe and not harsh on my hair even with me dying it. After I washed my hair with this and went to comb it I noticed I didn&#x27;t even have to use my detangle because I didn&#x27;t have all the snags and knots that I normally get with my hair when it is wet. I also noticed that I didn&#x27;t have a lot of hair that was brushed out and that I lost like usual. I received this product to review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m approaching 50 and have notice my hair mainly in the crown area thinning and falling out rapidly.  I&#x27;ve used the vitamin shampoo for a month now.  I have new regrowth in the crown area and my hair has grown substantially within the pass 30 days.  I use the shampoo every 2-3 days.  It smells wonderful and the bottle has a generous amount.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, so far. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but have noticed some decrease on the amount of hair lost. I&#x27;m hoping on better results as I continue using it. And this shampoo DOES smell really good. </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a rough couple of years and stress took its toll on my skin and hair. I&#x27;ve got my husband using this and we both love the way it makes our hair smell and feel and the body it gives is amazing. Yes the price is expensive but I truly believe you get what you pay for and I will keep using. It lathers with very little product so I know it will last. Thank you Amazon !!</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Low hair fall</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It actually works for thinning hair and hair loss. And the smell is fantastic. My husband loves it. It must be the combination of the shampoo and the vitamins together. Whatever it is I&#x27;m happy to find something that works.</li>
            <li> Thought I had already reviewed this shampoo but maybe not. I use it three times a week and just love it. It smells good and I have noticed a change in hair loss</li>
            <li> THIS SHAMPOO IS AMAZING!!! I LOVE the fragrance and gentle cleansing it offers! I will be ordering more!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for 2 weeks and I see results already, much less hair loss and the texture of my hair is so soft and full of body! I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in 2months!</li>
            <li> I really like how this shampoo leaves my hair.  I have seen some growth so it must be working.  I definitely recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Regretted I purchased this. It made my thinning hair worse. I use MiN&#x27;s &amp;#34;Detox&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Wash&amp;#34; for YEARS. That one works. Absolutely works. This? Garbage. Regretted my purchase alltogether. Going back to MiN&#x27;s hair products.</li>
            <li> Not a bad quality product but I did not like many of the unnecessary chemical ingredients such as sulfates damaging and drying to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Contacted them for refund based on their 100% Money Back guarantee, and thus far they have ignored my request.</li>
            <li> Tried this shampoo for a few weeks but had to discontinue use because of my seborrheic dermatitis.I can&#x27;t use shampoos with oils in them.Had to go back to head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo after a medical procedure resulted in my getting my hair clipped from the sides of my head with an electric clipper like the ones that horse people use to clip horses ears and noses. The fact that it was wielded by a neurosurgeon, guided by ultrasound was completely reassuring medically but hair considerations, not so much. The result was huge vertical scars necessary for diagnosis of a life threatening illness. My Hair , thin and fine under regular circumstances was worn shoulder length blunt cut. It is pure white. I had to wear scarves for a while and only a week ago got all the superglue out of my hair. I was told to just wash it normally and let the glue come out on its own. Well sure, it covered my stitches in a major artery!  This is the shampoo I used. My hair was so soft and shiny, just what I wanted and there was no irritation over the raw incisions. Best of all there is hair growth, faster than I would have believed. My bangs have grown out to a ear length so they cover the incisions when I push them back. I got a trim at the beauty shop yesterday and they commented on how well my hair was growing out over the incisions and that i could still have bangs and the grown out side bangs still hide the shaved area which is 3/4 of an inch and more. My surgery was May 1 and today is June 13 so I have no complaints. To have a product gentle enough to heal a significant incision and still get growth amazed me and I have treated a lot of animals with significant wounds that could result in hair loss. I know that the product must not be anything but gentle. This product is!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this shampoo!  To me, it smells mildly of cedar!  I only notice the cedar scent while I&#x27;m shampooing my hair, but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger in my hair after I&#x27;ve rinsed it.  When I first started using this shampoo, I had a lot of appointments to go to, so I was washing my hair every other day.  Within a week, I noticed a 75% reduction in the amount of hair I found in the tub drain strainer after shampooing my hair in the shower.  There was also less hair in my hair brush, and I stopped finding individual strands of hair that had fallen out of my head in between shampoos (my hair is more than 2 feet long, so it&#x27;s easy to notice individual strands when they&#x27;re not attached to my head).  I have no doubt that this shampoo works well for my hair loss!  However, when I stopped having a lot of appointments and started washing my hair every 3-4 days, my hair loss returned to what it was before I started using this shampoo.  So...to get the best results from this shampoo, I recommend washing your hair every day or at least every other day.</li>
            <li> To early to tell if it will help hair growth but my hair has not bee health and LOVE the smell of my hair all day! Only down side a little pricey but hey you get what you pay for....</li>
            <li> Vitamins Hair Growth Shampoo does support existing hair regrowth when supplemented with a diet and daily regimen designed for hair regrowth. Hair quality and texture is improved. The shampoo lathers well and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> this product was purchased for my daughter, who is 12 and has had short hair her whole life.  her hair is healthy but does not grow past jaw length.  we&#x27;ve tried biotin supplements, hair trims (it does not stimulate growth, as my mom believes!) and now our  journey continues with this shampoo.  so far she likes the product, its light fragrance and good lather.  we have not noticed a difference in hair length or texture yet, but it&#x27;s too soon to tell, so we will post again after a couple more months of use.  the owner of the company has been very helpful in email communication about the product.</li>
            <li> Good smelling leaves my hair soft and its growing!!!</li>
            <li> Very expensive shampoo.  He hoped it was a different shampoo. The bottle, the ingredient except (Procapil and lable) , textute, smells is the same Rozgue Cosmeseutical  grow fast shampoo, cost $9.00 dollar.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to make a HUGE difference, but I do feel stubble where I didn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li> What a great experience I had with vitamin shampoo , I try different shampo in the past none works for me, finally I got what I was looking for for a long time !! I recommended highly to man and Woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and I wish you a big success ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shafie</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second day (for the shampoo) and so far I see the difference of my hair already, they feel more manageable I have not receive my Vitamins i hope in a few days so I can can start and really see the effect on both. I will give it a 5 stars when I take both and see the full result , I can&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt more healthier.  I have been using for two weeks now, I noticed an immediate change in texture&lt;br /&gt;and shine.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown. It is soft and I am loving the results!</li>
            <li> No difference seen in hair growth</li>
            <li> I really really love this shampoo!  My hair has never looked better and smells so good!  Its shinier, stronger, and has a lot a bounce.  I&#x27;m also taking a Biotin vitamin, so both of them together work great together!</li>
            <li> AWESOME!  Great product...  wish I could buy by the gallon!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.. from the first time I used it my hair felt softer, fuller healthier and I also saw less hair loss. I have been using it for about 1 month, but would definitely reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it on 12/24/2014 and it&#x27;s okay.  I haven&#x27;t had any real significant growth yet, but I guess time will tell.  I&#x27;ve used it almost every day, but nothing miraculous...oh, well.  My hair feels clean, smells nice, great lather, less breakage, but not a whole lot of new growth to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace.</li>
            <li> Really nice biotin shampoo. I got this to use in conjunction with Nourish biotin supplements. I had been have issues with my hair growth. It&#x27;s been at the same length for years, no growth. With the supplements and shampoo, I am seeing results. Finally getting somewhere! I am happy to recieve this shampoo to review.</li>
            <li> This is awesome shampoo</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Love this shampoo i always have had thin hair and when i started using this my hair is fuller and thicker I&#x27;m on my second bottle :)&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much fullness in my hair yet BUT..I have noticed that not alot of hair loss is happening when I&#x27;m in the shower which is great!! I have high hopes for this product, look forward to using it everyday!</li>
            <li> Great product, love the way my hair looks! seems like it should be better for you, too! Just as described and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> This product actually works, I bought it for my boyfriend and he&#x27;s liking it so far, it took a few weeks for him to see results but it&#x27;s working, ill recommend it..&lt;br /&gt;-Amalia S</li>
            <li> Terrible product!. Stay away not worth all the money. I regret purchasing.</li>
            <li> I will review after a months use or so. So far, it&#x27;s the nicest shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for one month and I hadn&#x27;t really noticed how drastic my results were until I looked at my before pic, wow! I also have been washing off my eye makeup with the shampoo and my eyelashes look awesome! My regimen is as follows: I condition my entire length of my hair, then I apply Apple cider vinegar to my hairline and roots and without rinsing then I start shampooing only my head not my entire length of hair (this will help u use less of this expensive shampoo) and leave it on while I do the rest of my shower probably 10 minutes or so. I massage the shampoo into my hair for as close to 4 minutes as I can get. The picture on the left was taken today and the one on the right was taken the day I got the shampoo</li>
            <li> Realizing it takes a while to regrown hair, I ordered 2 of these expensive bottles, plus vitamins, and have used these products consistently for approximately 5 months with no success (no thyroid problems).  Although it smells good, it is very drying and frys my hair.  There has been no hair regrowth at all.  I realize some products just don&#x27;t work for some people and I fall into that category.</li>
            <li> The smell of this stuff is so overpowering, it woke me from sleep at night.  Have received an acknowledgement for refund without return, but let&#x27;s see if it truly goes through.</li>
            <li> left my hair greasy at the top of my scalp.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT WORTH THE $ IF YOU WANT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> Update: So ive used this for about three weeks. The more i used i had like a film on my hair. My hair looked oily and was just flat. I didnt notice much growth and my hair still look the same. Idk how long i have to used this to get great results. I had to switch brands though so my hair would look fuller and feel weightless. Ill still use this just change the way i use it.   i have used this for two days now. i love the smell and the ease of putting it in my hair. i have notice my hair looking healthier. As for lenght well it has only been two days so i haven&#x27;t noticed a change yet. i do think i will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> Great smell, but didn&#x27;t work as I thought it would. Also a pit pricey.</li>
            <li> So far I like how it smells and how it leaves my hair feeling. My hair is falling out less but it may be due to me thyroid medication being lowered to keep my thyroid at the right level. I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if I get new hair growth. It is pricey though but keys see the results  once use this more.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is working, but we will see.  I was disappointed that when I ordered two of them, one of them was half used and obviously a return.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is an amazing product it made my hair grow!!! I was so happy it was a miracle a dream come true I was very depressed that I had bold stops that where very visible Infront of my hair I had to try something and choose this product I tried this because all the ingredients where natural so at the end it did work everybody started to notice a big difference and made my self esteem go up I felt more beautiful I will purchase this product in the future I finish the bottle in a month I was worth buying</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the amazing reviews.  I was so excited to try it out.  This product did nothing for me.  :(</li>
            <li> I have only used it once.  Will update once I&#x27;m done with the bottle.  I obviously can&#x27;t say that my hair is thicker after one use.  However, I can say that it seems to &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; the hair/attach to it.  I have really short/fine hair that has thinned a little after three babies.  It lays nicer without having to style then it has with regular shampoo.  I did not have to use product this morning.  It also appears to have more body then it normally does &amp;#60;- for this reason I have stated 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I have ever used!  No more fly away hair, instead you get volume, shininess, and a clean feeling. This is the only shampoo I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make any difference other than dry your scalp out and itch.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would really make my hair bouncy and full. Well it&#x27;s like others that cost less.  It works ok but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am using the product regularly, and am still waiting to see an improvement. I am still hopeful.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A GIFT, SO I AM NOT SURE IF IT WORKS FOR HER YET. TIME WILL TELL.</li>
            <li> Although this product may help with hair loss, I would never buy it due to the numerous harsh chemicals including the preservatives, perfumes and lathering agents. As someone with sensitive skin and recognizing that what you put on your skin (scalp) goes into your bloodstream, I want to avoid these chemicals. It would be nice if the manufacturers would re-formulate.</li>
            <li> Turned my hair into a haystack!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 2 months and the difference in my hair is not only noticeable but amazing, my hair has grown 3 inches since I started using it. I had gotten a haircut at the beginning of January, received the shampoo 2 weeks later, my hair went from shoulder length (Jan)  to my bra line (Apr 5). I&#x27;m so happy, my hair loss  has gone down 70%! No more hair in the shower. My crown is fuller with baby hair, which is a sign of new hair regrowth. I&#x27;m thankful I came across this product. No more false promises shampoos, this is my one and only. Seriously no Biolage,  Pantene,  Nexxus, paul Mitchell, or any other useless lying product has done what this simple labeled,  sweet smelling shampoo has done for me. GOODBYE WASTE OF MONEY, HELLO MY BEAUTIFUL SILKY LONG HAIR.</li>
            <li> Disappointed to find that this shampoo contains sulfates which strip hair color.</li>
            <li> I have been using for two weeks, my hair feels better as it is damaged.  I am growing out short hair cut and hair color.  Not much on the 120% growth.  I went back to my 1600 mcg biotin daily using vitamins I bought here locally.  Their vitamins were a bit too strong - they contain 4000 mcg daily. I tried their vitamins at 2000 mcg daily. Still a bit strong for me.  I have not noticed any improvement in growth using the shampoo or any vitamins.  My hair, skin and nails do feel stronger and my complexion looks a lot better.  I have been taking vitamins for over a month.  Taking a lower dose of the biotin and along with added B vitamins, evening primrose oil, silica in my brand work well for me.  I have cut back on washing my hair to twice a week.  5 stars for the customer service and shipping!  I am looking forward to 1 month and I will come back as I am measuring growth and keeping up with a photo library.  As of today, I am one month into new hair growth (two weeks using the VITAMINS brand).  Additional two weeks from now, my growth will be at 6 weeks.  I will repost as my journey continues....</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Product smells good! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Seems to work. Hair feels thicker. Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> WOW. My friends are SHOCKED at how long my hair is getting! And it&#x27;s so thick I&#x27;ve stopped using all my sticky products. This is amazing. In fact, it smells so good that I&#x27;d use it even if I didn&#x27;t need hair growth! It smells like a $100 shampoo. I&#x27;m so impressed with the thickness and texture it leaves my normally limp, dry, thin hair in. Thank you thank you!!</li>
            <li> So far great product.  Make your hair feel great, great lather and no conditioner needed.  As far as results, too soon to tell, as I have only been using for a couple of weeks, but so far, love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a while before doing a review,I have been been using this for about a month now while the bottle is still half way through i did buy a second one for back up.Due to IV medications i have noticed that the Hair strainer in my Tub was filling up fast ,i started to get very upset .I have used several Growth Shampoos and nothing can even come close to comparing with this Shampoo.The first week i noticed less Hair in the Tub strainer by the second week none the Third week i could see new Hairs on my Scalp.This is my Holy Grail ,not only does this promote Hair Growth this leaves a nice vibrant shine.The Scent is Amazing and the Price is great you don&#x27;t need to use Conditioner with this so right there you are saving money at least i am.My Husband is now using this also and he is getting great results ,I have noticed his Hair is Thicker and Growing faster than ever so he gets it cut more often than before.I am very Greatful for the seller of this wonderful Shampoo i just wish i knew about this long ago.I also want to mention this will last a long time you don&#x27;t need much,like i mentioned i still have half a Bottle and have another for back up but now with my Husband using this i will probably go through it a little faster.So Thank you for making this Available to us,as long as this is around i will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo as I have thinning hair.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday as this product suggests.  I use it every three days, and honestly, I have not noticed any changes.  I have only used it 5 times.  Maybe I need to use it longer to make an accurate assessment.  But I will say this product is very expensive, and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this profuct but was so sad it did not work for me. It smells like old men cologne, made my hair come out even more and tangle up, and bottle was not filled(missing like 5 washes). I&#x27;m glad some people had results with it, I guess I&#x27;m sticking to organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated this review, customer service was excellent in responding and communicating. Hope they are able to come up with new formula.</li>
            <li> My hair had been thinning out due to hair fall. I have used other products to stop my hairfall or grow hair back but none is effective. I have seen good reviews about this product so I tried a bottle of it. In just 2 weeks, I have noticed newly-grown hairstrands. It&#x27;s continually growing and I haven&#x27;t even consumed the whole bottle. It&#x27;s so economical because just a small amount to damp would create bubbles right away, plus I love the scent too!! I would highly recommend this product to be proven effective!! 👍👍👍</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;So far I am loving the products. My hair loss has slowed down considerably. I love the pleasant smell AND with fairly long hair, I have found no need for cream rinse like many other products.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My hair does look fuller but I don&#x27;t notice shine or growth yet but I&#x27;ve only been using it two weeks.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.  Having seen much growth yet but it leaves my hair so soft and easy to manage, which I must say sometimes wasn&#x27;t easy with a short Afro. Hoping the shampoo will cause my hair to grow a little longer before summer.</li>
            <li> We bought this product and my husband uses it daily. He mentioned how thick, full, and soft his hair is now. His hair feels great!!!! Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this shampoo after reading the reviews on here. It is my second week using it. The scent is great. Although, my hair still falls out when I&#x27;m showering but this product definitely makes my hair feel healthier. I no longer have to use any anti-frizz creme for my hair.  I will continue to try this shampoo and see if it will help with hair regrowth. So far, I&#x27;ve been pretty satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent! all the vitamin shampoos 3 of them arrived way before the arrival time I expected. Wow what a service and to top it all my hair is smiling again. It looks healthy, shiny and has stop falling quite a bit, I&#x27;ve noticed that each time I wash my hair it sheds less and less. I am definitely going to buy the supplements as well to help grow my hair.</li>
            <li> I hope this shampoo continues to be available forever.  It has made a huge turnaround in my hair FILLING OUT rather than FALLING OUT.  I have hypothyroidism, and for several years a large amount of hair would be left in my comb when combing it out after shampooing.  I have tried many other products that billed themselves as anti-hair-loss shampoos, and none made a significant change until this one.  PROs: -- Hardly have any loose hairs in my comb now -- New hairs around my forehead that would never seem to grow past a half inch before before are now growing longer -- Almost no perfumed fragrance, just a nice neutral smell, which is nice since I am sensitive to perfumes  CONs: -- None  I also use an after-shampoo conditioner with silk protein called Silk 18 Natural Conditioner By Maple Holistics which is Sulfate Free and has 18 Silk Amino Acids, Argan, Jojoba, and Keratin that may be helping eliminate hair breakage as well.  I will describe it in a review as well. AND if your eyebrows are also thinning like mine have, I also recommend you check out EmbelLASH or NaturalLASH by Protege at Amazon (which has made a major difference in my eyebrows growing back in after hypothyroidism resulted in loosing the outer one third).</li>
            <li> I would like to say that I just purchased my next bottle...  And I love love love this product. At first I was a bit skeptical because when I first started using it I didn&#x27;t see much of change. I been using this product for a little over a month and just realized that the length is cut off when I first bought the product already grew back!!!! I cut off about 1-2 inches of dead hair and I already got it back. Not to mention I put some on my eyebrows and my eyebrows are looking thicker and spots that I had missing now have hair. My hair still needs a lot of repairing but I know and am 100% sure that with continuous use this shampoo will do it for me... I barely even need to use conditioner. This is a great natural product and has been the only thing that has actually worked. Especially since I&#x27;m pregnant and instead of my hair actually growing it fell out and got very stringy. This shampoo has brought it back to life... I advise anyone who wants to buy it don&#x27;t be hesitant.. The price is right !! Shipping is fast.... I love it</li>
