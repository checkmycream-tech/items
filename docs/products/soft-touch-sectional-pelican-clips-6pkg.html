            <li>I love them!!!</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Great for the hair, does not break the hair off.</li>
            <li>They work great.</li>
            <li>what is very Nice</li>
            <li>I loved these clips they hold hair up great.</li>
            <li>On the inside (grippy part) it has teeth and the hinges kept catching my hair!  </li>
            <li>Also they are a good price.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t leave any creases or marks though, so I consider them a good purchase.</li>
            <li>and I figured that for the price they were a good deal.</li>
            <li>Amazon you are amazing thank you again.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve lost about 5 clips this way, I&#x27;ll probably purchase another kind...</li>
            <li>They hold a good amount of hair, and stay secure.  </li>
            <li>However, the spring tension isn&#x27;t quite as strong as I would have liked, so they don&#x27;t hold quite as well as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in good condition, very&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t been able to clean them yet, but I am sure I will be able to clean them easier also!!!</li>
            <li>These are a durable, sturdy construction, and do a great job holding moderately large sections of hair as needed.</li>
            <li>and I just love them.</li>
            <li>I love this clips because they do not crimp your hair while you are styling it.  </li>
            <li>I love these there allot easier to Use then the aluminum ones that I had used before.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will order from you again.</li>
            <li>your Shipping and Packaging is always over the top Like always.</li>
            <li>I for sure will be a return customer...</li>
            <li>These clips are kind of padded and thus are quite comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I did not use these clips more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought these after a quick tutorial from my hairdresser on how to blow out my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>they should show a full size photo up in here!</li>
            <li>And they are easy to store</li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to grip my hair.</li>
            <li>They stay in your hair easily.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>The hair clips are great for sectioning off hair to detangle; I&#x27;ve purchase several and share with friends and family.</li>
            <li>So, this may be better for people with straight or wavy hair, rather than curly/coarse/fragile hair.</li>
            <li>They are of good quality and larger size.  </li>
            <li>good hair clip for curiling or treating your hair Holds tight , and love the colors.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and dont really hold hair.</li>
            <li>Just wish more came in a pkg,  kat young</li>
            <li>These were just the right size for what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I have plenty of cheapo clips from local stores that do a way better job of holding my hair without hurting.</li>
            <li>Of course, there aren&#x27;t any problems when my hair is straight.</li>
            <li>I wanted these for sectioning my hair while straightening, and they do not work very well at all.  </li>
            <li>kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li>high Quality of the plastic</li>
            <li>These clips work ok as long as you don&#x27;t try to pin back a lot of hair with them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re made of a soft plastic/rubber that allows it some flexibility, and the top half has some ribbing that gives the clip some grip and keeps them in place.</li>
            <li>The clips just slid out of my hair and when I tried to clip up individual sections of hair on top of my head the hair just came flopping down again.</li>
            <li>Something to keep in mind though, they do work better on wet hair than dry hair.</li>
            <li>However, whenever I use them, no matter how gentle I am, I always feel like the tiny teeth are dragging across my hair whenever I put them in or take them out, causing some breakage.</li>
            <li>I just got my Sectional Pelican Clips, By Soft Touch.</li>
            <li>My girls have long hair and this makes managing it much easier after washing and conditioning.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and have a hard time finding anything that will hold my hair while I style it.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, these do not really hold my hair up very well at all.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted the colors they advertise, not black and white.</li>
            <li>That being said, they sort of do their job of holding your hair but they are super hard and your hair tends to fall out.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t super thick.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not long enough and they don&#x27;t grip tightly enough.  </li>

            <li> The web page for this item says &amp;#34;6 clips in package: 2 each of red, blue, and black.&amp;#34;  What we got were 3 black and 3 white clips.  </li>
            <li> clip itself is about 4.5 inches long, with the clippable section</li>
            <li> about 3.25 inches long.</li>
            <li> these clips are well made, but they are so much bigger than i expected.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that they only last a few months, and then break.  </li>
            <li> but they are a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I do have long hair</li>
            <li> I ordered these clips as described - 2 blue clips, 2 red and two black.</li>
            <li> I may be a guy, but I have lengthy enough hair that it tends to get in the way when I&#x27;m cooking or doing other household chores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a few packs of these, and generally like them  </li>
            <li> I try to open them as wide as possible before doing either or, but there&#x27;s usually a snag at some point.</li>
            <li> These clips are hard plastic, not the soft silicon advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the plain metal ones.</li>
            <li> These are very simple and plain plastic clips.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian female with wavy/straight, long, and thick hair.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t find this size from the other sellers.  </li>
            <li> i tried to return the package to Amazon and ask for replacement with the colors they describe, i was not able to choose the \\&quot;replacement\\&quot; option, only refund.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wanted these clips to help section my thick hair for flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> I received 3 black clips and 3 white.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> these almost always grab a few hairs in the hinge and pull them out when I try to remove them.  </li>
            <li> For an item this inexpensive, and given the hassle of receiving the wrong merchandise and the hassle of returning it, Amazon shouldn&#x27;t require us to bother returning the item, and it shouldn&#x27;t simply suggest re-ordering the same thing given the likelihood of getting the same wrong merchandise again, having to return it again, etc.</li>
            <li> The smaller underclip snaps off, and makes the clip useless.  </li>
            <li> When we called Amazon, they said that we had to return the wrong ones in order to get a refund, and that we could order the same item again on the website.  </li>
            <li> or if I am Lazy I just Curl them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bi-racial, with thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY thick hair</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the metal clips caught in my hair and were painful to remove.</li>
            <li> I have Shoulder Length Hair that is very, very thick.</li>
            <li> - they slide around my hair and does a poor job of keeping them in place when I clip sections up.</li>
            <li> These clips have turned out to be useless.  </li>
            <li> My problem with them is that they have very poor grip</li>
            <li> I am disappointing but I still need these and will keep them as there is no option to replace.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair also has gotten caught in the hinges which is annoying and painful.</li>

            <li> these almost always grab a few hairs in the hinge and pull them out when I try to remove them.  They&#x27;re not long enough and they don&#x27;t grip tightly enough.  I&#x27;m going back to the plain metal ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bi-racial, with thick, curly hair. I don&#x27;t use these on a regular basis, since I try to avoid heat-styling as much as possible, but I felt like these held my hair in place well, which says something. However, whenever I use them, no matter how gentle I am, I always feel like the tiny teeth are dragging across my hair whenever I put them in or take them out, causing some breakage. I try to open them as wide as possible before doing either or, but there&#x27;s usually a snag at some point. Of course, there aren&#x27;t any problems when my hair is straight. So, this may be better for people with straight or wavy hair, rather than curly/coarse/fragile hair.</li>
            <li> I may be a guy, but I have lengthy enough hair that it tends to get in the way when I&#x27;m cooking or doing other household chores. The hair clip I&#x27;d been using up until now broke recently, so I was looking for something to replace it with, and came across these pelican clips, which work well enough to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clip itself is about 4.5 inches long, with the clippable section about 3.25 inches long. They&#x27;re made of a soft plastic/rubber that allows it some flexibility, and the top half has some ribbing that gives the clip some grip and keeps them in place. However, the spring tension isn&#x27;t quite as strong as I would have liked, so they don&#x27;t hold quite as well as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> I loved these clips they hold hair up great. And they are easy to store and I just love them.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and have a hard time finding anything that will hold my hair while I style it.  These do the trick!</li>
            <li> These were just the right size for what I needed.  They are of good quality and larger size.  I thought that they were over priced but I couldn&#x27;t find this size from the other sellers.  I would recommend these for pulling hair back to blow dry sections.</li>
            <li> My girls have long hair and this makes managing it much easier after washing and conditioning. Definitely a life saver! lol</li>
            <li> Great for the hair, does not break the hair off. Came in set of six which is&lt;br /&gt;plenty when conditioning hair. Arrived quickly and in good condition, very&lt;br /&gt;well wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> these clips are well made, but they are so much bigger than i expected. they should show a full size photo up in here!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a few packs of these, and generally like them  They hold a good amount of hair, and stay secure.  The only problem is that they only last a few months, and then break.  The smaller underclip snaps off, and makes the clip useless.  Since I&#x27;ve lost about 5 clips this way, I&#x27;ll probably purchase another kind...kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li> There is nothing overly fancy about these clips, but they do just what I needed them for: to hold my hair in sections while styling. These are a durable, sturdy construction, and do a great job holding moderately large sections of hair as needed. Now I just need another package...</li>
            <li> I love this clips because they do not crimp your hair while you are styling it.  Couldn&#x27;t find anything locally but thank you Amazon, this is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> These clips are hard plastic, not the soft silicon advertised. That being said, they sort of do their job of holding your hair but they are super hard and your hair tends to fall out. I only use them when curling my hair so they will work. Also they are a good price.</li>
            <li> The web page for this item says &amp;#34;6 clips in package: 2 each of red, blue, and black.&amp;#34;  What we got were 3 black and 3 white clips.  When we called Amazon, they said that we had to return the wrong ones in order to get a refund, and that we could order the same item again on the website.  But they gave no assurance that we would get the correct order the second time.  For an item this inexpensive, and given the hassle of receiving the wrong merchandise and the hassle of returning it, Amazon shouldn&#x27;t require us to bother returning the item, and it shouldn&#x27;t simply suggest re-ordering the same thing given the likelihood of getting the same wrong merchandise again, having to return it again, etc.</li>
            <li> good hair clip for curiling or treating your hair Holds tight , and love the colors.Just wish more came in a pkg,  kat young</li>
            <li> I just got my Sectional Pelican Clips, By Soft Touch. I love these there allot easier to Use then the aluminum ones that I had used before. I have Shoulder Length Hair that is very, very thick. I often do Vintage inspired Hair Styles. or if I am Lazy I just Curl them. these Clips do not get caught in my hair, nor does it pull my hair. what is very Nice I like how easy it is to grip my hair. high Quality of the plastic so it helps treat my hair not damage my hair. haven&#x27;t been able to clean them yet, but I am sure I will be able to clean them easier also!!! Amazon you are amazing thank you again. I am sure I will order from you again. your Shipping and Packaging is always over the top Like always. I for sure will be a return customer... your Shipping is always allot earlier then you say it will be but that&#x27;s fine I am not complaining&lt;br /&gt;  xoxo,&lt;br /&gt;  Sara-</li>
            <li> These are very simple and plain plastic clips. My problem with them is that they have very poor grip - they slide around my hair and does a poor job of keeping them in place when I clip sections up. If I move my head with these on then they will move all over the place. My hair also has gotten caught in the hinges which is annoying and painful.</li>
            <li> These clips are kind of padded and thus are quite comfortable.  They stay in your hair easily.  I love them!!!</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this because the only thing \\&quot;soft\\&quot; about this product was the rubbery material on the outside.  On the inside (grippy part) it has teeth and the hinges kept catching my hair!  I have plenty of cheapo clips from local stores that do a way better job of holding my hair without hurting.</li>
            <li> Yeah, these do not really hold my hair up very well at all.  I wanted these for sectioning my hair while straightening, and they do not work very well at all.  If i tilt my head to the necessary side, I can make do.  (Pun).</li>
            <li> They work great. I use them quite offten.</li>
            <li> I bought these after a quick tutorial from my hairdresser on how to blow out my hair nicely. I have REALLY thick hair and they worked really well to separate into sections while I dried. Something to keep in mind though, they do work better on wet hair than dry hair. When I try to use them for curling the sections often slip out of the clips. They don&#x27;t leave any creases or marks though, so I consider them a good purchase.</li>
            <li> These clips have turned out to be useless.  I don&#x27;t like them and don&#x27;t use them and wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered these clips as described - 2 blue clips, 2 red and two black. I received 3 black clips and 3 white.&lt;br /&gt;When i tried to return the package to Amazon and ask for replacement with the colors they describe, i was not able to choose the \\&quot;replacement\\&quot; option, only refund.&lt;br /&gt;I know I am being picky with the colors but I wanted the colors they advertise, not black and white. I am disappointing but I still need these and will keep them as there is no option to replace.&lt;br /&gt;They should not be sending me stock they want to get rid of, they should send me what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I will not order from them again.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian female with wavy/straight, long, and thick hair. I bought these clips to hold up the upper layers of my hair while I straighten it and I figured that for the price they were a good deal. These did not work AT ALL. The clips just slid out of my hair and when I tried to clip up individual sections of hair on top of my head the hair just came flopping down again. Not only that, but the metal clips caught in my hair and were painful to remove. I did not use these clips more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that these hair clips are inexpensive but they are a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and dont really hold hair. These slide out and dont stay in place. Get the metal ones from sally beauty!</li>
            <li> These clips work ok as long as you don&#x27;t try to pin back a lot of hair with them. I had to use all 6 of them to hold back my hair. I do have long hair but it isn&#x27;t super thick.</li>
            <li> I wanted these clips to help section my thick hair for flat ironing.  However, they won&#x27;t even hold up the smallest section. The clips keep sliding out of my hair.</li>
            <li> The hair clips are great for sectioning off hair to detangle; I&#x27;ve purchase several and share with friends and family.</li>
