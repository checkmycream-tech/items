            <li>/&gt;The smell is awesome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hold of the cream is perfect.</li>
            <li>It smells great too.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff to put in your hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I now use it every day.  </li>

            <li>I love the smell of this stuff!</li>
            <li>Totally love it!</li>
            <li>I really is so amazing, my wife is stealing it from me.</li>
            <li>this stuff works great with clean hair as well as  on a day when you don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but more importantly makes your hair look amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a light conditioner and makes your hair and scalp feel clean, while getting rid of fly away hairs and making your hair manageable.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This product smells great and work very well.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Just needs a bit more hold.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the hold...</li>
            <li>If I wear it more than two days in a row, I will start to break out a bit on the forehead.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, phenomenal product.</li>
            <li>Clean, nice texture.</li>
            <li>No regrets, it works great.</li>
            <li>This is not the right product if you are looking for very strong hold.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and use it mostly as an anti-frizz control measure, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>It also has a strong but fantastic sage aroma.</li>
            <li>I might as well use cheap hair spray.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great, just enough to be something but not perfume-y.</li>
            <li>It makes styling so much easier, smells great, and works very well with finishing products like pomade or styling paste.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff - it is very costly but works great, has a great, and subtle, fragrance.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of high end</li>
            <li>I let it air dry &amp; my hair looks great.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a nightmare to keep looking cool.</li>
            <li>Make sure not to use too much at a time though.</li>
            <li>Its really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I also tried using a tiny bit, then more and more still.  </li>
            <li>overpowering at first, is pretty fantastic as well.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I first bought this from my barber...</li>
            <li>In short I love it.</li>
            <li>Your hair looks clean and alive.</li>
            <li>I really like this styling cream</li>
            <li>but the problem is that if too much is used, it will leave a oily residue on the hair.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or look wet as most styling gel/creams do.</li>
            <li>price is a bit much.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This is the first product to give me the right amount of hold without making my hair so gross</li>
            <li>People expecting more hold should understand that a cream behaves differently than a gel and serve different purposes.</li>
            <li>I have had one issue that is most likely just because of my specific skin type...</li>
            <li>There is a reason why every men&#x27;s magazine and high end barber shops are recommending this product.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I used to live in the US and started using this styling cream when a high-end barber that I went to (FSC Barbers in New York) used it on my hair after a cut.</li>
            <li>I just wish I could buy it where I live and not have to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li>It has a natural hold and does not make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>Soft hold and a pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>Natural, organic feeling hair product.  </li>
            <li>Have tried other &amp;#34;creams&amp;#34; but this has proven to be my first choice, despite the cost.  </li>

            <li>Like someone else said, you do need to be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li>I tried many products but they were too greasy or too smelly or too gluey.</li>
            <li>Again, I have a very specific type of skin (very dry and very sensitive), but if you see similar reviews, than maybe its a pattern.</li>

            <li> Worth a shot if your hair is at least 2.5 inches long, maybe 3.</li>
            <li> This gives a &amp;#34;pliable&amp;#34; look, put keeps hair in place giving it a natural look with a little bit of shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for other products that might be similar but haven&#x27;t yet come across anything else</li>
            <li> i use on damp hair as well as dry hair</li>
            <li> I got an expensive haircut a while ago and the barber put this in my hair and it was just right!</li>
            <li> I tried putting it on in wet, damp, almost dry and dry hair and see little difference in my appearance.  </li>
            <li> and you need only a small amount per use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look like other styling cream.</li>
            <li> Other styling gels or creams are either greasy or after a few hours your hair is too dry.</li>
            <li> Just enough for my undercut on days when I don&#x27;t feel like working too hard or looking too put together.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like I put anything in my hair but makes it easier to control and makes it look just a little shinier.</li>
            <li> Not too firm and not too little.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always have trouble finding a cream that balances hold without being too greasy or stiff.</li>
            <li> I have medium long hair that is very thick that gets kinda of wavy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been hard to find something that can control it, and keep it from getting frizzy.</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t get hardly any residue.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 3 years now.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I have waves that can be tough to tame and this product does NOT do the trick.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended for &amp;#34;holding&amp;#34; any type of hair in place which was my biggest concern for me, having thin hair, but a lot of it.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I really love this stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t look like I put anything in my hair but makes it easier to control and makes it look just a little shinier. It lasts me about 5-6 mo (I have 1.5-2in hair).</li>
            <li> This product smells great and work very well. It has a natural hold and does not make my hair look greasy. People expecting more hold should understand that a cream behaves differently than a gel and serve different purposes.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great with clean hair as well as  on a day when you don&#x27;t wash it. No build up and you need only a small amount per use. i use on damp hair as well as dry hair</li>
            <li> Made my hair look too greasy</li>
            <li> I have long hair and use it mostly as an anti-frizz control measure, but it works great.  Doesn&#x27;t feel oily or look like I have a lot of product in my hair and the sage smell, overpowering at first, is pretty fantastic as well.</li>
            <li> Soft hold and a pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> I first bought this from my barber... I love the smell of this stuff! Its really clean and fresh. Not at all greasy. Totally love it!</li>
            <li> I used to live in the US and started using this styling cream when a high-end barber that I went to (FSC Barbers in New York) used it on my hair after a cut. I have never used anything like it before, or since. It&#x27;s not like a Gel that dries your hair, and it&#x27;s not like a wax that makes your hair look greasy. It&#x27;s like a light conditioner and makes your hair and scalp feel clean, while getting rid of fly away hairs and making your hair manageable. It smells great too. In short I love it. I just wish I could buy it where I live and not have to pay for shipping. I&#x27;ve looked for other products that might be similar but haven&#x27;t yet come across anything else that&#x27;s comparable. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> I really like this styling cream but the problem is that if too much is used, it will leave a oily residue on the hair. It holds well by itself but I mix a bit with the Malin + Goetz pomade</li>
            <li> Best product for hair.</li>
            <li> Just made my hair greasy</li>
            <li> I have frizzy curly hair that&#x27;s a nightmare to keep looking cool. I had been looking for a product for years that would help me out. I read a review for this product on GQ and immediately bought it. No regrets, it works great. Make sure not to use too much at a time though.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff to put in your hair. I tried many products but they were too greasy or too smelly or too gluey. I got an expensive haircut a while ago and the barber put this in my hair and it was just right! I jumped out of the chair and ran to Malin &amp; Goetz to buy a tube of Styling Cream-4oz !</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 3 years now. Nothing else compares. It is not greasy and last all day. Other styling gels or creams are either greasy or after a few hours your hair is too dry. Like someone else said, you do need to be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> I have medium long hair that is very thick that gets kinda of wavy. I always have trouble finding a cream that balances hold without being too greasy or stiff. This gives a &amp;#34;pliable&amp;#34; look, put keeps hair in place giving it a natural look with a little bit of shine. This is not the right product if you are looking for very strong hold. There is a reason why every men&#x27;s magazine and high end barber shops are recommending this product.</li>
            <li> Smell and works like a million bucks. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I now use it every day.  It makes styling so much easier, smells great, and works very well with finishing products like pomade or styling paste.</li>
            <li> Good product for medium length hair.  Shorter hair may need stronger hold. I like the smell.  Natural, organic feeling hair product.  I like this company, it&#x27;s kind of high end Tom&#x27;s of Maine.  Worth a shot if your hair is at least 2.5 inches long, maybe 3.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It smells good, but more importantly makes your hair look amazing.  I put it in my hair while it is still damp.  I let it air dry &amp; my hair looks great.  Clean, nice texture.</li>
            <li> This product smells awesome and it lasts for quite a while. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or look wet as most styling gel/creams do. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nearly perfect. Just needs a bit more hold.</li>
            <li> my hair is under control and has a natural-silky texture</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the hold... Just enough for my undercut on days when I don&#x27;t feel like working too hard or looking too put together. I have had one issue that is most likely just because of my specific skin type... If I wear it more than two days in a row, I will start to break out a bit on the forehead. Again, I have a very specific type of skin (very dry and very sensitive), but if you see similar reviews, than maybe its a pattern. Otherwise, phenomenal product.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended for &amp;#34;holding&amp;#34; any type of hair in place which was my biggest concern for me, having thin hair, but a lot of it.  I have waves that can be tough to tame and this product does NOT do the trick.  I might as well use cheap hair spray.  In fact, I&#x27;m buying some tomorrow.  I am an entertainer and I can&#x27;t afford to have my hair look out of whack.  I tried putting it on in wet, damp, almost dry and dry hair and see little difference in my appearance.  I also tried using a tiny bit, then more and more still.  It seems to have zero effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> I really is so amazing, my wife is stealing it from me. It doesn&#x27;t give the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look like other styling cream. Your hair looks clean and alive.</li>
            <li> This is the first product to give me the right amount of hold without making my hair so gross I can&#x27;t run my hand through it. I have really thick hair and it&#x27;s been hard to find something that can control it, and keep it from getting frizzy. I can also go to bed without washing my hair and I don&#x27;t feel like all the product is rubbing off onto my pillow. The smell is great, just enough to be something but not perfume-y. Please don&#x27;t change the formula and please don&#x27;t stop making it. This really is perfect.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is awesome. They say it is \\&quot;sage\\&quot;, but it smells a lot sweeter than that. Whatever it is, it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The hold of the cream is perfect. Not too firm and not too little.&lt;br /&gt;The cream doesn&#x27;t come off the hair - when you run your fingers through it, you don&#x27;t get hardly any residue. This means that, unlike gel and similar products, you don&#x27;t feel like you need to wash it off to be comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The price is a bit much.</li>
            <li> Light hold, not greasy looking and a subtle masculine sage smell.  I recommend this product and I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - it is very costly but works great, has a great, and subtle, fragrance.  Have tried other &amp;#34;creams&amp;#34; but this has proven to be my first choice, despite the cost.  Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Works very well. This is a pliable styling cream with a moderate hold. It also has a strong but fantastic sage aroma.</li>
            <li> It works. It&#x27;s hair cream and it doesn&#x27;t smell all foo foo.</li>
