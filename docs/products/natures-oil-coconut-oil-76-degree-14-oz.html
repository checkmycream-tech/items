            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Works great for skin and hair, and it is absolutely fantastic for shaving!</li>
            <li>Product arrived fresh and delicious as it should!</li>
            <li>Arrived on time with tape around the lid to keep it sealed even in warm weather.</li>
            <li>Kind of bummed</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was packaged great.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Coconut has a natural beautiful occurring smell that no one can honestly detest so why has it been extracted from this product.</li>
            <li>need more time to test it.</li>
            <li>Tried to return it, they were charging me more for the shipping than what I paid for, threw it in trash.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this 100% coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I pleased with product</li>
            <li>I must say, I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was able to comb through my hair without any tangles.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t been able to close it.</li>
            <li>this way i had more control of the oil verses using my hands</li>
            <li>A lot of the premade hair oils I buy already have coconut oil in them so this skips over my need to buy more of those products, though I do mix this in with hair products that don&#x27;t include coconut oil as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:</li>
            <li>I continue to use those product and continue to be satisfied.</li>
            <li>Absolutely Love it.  </li>
            <li>I will order this product again. :))</li>
            <li>I also love how the oil solidifies (makes it easier to manage).</li>
            <li>Love love love my coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>So the main reason i got this oi was for my hair and honestly I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be this good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb very quickly so you might be better off using it at night.</li>
            <li>but I want anyone who sees this junk to actually buy quality honest food) which is GMO free and truly organic and great for the price.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and its a good quality.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t cheap out on food items and do research.</li>
            <li>It really depends on how warm the temps are that you are storing it.</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t use it in its original container</li>
            <li>I use it as a conditioner for my my natural hair as it glides through my hair and leaves a lasting shine with an awesome moist to my scalp.</li>
            <li>I use it when I clean my machete.</li>
            <li>I use this in everything from taking a tablespoon full to mixing in with hyaluronic acid serums.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product being that it is 100% Natural.</li>
            <li>In my home it has stayed a nice pliable soft texture.</li>
            <li>I bought the Grapeseed and Sweet almond Oil from this seller and this is one of my favorites of the 3.</li>
            <li>Just plain, amazing, natural coconut oil for a great price.</li>
            <li>Better than expected!!Perfect use directly after a shower for a spa like pampered massage.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the $7.00 that my wife paid for 16 oz.</li>
            <li>I  guess its worth using the rest of it</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know what to write for this review because i have reviewed other product by these people and it nothing but good news</li>
            <li>It is all natural and works great on the body for dry, cracking skins.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for a low price yet effective product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipper!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this brand of coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the pricing as it is low cost</li>
            <li>Stop buying other products that use this main ingredient but ad a lot of good smelling oils but charge you $14.00 for 1.6 oz.</li>
            <li>Works great in the hair as a deep conditioner or apply 1 hour before color or bleaching hair and color or bleach right over it to cut down on damage.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil can go from liquid to solid quite easily depending on room temperature.</li>
            <li>Used over entire body; gives the skin a really smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>The coconut itself is great but the lid of a jar was broken</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve really appreciated if they added to the description that it was scentless.</li>
            <li>thanks..</li>
            <li>Skip over lotion go straight for the coconut oil for skin hydration.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My skin stays smooth and you can see the different .</li>
            <li>If your home is very warm then the coconut oil will thin out and become a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 10/25/2015:</li>
            <li>This coconut oil made my hair super soft and renewed my hair completely .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again this is a far cry from pure and all natural (which isn&#x27;t a real thing anyways)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick and it makes your hair shiny.</li>
            <li>Good oil, dont care for the container, lid was broken when i received it.</li>
            <li>My new go to product.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to keep it in a hot area because it will melt if it&#x27;s stored on an area with 76degree or higher.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and supple after using this coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Very soft ,but , no smell to it</li>
            <li>for dry itchy winter skin, this works better than more expensive lotions and body creams I have purchased.</li>
            <li>My skin looks rejuvenated and baby soft without the greasy feel.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it is 100% natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t smell the coconut, if it is actual real coconut oil.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural scent.</li>
            <li>Works better than using various lotion due to the fact their main ingredient is water and once that dries up on the skin, it&#x27;s left once again dry.</li>
            <li>Usually I use olive oil and that works pretty decent</li>
            <li>So far I have only used it for skin care purposes.  </li>
            <li>love the product the lid was broken</li>
            <li>Easy to use, not messy, just a small amount covers what I need and I do believe the winter dry skin itch is almost ALL GONE!!</li>
            <li>Just want to let you know that if you&#x27;re paying 4$ for &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; (a gimmick and just designed to be a buzzword to entice you since they can&#x27;t legally say organic or GMO free) &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; (no it&#x27;s actually not, in fact it&#x27;s processed with dangerous chemicals and poisons in a method that removes practically all the vital nutrients)</li>
            <li>You just need to be careful you do not use high heat or heat it for a longer time than necessary to melt it.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> I would buy again just due to the price and the quantity  that you get for such a low price.</li>
            <li> this product wasn&#x27;t what i expected, it didn&#x27;t stay solid and didn&#x27;t have a coconut aroma to it.</li>
            <li> Overall NOT satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used coconut oil for other things besides my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> this one didn&#x27;t smell like coconut as much as other brands do.</li>
            <li> Having bought coconut oil again from other companies I have noted that this coconut oil is refined.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied, it feels artificial compared to other natural coconut oils I have used.</li>
            <li> If you want coconut oil that actually smells like coconut oil and isn&#x27;t refined look for jars labeled as cold pressed &amp;#34;extra virgin&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;virgin.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I am on a serious budget.</li>
            <li> Not good for skin.</li>
            <li> weird smell to it, and when it came to me the cap was cracked and broken</li>
            <li> (sorry this isn&#x27;t an advert</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick and it makes your hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied, it feels artificial compared to other natural coconut oils I have used. Also, it hasn&#x27;t been improving my skin or my hair even though I have been using for almost 2 months. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with this product also. A very good buy. 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what to write for this review because i have reviewed other product by these people and it nothing but good news this company has great customer service i have no problem with there products the only thing i regret is that i ordered only 1 of each products.</li>
            <li> This product has been helping to re moisturize my skin not only on my hands but as a night cream.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Used over entire body; gives the skin a really smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> I use this in everything from taking a tablespoon full to mixing in with hyaluronic acid serums. Great stuff and will buy again</li>
            <li> What can i say, it&#x27;s coconut oil. Arrived on time with tape around the lid to keep it sealed even in warm weather.</li>
            <li> Good product. Good price.</li>
            <li> The coconut itself is great but the lid of a jar was broken</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this 100% coconut oil. This product does what it is meant to do. It arrived quickly and was packaged great. I use it as a conditioner for my my natural hair as it glides through my hair and leaves a lasting shine with an awesome moist to my scalp. I would buy again just due to the price and the quantity  that you get for such a low price. And it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Stop buying other products that use this main ingredient but ad a lot of good smelling oils but charge you $14.00 for 1.6 oz. This product is well worth the $7.00 that my wife paid for 16 oz. It is all natural and works great on the body for dry, cracking skins.</li>
            <li> Perfect timing and quick! Product arrived fresh and delicious as it should!</li>
            <li> the quality is  100 % good I pleased with product</li>
            <li> I have used this numerous times. You just need to be careful you do not use high heat or heat it for a longer time than necessary to melt it.  Works beautifully</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product being that it is 100% Natural. But where is the smell of this product??? I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t smell the coconut, if it is actual real coconut oil. Or if it is, why is it removed? Coconut has a natural beautiful occurring smell that no one can honestly detest so why has it been extracted from this product. I would&#x27;ve really appreciated if they added to the description that it was scentless. So I would consider buying or Not. Overall NOT satisfied.</li>
            <li> great product, will order again</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this brand of coconut oil. I&#x27;ve always used coconut oil for other things besides my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair. I must say, I love this product. I shampooed my hair before applying the product. It also worked well with my leave in conditioner. I was able to comb through my hair without any tangles. My hair is very soft and supple after using this coconut oil. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell. It melts immediately after putting it in your hands. You can also use this as a deep conditioner oil.</li>
            <li> just  don&#x27;t like it. weird smell to it, and when it came to me the cap was cracked and broken so I haven&#x27;t been able to close it. I  guess its worth using the rest of it so I at least get my money&#x27;s  worth but I will never buy it again.  Just didn&#x27;t work for me,  it may for someone else.</li>
            <li> this worked well with my homemade sugar scrubs. thanks..</li>
            <li> this product wasn&#x27;t what i expected, it didn&#x27;t stay solid and didn&#x27;t have a coconut aroma to it. i couldn&#x27;t use it in its original container i had to put it in a squeeze bottle, this way i had more control of the oil verses using my hands</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s coconut oil, one of the best creations of all time. Kind of bummed this one didn&#x27;t smell like coconut as much as other brands do.</li>
            <li> Not good for skin. Excellent for cooking or conditioning leather. I use it when I clean my machete.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price I paid</li>
            <li> Very soft ,but , no smell to it but it works wonders ,product arrived on time</li>
            <li> COCONUT OIL! I use this for hair and body. This coconut oil has been refined and thus it&#x27;s coconut scent has been removed.  I use if for self and on my kids. It helps soothe my hand eczema and keep the rest of my skin hydrated. Works better than using various lotion due to the fact their main ingredient is water and once that dries up on the skin, it&#x27;s left once again dry. Skip over lotion go straight for the coconut oil for skin hydration. Can be used in DIY lip balm as its great for moisturizing ones lips too.  A lot of the premade hair oils I buy already have coconut oil in them so this skips over my need to buy more of those products, though I do mix this in with hair products that don&#x27;t include coconut oil as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Based on the fact this is &amp;#34;76 degree&amp;#34;, it will not stay solid. Coconut oil can go from liquid to solid quite easily depending on room temperature. If your home is very warm then the coconut oil will thin out and become a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 10/25/2015: Having bought coconut oil again from other companies I have noted that this coconut oil is refined. Refined coconut oil is void of it&#x27;s natural scent. Some of the benefits of coconut oil for cosmetic use may be lost when the oil is refined. If you want coconut oil that actually smells like coconut oil and isn&#x27;t refined look for jars labeled as cold pressed &amp;#34;extra virgin&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;virgin.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Just want to let you know that if you&#x27;re paying 4$ for &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; (a gimmick and just designed to be a buzzword to entice you since they can&#x27;t legally say organic or GMO free) &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; (no it&#x27;s actually not, in fact it&#x27;s processed with dangerous chemicals and poisons in a method that removes practically all the vital nutrients) coconut oil then you are being ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest Viva labs (sorry this isn&#x27;t an advert but I want anyone who sees this junk to actually buy quality honest food) which is GMO free and truly organic and great for the price. (it&#x27;s virgin ofc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again this is a far cry from pure and all natural (which isn&#x27;t a real thing anyways) so don&#x27;t cheap out on food items and do research. I promise you that you do not want to be buying this product or anything like it.</li>
            <li> Good quality, well priced.</li>
            <li> great for lips and hair</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I am pleased with the pricing as it is low cost and I am on a serious budget. This has not been runny at all, as I had read on another review. It really depends on how warm the temps are that you are storing it. In my home it has stayed a nice pliable soft texture. So far I have only used it for skin care purposes.  I have yet to use it for cooking, but when I use it on my lips it doesn&#x27;t have taste at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves that it has no smell.</li>
            <li> PERFECT!  Price and product.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I continue to use those product and continue to be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Good oil, dont care for the container, lid was broken when i received it. Works great in the hair as a deep conditioner or apply 1 hour before color or bleaching hair and color or bleach right over it to cut down on damage.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love it.  Im using it for my body and my hair.  I will not be caught without it, will order again</li>
            <li> Great product, I got it on time and packaging was very good! I will order this product again. :))</li>
            <li> I bought the Grapeseed and Sweet almond Oil from this seller and this is one of my favorites of the 3. I have super thick hair so this moisturizes and keeps my hair from drying out as well. I also love how the oil solidifies (makes it easier to manage).</li>
            <li> So the main reason i got this oi was for my hair and honestly I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be this good. Usually I use olive oil and that works pretty decent but when i used this I was stunned . This coconut oil made my hair super soft and renewed my hair completely . I definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> My skin stays smooth and you can see the different .</li>
            <li> love the product the lid was broken</li>
            <li> Great value! The oil is odorless, and is a great moisturizer post shower. It doesn&#x27;t absorb very quickly so you might be better off using it at night.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been softer!</li>
            <li> Great price and great for body care.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Smells great and oily.</li>
            <li> Love love love my coconut oil. I use it on everything  hair, skin, winter feet. This stuff is awesome and the amount you get for the price is a great deal. My new go to product.</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer for my hair and skin. I also like the fact it has no smell, so I can mix it with different moisturizers and hair products and not worry about conflicting scents when I use it.</li>
