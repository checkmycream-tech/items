    <ol>
            <li>Works perfectly.</li>
            <li>but it did so beautifully with no brassy color</li>
            <li>this with a toner is great.</li>
            <li>So I used color fix to get rid of my bright, bright, bright (were talking no browns or blacks...)</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>loved it, but i didnt read how to use it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always worked great :)</li>
            <li>, I am very happy, and kind of surprised.</li>
            <li>Took out the orange tones from my hair just fine!</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;ve used this product before</li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery…♡</li>
            <li>Remember to buy the strong peroxide.</li>
            <li>Came quick and I was really pleased</li>
            <li>it is a very very good bleach, is easy to use and powerful, if i have to use it again i will buy the biiigggg one, it is tiny for all the hair i have.</li>
            <li>This bleach is great for bleaching your hair to blonde.</li>
            <li>It burned, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>7 level lift is most definitely what I need!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just blue tinted bleach, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>it lifts your hair pretty well</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy because my hair was turned orange, compared to other products which get the job done in the same amount of time.</li>
            <li>and it did it very well.</li>
            <li>I used the l&#x27;oreal 30 volume cream developer, and it worked very well</li>
            <li>, finally something right !</li>
            <li>Always works, super fast and with relatively low damage to the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Quick Blue for years</li>
            <li>This actually kind of sucks compared to them.</li>
            <li>I usually only keep it on for about 15 minutes, and my hair is always light enough to dye purple, which is the goal.</li>
            <li>I used this to bleach my hair to a pale yellow that was suitable for toning, I have dark/medium brown hair, and it did just that</li>
            <li>And it even made some true white blonde naturally.</li>
            <li>hair for 13 years, many times going from black to blonde.</li>
            <li>This worked fantastic when I wanted a skunk streak in my hair and my hair is very very dark.</li>
            <li>i was skeptical because i have ethnic hair and its very dark, but it lightened my hair perfect.</li>
            <li>The consisency was thick, smell strong, and even with thirty developer didn&#x27;t turn the platenum I wanted..</li>
            <li>It left a lot of my hair still dark and only light close to the roots.</li>
            <li>It worked amazingly, it took a while to bleach my thick dark brown hair</li>
            <li>, I do recommend getting more than 1 or 2 packets if you have long or thick hair.</li>

            <li> I finally got the color I wanted and tinted it as you never really get rid of that hint of yellow.</li>
            <li> Used this last year after bleaching with some other brand and it helped even out the darker spots.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair half way down my back</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t come out orangey or yellow and my hair is naturally black.</li>
            <li> , be careful it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br</li>
            <li> and ive been doing blonde on my short hair for about 6 years only bleaching regrowth and this made my hair feel like ramen noodes which is not good!</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t use any other product for fear of damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair out a little, but I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Bleached black out of my hair within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> did clump a little, but I don&#x27;t know if it was the bleach or the developer I used.</li>
            <li> Dark tones can be hard to get out recommend 3-4 packets</li>
            <li> With the proper application it was not splotchy, blotchy, and my hair isn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be after all the torture I put t through.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really as good as some bleaches I&#x27;ve bought at the store.</li>
            <li> but it damaged my hair badly</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell, it doesn&#x27;t burn, and it works wonders.  </li>

            <li> Bleached black out of my hair within 30 minutes. I loved it. It burned, but it was worth it. I had bleach blonde hair within 45 minutes. It dried my hair out a little, but I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Quick Blue for years and it&#x27;s always worked great :)</li>
            <li> I have been doing hair for years and this with a toner is great. I have blonde hair half way down my back and I won&#x27;t use any other product for fear of damaging my hair. I always use a toner to get the brassiness out.</li>
            <li> This worked fantastic when I wanted a skunk streak in my hair and my hair is very very dark. I finally got the color I wanted and tinted it as you never really get rid of that hint of yellow. If you want to truly remove all color you can this is the way to go. Remember to buy the strong peroxide.</li>
            <li> So I used color fix to get rid of my bright, bright, bright (were talking no browns or blacks...) loreal permenent red color. I bleached afterwords.... The consisency was thick, smell strong, and even with thirty developer didn&#x27;t turn the platenum I wanted.. However! With the proper application it was not splotchy, blotchy, and my hair isn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be after all the torture I put t through..... Good product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really as good as some bleaches I&#x27;ve bought at the store. This actually kind of sucks compared to them. I wasn&#x27;t happy because my hair was turned orange, compared to other products which get the job done in the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> Came quick and I was really pleased, finally something right !</li>
            <li> This bleach is great for bleaching your hair to blonde. I only had two packets after  dying my hair brown it worked well! Dark tones can be hard to get out recommend 3-4 packets</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bleach, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  did clump a little, but I don&#x27;t know if it was the bleach or the developer I used.</li>
            <li> Used this last year after bleaching with some other brand and it helped even out the darker spots. So I went ahead and bought it again for this time. It left a lot of my hair still dark and only light close to the roots. I left it on for about 45 mins with a 30 vol developer but that didn&#x27;t do the trick. Still like the product but it didn&#x27;t work the way I wanted.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve used this product before and I like this product. My hair didn&#x27;t come out orangey or yellow and my hair is naturally black.</li>
            <li> This is my bleach of choice.  7 level lift is most definitely what I need!  It doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell, it doesn&#x27;t burn, and it works wonders.  I use this with 30vol developer.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> it did it&#x27;s job and it did it very well. i was skeptical because i have ethnic hair and its very dark, but it lightened my hair perfect.</li>
            <li> Always works, super fast and with relatively low damage to the hair. May be cheaper at your local Sally&#x27;s, though.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Frosty platinum.</li>
            <li> I used this to bleach my hair to a pale yellow that was suitable for toning, I have dark/medium brown hair, and it did just that IN ONLY ONE BLEACHING!! And it even made some true white blonde naturally. I used the l&#x27;oreal 30 volume cream developer, and it worked very well, I am very happy, and kind of surprised.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves using this product.</li>
            <li> It worked amazingly, it took a while to bleach my thick dark brown hair but it did so beautifully with no brassy color, I do recommend getting more than 1 or 2 packets if you have long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bleach for a while now. I have medium brown hair, and with a 30 volume developer, this gets the job done. I usually only keep it on for about 15 minutes, and my hair is always light enough to dye purple, which is the goal.</li>
            <li> loved it, but i didnt read how to use it so i didnt get the color i wanted</li>
            <li> I want to start with I never review items, I have been coloring and bleaching&lt;br /&gt;my hair for 13 years, many times going from black to blonde. I used&lt;br /&gt;this product and within 10min my scalp was burning and after washing&lt;br /&gt;it out now have 3 chemical burns from thus bleach, be careful it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;work and now I am in pain with orange and tiger strip blonde hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just blue tinted bleach, what more could you ask for? Took out the orange tones from my hair just fine!</li>
            <li> it lifts your hair pretty well but it damaged my hair badly and ive been doing blonde on my short hair for about 6 years only bleaching regrowth and this made my hair feel like ramen noodes which is not good!</li>
            <li> it is a very very good bleach, is easy to use and powerful, if i have to use it again i will buy the biiigggg one, it is tiny for all the hair i have.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery…♡</li>
