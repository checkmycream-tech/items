            <li>AWESOME PROTECTION BUYING MORE MUST LEAVE ON YOUR FACE 15 MINS BEFORE GOING OUT IN THE SUN</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen i think is best cause it contains zinc oxide.  </li>

            <li>Gives good coverage.</li>
            <li>The product is good</li>
            <li>but hopefully not so good that you will raise the price because you think everyone will buy it anyway.</li>
            <li>so I need a good sunblock.</li>
            <li>This is a good one</li>
            <li>On time, good price, will order again.</li>
            <li>This works just as good as the one I got for $$$$ from my dermatologist.</li>

            <li>Better stil. .</li>

            <li>Love that this sunscreen does not feel oily.</li>
            <li>I LOVE OBAGI</li>
            <li>I ordered goods on 11/5 and was scheduled to deliver to my friend&#x27;s house on 15/5 at the latest.</li>
            <li>LOVE this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>and I love the feel of Sun Shield Matte 50++ on my skin.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on easily on top of it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite sun screen for my face.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love this sun shield because:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this brand of sun screen.  </li>
            <li>So many sun screens are greasy but this is not at all.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy to add this item to my daily Obagi regimen.</li>
            <li>been my favorite.</li>
            <li>, my days in the sun have been many.  </li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I first got a travel size of this sunscreen and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I like how easy i can apply it and it stays on most of the day.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it keeps the sunspots I&#x27;ve bleached over the winter at bay all summer.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, smooth light texture...love it!  </li>
            <li>I love the matte finish that provides a smooth look.</li>
            <li>I used this on my trip to Mexico and it went on easy and was not sticky.</li>
            <li>I use it on my kids, their caramel complexion and they get sun burns easily.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it also comes off easily when you sweat or get water on your face</li>
            <li>Never bothers your eyes, strong protection, goes on well.</li>
            <li>Everything fine.</li>
            <li>Smooth, fragrance free and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This broad spectrum high SPF sunscreen is the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful (fingers crossed - not really superstitous) and so far after six months of use, I&#x27;m cancer free!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light in feeling.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and helps me feel protected in the sun.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that my skin has a fresh matte look to it.</li>
            <li>Great product that I have used for several years.  </li>
            <li>No break outs, no smell, just fabulous.</li>
            <li>Love that is isn&#x27;t shiny, which is rare in an SPF product of this strength.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to note, however, that it is not waterproof.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly over and under make up</li>
            <li>feels light.</li>
            <li>Fair skin and very blue eyes burn easily.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida and it&#x27;s 100% effective in our blistering summer climate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreen, this is bay far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is good but it leaves an oily white skin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.</li>
            <li>Would be better for someone with a much lighter skin tone.</li>
            <li>Arrive quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Received product quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly with no excess shine.  </li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen for daily use - its not oily and I use it as my moisturizer under makeup everyday- works great!  </li>
            <li>A great protection from dark spots from the sun.</li>
            <li>Right after you put it on your face, it quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Takes away the oiliness, gets completely absorbed by my skin, and does not leave any film or greyisch color on the skin.</li>
            <li>It is really worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>The only kind my wife will use.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I love this sun shield because it soaks into the skin and does not mess up my makeup when I add</li>
            <li>I would recommend for getting the right protection while bleaching under neath</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much fresher and clean.</li>
            <li>The one thing I have noticed during the dry summer it makes my skin feel very dry great for a climate with lots of humidity !!</li>
            <li>Wait a good five minutes before applying makeup over it as it will clump slightly - after that, though, its like nothing&#x27;s on your skin:</li>
            <li>It starts to dry/stick to my very fast</li>
            <li>This is a terrific product, and matte option makes it even better.  </li>
            <li>Product is the same as what I purchase from Dermatologist office at a much more manageable</li>
            <li>Have bought the regular of this product, but this is better.</li>
            <li>and/or smell that most facial sunscreens have.</li>
            <li>It really is matte!</li>
            <li>I love this product I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li>Obagi Sun Shield Matte SPF50 has been my daily sunscreen for many years.  </li>
            <li>Glad I finally tried it!!</li>
            <li>I think it does its job pretty well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I apply every day, more than once on long hikes.  </li>
            <li>Easily covered up with simple powder.</li>
            <li>My wife had previously used this product and liked it so much that she needed to re-order.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive, light skin and have been faithfully using Obaji sunscreen for over ten years.</li>
            <li>Recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li>so I have to be fast putting it on.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it goes on well</li>
            <li>, it blends in after a minute or two, and it really protects my face.</li>
            <li>Really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cream that spreads and disappears fastly which I use on my face before applying my make-up.  </li>
            <li>Real 5 star</li>
            <li>It has really helped protect my skin</li>
            <li>It works really, really well.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is much cheaper than buying in  spa or doctors office.</li>
            <li>And this sunscreen is reasonably priced as well.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only sun screen that I have found that will significantly reduce the oil practically all day.</li>
            <li>I find it keeps my skin pretty clear</li>
            <li>I just love the entire Obaji skincare line, especially the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>But like most sunscreens, it needs to be rubbed in well or it will leave white marks, especially on the hairline on the forehead.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, dries matte, is a high spf.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Who knew a matte high SPF sunscreen was even on the market?  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This goes on white BUT is a clean clear greaseless finish immediately.  </li>
            <li>Having trouble trusting that this is genuine!</li>
            <li>Since I live in a high altitude climate with lots of sun, I also wear a hat.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida where the sun is merciless and this sunscreen gives my skin the best protection of any sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>But I still need to go for walks, take the dogs to the park and live life.  </li>
            <li>This is a great daily facial sunscreen with physical blockers (I prefer to use physical blockers vs. chemical blockers because I don&#x27;t want my melasma and age spots to come back).  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have gone through LOTS of OTC brands all of which caused some sort of break out or reaction..</li>
            <li>Ive tried MANY sunscreens but this is the first sun lotion I&#x27;ve found that ticks all the boxes: broad spectrum, high SPF, matte not oily, blends into skin well not leaving a heavy white look and did not make my skin break out.</li>
            <li>the sun screen is kinda thick and scrapes off pretty easily</li>
            <li>My skin has dramatically improved and looks clear!</li>
            <li>Pretty non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t give that white zombie look.</li>
            <li>It gives the perfect base for makeup and is truly matte, even in high humidity.  </li>
            <li>Mona Young Lopez</li>
            <li>Good stuff, expensive though.</li>
            <li>Very painfull for a few days at first, then the release and pain have diminished ALOT.</li>
            <li>I use my eye cream firts, then on my fingers put a little bit of: obagi, my moisturizing cream and foundation, rub it all together then quickly pat it all over my face.</li>
            <li>It goes on a little white, but it absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I live in Hawaii  Not oily or drying  great base</li>
            <li>I checked other sites and this was posted for much moremoney.</li>
            <li>Also does not dry me out.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is really matte and works as an good make-up base.</li>
            <li>Every morning, I just spritz with my Polypeptide toner by Bioelements, let it dry then add my Clear, then apply my Sun Shield.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because there is some white pilling if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday, but know in summer I highly recommended, I live in PR and we have sun, all year long!</li>

            <li> This is a great product, I would say the best of its kind I ever used.</li>
            <li> AWESOME PROTECTION BUYING MORE MUST LEAVE ON YOUR FACE 15 MINS BEFORE GOING OUT IN THE SUN</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen i think is best cause it contains zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li> Price and delivery was good.</li>
            <li> Great efficient service, brilliantly effective cream</li>
            <li> Gives good coverage.</li>
            <li> The product is good</li>
            <li> but hopefully not so good that you will raise the price because you think everyone will buy it anyway.</li>
            <li> so I need a good sunblock.</li>
            <li> This is a good one</li>
            <li> On time, good price, will order again.</li>
            <li> This works just as good as the one I got for $$$$ from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> So good that I am ordering another for my mother.</li>
            <li> An all time favorite!</li>

            <li> I have tried many sunscreens and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Most amazing sunscreen I ever used.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is a perfect product.  </li>
            <li> This sun shield goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, fresh not stale.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I will sure recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it is genuine Obagi or a knock off!</li>
            <li> I really in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Better stil. .</li>
            <li> Makes me want to throw my Cetaphil ones in the garbage though I can&#x27;t afford to do that : )</li>
            <li> Love that this sunscreen does not feel oily.</li>
            <li> I LOVE OBAGI</li>
            <li> I ordered goods on 11/5 and was scheduled to deliver to my friend&#x27;s house on 15/5 at the latest.</li>
            <li> LOVE this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> and I love the feel of Sun Shield Matte 50++ on my skin.</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on easily on top of it.  </li>
            <li> My favorite sun screen for my face.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love this sun shield because:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this brand of sun screen.  </li>
            <li> So many sun screens are greasy but this is not at all.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy to add this item to my daily Obagi regimen.</li>
            <li> been my favorite.</li>
            <li> , my days in the sun have been many.  </li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> I first got a travel size of this sunscreen and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I like how easy i can apply it and it stays on most of the day.</li>
            <li> More importantly, it keeps the sunspots I&#x27;ve bleached over the winter at bay all summer.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, smooth light texture...love it!  </li>
            <li> I love the matte finish that provides a smooth look.</li>
            <li> I used this on my trip to Mexico and it went on easy and was not sticky.</li>
            <li> I use it on my kids, their caramel complexion and they get sun burns easily.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it also comes off easily when you sweat or get water on your face</li>
            <li> Never bothers your eyes, strong protection, goes on well.</li>
            <li> Everything fine.</li>
            <li> Smooth, fragrance free and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This broad spectrum high SPF sunscreen is the best on the market.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful (fingers crossed - not really superstitous) and so far after six months of use, I&#x27;m cancer free!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really light in feeling.</li>
            <li> It goes on light and helps me feel protected in the sun.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that my skin has a fresh matte look to it.</li>
            <li> Great product that I have used for several years.  </li>
            <li> No break outs, no smell, just fabulous.</li>
            <li> Love that is isn&#x27;t shiny, which is rare in an SPF product of this strength.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to note, however, that it is not waterproof.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly over and under make up</li>
            <li> feels light.</li>
            <li> Fair skin and very blue eyes burn easily.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida and it&#x27;s 100% effective in our blistering summer climate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreen, this is bay far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It is good but it leaves an oily white skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.</li>
            <li> Would be better for someone with a much lighter skin tone.</li>
            <li> Arrive quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Received product quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly with no excess shine.  </li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for daily use - its not oily and I use it as my moisturizer under makeup everyday- works great!  </li>
            <li> A great protection from dark spots from the sun.</li>
            <li> Right after you put it on your face, it quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Takes away the oiliness, gets completely absorbed by my skin, and does not leave any film or greyisch color on the skin.</li>
            <li> It is really worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> The only kind my wife will use.</li>
            <li> but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this sun shield because it soaks into the skin and does not mess up my makeup when I add</li>
            <li> I would recommend for getting the right protection while bleaching under neath</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much fresher and clean.</li>
            <li> The one thing I have noticed during the dry summer it makes my skin feel very dry great for a climate with lots of humidity !!</li>
            <li> Wait a good five minutes before applying makeup over it as it will clump slightly - after that, though, its like nothing&#x27;s on your skin:</li>
            <li> It starts to dry/stick to my very fast</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product, and matte option makes it even better.  </li>
            <li> Product is the same as what I purchase from Dermatologist office at a much more manageable</li>
            <li> Have bought the regular of this product, but this is better.</li>
            <li> and/or smell that most facial sunscreens have.</li>
            <li> It really is matte!</li>
            <li> I love this product I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li> Obagi Sun Shield Matte SPF50 has been my daily sunscreen for many years.  </li>
            <li> Glad I finally tried it!!</li>
            <li> I think it does its job pretty well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I apply every day, more than once on long hikes.  </li>
            <li> Easily covered up with simple powder.</li>
            <li> My wife had previously used this product and liked it so much that she needed to re-order.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive, light skin and have been faithfully using Obaji sunscreen for over ten years.</li>
            <li> Recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> so I have to be fast putting it on.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it goes on well</li>
            <li> , it blends in after a minute or two, and it really protects my face.</li>
            <li> Really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cream that spreads and disappears fastly which I use on my face before applying my make-up.  </li>
            <li> Real 5 star</li>
            <li> It has really helped protect my skin</li>
            <li> It works really, really well.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is much cheaper than buying in  spa or doctors office.</li>
            <li> And this sunscreen is reasonably priced as well.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only sun screen that I have found that will significantly reduce the oil practically all day.</li>
            <li> I find it keeps my skin pretty clear</li>
            <li> I just love the entire Obaji skincare line, especially the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> But like most sunscreens, it needs to be rubbed in well or it will leave white marks, especially on the hairline on the forehead.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, dries matte, is a high spf.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Who knew a matte high SPF sunscreen was even on the market?  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This goes on white BUT is a clean clear greaseless finish immediately.  </li>
            <li> Having trouble trusting that this is genuine!</li>
            <li> Since I live in a high altitude climate with lots of sun, I also wear a hat.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida where the sun is merciless and this sunscreen gives my skin the best protection of any sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> But I still need to go for walks, take the dogs to the park and live life.  </li>
            <li> This is a great daily facial sunscreen with physical blockers (I prefer to use physical blockers vs. chemical blockers because I don&#x27;t want my melasma and age spots to come back).  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have gone through LOTS of OTC brands all of which caused some sort of break out or reaction..</li>
            <li> Ive tried MANY sunscreens but this is the first sun lotion I&#x27;ve found that ticks all the boxes: broad spectrum, high SPF, matte not oily, blends into skin well not leaving a heavy white look and did not make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> the sun screen is kinda thick and scrapes off pretty easily</li>
            <li> My skin has dramatically improved and looks clear!</li>
            <li> Pretty non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t give that white zombie look.</li>
            <li> It gives the perfect base for makeup and is truly matte, even in high humidity.  </li>
            <li> Mona Young Lopez</li>
            <li> Good stuff, expensive though.</li>
            <li> Very painfull for a few days at first, then the release and pain have diminished ALOT.</li>
            <li> I use my eye cream firts, then on my fingers put a little bit of: obagi, my moisturizing cream and foundation, rub it all together then quickly pat it all over my face.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little white, but it absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I live in Hawaii  Not oily or drying  great base</li>
            <li> I checked other sites and this was posted for much moremoney.</li>
            <li> Also does not dry me out.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is really matte and works as an good make-up base.</li>
            <li> Every morning, I just spritz with my Polypeptide toner by Bioelements, let it dry then add my Clear, then apply my Sun Shield.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because there is some white pilling if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, but know in summer I highly recommended, I live in PR and we have sun, all year long!</li>
            <li> Also, I am very tan and this product does not leave me looking pale or white.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and usually use a mattifying primer.</li>
            <li> This will last a long time too.  </li>
            <li> This formula is thick and rich and a little bit is all that&#x27;s needed.  </li>
            <li> I occasionally buy other brands, but always come back to this one as it cannot be beat for effectiveness and comfort.</li>
            <li> You do not have to worry as you will be protected all day long, just reapply if you wash your face.  </li>
            <li> A little expensive, but it is not greasy like most sunscreen and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Now if your skin is dry this isnt the product for you.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, just as expected.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and keeps skin from getting red and dried out.</li>
            <li> Other sun blocks  </li>
            <li> This sun-screen works well with the other products I use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use my Matt 50 for every outdoor activity.. even workouts and long bike rides..  EVERYTHING and everyday.</li>
            <li> a little expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been very careful all my life not to get sunburned or tanned and frankly I do not tan just burn.  </li>
            <li> Most other sun shields if you sweat and it gets in your eyes---- bloody mercy!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish they they cost less.</li>
            <li> Previously used Shiseido</li>
            <li> The price was about half what I paid at my Dr&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a little thinner than what I recieved at doctor.</li>
            <li> so I use a little foundation for color.  </li>
            <li> I was a little weary of the price</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I only use Obagi products and was tired of driving a distance to pick up the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the greasy heavy feeling  </li>
            <li> I wear this everyday under my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I wear it everyday under my makeup.</li>
            <li> But they are wrong because it is the same as the ones I have purchased from the skin doctor.  </li>
            <li> Try not to put on too thick.  </li>
            <li> NO MORE DISTRESSED SKIN!</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars if it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t interfere with base makeup color or texture.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is good but it leaves an oily white skin.</li>
            <li> An all time favorite!</li>
            <li> Obagi sun  screen is the best. Also it moisturizes instead of drying. I live in Florida and it&#x27;s 100% effective in our blistering summer climate.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rub off and non greasyll. I use my eye cream firts, then on my fingers put a little bit of: obagi, my moisturizing cream and foundation, rub it all together then quickly pat it all over my face. It starts to dry/stick to my very fast so I have to be fast putting it on. Obagi is moist enough by this mix works for me from 6:30 am till 5 pm.</li>
            <li> Love this! Not greasy, dries matte, is a high spf. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.</li>
            <li> I just love the entire Obaji skincare line, especially the sunscreen. The weight of this sunscreen is perfect; never oily/shiny nor thick/pasty.

            <li> This is a terrific product, and matte option makes it even better.  I am extremely pleased with it.  I will sure recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works great. I use this under my makeup.  I have oily skin and this does not make my skin oily. It feels powdery and have a matte finish. It&#x27;s really light in feeling.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it goes on well, it blends in after a minute or two, and it really protects my face. Love it</li>
            <li> Great sun lotion. Ive tried MANY sunscreens but this is the first sun lotion I&#x27;ve found that ticks all the boxes: broad spectrum, high SPF, matte not oily, blends into skin well not leaving a heavy white look and did not make my skin break out. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Having trouble trusting that this is genuine! Seems greasier than the tube I purchased from my doctor! Don&#x27;t know if it is genuine Obagi or a knock off!</li>
            <li> I really in love with this product. I was looking for a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t show any greasiness or that shiny looking! I tried many brands, I got one from Dubai that made in France and many products, but no luck! Some of them my pores which caused breakouts, but this product is matte, no one can tell if you are wearing it or not and this is the best part of it, plus it protect you from the sun!</li>
            <li> It goes on light and helps me feel protected in the sun.</li>
            <li> Everything fine. Arrive quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that won&#x27;t irritate skin.  Better stil. . .it won&#x27;t clog your pores!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for daily use - its not oily and I use it as my moisturizer under makeup everyday- works great!  My Husband even likes it and when he goes fishing he steals mine!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreen, this is bay far my favorite. I wish they they cost less. A bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Price and delivery was good.</li>
            <li> Most amazing sunscreen I ever used. Makes me want to throw my Cetaphil ones in the garbage though I can&#x27;t afford to do that : )</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fresh not stale. Product is the same as what I purchase from Dermatologist office at a much more manageable price.&lt;br /&gt;Received product quickly.</li>
            <li> Great efficient service, brilliantly effective cream</li>
            <li> Best price ever. I checked other sites and this was posted for much moremoney. This peoduct never leaves your face looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I only use Obagi products and was tired of driving a distance to pick up the sunscreen.  People had told me not to order on line because the product would not be the same.  But they are wrong because it is the same as the ones I have purchased from the skin doctor.  I will always order on line now.  Wish I would have known about this product when I was in my thirties.</li>
            <li> I have been very careful all my life not to get sunburned or tanned and frankly I do not tan just burn.  Fair skin and very blue eyes burn easily.  But I still need to go for walks, take the dogs to the park and live life.  This is a wonderful product, has a matte finish and my foundation goes over it well.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever. Wait a good five minutes before applying makeup over it as it will clump slightly - after that, though, its like nothing&#x27;s on your skin: no shine, no unnatural matte look, just invisible. More importantly, it keeps the sunspots I&#x27;ve bleached over the winter at bay all summer. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Best product for sun protection I&#x27;ve ever used!!!! Be prepared for a non greasy feeling of protection. I love it!</li>
            <li> Living in AZ, who needs to put sunscreen on my face every day. I love this!.  Have bought the regular of this product, but this is better. Easily covered up with simple powder. My daughter even likes this. Going to order another tube, as my daughter has hijacked mine.</li>
            <li> Love that this sunscreen does not feel oily. Right after you put it on your face, it quickly absorbs. Gives good coverage. I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that my skin has a fresh matte look to it. I have tan oily/combo skin. I have been on the Obagi NuDerm program since May and my face requires alot or sun protection. Every night I use Blender and 1% Retin-A. I wash with Clinique liquid soap for All skin types. Every morning, I just spritz with my Polypeptide toner by Bioelements, let it dry then add my Clear, then apply my Sun Shield. My skin looks so much fresher and clean. My skin has dramatically improved and looks clear! Spots and imperfections are vanishing. NO MORE DISTRESSED SKIN! I LOVE OBAGI AND HOW IT HAS TRANSFORMED MY SKIN!!!</li>
            <li> Good product! Dose the job</li>
            <li> Great product that I have used for several years.  I buy it in the matte finish and use it only on my face and neck.  Other sun blocks  leave a shiny or greasy feel for me.  This one does not and you can then put your finishing make-up on immediately.  No break outs, no smell, just fabulous.</li>
            <li> I mix this sunscreen with my Murad oil control moisturizer, and it is perfect. I have oily skin, and this combination works great. Takes away the oiliness, gets completely absorbed by my skin, and does not leave any film or greyisch color on the skin. Really like this sunscreen. I don&#x27;t like the greasy heavy feeling  and/or smell that most facial sunscreens have. With this one you don&#x27;t feel anything is on your skin.</li>
            <li> After finding out that I had basal cell cancer on my face, my son told me about this wonderful product - Obagi.  It&#x27;s a cream that spreads and disappears fastly which I use on my face before applying my make-up.  It&#x27;s wonderful (fingers crossed - not really superstitous) and so far after six months of use, I&#x27;m cancer free!!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is really matte and works as an good make-up base. But it leaves a white cast on my face (I am medium-Tan). Would be better for someone with a much lighter skin tone.</li>
            <li> AWESOME PROTECTION BUYING MORE MUST LEAVE ON YOUR FACE 15 MINS BEFORE GOING OUT IN THE SUN&lt;br /&gt;AND MUST RE APPLY</li>
            <li> The best product in this category! Real 5 star</li>
            <li> It really is matte! I have very oily skin and usually use a mattifying primer. This product works as a sunscreen and also soaks up oil on my nose and chin - no need for the primer now.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this product I can&#x27;t say enough about it. Recommend it very highly. All of the Obagi product that I have used are great.</li>
            <li> This is a great daily facial sunscreen with physical blockers (I prefer to use physical blockers vs. chemical blockers because I don&#x27;t want my melasma and age spots to come back).  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because there is some white pilling if I&#x27;m not careful. Because of this, I currently am using another brand (Elta MD).</li>
            <li> My wife had previously used this product and liked it so much that she needed to re-order.  The product is good but hopefully not so good that you will raise the price because you think everyone will buy it anyway.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY sun blocking product I will use.  No smell of the over counter sun blocks.  I can reapply over makeup without a problem.  It is really worth every cent.  You want to delay the onset of wrinkles?  Get this product.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, but know in summer I highly recommended, I live in PR and we have sun, all year long! Since in Matte docent feels greasy...is like wearing nothing, but you  know you are protected!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product. Love that is isn&#x27;t shiny, which is rare in an SPF product of this strength. Would give it 5 stars if it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> Goods was not delivered in time as scheduled. I ordered goods on 11/5 and was scheduled to deliver to my friend&#x27;s house on 15/5 at the latest. However my friend received goods on 30/5. I don&#x27;t like to use this membership anymore. My account has been charged for a membership fee at USD 99 yesterday. Why do I have to pay for service not making me to satisfy. I want to stop membership and receive a refund.</li>
            <li> I wear this everyday under my makeup.  It has really helped protect my skin and I can see a big difference in tone and my complexion.</li>
            <li> I used this on my trip to Mexico and it went on easy and was not sticky. The no smell makes it perfect since I react to perfume with a rash. I have tried many sunscreens and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> LOVE this sunscreen.  Does not irritate my skin or make my make-up run.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great protection from sun.  Goes on well.  Does not leave white residue nor is it oily.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it on my kids, their caramel complexion and they get sun burns easily.  It works really, really well.</li>
            <li> This sun-screen works well with the other products I use.&lt;br /&gt;Atomy skin care, then Obagi sun shield, then Missha BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;Everything stays in place even in summer, all day.</li>
            <li> This was a God sent for my entire back.Very painfull for a few days at first, then the release and pain have diminished ALOT.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note, however, that it is not waterproof.</li>
            <li> Always order Obagi products from Amazon.  Obagi Sun Shield Matte SPF50 has been my daily sunscreen for many years.  I find it keeps my skin pretty clear and I am a lap swimmer.  I do use Obagi  on my face every day whether it is sunny or cloudy.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily per my dermatologist&#x27;s suggestion.  (I have had skin cancers.)  Mona Young Lopez</li>
            <li> Very good product, no oily residues and excellent protection.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, smooth light texture...love it!  Previously used Shiseido but like this one much better!  Glad I finally tried it!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, expensive though. Doesn&#x27;t make my face break out. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Obaji products are great products no doubt. I bought this cream because my Estitichian puts it on me after every microdermabrasion treatment. I suffer from hyper pigmentation so I need a good sunblock. This is a good one but I only use it during the day because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; lotion. I like to use an oil based cream at night to offset the drier Obaji cream.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is SPF 50, yet not oily at all! I would recommend it. But like most sunscreens, it needs to be rubbed in well or it will leave white marks, especially on the hairline on the forehead. I think it does its job pretty well.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, just as expected. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> This goes on white BUT is a clean clear greaseless finish immediately.  It provides a wonderful shield against the sun even at the equator snorkeling and diving.  I love it!</li>
            <li> love it!!!! im combination and it doesn&#x27;t make me have brake outs. Now if your skin is dry this isnt the product for you. I am an esthetician take my word. Also, I am very tan and this product does not leave me looking pale or white. It has a texture of almost a gel so it doesn&#x27;t leave you looking oily.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and keeps skin from getting red and dried out.Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> The price was about half what I paid at my Dr&#x27;s office. Very good sun screen</li>
            <li> This is some great sunscreen. The only kind my wife will use. Pretty non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t give that white zombie look. a little expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I like it, just a bit heavy.&lt;br /&gt;But for being 50 SPF, it works well.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have been using  Obagi Products for several years now and I love the feel of Sun Shield Matte 50++ on my skin. Great protection, not greasy and works well under make up.  I have very sensitive skin and have gone through LOTS of OTC brands all of which caused some sort of break out or reaction.. I use my Matt 50 for every outdoor activity.. even workouts and long bike rides..  EVERYTHING and everyday. Love it!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does not feel greasy or oily. It goes on a little white, but it absorbs into the skin quickly.  Makeup goes on easily on top of it.  Helps keep my oily t-zone in check throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is much cheaper than buying in  spa or doctors office. It seems to work great! My face does not burn. The consistency is a little thinner than what I recieved at doctor. Will order again.</li>
            <li> The best: blends in nicely, lasts well, doesn&#x27;t sting eyes.</li>
            <li> My favorite sun screen for my face.  I use it daily!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin so I have a problem with sunscreen clogging my pores; this sunscreen does not. I can have it on for several hours and my skin will not feel or look oily.</li>
            <li> This sun shield goes on very smoothly.  I have an olive complexion so I use a little foundation for color.  Blends beautifully.  A great protection from dark spots from the sun.</li>
            <li> the sun screen is kinda thick and scrapes off pretty easily&lt;br /&gt;it also comes off easily when you sweat or get water on your face</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen for the face, ever.  Not greasy, no odor and absorbs perfectly under your makeup.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen. It has a great matte finish.  It absorbs quickly with no excess shine.  Works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I would say the best of its kind I ever used. Personally, I stick to it.</li>
            <li> I love this sun shield because it soaks into the skin and does not mess up my makeup when I add&lt;br /&gt;that over the sun shield.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I like that my face isn&#x27;t all shiny. This new matte sunblock is great! It glides on smoothly over and under make up</li>
            <li> Part of my facial routine recommended by my skin specialist.</li>
            <li> the only sunscreen I use and I live in Hawaii  Not oily or drying  great base</li>
            <li> Love this sun shield because:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s matte meaning not looking greasy all day&lt;br /&gt;2. If I sweat after running, never burns my eyes. Most other sun shields if you sweat and it gets in your eyes---- bloody mercy!&lt;br /&gt;3. SPF 50, perfect for PA weather&lt;br /&gt;4. Smooth, fragrance free and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most definitely will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best sunscreen for the face. It&#x27;s not greasy and works well under make-up.</li>
            <li> I love the matte finish that provides a smooth look. I would recommend for getting the right protection while bleaching under neath</li>
            <li> On time, good price, will order again.</li>
            <li> Never bothers your eyes, strong protection, goes on well. I don&#x27;t use anything else bcse this works so well. Love it</li>
            <li> I was a little weary of the price but it is well worth it. Its not greasy and I stay Matte all day. I can be out all day in the sun and my face wont burn.</li>
            <li> My fave sunscreen. Ever. The only one that does not make me breakout or go grease ball on me ten minutes after I walk outside in our southern summer. Also does not dry me out. Perfection!!!  This works just as good as the one I got for $$$$ from my dermatologist. Good buy!</li>
            <li> I love this brand of sun screen.  So many sun screens are greasy but this is not at all.  I wear it every day underneath makeup.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to add this item to my daily Obagi regimen. So good that I am ordering another for my mother. Shipment came in on time as well.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but it is not greasy like most sunscreen and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  I wear it everyday under my makeup.</li>
            <li> not cakey. feels light. smell can be improved though. Does feel like I&#x27;m applying some medicine on my skin.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen totally blocks the sun which is what I wanted.  Some people complain about the whiteness of the lotion but it you work it between your fingers before applying, it covers and does not look white.  I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is great!!  If you don&#x27;t buy this product just please wear sunscreen daily!!!  Best anti aging item you can invest in.  The one thing I have noticed during the dry summer it makes my skin feel very dry great for a climate with lots of humidity !!</li>
            <li> its become by best friend.  I like how easy i can apply it and it stays on most of the day.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this is the only sun screen that I have found that will significantly reduce the oil practically all day. My foundation (MAC) still looks great.</li>
            <li> This broad spectrum high SPF sunscreen is the best on the market.  You do not have to worry as you will be protected all day long, just reapply if you wash your face.  It doesn&#x27;t interfere with base makeup color or texture.  Apply last, after face cream etc. but before foundation.  Use on neck and chest.  Its matte finish makes it undetectable.</li>
            <li> Consistently great product and excellent sun protection coverage!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good cream  does not leave your face white like the cream that has zinc in it .</li>
            <li> I apply every day, more than once on long hikes.  Works great.  I apply to face and hands, 365 days per year.</li>
            <li> Works.  No allergy or outbreak problem.  This is my daily sun screen.  Try not to put on too thick.  I have tried them all and this&lt;br /&gt;has been my favorite. Raised in southern CA., my days in the sun have been many.  Since I live in a high altitude climate with lots of sun, I also wear a hat.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen i think is best cause it contains zinc oxide.  Since i havee been using it i get compliments about my skin, love im runnin out i need to order another one.</li>
            <li> Broke skin out a bit despite claim.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida where the sun is merciless and this sunscreen gives my skin the best protection of any sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  This formula is thick and rich and a little bit is all that&#x27;s needed.  It absorbs in under a minute and the finish is truly matte.  I have oily skin and in the winter I use this sunscreen mixed with moisturizer.  In the summer, I use it alone.  It gives the perfect base for makeup and is truly matte, even in high humidity.  There&#x27;s no need to use a greasy sunscreen when something as great as Obagi exists.  For all those people who need a matte product, look no further.  And this sunscreen is reasonably priced as well.  I first got a travel size of this sunscreen and loved it.  Who knew a matte high SPF sunscreen was even on the market?  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is a perfect product.  For those with oily skin, it is a godsend.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
