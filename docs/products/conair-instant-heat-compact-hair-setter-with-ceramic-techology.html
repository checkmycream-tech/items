            <li>I love this set!  </li>
            <li>Just the perfect accessory for the hot roller travelers</li>
            <li>Love that I can pack them!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and curls are very good</li>
            <li>These are so compact, heat up very quickly and create a great curl and a lot of body and bounce.  </li>
            <li>Packs easily, works great.  </li>
            <li>These work great, travel well and are compact but still get hot and do a great job on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and it does provide great results.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and gives great curls.  </li>
            <li>More importantly it works...makes nice curls!!</li>
            <li>They work best if not overloaded with too large an amount of hair, trial and error</li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>fantastic, I am realy happy</li>
            <li>These rollers have a neat shape, are smooth, and work great.</li>
            <li>Even after I let them warm up for an hour and after that I could hold the rollers in my palm without even burning my hand.</li>
            <li>Thrilled with the way they curl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for months (when I travel) and it still heats up really nicely (takes about 10 minutes).  </li>
            <li>and it got barely warm.</li>
            <li>So I just have a nice, curly, 1950&#x27;s sock-hop pony tail look when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>It makes nice curls.</li>
            <li>I liked them so well that I use them at home now.  </li>
            <li>Each curler has it&#x27; own pin to match.  </li>
            <li>Nice compact design.  </li>
            <li>However, for the price, I liked the size and decided to try again.  </li>
            <li>Nice to travel with.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t warm up evenly.  </li>
            <li>Zippered top is superior to the velcro-held flap of some sets, so the clips don&#x27;t get lost in your travels.</li>
            <li>Heat fast and work great!  </li>
            <li>The clips are kind of tricky to use.</li>
            <li>They are nicely compact for use on travel vacations.</li>
            <li>Nice rollers.  </li>
            <li>Nice bag.  </li>
            <li>Nice concept.  </li>
            <li>These hold the rollers in place nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Travel Pouch: They&#x27;re both nice and compact.</li>
            <li>Nice set of rollers for travel/works well for mid-length to shorter hair.</li>
            <li>This is a nice compact set of rollers.  </li>
            <li>Nice, compact set, recommended.</li>
            <li>But these were just perfect... easy easy easy to use, and even as a beginner</li>
            <li>I wish I could give this product a stellar review, as the unit is compact and ideal for travel.</li>
            <li>The rollers are a good size, the clips secure effectively, and the unit is a compact size to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and produce great curls.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, styles nicely, great value.</li>
            <li>Very easy to take out, no pull on any strands of hair.  </li>
            <li>The clips are very easy to work with.</li>
            <li>However, they do tangle very easily.</li>
            <li>It  was a very easy way of buying just what I wanted</li>
            <li>Makes things VERY easy in the morning.</li>
            <li>Love love these!</li>
            <li>Compact size is great and they heat up very fast!</li>
            <li>The size of this set is great for travel and convenience, but the rollers do not get very hot and do nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>This heats up in minutes which is perfect for my busy schedule.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked 2 more curlers but got by with the 12.</li>
            <li>Honestly, my sneakers take up more room than</li>
            <li>but I do not get any kind of meaningful</li>
            <li>My style lasts all day and I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>considering I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>So easy to travel with!  </li>
            <li>Lightweight and soft-sides make it easy to pack!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love these!</li>
            <li>The curlers worked great and it was really nice to be able to take them and not use up so much space in my suitcase!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better heated rollers before, but if you&#x27;re in need of something cheap and fairly functional, they do the trick.</li>
            <li>This roller set is a nice compact set perfect to throw in your suitcase, but has a big issue.  </li>
            <li>and I was pretty happy with them.  </li>
            <li>These hot rollers work great.  </li>
            <li>These were great at first.</li>
            <li>All the way until the curler gets cool, is a good rule of thumb.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size for travel; they do a great job on my hair in very little time.  </li>
            <li>Product heats up quickly and produces a good curl.</li>
            <li>They heat quickly and do a good job.</li>
            <li>Compact and rollers get nice and hot for a good curl.</li>
            <li>They heat up relatively quickly and it&#x27;s great they fit so well into a packed suitcase.</li>
            <li>Ratings are accurate!</li>
            <li>Love the compact size.</li>
            <li>Hoping that is just part of the learning curve and with more use and familiarity of the item, I can eliminate that.</li>
            <li>Much better than another brand I bought.</li>
            <li>I totally love these.  </li>
            <li>but i got something that works better for think wavy hair that I am trying to make  shine.</li>
            <li>and so I think will be better for travel.  </li>
            <li>On the second day my hair will be wavy and it still looks awesome.</li>
            <li>Just like the one before it that lasted many years.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these rollers a couple of weeks ago and love them.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have many choices.&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>These grip better and curl better than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Love the size.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for a replacement that heats better and provides better curling.</li>
            <li>I love this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>and I was so pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have to find better clips, the pin-like ones, but I&#x27;m worried they won&#x27;t hold since they don&#x27;t come with the rollers.</li>
            <li>Just be sure they are connected to the heating element on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Love them and plan to keep them until they wear out.</li>
            <li>I love the curlers.  </li>
            <li>am really glad I did.</li>
            <li>I thought being the brand as well known it would be ok to order on line</li>
            <li>but it is most unsatisfactory.  </li>
            <li>I just wish there were more of them.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be okay.  </li>
            <li>They are not the smooth kind</li>
            <li>The size and number of rollers are perfect for my travel, but the rollers have not yet heated up enough for me - still contemplating whether or not to return.</li>
            <li>So, I use these most of the time at home now, not just for traveling.  </li>
            <li>These curlers work ok.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>Wish it came with more curlers..</li>
            <li>but overall, it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li>I decided to try these after shopping around and reading many reviews.</li>
            <li>I love the size of the rollers.</li>
            <li>it is ok....</li>
            <li>for the money  ii&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>That is the measurement of the top.  </li>
            <li>it is a great choice when you have a short time and need gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li>I read soooo many reviews before I settled on buying these.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>love how compact the box is and yet everything you need is there.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>Perfect name for this product -- instant heat and compact!</li>
            <li>Great product -- can&#x27;t say enough good things.  </li>
            <li>and love the case.</li>
            <li>Better than hoped.</li>
            <li>I liked these curlers initially, and thought that they would be ideal for traveling, since the set is compact.  </li>
            <li>Love these curlers.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>they are OK, but I am still looking for good powerful travel curlers.</li>
            <li>so glad I got them.</li>
            <li>The price is award winning too :-)</li>
            <li>WAS setting my hair with velcro rollers after a shower, and that worked much better.</li>
            <li>I feel they have a better grip than the ones they come with.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s compact</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s the case, just put more hair on the curler.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need three more rollers, but I&#x27;ll use a curling iron as well</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more curls and pizzazz, but the curls were just sort of...limp.  </li>
            <li>I am learning how to use this things, but i love the way it make my hair look and</li>
            <li>/&gt;even better.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>This product is a great and economic purchase which allows curl to be added to your styl.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package, there was an order form for getting more rollers, which I may do.  </li>
            <li>I had read the reviews to push the curlers into the base--and the instructions said to close the top when heating.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to buy more.</li>
            <li>The unit has held up across many trips.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>My curls didn&#x27;t hold up for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>The are compact and most efficient.  </li>
            <li>I am a beginner when it comes to using hot rollers &amp; these have turned out to be a perfect first set.</li>
            <li>but i blame that more on me than the product.</li>
            <li>They are light for packing &amp; travel!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this set.</li>
            <li>This is more intended for pack and travel....very cute.</li>
            <li>but it works ok.  </li>
            <li>Love this item--so compact, so efficient</li>
            <li>My kids thought I looked hilarious.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it takes a minute or more to untangle a roller.</li>
            <li>They are fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I just love them.  </li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with these rollers.</li>
            <li>Wanted to love these rollers but just couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and I already love them.  </li>
            <li>Overall, excellent!</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to a more compact set.  </li>
            <li>It was thicker and seemed more durable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this set and would buy again in a heartbeat if it dies.</li>
            <li>I really love these rollers.  </li>
            <li>Really love these curlers.  </li>
            <li>These would probably be better for shorter hair.</li>
            <li>Tried many times and still couldn&#x27;t clip my hair on the rollers.</li>
            <li>If you have thicker or coarser hair, perhaps this may be a better tool.</li>
            <li>I just ordered clips to see if rollers stay in better.</li>
            <li>so glad I tried them :)</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t curl all the way to the roots, mostly just the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li>It was the right size, light weight and worked great.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, compact unit, heats quickly and provides the kind of smooth ends and curl that I am looking for.</li>
            <li>super love the curls!</li>
            <li>It is very light and easy to pack but took forever to heat up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, very light in weight to carry.</li>
            <li>The clips do a pretty good job of holding the rollers in my hair.</li>
            <li>nice full bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li>They really work wonderfully, and I am so happy I decided to get these over any other travel size out there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excited!</li>
            <li>They heat up quick and store away nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These heat up quickly, and curl nicely.</li>
            <li>I love how compact the case is and easy for travel.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little cube of curlers and they are just the perfect hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might not all be &#x27;fresh&#x27; but hair products are ok from them!</li>
            <li>It might not all be &#x27;fresh&#x27; but hair products are ok from them!</li>
            <li>Also, it would have helped to have maybe 2 or 3 more rollers to fit all of my hair.</li>
            <li>THE reliable hot roller~ with nice gripping</li>
            <li>I was very impressed by the compact size and shape as it fits nicely into my small suitcase.</li>
            <li>First curlers, very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking at buying smooth rollers to see if that works better.</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy this cute curling system.</li>
            <li>Good quality product and my wife is very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>I bought this hairsetter for travel and loved it so much that I bought another one to use at home.</li>
            <li>These curlers work really good and heat up really fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good concept but didn&#x27;t really give me the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li>so purchased another set since I loved them so much.</li>
            <li>Good quality, very compact and&lt;br</li>

            <li>Awesome ... bought it for traveling due to</li>
            <li>Heats up quick and the curlers are easy to handle!</li>
            <li>I read many reviews of many many hot rollers before deciding on this one.</li>
            <li>Great to get back to hot rollers...much better for my hair and styles better!  </li>
            <li>easy to use, but not for me</li>
            <li>-one set completes hair  -easy to pack  DISLIKES:  </li>
            <li>I have always liked the metal holders better than all the newer style ones as they leave no ridges and keep the curler in place really snugly.</li>
            <li>The rollers have no rubbery feel which helped rolling my hair easy with another set I owned.</li>
            <li>and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience using hot rollers and I will say that they work great.  </li>
            <li>so it was easy to pack in my luggage.  </li>
            <li>You can easily curl the left-out ends after that.</li>

            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The clips are easy to use and they don&#x27;t leave clip marks or dents.</li>

            <li>Lightweight thus easy to carry.</li>
            <li>works great,  very small and compact-love it,  also great for travel</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty amazing</li>
            <li>i put the curlers on, do my make up, and after 20 minutes, i have beautiful curls that last all day!  </li>
            <li>Work well, grip the hair well without pulling, and get nice and hot.  </li>
            <li>My handy, residential electrical engineer tried to fix my first one with a blown fuse.  </li>
            <li>They are equally as warm as the first and don&#x27;t curl.  </li>
            <li>Some curlers were extremely hot and some were barley warm.</li>
            <li>I give this 4 stars because they are super compact, heat up quickly and look nice.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and put a nice curl to my hair rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Excellent, in a few minutes you have a wonderful  hair stile, they are easy to put on and they dont fall like other brand</li>
            <li>The pins work fine</li>
            <li>Cord is now attached which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li>I thought I might have a problem with the clips, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li>and it is working fine.</li>
            <li>these work fine</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my mom who has fine hair but a ton of it</li>
            <li>It is light and easy to transport which is why i bought it.</li>
            <li>Just my experience, don&#x27;t care for the type of curl for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>They will probably work fine.  </li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>I am growing out layered hair, and my hair is fairly fine.  </li>
            <li>and I am fine with these.</li>
            <li>and they worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does a fabulous job in creating curls.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to sell them to a friend</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly!</li>
            <li>The rollers are adequate for what I need; I just wish the curls were more long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Order did arrive quickly and were packaged appropriately.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised that they got as good of reviews as they did.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if I wanted a tight curl, these would be awesome.</li>
            <li>The compact size is going to fit in my suitcase just fine.  </li>
            <li>It does heat up nicely and it certainly does what it says it does.</li>
            <li>These are the best little set of rollers I&#x27;ve ever used ....</li>
            <li>The curlers stayed in just fine and are easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is portable, compact and light to carry for her.</li>
            <li>I still prefer them to a curling iron for travel, electric rollers seem to smooth out the frizz in my hair.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, I needed something to get a USB extension cable up over $25 for free shipping</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on my first use of the set, I feel it gives me what I was looking for: nice full waves and smooth, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>Fortunately - had my \\&quot;old\\&quot; con-air clips that worked.  </li>
            <li>These would be great for short hair.</li>
            <li>The case is really fantastic, keep everything in place.</li>
            <li>They work great even though they are smaller.  </li>
            <li>The pins to hold them in place are cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>I guess you get what you pay for and the cost being so cheap</li>
            <li>also delivers cheap results.</li>
            <li>I like the compact size-it should fit in my suitcase without taking up a lot of room.</li>
            <li>I left them in for about 30 minutes and her hair looked great.  </li>
            <li>Extremely light weight</li>
            <li>only took about 10 minutes to heat up and they worked great.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect size, not too bulky or heavy.  </li>
            <li>It fit into my carry on bag.  </li>
            <li>This is a great starter for short to shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s as many as you get in many full size hot roller sets</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t know the difference between these and the smooth ones.</li>
            <li>: If done correctly these give great curls that last.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANTLY...</li>
            <li>My hair slid out of the roller before I could secure them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The curlers are a nice design, the clips work well, and overall I liked them.  </li>
            <li>Great compact travel curlers - they heat up fast and don&#x27;t take up much room in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li>This is just what I was looking for because I wanted more bigger rollers and the price was unbelievably good.</li>
            <li>I pack light, so each item I bring has to be worth the precious space in my carry-on bag.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use the right pins for the color of the curler rods.</li>
            <li>Listen, I don&#x27;t know what some other reviewers thought they were buying when they bought this set, but it works, it;s cheap, it;s well-made and incredibly convenient.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and is light and easy to carry in travel bag.</li>
            <li>but the unit heats up quickly and is easy to put away.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, are easy to use and take about 20 minutes to set.</li>
            <li>If you really want a good set, try a thermal setting spray, like Redken&#x27;s Hot Sets 22.</li>
            <li>These are a good value &amp;  if you have long hair they might work better than they did for me.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and easy to use.</li>
            <li>rollers heat up quickly, are easy to use and do not tangle the hair.</li>
            <li>I would really have liked about 3 more larger rollers, but then it wouldn&#x27;t be so nice and compact for traveling.</li>
            <li>just what I was after..great for traveling, take up very little space, and work great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple times and it heats up quickly in the zipper pouch, sets great, there are just enough rollers for what I need, and it&#x27;s compact.  </li>
            <li>These are a great product, and it&#x27;s difficult to find this style of roller in the market (and I&#x27;ve been shopping awhile), and it&#x27;s great to have 8 of the \\&quot;right size\\&quot; roller in a travel-size pack, and if one reads the directions (wink) then it really is better to follow the directions and leave the lid on while the rollers heat up so that they&#x27;ll heat up quicker.</li>
            <li>I know that the original purpose for these curlers was as a travelling set.  </li>
            <li>The case is small, perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li>They work great on my long hair.</li>
            <li>The pins hold the rollers and the curlers work great in my long hair.</li>
            <li>Very pleased and surprised by this set.  </li>
            <li>They have sales pretty often on many drug store, and some department store stuff.</li>
            <li>They have sales pretty often on many drug store, and some department store stuff.</li>
            <li>Like it,fast heating could be more hot.</li>
            <li>I just got these today, and bought them on the recommendation of the many people who reviewed them, after first asking a number of questions.</li>
            <li>I bought these for travel, but I love these curlers so much I&#x27;m now using them at home!  </li>
            <li>The size of the rollers are fine for my short hair and the heat is a good</li>
            <li>I love my other set, but thought I&#x27;d try this one to see if I liked it better.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest, there are better than my regular set</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations but let me tell you, I was so blown away by the how good my hair looked, even my husband was like WOW you should curl your hair more often.  </li>
            <li>The special &#x27;gripper teeth&#x27; on the curlers really do help hold the hair as you roll the curler, making these stay the most securely of any of the curler sets I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>The hot rollers are compact and fit easily in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li>they are super small and will be perfect for travel</li>
            <li>this is a good option for travel because you get more than the five jumbos in other travel cases.  </li>
            <li>I like it a lot better than my large set of Conair Ion shine curlers.</li>
            <li>but I wanted more large ones</li>
            <li>I love that they have 8 large rollers.</li>
            <li>The design is excellent, they get hot where they need to for curling, but there are little nubs on them that allow handling without getting my fingers burned.</li>
            <li>Second the curlers have teeth which I thought was great at first</li>
            <li>I bought the first one just for travel, but liked them so much</li>
            <li>It is good for traveling outside the US.</li>
            <li>I tried it 5 times and used different sprays to give it a good try.</li>
            <li>Everything about these rollers is great -- incredibly fast heat-up time, and they really curl your hair very well.  </li>
            <li>heat up is fast and the more you use them</li>
            <li>These heat up fast (they say two minutes, but I always give them five for more holding power).  </li>
            <li>Also, you need to leave them in for a good while if you want a solid curl.</li>
            <li>Much smaller than my last&lt;br /&gt;larger set and just as good.</li>
            <li>I get nice soft curls and body with the&lt;br /&gt;large rollers.  </li>
            <li>I am able to roll all of my hair on this set if I really push it</li>
            <li>If you really want to do your hair for the evening, you&#x27;re going to need something more.</li>
            <li>The curlers stay in so so - not bad -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good if you do not have the space to store the regular size one and need a quick curl every one in a while.</li>
            <li>If you heat them for ten min they&#x27;re good to go for a quick pick me up, heat them longer, the curl lasts longer.</li>
            <li>the plus side, I found that these rollers heated up quickly, and they gripped the hair well thanks to a combination of the combs on the rollers themselves and the included metal clips (although I would have preferred something a bit more updated--</li>
            <li>these wonderful little rollers give my hair an incredible bounce and curl, lots of compliments on my hair after using this product, easily to use heats up in minutes and is so small it is a pleasure to use, Highly recommend,</li>
            <li>Works really well, and is super light and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>I needed a compact set of hot rollers to trow in my suitcase for weekend trips and would heat up very quickly, and this product exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Make sure the curl is wound good and tight, to the roller or your scalp.</li>
            <li>I have a set of Conair rollers from 2008 that are flocked and work great, but the set only has 8 large rollers in it.</li>
            <li>great for foreign travel and cruise ships.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer of my other set was Remington and it was compact, did a great job with curling my hair</li>
            <li>I use them when I want super curly hair.  </li>
            <li>They do not heat up as quickly as I would like</li>
            <li>I did an almost perfect job, just by following the enclosed instructions (which were simple as pie).</li>
            <li>Shipping was super quick as always with Amazon.</li>
            <li>they heat up quickly and come with clips color coded.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and stay in my hair well.  </li>
            <li>The culers heat quickly.</li>
            <li>I have use many hot rollers and these are the first ones that just don&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li>Quick heating.  </li>
            <li>I returned these and bought the Conair Heatwaves set with the Jumbo-1 1/2&amp;#34; and Super Jumbo-1 3/4&#x27; rollers.</li>
            <li>They heated up quickly.  </li>
            <li>and they heat quickly.  </li>
            <li>they made my hair super curly..not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly.   </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t work for those of us that like jumbo and super jumbo rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick heat/ dual voltage.</li>
            <li>The curlers do an adequate job</li>
            <li>stars for quickly heating and cooling.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and the starter strip helps hold the hair to get the roller started.</li>
            <li>They are quick to heat up and use.  </li>
            <li>Curlers heat quickly and clips work well.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly.</li>
            <li>Small set, heat up quickly, great results, easy to travel with....</li>
            <li>I decided to give these a try...and they are compact, heat fairly quickly, and did a good job curling my long hair.</li>
            <li>It is very compact and light weight, and it does a great job as long as you take the time to do it right.  </li>
            <li>They get very hot</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>Other than that, It&#x27;s looks to be a nice product even though I wasn&#x27;t able to try it out.</li>
            <li>But I found that by experimenting with the length of time heating, and amount of time the curlers were left in the hair, the curls turned out great, and also held their curl much better than my regular electric curlers would do.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get very hot though.</li>
            <li>* Size - they are small and will be ideal in a suitcase&lt;</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t get very hot, they didn&#x27;t curly my hair</li>
            <li>That will give you curl for a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair that just touches my shoulders, and I like curling it once and awhile for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my new instant heat curlers - within two minutes they are well heated and was able to use.</li>
            <li>Replaced those with another travel Remington set (still working) &amp; bought these to have more large hot rollers.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, get nice and hot, and my hair has soft, bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li>Heats up super fast and leaves my normally impossible to curl pin straight hair with beautiful bouncy perfect curls!</li>
            <li>I am very surprised to learn that this unit heat up within 10 minutes!!!!</li>
            <li>Small and lightweight so fit great in carry on.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and is very compact.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Very lightweight &amp; easy to pack.</li>
            <li>It is also very compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Compact, easy to transport and very functional.</li>
            <li>Love these rollers they heat up fast, &amp; stay hot.</li>
            <li>They took 5 minutes to heat up, and even then weren&#x27;t hot enough to hold a good curl.</li>
            <li>It is very compact, easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>It does take a little more than the \\&quot;instant\\&quot; that is advertised by Conair, but it does heat up nicely in a shorter period of time than my full set of Clairol rollers.  </li>
            <li>even with the heat and humidity here, curls last for more than 10 hours!</li>
            <li>After that 5 minutes, they are really hot!  </li>
            <li>These hot rollers have saved my frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>Would prefer larger and even better if flocked!</li>
            <li>These are not the hot rollers your mother used!  </li>
            <li>Only became a mild warm just would not heat up.</li>
            <li>they heat right up quickly and the curl lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I have fine, long-ish hair and these curlers worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>These seem to be fine for what they are  -very compact.</li>
            <li>I bought it for traveling so it would fit in my luggage instead of dragging my large set</li>
            <li>Great little set to travel with.  </li>
            <li>Great compact rollers to take on the go with you and takes up a little room in your suitcase or bag.  </li>
            <li>These work great and take up so little room in my already cramped bathroom.</li>
            <li>This is a great little set.  </li>
            <li>This little hair setter is so compact and will be great for traveling.</li>
            <li>I was very reluctant to buy this at all, especially on line because like most women my hair is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really like these, easy to put in, don&#x27;t get super hot as some others do</li>
            <li>These are easy to wrap around the curler, quick to heat up, and leave a great long lasting wave.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s compact size and finally a unit with more than &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; large curlers in it (something I&#x27;ve been searching for years to find) -- however it provides such a great curl -- I&#x27;m using it exclusively now.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re neatly put together, compact and the clips secure the rollers very well.  </li>
            <li>But the size is amazing; it&#x27;s tiny!</li>
            <li>Our millionares who own the China plants, dont pay for quality, dont blame the Chinese for U.S. greed.  </li>
            <li>They need to be ordered separately but worth it to me.</li>
            <li>The problem I have with this set is that some of the rollers do not heat up correctly and others only get warm.  </li>
            <li>However, at this price, this is well worth it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re faster and hold better than my old clunky set.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a set of all larger rollers.  </li>
            <li>After placing the curlers, 15 minutes later I had a nice curl.  </li>
            <li>Had my old set for years...was so glad to see they still make these.  </li>
            <li>thought this was well worth the price</li>
            <li>Bought these for my daughter to use when traveling, easier than a curling iron, she absolutely loves them and wants more.</li>
            <li>The compact size is great for traveling, the soft case is easy to fit in a small suitcase.</li>
            <li>Very handy little kit.</li>
            <li>They heat up pretty fast and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Every electrical outlet works perfectly and other products work as they should, so obviously there is a defect in the product that I received.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is quick to heat but doesn&#x27;t get so hot that she can&#x27;t touch the curlers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I tried the quick method of hot rollers instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use the Conair Hot Roller Super Clips.</li>
            <li>Overall,this is a really great little set of hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>This item didn&#x27;t really heat up hot enough for me to get a good curl.  </li>
            <li>Of course using a flat iron at the roots, and lifting spray or some sort of super-hold- gel will help lift the root area really nicely.</li>
            <li>I did not buy the right size.</li>
            <li>I did like the rollers because they were just the right size and my hair stayed in them well .</li>
            <li>so everything stays right together.  </li>
            <li>right for someone on the go.</li>
            <li>Right number of rollers in each size.</li>
            <li>lips, the quantity is just right for my hair.</li>
            <li>have the rollers in my hair right now</li>
            <li>The pouch is the right size for home or travel.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for traveling</li>
            <li>When removing the Remington rollers, the rollers fall right out and the curl is shiny and in one piece.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did do my homework and feel I made the right chose.  </li>
            <li>Best money I have spent in a long time.</li>
            <li>I was surprised as I always use Conair hot curlers and love them.  </li>
            <li>But about a month in they stopped getting hot and would only get slightly warm.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note, they do heat up quickly.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, are pretty easy to roll (thanks to the extra strip of teeth on each roller) and the clips hold the rollers very well, even with my very fine, slippery hair.  </li>
            <li>Fekkai makes a great lifting spray, it is pricey, but it takes very little to just do the crown</li>
            <li>I had a great small travel set used 4 times a week for 10 plus years.</li>
            <li>Great for traveling or for a small space.</li>
            <li>It is small &amp; compact - works great.</li>
            <li>Great for travel, small and compact.</li>
            <li>In addition, they didn&#x27;t seem to grip my fine, straight hair very well.</li>
            <li>My regular ceramic hot rollers would have required a huge energy transformer to use, so I put them in storage and got these with the clips to make it easy.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, short to medium length hair and had no problems keeping these in my hair.  </li>
            <li>--it heats up quickly, it&#x27;s easy to use (no hot poles to burn your hand on as you reach for more rollers)</li>
            <li>This set of hot curlers is just right for me...</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and are reasonably price too.  </li>
            <li>The rollers did not get warm enough to really do anything for your hair.</li>
            <li>This set does not take up much counter space, and it heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Theses rollers heat up quickly and set your hair fast.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, are very compact and find I&#x27;m using them quite a bit at home to freshen my hair or change the look.</li>
            <li>My hair is longer on top and need a few more rollers.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and curls my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Rollers heat up SUPER fast</li>
            <li>I also own the  Conair Compact Hairsetter, Blue, but don&#x27;t like it nearly as much.  </li>
            <li>Mine runs slightly longer, but they still hold pretty good.</li>
            <li>hair is very straight and the combs on the rollers help to keep each section on the roller as I am turning the curler.  </li>
            <li>I like these rollers very much.  </li>
            <li>But, since the old rollers do not have dual voltage, are heavy, and bulky---this new set was a GREAT find!</li>
            <li>This little package of curlers takes up minimum space while supplying a fair amount of curlers.  </li>
            <li>Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count]] (also purchased on Amazon) b/c I wanted to not have to depend on the little metal clips; the super clips work really well, but there&#x27;s no place to store them which kind of defeats the purpose of having a travel size curlers, but if you like the wire clips, then you are all set.  </li>
            <li>I would have rated them higher if my first set hadn&#x27;t died a very, very premature death.</li>
            <li>They do not get hot at all and therefore do not work to curl your hair.</li>
            <li>expect them to work like hot rollers once made in the US, however.  </li>
            <li>I have a set of Clairol Hot Rollers from 1969 that I STILL use (no lie).  </li>
            <li>I have never used hot rollers before, and was apprehensive about having to do it for my sister&#x27;s wedding in a month.</li>
            <li>The rollers are hot on your fingers.</li>
            <li>Would love it though if I could find a set like this with eight rollers one size bigger.</li>
            <li>I love this item because it has enough curlers to finish all my hair</li>
            <li>I put away one of the heating elements and just insert a extras rollers into the heating element when i take one out, and its hot by the time I get to that roller.</li>
            <li>...mission accomplished!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been awhile since I used hot rollers and was hoping I could use these</li>
            <li>This hot roller set is dual voltage.</li>
            <li>And it is only $9 more).</li>
            <li>I ordered these compact hot rollers for a trip we are planning to the UK.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Conair hot rollers to replace a \\&quot;vintage\\&quot; set.  </li>
            <li>These got warm, but not really warm enough to make a good curl.</li>
            <li>It really did nothing!</li>
            <li>I searched the beauty supply stores and online and could not locate the exact size pins I needed.</li>
            <li>The only thing I am not too happy is the amount of rollers, should have at least a pair more, but I will manage.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t seem like they get hot</li>
            <li>I have to leave early in the morning to park for free in a parking garage before they start charging</li>
            <li>they could be a tad larger but are ok.</li>
            <li>say that I love them on a regular basis...</li>
            <li>I tried to use these when I first go them.</li>
            <li>Using hot rollers as opposed to a curling iron, my hair is fuller, curlier and softer.  </li>
            <li>but I think  some kind of light dampness is the key to lasting longer.</li>
            <li>but I think  some kind of light dampness is the key to lasting longer.</li>
            <li>I love this product and  I got a lot of compliments about my hair recently</li>
            <li>I used to have the hot rollers from years ago.  </li>
            <li>would recommend that you put a gel or mousse on your hair first that way the curl lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Great product, small and very packable.</li>
            <li>The hot rollers work well</li>
            <li>Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li>It is nice and small and fit well in my suitcase for travel.</li>
            <li>seems like it takes a while to heat up, sure isn&#x27;t instant like advertised.  </li>
            <li>The extra clipsI I purchased which were supposed be better also didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li>There is no way to know when the curlers are hot.  </li>
            <li>Used the product for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>The rollers get hot, yes - they have to to do their job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never had hot rollers</li>
            <li>Have used these numerous times and love them.  </li>
            <li>and my first impressions are how hot they didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time this a.m. ....</li>
            <li>pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So we searched &amp; searched for Dual Voltage hot rollers -</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading reviews for these curlers - I bought these hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>If they would have just heated up they would get a much higher review.</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t curl the way I&#x27;m used to hot rollers curling.  </li>
            <li>They never get truly hot and so the curl does not hold up well during the day.</li>
            <li>On top of that the curl lasts me a second day!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Handling: The Conair rollers were easier to handle and they didn&#x27;t seem to get as hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>I give a few minutes to get good and hot</li>
            <li>just about ten minutes, my hair is transformed into bouncy curls that I&#x27;ve never been able to have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like they get as hot as my full-size set</li>
            <li>Very Handy...great for travel!</li>
            <li>Rollers take about 10 minutes to get really hot.</li>
            <li>I revised this because, after contacting Conair customer service, they readily shipped a new type of clip, the pin-like ones, for free.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for travel and they really get hot.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the extra bonus, they curlers are super light weight and compact</li>
            <li>will soon let you know how much is just right.  </li>
            <li>Fast heating up right in bag.  </li>
            <li>The Conair rollers are hard plastic, with a &amp;#34;starting strip.&amp;#34; I thought the starting strip made it easier to wrap my hair around the roller without the shorter hair popping out, and they stayed more securely in my hair while it was setting, however, when removing the rollvers, they kind of got stuck in my hair and &amp;#34;combed&amp;#34; out the curl a bit, making the curl fuzzy.</li>
            <li>If you have short hair, this is ideal, but for longer hair, it makes the curl too tight, hence the need for JUMBO rollers.</li>
            <li>And there are more of the large rollers than there were in my big set.  </li>
            <li>These fit well on small countertops and in any suitcase very easily.  </li>
            <li>Good that there are more big rollers than the small.</li>
            <li>so I got these to warm them up, pop them in and do my other thing like make-up and such.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surprising how many curlers you get in a small package, especially when compared to my 20+-year-old 5-curler travel set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I stuck them under the sink and completely forgot that I was once excited about them.  </li>
            <li>The perfume fragrance isn&#x27;t strong enough and doesn&#x27;t last more then an hour.  </li>
            <li>If you use \\&quot;end papers\\&quot; (I just use a sheet of folded toilet paper), it will grab your hair ends better when rolling it.  </li>
            <li>with much more satisfactory results and much longer lasting styling.  </li>
            <li>These are ok - don&#x27;t seem to get that hot and the pins don&#x27;t stay in my hair (maybe because my hair is quite long).</li>
            <li>I will stick to my curling irons or my foam curlers to get real curls, real fast, with real convenience.  </li>
            <li>For anyone who uses hot rollers, the picture looks as if you would be receiving large and medium sized rollers.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly..not too hot, packs easily, just wish rollers were slightly bigger.</li>
            <li>did not hold heat and took forever to get somewhat hot,  much prefer the Remington travel rollers</li>
            <li>They do heat up pretty fast</li>
            <li>they heat up fast and the dont take up much space!</li>
            <li>They warmed up very fast (I&#x27;d say 2-5 minutes), and gave my hair a nice curl, (though a little bumpy in places).</li>
            <li>I use them everyday not just for travel, nice and compact, heat fast enough for me tho maybe not quite as quickly as others and the curl they give is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have the large 30 set of hot rollers and this 12 piece travel set gets so much hotter in just 3-4 minutes</li>
            <li>other thing REALLY IMPORTANT about these, is THEY HAVE THE NICE TEETH to grip your hair-a really big deal.</li>
            <li>This is a great set of hot rollers if you have short hair or want tight curls.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad these rollers do not burn or dry out my hair like a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I use them every day in place of a much larger set that wasn&#x27;t nearly as easy to use.</li>
            <li>Rollers are considered large , not jumbo as I needed.</li>
            <li>It would have 5 stars if there were some large rollers, which is my preference.</li>
            <li>Definitely a smart purchase.</li>
            <li>Before making my purchase I read reviews from others who had purchased these curlers on Amazon, so I was prepared for certain shortcomings.  </li>
            <li>Also, you certainly can&#x27;t beat the cost.  </li>
            <li>You get 8 Large and 4 medium</li>
            <li>The write up says these rollers are large and jumbo.  </li>
            <li>It is certainly compact for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rollers are advertised as large and medium.  </li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift, along with large clamps for her to use instead of the pins that are included with the curlers.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this hoping the large rollers would be 1.25 inch diameter where the hair goes.  </li>
            <li>The large rollers are 1.25 inch where your fingers touch on the outer rim.  </li>
            <li>; large.</li>
            <li>It takes more than fifteen minutes for mine to heat up completely and even then it doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough because the curls will fall after about an hour with hairspray.</li>
            <li>There are definitely some good things about it--and it is certainly sized nicely for travel if that&#x27;s your main purpose in purchasing it--but due to both the roller size and limited number of rollers, the usefulness of this set restricted.</li>
            <li>The grooves on each one seem to grab onto the hair and separate to give more curl and don&#x27;t get the loose ends to retrieve onto the curler like others I have had.</li>
            <li>These gave my hair a nice curl (not too tight), lots of body and shine, and the style lasted all day.  </li>
            <li>You can get the hair to roll nice and tight without a lot of slippage.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My tabletop curlers are jumbo size, but since I recently had my hair relaxed these large and medium size rollers would do just fine.  </li>
            <li>The layout of the set was nice and small/compact but a little bulky for travelling--the new ones I just bought, Remington H-1015, have a more streamlined design for about the same amount of curlers</li>
            <li>but they totally get tangled in my fine hair when I&#x27;m trying to remove them.  </li>
            <li>but someone with short hair would be fine.  </li>
            <li>They heated up quickly, came with the metal clips (these are the ones I learned to use way back when hot rollers first came out), and had no odor.  </li>
            <li>I really want Large rollers.  </li>
            <li>The next time, I let them heat up for a good 15-20 minutes and they did get quite hot (not as hot as my regular Conair curlers, but hot enough).</li>
            <li>This beats having a large set that takes up too much room.  </li>
            <li>Nice little space saver for traveling.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little traveler pack.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and the small size makes it easy to pack.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, short to medium length, and very layered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had long, fine hair when I first received this.</li>
            <li>I thought rollers were a little bigger, but they are still great.</li>
            <li>You need very ylittle spritz to get the curls to stay nice for a few days.</li>
            <li>You need very ylittle spritz to get the curls to stay nice for a few days.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast.</li>
            <li>They are really light and compact and heat just as well as my regular ones.</li>
            <li>but it cost 4x as much.</li>
            <li>and they also retain their heat much longer as well.</li>
            <li>The clips held my hair very well.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast and work really well.  </li>
            <li>Heats fast.  </li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t available locally, so Amazon.com to the rescue.  </li>
            <li>It would have been very helpful if the size of the rollers was included in the description of the product.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast and curlers have grip teeth that really work.  </li>
            <li>I also ordered then I&#x27;ll be ready to go.</li>
            <li>It is as advertised, heats fast,</li>
            <li>I really like these compact rollers.  </li>
            <li>It really curled my hair and the curl lasted throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re fast to use</li>
            <li>they heat up FAST</li>
            <li>WORKS FAST, AND NO PROBLEMS WITH IT.</li>
            <li>They do heat up fast and they work well.</li>
            <li>They do heat up fast</li>
            <li>Very compact, which is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I really like these compact rollers.</li>
            <li>Very compact and would travel well,</li>
            <li>Yup, it WOULD help if there really were JUMBO rollers just like these..</li>
            <li>It seems to be ready in 5 min.  </li>
            <li>very compact..practical for refrshing your do.&lt;br /&gt;Iif</li>
            <li>the starter grab row really works.</li>
            <li>They travel very well.</li>
            <li>I brush mine straight and use conair in the ends.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I like these rollers so much</li>
            <li>Heat up fast, work well, and pack well for travel.</li>
            <li>The heat up fast and don&#x27;t burn my fingers.</li>
            <li>The heat up fast and don&#x27;t burn my fingers.</li>
            <li>I really like these curlers.</li>
            <li>If you want real curly hair, then you need to get these.</li>
            <li>and then I am ready to go.</li>
            <li>but I bot it to travel with and won&#x27;t need it too much.</li>
            <li>Have they cheapened them so much to save money that they no longer work?    </li>
            <li>Heated up fast.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast.</li>
            <li>Very compact for travel.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much room in the suitcase?</li>
            <li>Thanks conair.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I can leave it in my suitcase so it is always at the ready.</li>
            <li>I like that the set has the traditional skinny hair pins to secure each roller.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate them</li>
            <li>I had a set of these that I used very often</li>
            <li>They are, however, much preferable to the Remington H-1015 set.</li>
            <li>just make sure you leave them in the pouch and have the pouch closed while heating.  </li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t really heat well.  </li>
            <li>They work fast and the curl lasts</li>
            <li>Heat very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So convenient on trips--they fit anywhere, and take up next to no room in a suitcase.  </li>
            <li>They heat up fast and REALLY curl.</li>
            <li>Very compact.</li>
            <li>The only thing I miss is there is no indicator light to remind me</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions, they say to heat them in the bag with the lid closed for more efficient heating.  </li>
            <li>Very compact.</li>
            <li>They are convenient and extremely fast to heat up.  </li>
            <li>too much work</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really get the curls I wanted.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t do much for the roots.</li>
            <li>it is much easier to use and doesn&#x27;t burn my fingers.</li>
            <li>Heat up fast, compact for traveling and really get the job done.</li>
            <li>and then when I took them off, my hair was already straight again by the time I was finished taking them out.</li>
            <li>Did not curl very well</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly - because I had to use SO much hair in each roller the curls</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking it could be my stick straight hair that won&#x27;t cooperate.  </li>
            <li>My six year old grand daughter loves her instant hair styling set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to completely peel back the plastic cover when the rollers are heating.</li>
            <li>it was excellent and if not for the base gradually breaking apart where the rollers fit (probably a fire hazard)</li>
            <li>I have to constantly reposition curlers so that they all get warm enough to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>I left them plugged in for 20 minutes and they were only slightly warm to the touch.</li>
            <li>the roller itself is kind of oval rather than round.</li>
            <li>Would love a compact set of 8 rollers in a soft case just a 1/4 inch larger in diameter than the largest ones in this set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d this travel set is good, just not for thick longer hair.</li>
            <li>They do take longer to warm up than my previous hot rollers and don&#x27;t get as hot but hot enough for me.</li>
            <li>However, to my regret, the rollers do not heat up quickly or get hot enough to give my hair a real curl.</li>
            <li>Although the cord comes wrapped up outside the case, I&#x27;ve found it can be easily coiled around the top of all the curlers, tucking the plug down inside, and the zipper can be zipped virtually all the way around the case.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, but just barely hot enough.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have other rollers that cost 3x as much, but they really aren&#x27;t 3x better.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my new set of hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>The first set barely got warm enough to put a little wave in my hair, and my hair curls fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>The starter strip is a small row of little prongs that grip your hair perfectly, allows you to NOT make fishhook ends--and DON&#x27;T tangle.  </li>
            <li>Nice color-coated clips don&#x27;t leave dent in your hair, they heat up fast and take up very little room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice and small and heats up really fast</li>
            <li>What happened to the old days when hot rollers really were \\&quot;hot\\&quot;?  </li>
            <li>I have long but fine hair</li>
            <li>I rarely use hair curlers so my first (and to date only)</li>
            <li>Although the rollers themselves are somewhat oval in shape, I really didn&#x27;t think the finished curl looks any different than with a round roller; however, I think the oval shape allows you to set the roller closer to your head for a more secure set.  </li>
            <li>These are easy to use and they heat up quickly, but the curl doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
            <li>Fast to heat and three of us used them to get ready for New Years Eve 2013.  </li>
            <li>Despite the fact that my hair is thinner than it was back when I first used hot rollers, I still need 20 of them: sixteen large and four</li>
            <li>Trashed that set (which I paid about $35 for) and paid half as much for this one which is a better size and creates nicer looking curls for me.</li>
            <li>: They both use similar pins to secure the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;-Surface: The Remington rollers a kind of velvety black smooth surface with some slight ridges.</li>
            <li>They heat quickly and stay hot for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>The curlers get hot very quickly and remain hot long enough to thoroughly set the curl.  </li>
            <li>They are nice and small and traveled well to London without be a suitcase hog.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for rollers that will give hair below your shoulders a nice bounce, these rollers are to small to do the job.</li>
            <li>Everything is handy in a small case.</li>
            <li>When I first got these, I was concerned over how old it looked.</li>
            <li>Okay product, does the job, I hate having to write more words, I&#x27;m done, if you want more words</li>
            <li>Would have given it five starts but does not get as hot as my old set</li>
            <li>I have another which are all the same sized rollers and therefore not quite as good since my hair at the back is too short to hold them.</li>
            <li>I wanted one set of 20 rollers, which is a fairly standard number of rollers for setting a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>Small and handy</li>
            <li>I tried them twice trying to use them to their full potential and both times the curlers did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad thing, but I will buy some larger ones now to supplement.  </li>
            <li>Make sure they are pushed down in their case while heating.  </li>
            <li>Make sure the rollers are pushed all the way down onto the posts so they make contact and can heat up.  </li>
            <li>you have to make sure all the rolles are pushed down on the heater.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, as it is fast heating, and contains more rollers than I have ever had in a small, very portable hair setter.</li>
            <li>I just take out the case, plug it directly into the wall, and within a few minutes I unzip the top and have 12 curlers hot and ready.</li>
            <li>My hair is much fuller, much bouncier, with much more long lasting curls.</li>
            <li>Just doing your ends is fairly quick, much easier and faster than a curling iron or twisting a flat iron over and over.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rollers make a better curl than the rollers I was previously using.</li>
            <li>They were definitely hot enough, but not too hot to hold.</li>
            <li>Gives me decent curls without taking up all my luggage space.</li>
            <li>Good for occasional use, but a bit of a pain for everyday.</li>
            <li>The rollers get hot enough, but not so hot that they burn my hands.</li>
            <li>I thought I might need two boxes since I prefer the blue rollers and wasnt sure I&#x27;d have enough, but the 8 rollers provided do the job</li>
            <li>there are twelve rollers and that is not enough for me, but is probably enough for most people&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>I am using the same product currently and love it.  </li>
            <li>The smaller rollers were better, yet there was only four of them, so their use was limited.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to learn quickly to handle only the ends.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>big issue is the same as most everyone else.</li>
            <li>The Conair Hot (Warm) Rollers work, but the clips are tight and they don&#x27;t get as hot as I had expected.</li>
            <li>I will more than likely purchase another just to have more curlers since I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out a little and don&#x27;t want to risk not having enough.</li>
            <li>I had an old one by conair that only had 8 curlers which were never enough nor did they curl so well and twelves is perfect for me at least.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Given that these rollers do not ever reach a high temperature, they might not work as well for people whose hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl well.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>But I guess all products with high heat will eventually damage hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>For those two reasons I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li>They take up very little space &amp; are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The Remington rollers are fine to handle on the ends, but sometimes a little too hot to hold in the middle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This set does warm up with 90 seconds as advertised but it is not hot enough.</li>
            <li>Usually curls and holds curls very easily.</li>
            <li>I love this little set.  </li>
            <li>They heat up super quick and set my hair in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>This hot roller set is fantastic and takes up so little room.  </li>
            <li>Extremely compact case that seems easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Too bad, it could have been perfect for use at home and for travel.</li>
            <li>The starter combs on the rollers are useless and cause some issues when putting the clips in but great product.</li>
            <li>it IS important to leave the case closed as directed.</li>
            <li>Finally have hot rollers I don&#x27;t mind bringing along on my travels since they don&#x27;t take much space and are lightweight yet do the job.</li>
            <li>After the it had been plugged in for at least 30 minutes, the curlers were barely warm.  </li>
            <li>It is also necessasry to leave them in your hair longer than you might normally do so.  </li>
            <li>I have normal weight hair and length.</li>
            <li>They do not get hot enough to really make any difference.</li>
            <li>Also,I smelled &#x27;pukey plastic&#x27; on the Rems after about 5 minutes, the Remingtons seem to just be one more toxic-junk roller set, with no grip, and an extra sheet of soft plastic on the outside of the roller, making the gaseous smell when heated.</li>
            <li>Practice, lasting results are worth the learning curve on updated,</li>
            <li>Just wish there were a few more of them in the set.  </li>
            <li>There are just enough curlers for a complete hair setting, and more than enough for a touchup......</li>
            <li>would not buy this again, although such setting products are probably all pretty much alike.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying and keeping the Conair Compact Hairsetter (in blue); it&#x27;s a little clunkier to travel with but delivers much better results and has the right number of rollers.</li>
            <li>Very compact for travel, fast heat up and cool down.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I would like more of the large curlers, but that&#x27;s just personal preference.  </li>
            <li>Medium&#x27; rollers are small diameter, but the 8 larger rollers were  adequate to set the top layers of my med.</li>
            <li>When I recently traveled, I used another, larger set of rollers that heat up quickly and hot.  </li>
            <li>I heated these up for a very long time (just to make sure) and then left them on my hair until they well fully cooled</li>
            <li>With more experience, I can do my hair to look professional in less than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Occasionally, if you get it just right, the pins hold</li>
            <li>These are all right in a pinch.i wish they where larger rollers.</li>
            <li>We have had no problems at all with them not getting warm enough like some reviewers and they stay in her hair (super thick, long, and straight) very well.  </li>
            <li>I have alot of hair and when I saw these, I feared they would not be large enough to roll my whole head.</li>
            <li>It was a cute idea for travel, but for my purposes, it had too few rollers and never quite got hot enough.</li>
            <li>Purchased these with high hopes but they do not even get hot enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>i live in the philippines</li>
            <li>Since I am leaving on a trip, I do not have time to return and receive a new item.</li>
            <li>a new one for me.</li>
            <li>I presume it was a new product.</li>
            <li>curl pretty fast (maybe 7 minutes or less) and the curl holds on fine, flat, overbleached, overcooked, dried-out hair, shoulder length, -for</li>
            <li>I have fine textured long hair, straight with a slight wave, easy to curl but tends to fall flat.  </li>
            <li>But for someone else with thin hair or super-fine hair that slides off the roller, then the starting strip is a great idea.</li>
            <li>I finally settled on the Conair HS28X Instant Heat Compact Styling Setter primarily for its compact size and the fact that the curlers came in two sizes.  </li>
            <li>Regrettably, this hair setter is no improvement over the one I used 20 years ago:&lt;br /&gt;rollers are heavy, the starter strip doesn&#x27;t really help the roller grip hair stands for a smooth, neat roll-up and the metal clips are a pain to slip on the rollers.</li>
            <li>But, the process would be cut by half, if I had have used a strong watts unit.</li>
            <li>, I am looking for hot air curlers of sufficient number that are all super-jumbo or at least a true jumbo size!</li>
            <li>and I can easily handle them, clips are tight</li>
            <li>They are all that I had hoped they would be: compact and easy to cary or store, heat up fast and don&#x27;t burn your fingers when you use them, give lasting curl in a short amount of time (left them in 5 to 10 min.)  </li>
            <li>I bought these recently at a local drugstore, and tried them today for the first time.</li>
            <li>Curlers Would not heat up hot enough to roll.</li>
            <li>The size was a concern for me because the last set of hot rollers I had were in my check in luggage and the case got destroyed by the airlines.  </li>
            <li>First, while they do indeed heat up in just a couple of minutes, it is only a \\&quot;surface charge.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Overall I highly recommend it though!!</li>
            <li>also, I didn&#x27;t like the pins--the curlers kept on flopping around on my head and just weren&#x27;t hot enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>And the curlers don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>I have bigger sets of hot rollers</li>
            <li>Short hair is so much easier to manage!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers in decades but purchased these for a recent trip.  </li>
            <li>By the time I had the last curler in, it was time to take out the first one.</li>
            <li>This is the second set of Conair hot rollers that I&#x27;ve purchased in two years.  </li>
            <li>I love these and have used them often over the past two years.</li>
            <li>This is my second set, only because I needed more larger sizes.</li>
            <li>Does not get as hot as I am accustomed to, but works just the same.</li>
            <li>I would buy this exact same one if I had it to do over again.</li>
            <li>If you like smaller, hot curlers, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li>Have to heat up twice to have enough and the look was straight out of the 80s!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a set of rollers on the small side you should love these.</li>
            <li>The rollers don&#x27;t stay hot for long and generally didn&#x27;t seem all that hot.  </li>
            <li>No different than the hot curlers of 40 years ago...disappointed.</li>
            <li>But they ARE hot enough.</li>
            <li>I also found that the youtube link that one other posters put was helpful because I never thought about putting the little rollers at the bottom, but they work great this way and only needed the one set.    </li>
            <li>I find that the clips hold the curlers securely in place (unlike other brands!)</li>
            <li>Ceramic rollers are just the right temperature, never get dirty, and clean easily if they would.  </li>
            <li>works amazingly for such a small set ...</li>
            <li>-kind of wish it was all just the bigger rollers, but small ones do the job</li>
            <li>These are definitely compact and a nice size for travel, but DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>my old roller set from the 1970s had the EXACT same clips).  </li>
            <li>They might be fine for women with short hair who wish to have a curly result, but are not the right product for long hair in loose unstructured waves.</li>
            <li>Only down side, did not come with the clips, so check to make sure they did not leave yours out.</li>
            <li>, maybe i can buy one of those in their store.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that I can only say positive things about this product.</li>
            <li>I have long, wavy hair that curls perfectly using Conair&#x27;s soft flocked curlers, so I hoped these would work, but they were a disappointment.</li>
            <li>My set barely got warm even though I left them plugged in for over 20 minutes while I showered and dried my hair.</li>
            <li>and sometimes I don&#x27;t get the satisfying click when I place the curler on it&#x27;s base, but for the most part it&#x27;s doing exactly what I wanted it to:  </li>
            <li>The clips included have their own little pocket so you don&#x27;t loose them and the rollers heat up well.</li>
            <li>The actual box the rollers came in was worn and slightly torn and looked like it had been opened many times.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect much out of these but wanted something that would heat quickly &amp; not take up much space.</li>
            <li>The only moderate curl I got was on the very first one I managed to put</li>
            <li>Every other rollers I&#x27;ve had get so hot that you can hardly stand to handle them, but these were barely warm at all.</li>
            <li>I only wish the \\&quot;large\\&quot; rollers were actually large.</li>
            <li>The large ones are smaller than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>The REM&#x27;s \\&quot;large rollers&#x27; are a tad thicker, but you only get 4 of them?</li>
            <li>I purchased these to replace a set of Conair Big Curls after a large piece of the case broke off.</li>
            <li>Wish the large rollers were slightly larger.</li>
            <li>I just purchased a second set this week as 12 rollers really aren&#x27;t enough to give the set I like, but 2 sets of these rollers is still less than a lot of setters out there with more rollers--and I&#x27;ll have a compact set for travel.  </li>
            <li>I like the little pocket the wires fit into too.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with the rapidity of the delivery and the product works just fine, but was disappointed that the rollers were so small.</li>
            <li>I found that the curls from this roller set quickly fell out and the curls made from my other set stayed in for hours.</li>
            <li>The small curler posts also fit the big rollers so you could purchase 4 more large rollers to replace the 4 small ones if you wanted to.</li>
            <li>I thought the rollers would be bigger, but they really are for shorter hair or tighter curls than I like . .</li>
            <li>They hear fast and the curls last.</li>
            <li>Since she travels frequently she loves the soft sides and the variety of curlers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it much and the curl does not last as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I like the compact size and the soft sided carring case makes it easier for packing to take on trips.</li>
            <li>I use the old clips that came with my old set</li>
            <li>wow............</li>
            <li>Everyone said, the curl looks natural and look like I walk out from the salon.</li>
            <li>&quot; you need for longer lasting styles, you really need to let them heat up about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>They work just like my larger set but are much easier to travel with.</li>
            <li>I bought these while traveling and am surprised at how well they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If they had just heated up more I would have given it least 4 stars.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty long.</li>
            <li>Stuck with them now as it would cost too much to ship back.  </li>
            <li>these rollers are NOT round.</li>
            <li>The clips that hold the roller in the hair are much too short.  </li>
            <li>It is soft sided</li>
            <li>My hair is poker straight and just above my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I like them, but I really wish they all heated up at the same rate</li>
            <li>Compact, soft case, weighs about 1 lb.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>- this may be really undesirable for some people who want big waves.</li>
            <li>Doing those two things worked well as far as heating the curlers.  </li>
            <li>This was supposed to arrive with clips to secure the curlers and those were missing from the box.  </li>
            <li>but I like them so far.</li>
            <li>But after reading much research on voltage converters - they are not suggested for heating elements such as curlers, irons, straighteners and stuff.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised with these travel curlers.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get stuck in your hair like the old type.  </li>
            <li>Second, the medium-sized rollers really didn&#x27;t work very well for me, as my hair was too short for them</li>
            <li>Do not buy these rollers they are not round but oval</li>
            <li>I wondered if it really was dual voltage between the US and Europe, but it actually is, without any visible switch to turn on.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping this was going to work for travel, but there not enough curlers to set all my hair.</li>
            <li>but I manage to get a complete set.  </li>
            <li>There are not enough to get the curls you really want with this.</li>
            <li>Only reason I am rating a 4 is because I wish there were a few more rollers.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast, holds heat enough to curl my hair, easy to use the two sizes of curlers and It takes up little space in my suitcase!</li>
            <li>They heat up and cool down as needed.  </li>
            <li>Or reheat some if hair is not dry enough the first time.</li>
            <li>(Conair has two or three other roller sets with 580 watts or more--the one with 580 watts heat up and ready for use in two minutes!!</li>
            <li>My curls looked pretty but didn&#x27;t hold very long.</li>
            <li>However, only the curlers sold with or in addition to this set will fit the heating rod so don&#x27;t plan on using any other curlers you have with this set.</li>
            <li>Small, compact and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li>The small compact design makes for easy storage.</li>
            <li>i have normal hair, not too thick but not too fine.</li>
            <li>I have long, thin straight hair, and let the rollers warm up for almost 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I returned it, didn&#x27;t have instant heat, didn&#x27;t even get hot enough to style my hair.</li>
            <li>all the rolling would go quickly, in about half the time.</li>
            <li>The larger roller size that I used in the past seemed to straighten my hair more than curl it, but these leave my medium length hair with loads of curls and body.</li>
            <li>they do get hot enough, just not instantly (like it says on the box)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mainly use the larger curlers and don&#x27;t have any issues with the clips.</li>
            <li>There are 8 medium-sized rollers and 4 smaller rollers, and this is the main flaw of this set.  </li>
            <li>I compared these sets under the exact same conditions, since I used them at the same time.</li>
            <li>I compared these sets under the exact same conditions, since I used them at the same time.</li>
            <li>Heated up fast and cooled down fast.</li>
            <li>size of the large rollers in this set is just a bit smaller than the large in my other Conair set-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Jumbo is a non-existent size,far as I know,  in this old style of heavier/better type of rollers, apparently.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I recently had my hair styled and thought curlers would help me maintain the style--unfortunately the curlers were too small, they really didn&#x27;t heat up as fast as the instructions said they would, I also had trouble making sure they were connected to the heat source--</li>
            <li>For minimal money, makes these and all hot curlers a breeze.</li>
            <li>I have a larger set of heat curlers I normally use and bought these for a trip since  they are compact.</li>
            <li>I have choose to use my large plastic clips from Hot Rollers past.  </li>
            <li>By the end of 3 hours with the Conair compact, my hair would be pretty much uncurled, with maybe some slight curling left at the ends.</li>
            <li>A new hairstyle needed different size curlers.  </li>
            <li>I plug them in when I start to blow dry and they are ready by the time I am done, which is probably about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in nearly 40 years, I have let my hair grow long, but I can&#x27;t let the hair dry naturally</li>
            <li>I have so much hair that when dyeing my hair at salons I need double the amt of chemicals) and yet one set was enough.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, considered frizzy and unmanageable cut into a long bob that touches my shoulders and these rollers and thier long lasting heat is enough to control my hair and gives it really soft shiny frizz free curls.</li>
            <li>I ordered several extra curlers which work well and heat up fast.  </li>
            <li>Or at least for the whole day, depending on your hair of course.&lt;br /&gt;These CONAIR ROLLERS are really worth tryin.</li>
            <li>Or at least for the whole day, depending on your hair of course.&lt;br /&gt;These CONAIR ROLLERS are really worth tryin.</li>
            <li>I even bought a second one because not all my ear fits on this set, and the ones that had too much hair didn&#x27;t stay as well, so Second set ordered to help keep it all curly</li>
            <li>No matter how long the preheat, the rollers do not get hot enough to hold the curl.</li>
            <li>But these rollers will not burn your fingers unless you hold them closed in your hand for long minutes, then I wonder if they wouldnt cool to the point of non burning anyway..</li>
            <li>The cool down part is key for packing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>set does not get nearly as hot as my other set.</li>
            <li>The first time I used them I only left them in for about 10 minutes, but the styling didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>The rollers did not get so hot that I got burned as I did with two other sets I tried.</li>
            <li>but I would get the other clips if you keep this hot roller set.</li>
            <li>The metal clips tuck into a small slot inside the case and are easily accessible.</li>
            <li>Small enough to easily pack.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to get a new one - my old one was starting to take longer to heat up.  </li>
            <li>First, these 12 rollers were barely enough to set all of my hair--and, as I mentioned earlier, my hair is relatively short (just touching my shoulders) and rather thin, so no way would this set work for someone with longer or thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>The wire clips hold fine for my hair (shoulder length, medium thick).  </li>
            <li>I have thick, fine hair and these curlers</li>
            <li>These are medium to small, nice for shorter styles or really tight curls.</li>
            <li>With this said, the product itself is fine and it is indeed small enough to throw in your luggage without taking up heaps of room.</li>
            <li>I recommend the &#x27;super clips&#x27; as well, as they are much easier on the scalp than the supplied U shaped ones (which work fine, they&#x27;re just a little uncomfortable).</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair and though it was ok, the rollers were a little too small to create a voluminous wave, they gave a tighter curl.  </li>
            <li>These are great for those bad hair days where you need to force your hair to behave.  </li>
            <li>It barely heats at all</li>
            <li>I marked mine with a dab of red nail polish.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get hot and are not worth the money.</li>
            <li>I tried them anyway and barely got any curl in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Tried only once but took a long time to get hot and not enough rollers.</li>
            <li>They completely did not stay on the roller, or in my hair and hurt when I tried to push them in so they&#x27;d properly hold.  </li>
            <li>Not large and medium, more like medium and small.</li>
            <li>The main reason I am knocking some stars off this review, however, is that they recently broke for apparently no reason, just stopped heating up at all.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new travel size curler set and although this is a bit larger than my last set</li>
            <li>The issue is that it is only 85 watts so it takes very very long time to get ready for the job.</li>
            <li>They heat quickly and take up very little room in the cabinet.  </li>
            <li>the only thing I don&#x27;t love is that they are a little smaller than I expected them to be and the curls tend to be tighter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and includes adequate amount of curlers.</li>
            <li>A quick makeover from the usual look.</li>
            <li>The curlers get hot but because I have thick hair, eight large rollers aren&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>Now that I am older and need to get stuff done and can&#x27;t spend a solid 30 minute curling my long mane</li>
            <li>Plus there are 12 curlers in the pack--also very unlike other models.</li>
            <li>The blue curlers are big enough for nice loose curls and are sufficient to do all of my shoulder length, medium thick hair.  </li>
            <li>It did not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>first time I let these curlers heat up, I thought they were broken; they just didn&#x27;t get that hot.</li>
            <li>I usually let them heat a full 5 minutes, not the 90 seconds that these instant heat rollers say they need.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would say is if you have really long thick hair you may need bigger and more rollers.  </li>
            <li>and I need bigger rollers to keep bigger curls and not tight curls.  </li>
            <li>other set I have is the Remington H-1015 Ceramic Compact, Large and Medium Roller set, also sold on Amazon for a similar price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently, my idea of jumbo and the manufacturer&#x27;s idea are different.</li>
            <li>these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of product- rollers are pretty narrow.</li>
            <li>so I called Conair 800-326-6247 and ordered RP 106- 3 large rollers for less than $7.  </li>
            <li>As soon as one got done, put the curlers back in to heat and less than 10 minutes later the next lady was ready to roll!  </li>
            <li>but I did not think that the unit got hot enough and the rollers seemed to heavy for the pins that secured them.  </li>
            <li>product may work well for people with short hair that is thick or medium, but I would not recommend it for anyone with fine hair that is medium length or long.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, are compact and manage to curl my thick medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>Only trouble is they don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Heat is gentle and the rollers did provide a slight lift (I left them in for 30 minutes).  </li>
            <li>Would rather have larger rollers, but I use the 8 larger size rollers for less than a minute and my hair curls fast.</li>
            <li>found that the little set of teeth on one side of these rollers really helped grip my hair</li>
            <li>you are a business traveler who just wants something to put a little bounce in your hair for day-time, this set does the trick.</li>
            <li>They are far too small to do a decent job in styling my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>I have a very hard time curling my hair and getting curlers to stay, but this one was easy to put in, stayed where they should, and curled my hair, lasting a long while.</li>

            <li> Just the perfect accessory for the hot roller travelers</li>
            <li> Love that I can pack them!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and curls are very good</li>
            <li> These are so compact, heat up very quickly and create a great curl and a lot of body and bounce.  </li>
            <li> Packs easily, works great.  </li>
            <li> These work great, travel well and are compact but still get hot and do a great job on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and it does provide great results.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and gives great curls.  </li>
            <li> More importantly it works...makes nice curls!!</li>
            <li> They work best if not overloaded with too large an amount of hair, trial and error</li>
            <li> amazing.</li>
            <li> fantastic, I am realy happy</li>
            <li> These rollers have a neat shape, are smooth, and work great.</li>
            <li> Even after I let them warm up for an hour and after that I could hold the rollers in my palm without even burning my hand.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with the way they curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for months (when I travel) and it still heats up really nicely (takes about 10 minutes).  </li>
            <li> and it got barely warm.</li>
            <li> So I just have a nice, curly, 1950&#x27;s sock-hop pony tail look when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> It makes nice curls.</li>
            <li> I liked them so well that I use them at home now.  </li>
            <li> Each curler has it&#x27; own pin to match.  </li>
            <li> Nice compact design.  </li>
            <li> However, for the price, I liked the size and decided to try again.  </li>
            <li> Nice to travel with.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t warm up evenly.  </li>
            <li> Zippered top is superior to the velcro-held flap of some sets, so the clips don&#x27;t get lost in your travels.</li>
            <li> Heat fast and work great!  </li>
            <li> The clips are kind of tricky to use.</li>
            <li> They are nicely compact for use on travel vacations.</li>
            <li> Nice rollers.  </li>
            <li> Nice bag.  </li>
            <li> Nice concept.  </li>
            <li> These hold the rollers in place nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Travel Pouch: They&#x27;re both nice and compact.</li>
            <li> Nice set of rollers for travel/works well for mid-length to shorter hair.</li>
            <li> This is a nice compact set of rollers.  </li>
            <li> Nice, compact set, recommended.</li>
            <li> But these were just perfect... easy easy easy to use, and even as a beginner</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this product a stellar review, as the unit is compact and ideal for travel.</li>
            <li> The rollers are a good size, the clips secure effectively, and the unit is a compact size to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and produce great curls.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, styles nicely, great value.</li>
            <li> Very easy to take out, no pull on any strands of hair.  </li>
            <li> The clips are very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> However, they do tangle very easily.</li>
            <li> It  was a very easy way of buying just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Makes things VERY easy in the morning.</li>
            <li> Love love these!</li>
            <li> Compact size is great and they heat up very fast!</li>
            <li> The size of this set is great for travel and convenience, but the rollers do not get very hot and do nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> This heats up in minutes which is perfect for my busy schedule.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked 2 more curlers but got by with the 12.</li>
            <li> Honestly, my sneakers take up more room than</li>
            <li> but I do not get any kind of meaningful</li>
            <li> My style lasts all day and I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> considering I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> So easy to travel with!  </li>
            <li> Lightweight and soft-sides make it easy to pack!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love these!</li>
            <li> The curlers worked great and it was really nice to be able to take them and not use up so much space in my suitcase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better heated rollers before, but if you&#x27;re in need of something cheap and fairly functional, they do the trick.</li>
            <li> This roller set is a nice compact set perfect to throw in your suitcase, but has a big issue.  </li>
            <li> and I was pretty happy with them.  </li>
            <li> These hot rollers work great.  </li>
            <li> These were great at first.</li>
            <li> All the way until the curler gets cool, is a good rule of thumb.</li>
            <li> They are the perfect size for travel; they do a great job on my hair in very little time.  </li>
            <li> Product heats up quickly and produces a good curl.</li>
            <li> They heat quickly and do a good job.</li>
            <li> Compact and rollers get nice and hot for a good curl.</li>
            <li> They heat up relatively quickly and it&#x27;s great they fit so well into a packed suitcase.</li>
            <li> Ratings are accurate!</li>
            <li> Love the compact size.</li>
            <li> Hoping that is just part of the learning curve and with more use and familiarity of the item, I can eliminate that.</li>
            <li> Much better than another brand I bought.</li>
            <li> I totally love these.  </li>
            <li> but i got something that works better for think wavy hair that I am trying to make  shine.</li>
            <li> and so I think will be better for travel.  </li>
            <li> On the second day my hair will be wavy and it still looks awesome.</li>
            <li> Just like the one before it that lasted many years.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers a couple of weeks ago and love them.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have many choices.&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> These grip better and curl better than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Love the size.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking for a replacement that heats better and provides better curling.</li>
            <li> I love this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> and I was so pleased.  </li>
            <li> I have to find better clips, the pin-like ones, but I&#x27;m worried they won&#x27;t hold since they don&#x27;t come with the rollers.</li>
            <li> Just be sure they are connected to the heating element on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Love them and plan to keep them until they wear out.</li>
            <li> I love the curlers.  </li>
            <li> am really glad I did.</li>
            <li> I thought being the brand as well known it would be ok to order on line</li>
            <li> but it is most unsatisfactory.  </li>
            <li> I just wish there were more of them.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be okay.  </li>
            <li> They are not the smooth kind</li>
            <li> The size and number of rollers are perfect for my travel, but the rollers have not yet heated up enough for me - still contemplating whether or not to return.</li>
            <li> So, I use these most of the time at home now, not just for traveling.  </li>
            <li> These curlers work ok.</li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with more curlers..</li>
            <li> but overall, it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I decided to try these after shopping around and reading many reviews.</li>
            <li> I love the size of the rollers.</li>
            <li> it is ok....</li>
            <li> for the money  ii&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li> That is the measurement of the top.  </li>
            <li> it is a great choice when you have a short time and need gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li> I read soooo many reviews before I settled on buying these.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> love how compact the box is and yet everything you need is there.</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> Perfect name for this product -- instant heat and compact!</li>
            <li> Great product -- can&#x27;t say enough good things.  </li>
            <li> and love the case.</li>
            <li> Better than hoped.</li>
            <li> I liked these curlers initially, and thought that they would be ideal for traveling, since the set is compact.  </li>
            <li> Love these curlers.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> they are OK, but I am still looking for good powerful travel curlers.</li>
            <li> so glad I got them.</li>
            <li> The price is award winning too :-)</li>
            <li> WAS setting my hair with velcro rollers after a shower, and that worked much better.</li>
            <li> I feel they have a better grip than the ones they come with.</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s compact</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s the case, just put more hair on the curler.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need three more rollers, but I&#x27;ll use a curling iron as well</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more curls and pizzazz, but the curls were just sort of...limp.  </li>
            <li> I am learning how to use this things, but i love the way it make my hair look and</li>
            <li> /&gt;even better.</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> This product is a great and economic purchase which allows curl to be added to your styl.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, there was an order form for getting more rollers, which I may do.  </li>
            <li> I had read the reviews to push the curlers into the base--and the instructions said to close the top when heating.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to buy more.</li>
            <li> The unit has held up across many trips.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> My curls didn&#x27;t hold up for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> The are compact and most efficient.  </li>
            <li> I am a beginner when it comes to using hot rollers &amp; these have turned out to be a perfect first set.</li>
            <li> but i blame that more on me than the product.</li>
            <li> They are light for packing &amp; travel!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set.</li>
            <li> This is more intended for pack and travel....very cute.</li>
            <li> but it works ok.  </li>
            <li> Love this item--so compact, so efficient</li>
            <li> My kids thought I looked hilarious.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it takes a minute or more to untangle a roller.</li>
            <li> They are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I just love them.  </li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with these rollers.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love these rollers but just couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and I already love them.  </li>
            <li> Overall, excellent!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to a more compact set.  </li>
            <li> It was thicker and seemed more durable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this set and would buy again in a heartbeat if it dies.</li>
            <li> I really love these rollers.  </li>
            <li> Really love these curlers.  </li>
            <li> These would probably be better for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Tried many times and still couldn&#x27;t clip my hair on the rollers.</li>
            <li> If you have thicker or coarser hair, perhaps this may be a better tool.</li>
            <li> I just ordered clips to see if rollers stay in better.</li>
            <li> so glad I tried them :)</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t curl all the way to the roots, mostly just the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li> It was the right size, light weight and worked great.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, compact unit, heats quickly and provides the kind of smooth ends and curl that I am looking for.</li>
            <li> super love the curls!</li>
            <li> It is very light and easy to pack but took forever to heat up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, very light in weight to carry.</li>
            <li> The clips do a pretty good job of holding the rollers in my hair.</li>
            <li> nice full bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li> They really work wonderfully, and I am so happy I decided to get these over any other travel size out there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excited!</li>
            <li> They heat up quick and store away nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These heat up quickly, and curl nicely.</li>
            <li> I love how compact the case is and easy for travel.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little cube of curlers and they are just the perfect hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might not all be &#x27;fresh&#x27; but hair products are ok from them!</li>
            <li> It might not all be &#x27;fresh&#x27; but hair products are ok from them!</li>
            <li> Also, it would have helped to have maybe 2 or 3 more rollers to fit all of my hair.</li>
            <li> THE reliable hot roller~ with nice gripping</li>
            <li> I was very impressed by the compact size and shape as it fits nicely into my small suitcase.</li>
            <li> First curlers, very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking at buying smooth rollers to see if that works better.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy this cute curling system.</li>
            <li> Good quality product and my wife is very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> I bought this hairsetter for travel and loved it so much that I bought another one to use at home.</li>
            <li> These curlers work really good and heat up really fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good concept but didn&#x27;t really give me the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> so purchased another set since I loved them so much.</li>
            <li> Good quality, very compact and&lt;br</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up quickly and make styling your hair very easy.  </li>
            <li> They work very well...are compact and great for travel and for  quick styles at home.  </li>

            <li> These rollers heat up very well and quickly; curls very nicely.</li>
            <li> Awesome ... bought it for traveling due to</li>
            <li> Heats up quick and the curlers are easy to handle!</li>
            <li> I read many reviews of many many hot rollers before deciding on this one.</li>
            <li> Great to get back to hot rollers...much better for my hair and styles better!  </li>
            <li> easy to use, but not for me</li>
            <li> -one set completes hair  -easy to pack  DISLIKES:  </li>
            <li> I have always liked the metal holders better than all the newer style ones as they leave no ridges and keep the curler in place really snugly.</li>
            <li> The rollers have no rubbery feel which helped rolling my hair easy with another set I owned.</li>
            <li> and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience using hot rollers and I will say that they work great.  </li>
            <li> so it was easy to pack in my luggage.  </li>
            <li> You can easily curl the left-out ends after that.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and storage</li>

            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The clips are easy to use and they don&#x27;t leave clip marks or dents.</li>
            <li> The way the pins hold the rolles isn&#x27;t that easy.</li>
            <li> so I could easily pack them.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Lightweight thus easy to carry.</li>
            <li> works great,  very small and compact-love it,  also great for travel</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty amazing</li>
            <li> i put the curlers on, do my make up, and after 20 minutes, i have beautiful curls that last all day!  </li>
            <li> Work well, grip the hair well without pulling, and get nice and hot.  </li>
            <li> My handy, residential electrical engineer tried to fix my first one with a blown fuse.  </li>
            <li> They are equally as warm as the first and don&#x27;t curl.  </li>
            <li> Some curlers were extremely hot and some were barley warm.</li>
            <li> I give this 4 stars because they are super compact, heat up quickly and look nice.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and put a nice curl to my hair rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent, in a few minutes you have a wonderful  hair stile, they are easy to put on and they dont fall like other brand</li>
            <li> The pins work fine</li>
            <li> Cord is now attached which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li> I thought I might have a problem with the clips, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li> and it is working fine.</li>
            <li> these work fine</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mom who has fine hair but a ton of it</li>
            <li> It is light and easy to transport which is why i bought it.</li>
            <li> Just my experience, don&#x27;t care for the type of curl for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> They will probably work fine.  </li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> I am growing out layered hair, and my hair is fairly fine.  </li>
            <li> and I am fine with these.</li>
            <li> and they worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does a fabulous job in creating curls.</li>
            <li> Luckily I was able to sell them to a friend</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly!</li>
            <li> The rollers are adequate for what I need; I just wish the curls were more long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Order did arrive quickly and were packaged appropriately.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised that they got as good of reviews as they did.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if I wanted a tight curl, these would be awesome.</li>
            <li> The compact size is going to fit in my suitcase just fine.  </li>
            <li> It does heat up nicely and it certainly does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> These are the best little set of rollers I&#x27;ve ever used ....</li>
            <li> The curlers stayed in just fine and are easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is portable, compact and light to carry for her.</li>
            <li> I still prefer them to a curling iron for travel, electric rollers seem to smooth out the frizz in my hair.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, I needed something to get a USB extension cable up over $25 for free shipping</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on my first use of the set, I feel it gives me what I was looking for: nice full waves and smooth, shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Fortunately - had my \\&quot;old\\&quot; con-air clips that worked.  </li>
            <li> These would be great for short hair.</li>
            <li> The case is really fantastic, keep everything in place.</li>
            <li> They work great even though they are smaller.  </li>
            <li> The pins to hold them in place are cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for and the cost being so cheap</li>
            <li> also delivers cheap results.</li>
            <li> I like the compact size-it should fit in my suitcase without taking up a lot of room.</li>
            <li> I left them in for about 30 minutes and her hair looked great.  </li>
            <li> Extremely light weight</li>
            <li> only took about 10 minutes to heat up and they worked great.  </li>
            <li> It is the perfect size, not too bulky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> It fit into my carry on bag.  </li>
            <li> This is a great starter for short to shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s as many as you get in many full size hot roller sets</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t know the difference between these and the smooth ones.</li>
            <li> : If done correctly these give great curls that last.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANTLY...</li>
            <li> My hair slid out of the roller before I could secure them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The curlers are a nice design, the clips work well, and overall I liked them.  </li>
            <li> Great compact travel curlers - they heat up fast and don&#x27;t take up much room in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for because I wanted more bigger rollers and the price was unbelievably good.</li>
            <li> I pack light, so each item I bring has to be worth the precious space in my carry-on bag.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use the right pins for the color of the curler rods.</li>
            <li> Listen, I don&#x27;t know what some other reviewers thought they were buying when they bought this set, but it works, it;s cheap, it;s well-made and incredibly convenient.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and is light and easy to carry in travel bag.</li>
            <li> but the unit heats up quickly and is easy to put away.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, are easy to use and take about 20 minutes to set.</li>
            <li> If you really want a good set, try a thermal setting spray, like Redken&#x27;s Hot Sets 22.</li>
            <li> These are a good value &amp;  if you have long hair they might work better than they did for me.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and easy to use.</li>
            <li> rollers heat up quickly, are easy to use and do not tangle the hair.</li>
            <li> I would really have liked about 3 more larger rollers, but then it wouldn&#x27;t be so nice and compact for traveling.</li>
            <li> just what I was after..great for traveling, take up very little space, and work great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple times and it heats up quickly in the zipper pouch, sets great, there are just enough rollers for what I need, and it&#x27;s compact.  </li>
            <li> These are a great product, and it&#x27;s difficult to find this style of roller in the market (and I&#x27;ve been shopping awhile), and it&#x27;s great to have 8 of the \\&quot;right size\\&quot; roller in a travel-size pack, and if one reads the directions (wink) then it really is better to follow the directions and leave the lid on while the rollers heat up so that they&#x27;ll heat up quicker.</li>
            <li> I know that the original purpose for these curlers was as a travelling set.  </li>
            <li> The case is small, perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> They work great on my long hair.</li>
            <li> The pins hold the rollers and the curlers work great in my long hair.</li>
            <li> Very pleased and surprised by this set.  </li>
            <li> They have sales pretty often on many drug store, and some department store stuff.</li>
            <li> They have sales pretty often on many drug store, and some department store stuff.</li>
            <li> Like it,fast heating could be more hot.</li>
            <li> I just got these today, and bought them on the recommendation of the many people who reviewed them, after first asking a number of questions.</li>
            <li> I bought these for travel, but I love these curlers so much I&#x27;m now using them at home!  </li>
            <li> The size of the rollers are fine for my short hair and the heat is a good</li>
            <li> I love my other set, but thought I&#x27;d try this one to see if I liked it better.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, there are better than my regular set</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations but let me tell you, I was so blown away by the how good my hair looked, even my husband was like WOW you should curl your hair more often.  </li>
            <li> The special &#x27;gripper teeth&#x27; on the curlers really do help hold the hair as you roll the curler, making these stay the most securely of any of the curler sets I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> The hot rollers are compact and fit easily in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li> they are super small and will be perfect for travel</li>
            <li> this is a good option for travel because you get more than the five jumbos in other travel cases.  </li>
            <li> I like it a lot better than my large set of Conair Ion shine curlers.</li>
            <li> but I wanted more large ones</li>
            <li> I love that they have 8 large rollers.</li>
            <li> The design is excellent, they get hot where they need to for curling, but there are little nubs on them that allow handling without getting my fingers burned.</li>
            <li> Second the curlers have teeth which I thought was great at first</li>
            <li> I bought the first one just for travel, but liked them so much</li>
            <li> It is good for traveling outside the US.</li>
            <li> I tried it 5 times and used different sprays to give it a good try.</li>
            <li> Everything about these rollers is great -- incredibly fast heat-up time, and they really curl your hair very well.  </li>
            <li> heat up is fast and the more you use them</li>
            <li> These heat up fast (they say two minutes, but I always give them five for more holding power).  </li>
            <li> Also, you need to leave them in for a good while if you want a solid curl.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than my last&lt;br /&gt;larger set and just as good.</li>
            <li> I get nice soft curls and body with the&lt;br /&gt;large rollers.  </li>
            <li> I am able to roll all of my hair on this set if I really push it</li>
            <li> If you really want to do your hair for the evening, you&#x27;re going to need something more.</li>
            <li> The curlers stay in so so - not bad -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good if you do not have the space to store the regular size one and need a quick curl every one in a while.</li>
            <li> If you heat them for ten min they&#x27;re good to go for a quick pick me up, heat them longer, the curl lasts longer.</li>
            <li> the plus side, I found that these rollers heated up quickly, and they gripped the hair well thanks to a combination of the combs on the rollers themselves and the included metal clips (although I would have preferred something a bit more updated--</li>
            <li> these wonderful little rollers give my hair an incredible bounce and curl, lots of compliments on my hair after using this product, easily to use heats up in minutes and is so small it is a pleasure to use, Highly recommend,</li>
            <li> Works really well, and is super light and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> I needed a compact set of hot rollers to trow in my suitcase for weekend trips and would heat up very quickly, and this product exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Make sure the curl is wound good and tight, to the roller or your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have a set of Conair rollers from 2008 that are flocked and work great, but the set only has 8 large rollers in it.</li>
            <li> great for foreign travel and cruise ships.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer of my other set was Remington and it was compact, did a great job with curling my hair</li>
            <li> I use them when I want super curly hair.  </li>
            <li> They do not heat up as quickly as I would like</li>
            <li> I did an almost perfect job, just by following the enclosed instructions (which were simple as pie).</li>
            <li> Shipping was super quick as always with Amazon.</li>
            <li> they heat up quickly and come with clips color coded.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and stay in my hair well.  </li>
            <li> The culers heat quickly.</li>
            <li> I have use many hot rollers and these are the first ones that just don&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li> Quick heating.  </li>
            <li> I returned these and bought the Conair Heatwaves set with the Jumbo-1 1/2&amp;#34; and Super Jumbo-1 3/4&#x27; rollers.</li>
            <li> They heated up quickly.  </li>
            <li> and they heat quickly.  </li>
            <li> they made my hair super curly..not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly.   </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t work for those of us that like jumbo and super jumbo rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick heat/ dual voltage.</li>
            <li> The curlers do an adequate job</li>
            <li> stars for quickly heating and cooling.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and the starter strip helps hold the hair to get the roller started.</li>
            <li> They are quick to heat up and use.  </li>
            <li> Curlers heat quickly and clips work well.  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly.</li>
            <li> Small set, heat up quickly, great results, easy to travel with....</li>
            <li> I decided to give these a try...and they are compact, heat fairly quickly, and did a good job curling my long hair.</li>
            <li> It is very compact and light weight, and it does a great job as long as you take the time to do it right.  </li>
            <li> They get very hot</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Other than that, It&#x27;s looks to be a nice product even though I wasn&#x27;t able to try it out.</li>
            <li> But I found that by experimenting with the length of time heating, and amount of time the curlers were left in the hair, the curls turned out great, and also held their curl much better than my regular electric curlers would do.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get very hot though.</li>
            <li> * Size - they are small and will be ideal in a suitcase&lt;</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t get very hot, they didn&#x27;t curly my hair</li>
            <li> That will give you curl for a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that just touches my shoulders, and I like curling it once and awhile for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my new instant heat curlers - within two minutes they are well heated and was able to use.</li>
            <li> Replaced those with another travel Remington set (still working) &amp; bought these to have more large hot rollers.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, get nice and hot, and my hair has soft, bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li> Heats up super fast and leaves my normally impossible to curl pin straight hair with beautiful bouncy perfect curls!</li>
            <li> I am very surprised to learn that this unit heat up within 10 minutes!!!!</li>
            <li> Small and lightweight so fit great in carry on.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and is very compact.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Very lightweight &amp; easy to pack.</li>
            <li> It is also very compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Compact, easy to transport and very functional.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers they heat up fast, &amp; stay hot.</li>
            <li> They took 5 minutes to heat up, and even then weren&#x27;t hot enough to hold a good curl.</li>
            <li> It is very compact, easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little more than the \\&quot;instant\\&quot; that is advertised by Conair, but it does heat up nicely in a shorter period of time than my full set of Clairol rollers.  </li>
            <li> even with the heat and humidity here, curls last for more than 10 hours!</li>
            <li> After that 5 minutes, they are really hot!  </li>
            <li> These hot rollers have saved my frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> Would prefer larger and even better if flocked!</li>
            <li> These are not the hot rollers your mother used!  </li>
            <li> Only became a mild warm just would not heat up.</li>
            <li> they heat right up quickly and the curl lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I have fine, long-ish hair and these curlers worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> These seem to be fine for what they are  -very compact.</li>
            <li> I bought it for traveling so it would fit in my luggage instead of dragging my large set</li>
            <li> Great little set to travel with.  </li>
            <li> Great compact rollers to take on the go with you and takes up a little room in your suitcase or bag.  </li>
            <li> These work great and take up so little room in my already cramped bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is a great little set.  </li>
            <li> This little hair setter is so compact and will be great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I was very reluctant to buy this at all, especially on line because like most women my hair is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really like these, easy to put in, don&#x27;t get super hot as some others do</li>
            <li> These are easy to wrap around the curler, quick to heat up, and leave a great long lasting wave.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s compact size and finally a unit with more than &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; large curlers in it (something I&#x27;ve been searching for years to find) -- however it provides such a great curl -- I&#x27;m using it exclusively now.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re neatly put together, compact and the clips secure the rollers very well.  </li>
            <li> But the size is amazing; it&#x27;s tiny!</li>
            <li> Our millionares who own the China plants, dont pay for quality, dont blame the Chinese for U.S. greed.  </li>
            <li> They need to be ordered separately but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> The problem I have with this set is that some of the rollers do not heat up correctly and others only get warm.  </li>
            <li> However, at this price, this is well worth it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re faster and hold better than my old clunky set.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a set of all larger rollers.  </li>
            <li> After placing the curlers, 15 minutes later I had a nice curl.  </li>
            <li> Had my old set for years...was so glad to see they still make these.  </li>
            <li> thought this was well worth the price</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter to use when traveling, easier than a curling iron, she absolutely loves them and wants more.</li>
            <li> The compact size is great for traveling, the soft case is easy to fit in a small suitcase.</li>
            <li> Very handy little kit.</li>
            <li> They heat up pretty fast and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Every electrical outlet works perfectly and other products work as they should, so obviously there is a defect in the product that I received.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is quick to heat but doesn&#x27;t get so hot that she can&#x27;t touch the curlers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I tried the quick method of hot rollers instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use the Conair Hot Roller Super Clips.</li>
            <li> Overall,this is a really great little set of hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> This item didn&#x27;t really heat up hot enough for me to get a good curl.  </li>
            <li> Of course using a flat iron at the roots, and lifting spray or some sort of super-hold- gel will help lift the root area really nicely.</li>
            <li> I did not buy the right size.</li>
            <li> I did like the rollers because they were just the right size and my hair stayed in them well .</li>
            <li> so everything stays right together.  </li>
            <li> right for someone on the go.</li>
            <li> Right number of rollers in each size.</li>
            <li> lips, the quantity is just right for my hair.</li>
            <li> have the rollers in my hair right now</li>
            <li> The pouch is the right size for home or travel.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for traveling</li>
            <li> When removing the Remington rollers, the rollers fall right out and the curl is shiny and in one piece.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did do my homework and feel I made the right chose.  </li>
            <li> Best money I have spent in a long time.</li>
            <li> I was surprised as I always use Conair hot curlers and love them.  </li>
            <li> But about a month in they stopped getting hot and would only get slightly warm.  </li>
            <li> On a positive note, they do heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, are pretty easy to roll (thanks to the extra strip of teeth on each roller) and the clips hold the rollers very well, even with my very fine, slippery hair.  </li>
            <li> Fekkai makes a great lifting spray, it is pricey, but it takes very little to just do the crown</li>
            <li> I had a great small travel set used 4 times a week for 10 plus years.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling or for a small space.</li>
            <li> It is small &amp; compact - works great.</li>
            <li> Great for travel, small and compact.</li>
            <li> In addition, they didn&#x27;t seem to grip my fine, straight hair very well.</li>
            <li> My regular ceramic hot rollers would have required a huge energy transformer to use, so I put them in storage and got these with the clips to make it easy.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, short to medium length hair and had no problems keeping these in my hair.  </li>
            <li> --it heats up quickly, it&#x27;s easy to use (no hot poles to burn your hand on as you reach for more rollers)</li>
            <li> This set of hot curlers is just right for me...</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and are reasonably price too.  </li>
            <li> The rollers did not get warm enough to really do anything for your hair.</li>
            <li> This set does not take up much counter space, and it heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Theses rollers heat up quickly and set your hair fast.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, are very compact and find I&#x27;m using them quite a bit at home to freshen my hair or change the look.</li>
            <li> My hair is longer on top and need a few more rollers.</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and curls my hair very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Rollers heat up SUPER fast</li>
            <li> I also own the  Conair Compact Hairsetter, Blue, but don&#x27;t like it nearly as much.  </li>
            <li> Mine runs slightly longer, but they still hold pretty good.</li>
            <li> hair is very straight and the combs on the rollers help to keep each section on the roller as I am turning the curler.  </li>
            <li> I like these rollers very much.  </li>
            <li> But, since the old rollers do not have dual voltage, are heavy, and bulky---this new set was a GREAT find!</li>
            <li> This little package of curlers takes up minimum space while supplying a fair amount of curlers.  </li>
            <li> Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count]] (also purchased on Amazon) b/c I wanted to not have to depend on the little metal clips; the super clips work really well, but there&#x27;s no place to store them which kind of defeats the purpose of having a travel size curlers, but if you like the wire clips, then you are all set.  </li>
            <li> I would have rated them higher if my first set hadn&#x27;t died a very, very premature death.</li>
            <li> They do not get hot at all and therefore do not work to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> expect them to work like hot rollers once made in the US, however.  </li>
            <li> I have a set of Clairol Hot Rollers from 1969 that I STILL use (no lie).  </li>
            <li> I have never used hot rollers before, and was apprehensive about having to do it for my sister&#x27;s wedding in a month.</li>
            <li> The rollers are hot on your fingers.</li>
            <li> Would love it though if I could find a set like this with eight rollers one size bigger.</li>
            <li> I love this item because it has enough curlers to finish all my hair</li>
            <li> I put away one of the heating elements and just insert a extras rollers into the heating element when i take one out, and its hot by the time I get to that roller.</li>
            <li> ...mission accomplished!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been awhile since I used hot rollers and was hoping I could use these</li>
            <li> This hot roller set is dual voltage.</li>
            <li> And it is only $9 more).</li>
            <li> I ordered these compact hot rollers for a trip we are planning to the UK.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Conair hot rollers to replace a \\&quot;vintage\\&quot; set.  </li>
            <li> These got warm, but not really warm enough to make a good curl.</li>
            <li> It really did nothing!</li>
            <li> I searched the beauty supply stores and online and could not locate the exact size pins I needed.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not too happy is the amount of rollers, should have at least a pair more, but I will manage.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t seem like they get hot</li>
            <li> I have to leave early in the morning to park for free in a parking garage before they start charging</li>
            <li> they could be a tad larger but are ok.</li>
            <li> say that I love them on a regular basis...</li>
            <li> I tried to use these when I first go them.</li>
            <li> Using hot rollers as opposed to a curling iron, my hair is fuller, curlier and softer.  </li>
            <li> but I think  some kind of light dampness is the key to lasting longer.</li>
            <li> but I think  some kind of light dampness is the key to lasting longer.</li>
            <li> I love this product and  I got a lot of compliments about my hair recently</li>
            <li> I used to have the hot rollers from years ago.  </li>
            <li> would recommend that you put a gel or mousse on your hair first that way the curl lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Great product, small and very packable.</li>
            <li> The hot rollers work well</li>
            <li> Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li> It is nice and small and fit well in my suitcase for travel.</li>
            <li> seems like it takes a while to heat up, sure isn&#x27;t instant like advertised.  </li>
            <li> The extra clipsI I purchased which were supposed be better also didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> There is no way to know when the curlers are hot.  </li>
            <li> Used the product for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> The rollers get hot, yes - they have to to do their job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never had hot rollers</li>
            <li> Have used these numerous times and love them.  </li>
            <li> and my first impressions are how hot they didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time this a.m. ....</li>
            <li> pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So we searched &amp; searched for Dual Voltage hot rollers -</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading reviews for these curlers - I bought these hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> If they would have just heated up they would get a much higher review.</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t curl the way I&#x27;m used to hot rollers curling.  </li>
            <li> They never get truly hot and so the curl does not hold up well during the day.</li>
            <li> On top of that the curl lasts me a second day!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Handling: The Conair rollers were easier to handle and they didn&#x27;t seem to get as hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> I give a few minutes to get good and hot</li>
            <li> just about ten minutes, my hair is transformed into bouncy curls that I&#x27;ve never been able to have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like they get as hot as my full-size set</li>
            <li> Very Handy...great for travel!</li>
            <li> Rollers take about 10 minutes to get really hot.</li>
            <li> I revised this because, after contacting Conair customer service, they readily shipped a new type of clip, the pin-like ones, for free.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for travel and they really get hot.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the extra bonus, they curlers are super light weight and compact</li>
            <li> will soon let you know how much is just right.  </li>
            <li> Fast heating up right in bag.  </li>
            <li> The Conair rollers are hard plastic, with a &amp;#34;starting strip.&amp;#34; I thought the starting strip made it easier to wrap my hair around the roller without the shorter hair popping out, and they stayed more securely in my hair while it was setting, however, when removing the rollvers, they kind of got stuck in my hair and &amp;#34;combed&amp;#34; out the curl a bit, making the curl fuzzy.</li>
            <li> If you have short hair, this is ideal, but for longer hair, it makes the curl too tight, hence the need for JUMBO rollers.</li>
            <li> And there are more of the large rollers than there were in my big set.  </li>
            <li> These fit well on small countertops and in any suitcase very easily.  </li>
            <li> Good that there are more big rollers than the small.</li>
            <li> so I got these to warm them up, pop them in and do my other thing like make-up and such.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Surprising how many curlers you get in a small package, especially when compared to my 20+-year-old 5-curler travel set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I stuck them under the sink and completely forgot that I was once excited about them.  </li>
            <li> The perfume fragrance isn&#x27;t strong enough and doesn&#x27;t last more then an hour.  </li>
            <li> If you use \\&quot;end papers\\&quot; (I just use a sheet of folded toilet paper), it will grab your hair ends better when rolling it.  </li>
            <li> with much more satisfactory results and much longer lasting styling.  </li>
            <li> These are ok - don&#x27;t seem to get that hot and the pins don&#x27;t stay in my hair (maybe because my hair is quite long).</li>
            <li> I will stick to my curling irons or my foam curlers to get real curls, real fast, with real convenience.  </li>
            <li> For anyone who uses hot rollers, the picture looks as if you would be receiving large and medium sized rollers.  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly..not too hot, packs easily, just wish rollers were slightly bigger.</li>
            <li> did not hold heat and took forever to get somewhat hot,  much prefer the Remington travel rollers</li>
            <li> They do heat up pretty fast</li>
            <li> they heat up fast and the dont take up much space!</li>
            <li> They warmed up very fast (I&#x27;d say 2-5 minutes), and gave my hair a nice curl, (though a little bumpy in places).</li>
            <li> I use them everyday not just for travel, nice and compact, heat fast enough for me tho maybe not quite as quickly as others and the curl they give is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have the large 30 set of hot rollers and this 12 piece travel set gets so much hotter in just 3-4 minutes</li>
            <li> other thing REALLY IMPORTANT about these, is THEY HAVE THE NICE TEETH to grip your hair-a really big deal.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of hot rollers if you have short hair or want tight curls.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad these rollers do not burn or dry out my hair like a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I use them every day in place of a much larger set that wasn&#x27;t nearly as easy to use.</li>
            <li> Rollers are considered large , not jumbo as I needed.</li>
            <li> It would have 5 stars if there were some large rollers, which is my preference.</li>
            <li> Definitely a smart purchase.</li>
            <li> Before making my purchase I read reviews from others who had purchased these curlers on Amazon, so I was prepared for certain shortcomings.  </li>
            <li> Also, you certainly can&#x27;t beat the cost.  </li>
            <li> You get 8 Large and 4 medium</li>
            <li> The write up says these rollers are large and jumbo.  </li>
            <li> It is certainly compact for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rollers are advertised as large and medium.  </li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, along with large clamps for her to use instead of the pins that are included with the curlers.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping the large rollers would be 1.25 inch diameter where the hair goes.  </li>
            <li> The large rollers are 1.25 inch where your fingers touch on the outer rim.  </li>
            <li> ; large.</li>
            <li> It takes more than fifteen minutes for mine to heat up completely and even then it doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough because the curls will fall after about an hour with hairspray.</li>
            <li> There are definitely some good things about it--and it is certainly sized nicely for travel if that&#x27;s your main purpose in purchasing it--but due to both the roller size and limited number of rollers, the usefulness of this set restricted.</li>
            <li> The grooves on each one seem to grab onto the hair and separate to give more curl and don&#x27;t get the loose ends to retrieve onto the curler like others I have had.</li>
            <li> These gave my hair a nice curl (not too tight), lots of body and shine, and the style lasted all day.  </li>
            <li> You can get the hair to roll nice and tight without a lot of slippage.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My tabletop curlers are jumbo size, but since I recently had my hair relaxed these large and medium size rollers would do just fine.  </li>
            <li> The layout of the set was nice and small/compact but a little bulky for travelling--the new ones I just bought, Remington H-1015, have a more streamlined design for about the same amount of curlers</li>
            <li> but they totally get tangled in my fine hair when I&#x27;m trying to remove them.  </li>
            <li> but someone with short hair would be fine.  </li>
            <li> They heated up quickly, came with the metal clips (these are the ones I learned to use way back when hot rollers first came out), and had no odor.  </li>
            <li> I really want Large rollers.  </li>
            <li> The next time, I let them heat up for a good 15-20 minutes and they did get quite hot (not as hot as my regular Conair curlers, but hot enough).</li>
            <li> This beats having a large set that takes up too much room.  </li>
            <li> Nice little space saver for traveling.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little traveler pack.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and the small size makes it easy to pack.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, short to medium length, and very layered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had long, fine hair when I first received this.</li>
            <li> I thought rollers were a little bigger, but they are still great.</li>
            <li> You need very ylittle spritz to get the curls to stay nice for a few days.</li>
            <li> You need very ylittle spritz to get the curls to stay nice for a few days.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast.</li>
            <li> They are really light and compact and heat just as well as my regular ones.</li>
            <li> but it cost 4x as much.</li>
            <li> and they also retain their heat much longer as well.</li>
            <li> The clips held my hair very well.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast and work really well.  </li>
            <li> Heats fast.  </li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t available locally, so Amazon.com to the rescue.  </li>
            <li> It would have been very helpful if the size of the rollers was included in the description of the product.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast and curlers have grip teeth that really work.  </li>
            <li> I also ordered then I&#x27;ll be ready to go.</li>
            <li> It is as advertised, heats fast,</li>
            <li> I really like these compact rollers.  </li>
            <li> It really curled my hair and the curl lasted throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re fast to use</li>
            <li> they heat up FAST</li>
            <li> WORKS FAST, AND NO PROBLEMS WITH IT.</li>
            <li> They do heat up fast and they work well.</li>
            <li> They do heat up fast</li>
            <li> Very compact, which is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I really like these compact rollers.</li>
            <li> Very compact and would travel well,</li>
            <li> Yup, it WOULD help if there really were JUMBO rollers just like these..</li>
            <li> It seems to be ready in 5 min.  </li>
            <li> very compact..practical for refrshing your do.&lt;br /&gt;Iif</li>
            <li> the starter grab row really works.</li>
            <li> They travel very well.</li>
            <li> I brush mine straight and use conair in the ends.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like these rollers so much</li>
            <li> Heat up fast, work well, and pack well for travel.</li>
            <li> The heat up fast and don&#x27;t burn my fingers.</li>
            <li> The heat up fast and don&#x27;t burn my fingers.</li>
            <li> I really like these curlers.</li>
            <li> If you want real curly hair, then you need to get these.</li>
            <li> and then I am ready to go.</li>
            <li> but I bot it to travel with and won&#x27;t need it too much.</li>
            <li> Have they cheapened them so much to save money that they no longer work?    </li>
            <li> Heated up fast.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast.</li>
            <li> Very compact for travel.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much room in the suitcase?</li>
            <li> Thanks conair.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I can leave it in my suitcase so it is always at the ready.</li>
            <li> I like that the set has the traditional skinny hair pins to secure each roller.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate them</li>
            <li> I had a set of these that I used very often</li>
            <li> They are, however, much preferable to the Remington H-1015 set.</li>
            <li> just make sure you leave them in the pouch and have the pouch closed while heating.  </li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t really heat well.  </li>
            <li> They work fast and the curl lasts</li>
            <li> Heat very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So convenient on trips--they fit anywhere, and take up next to no room in a suitcase.  </li>
            <li> They heat up fast and REALLY curl.</li>
            <li> Very compact.</li>
            <li> The only thing I miss is there is no indicator light to remind me</li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions, they say to heat them in the bag with the lid closed for more efficient heating.  </li>
            <li> Very compact.</li>
            <li> They are convenient and extremely fast to heat up.  </li>
            <li> too much work</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really get the curls I wanted.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t do much for the roots.</li>
            <li> it is much easier to use and doesn&#x27;t burn my fingers.</li>
            <li> Heat up fast, compact for traveling and really get the job done.</li>
            <li> and then when I took them off, my hair was already straight again by the time I was finished taking them out.</li>
            <li> Did not curl very well</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly - because I had to use SO much hair in each roller the curls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking it could be my stick straight hair that won&#x27;t cooperate.  </li>
            <li> My six year old grand daughter loves her instant hair styling set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to completely peel back the plastic cover when the rollers are heating.</li>
            <li> it was excellent and if not for the base gradually breaking apart where the rollers fit (probably a fire hazard)</li>
            <li> I have to constantly reposition curlers so that they all get warm enough to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> I left them plugged in for 20 minutes and they were only slightly warm to the touch.</li>
            <li> the roller itself is kind of oval rather than round.</li>
            <li> Would love a compact set of 8 rollers in a soft case just a 1/4 inch larger in diameter than the largest ones in this set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d this travel set is good, just not for thick longer hair.</li>
            <li> They do take longer to warm up than my previous hot rollers and don&#x27;t get as hot but hot enough for me.</li>
            <li> However, to my regret, the rollers do not heat up quickly or get hot enough to give my hair a real curl.</li>
            <li> Although the cord comes wrapped up outside the case, I&#x27;ve found it can be easily coiled around the top of all the curlers, tucking the plug down inside, and the zipper can be zipped virtually all the way around the case.  </li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, but just barely hot enough.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have other rollers that cost 3x as much, but they really aren&#x27;t 3x better.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my new set of hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> The first set barely got warm enough to put a little wave in my hair, and my hair curls fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> The starter strip is a small row of little prongs that grip your hair perfectly, allows you to NOT make fishhook ends--and DON&#x27;T tangle.  </li>
            <li> Nice color-coated clips don&#x27;t leave dent in your hair, they heat up fast and take up very little room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice and small and heats up really fast</li>
            <li> What happened to the old days when hot rollers really were \\&quot;hot\\&quot;?  </li>
            <li> I have long but fine hair</li>
            <li> I rarely use hair curlers so my first (and to date only)</li>
            <li> Although the rollers themselves are somewhat oval in shape, I really didn&#x27;t think the finished curl looks any different than with a round roller; however, I think the oval shape allows you to set the roller closer to your head for a more secure set.  </li>
            <li> These are easy to use and they heat up quickly, but the curl doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
            <li> Fast to heat and three of us used them to get ready for New Years Eve 2013.  </li>
            <li> Despite the fact that my hair is thinner than it was back when I first used hot rollers, I still need 20 of them: sixteen large and four</li>
            <li> Trashed that set (which I paid about $35 for) and paid half as much for this one which is a better size and creates nicer looking curls for me.</li>
            <li> : They both use similar pins to secure the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;-Surface: The Remington rollers a kind of velvety black smooth surface with some slight ridges.</li>
            <li> They heat quickly and stay hot for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> The curlers get hot very quickly and remain hot long enough to thoroughly set the curl.  </li>
            <li> They are nice and small and traveled well to London without be a suitcase hog.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for rollers that will give hair below your shoulders a nice bounce, these rollers are to small to do the job.</li>
            <li> Everything is handy in a small case.</li>
            <li> When I first got these, I was concerned over how old it looked.</li>
            <li> Okay product, does the job, I hate having to write more words, I&#x27;m done, if you want more words</li>
            <li> Would have given it five starts but does not get as hot as my old set</li>
            <li> I have another which are all the same sized rollers and therefore not quite as good since my hair at the back is too short to hold them.</li>
            <li> I wanted one set of 20 rollers, which is a fairly standard number of rollers for setting a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> Small and handy</li>
            <li> I tried them twice trying to use them to their full potential and both times the curlers did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad thing, but I will buy some larger ones now to supplement.  </li>
            <li> Make sure they are pushed down in their case while heating.  </li>
            <li> Make sure the rollers are pushed all the way down onto the posts so they make contact and can heat up.  </li>
            <li> you have to make sure all the rolles are pushed down on the heater.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, as it is fast heating, and contains more rollers than I have ever had in a small, very portable hair setter.</li>
            <li> I just take out the case, plug it directly into the wall, and within a few minutes I unzip the top and have 12 curlers hot and ready.</li>
            <li> My hair is much fuller, much bouncier, with much more long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> Just doing your ends is fairly quick, much easier and faster than a curling iron or twisting a flat iron over and over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rollers make a better curl than the rollers I was previously using.</li>
            <li> They were definitely hot enough, but not too hot to hold.</li>
            <li> Gives me decent curls without taking up all my luggage space.</li>
            <li> Good for occasional use, but a bit of a pain for everyday.</li>
            <li> The rollers get hot enough, but not so hot that they burn my hands.</li>
            <li> I thought I might need two boxes since I prefer the blue rollers and wasnt sure I&#x27;d have enough, but the 8 rollers provided do the job</li>
            <li> there are twelve rollers and that is not enough for me, but is probably enough for most people&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I am using the same product currently and love it.  </li>
            <li> The smaller rollers were better, yet there was only four of them, so their use was limited.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to learn quickly to handle only the ends.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> big issue is the same as most everyone else.</li>
            <li> The Conair Hot (Warm) Rollers work, but the clips are tight and they don&#x27;t get as hot as I had expected.</li>
            <li> I will more than likely purchase another just to have more curlers since I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out a little and don&#x27;t want to risk not having enough.</li>
            <li> I had an old one by conair that only had 8 curlers which were never enough nor did they curl so well and twelves is perfect for me at least.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given that these rollers do not ever reach a high temperature, they might not work as well for people whose hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl well.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> But I guess all products with high heat will eventually damage hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> For those two reasons I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> They take up very little space &amp; are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The Remington rollers are fine to handle on the ends, but sometimes a little too hot to hold in the middle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This set does warm up with 90 seconds as advertised but it is not hot enough.</li>
            <li> Usually curls and holds curls very easily.</li>
            <li> I love this little set.  </li>
            <li> They heat up super quick and set my hair in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> This hot roller set is fantastic and takes up so little room.  </li>
            <li> Extremely compact case that seems easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Too bad, it could have been perfect for use at home and for travel.</li>
            <li> The starter combs on the rollers are useless and cause some issues when putting the clips in but great product.</li>
            <li> it IS important to leave the case closed as directed.</li>
            <li> Finally have hot rollers I don&#x27;t mind bringing along on my travels since they don&#x27;t take much space and are lightweight yet do the job.</li>
            <li> After the it had been plugged in for at least 30 minutes, the curlers were barely warm.  </li>
            <li> It is also necessasry to leave them in your hair longer than you might normally do so.  </li>
            <li> I have normal weight hair and length.</li>
            <li> They do not get hot enough to really make any difference.</li>
            <li> Also,I smelled &#x27;pukey plastic&#x27; on the Rems after about 5 minutes, the Remingtons seem to just be one more toxic-junk roller set, with no grip, and an extra sheet of soft plastic on the outside of the roller, making the gaseous smell when heated.</li>
            <li> Practice, lasting results are worth the learning curve on updated,</li>
            <li> Just wish there were a few more of them in the set.  </li>
            <li> There are just enough curlers for a complete hair setting, and more than enough for a touchup......</li>
            <li> would not buy this again, although such setting products are probably all pretty much alike.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying and keeping the Conair Compact Hairsetter (in blue); it&#x27;s a little clunkier to travel with but delivers much better results and has the right number of rollers.</li>
            <li> Very compact for travel, fast heat up and cool down.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I would like more of the large curlers, but that&#x27;s just personal preference.  </li>
            <li> Medium&#x27; rollers are small diameter, but the 8 larger rollers were  adequate to set the top layers of my med.</li>
            <li> When I recently traveled, I used another, larger set of rollers that heat up quickly and hot.  </li>
            <li> I heated these up for a very long time (just to make sure) and then left them on my hair until they well fully cooled</li>
            <li> With more experience, I can do my hair to look professional in less than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, if you get it just right, the pins hold</li>
            <li> These are all right in a pinch.i wish they where larger rollers.</li>
            <li> We have had no problems at all with them not getting warm enough like some reviewers and they stay in her hair (super thick, long, and straight) very well.  </li>
            <li> I have alot of hair and when I saw these, I feared they would not be large enough to roll my whole head.</li>
            <li> It was a cute idea for travel, but for my purposes, it had too few rollers and never quite got hot enough.</li>
            <li> Purchased these with high hopes but they do not even get hot enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> i live in the philippines</li>
            <li> Since I am leaving on a trip, I do not have time to return and receive a new item.</li>
            <li> a new one for me.</li>
            <li> I presume it was a new product.</li>
            <li> curl pretty fast (maybe 7 minutes or less) and the curl holds on fine, flat, overbleached, overcooked, dried-out hair, shoulder length, -for</li>
            <li> I have fine textured long hair, straight with a slight wave, easy to curl but tends to fall flat.  </li>
            <li> But for someone else with thin hair or super-fine hair that slides off the roller, then the starting strip is a great idea.</li>
            <li> I finally settled on the Conair HS28X Instant Heat Compact Styling Setter primarily for its compact size and the fact that the curlers came in two sizes.  </li>
            <li> Regrettably, this hair setter is no improvement over the one I used 20 years ago:&lt;br /&gt;rollers are heavy, the starter strip doesn&#x27;t really help the roller grip hair stands for a smooth, neat roll-up and the metal clips are a pain to slip on the rollers.</li>
            <li> But, the process would be cut by half, if I had have used a strong watts unit.</li>
            <li> , I am looking for hot air curlers of sufficient number that are all super-jumbo or at least a true jumbo size!</li>
            <li> and I can easily handle them, clips are tight</li>
            <li> They are all that I had hoped they would be: compact and easy to cary or store, heat up fast and don&#x27;t burn your fingers when you use them, give lasting curl in a short amount of time (left them in 5 to 10 min.)  </li>
            <li> I bought these recently at a local drugstore, and tried them today for the first time.</li>
            <li> Curlers Would not heat up hot enough to roll.</li>
            <li> The size was a concern for me because the last set of hot rollers I had were in my check in luggage and the case got destroyed by the airlines.  </li>
            <li> First, while they do indeed heat up in just a couple of minutes, it is only a \\&quot;surface charge.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Overall I highly recommend it though!!</li>
            <li> also, I didn&#x27;t like the pins--the curlers kept on flopping around on my head and just weren&#x27;t hot enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> And the curlers don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I have bigger sets of hot rollers</li>
            <li> Short hair is so much easier to manage!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers in decades but purchased these for a recent trip.  </li>
            <li> By the time I had the last curler in, it was time to take out the first one.</li>
            <li> This is the second set of Conair hot rollers that I&#x27;ve purchased in two years.  </li>
            <li> I love these and have used them often over the past two years.</li>
            <li> This is my second set, only because I needed more larger sizes.</li>
            <li> Does not get as hot as I am accustomed to, but works just the same.</li>
            <li> I would buy this exact same one if I had it to do over again.</li>
            <li> If you like smaller, hot curlers, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> Have to heat up twice to have enough and the look was straight out of the 80s!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a set of rollers on the small side you should love these.</li>
            <li> The rollers don&#x27;t stay hot for long and generally didn&#x27;t seem all that hot.  </li>
            <li> No different than the hot curlers of 40 years ago...disappointed.</li>
            <li> But they ARE hot enough.</li>
            <li> I also found that the youtube link that one other posters put was helpful because I never thought about putting the little rollers at the bottom, but they work great this way and only needed the one set.    </li>
            <li> I find that the clips hold the curlers securely in place (unlike other brands!)</li>
            <li> Ceramic rollers are just the right temperature, never get dirty, and clean easily if they would.  </li>
            <li> works amazingly for such a small set ...</li>
            <li> -kind of wish it was all just the bigger rollers, but small ones do the job</li>
            <li> These are definitely compact and a nice size for travel, but DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> my old roller set from the 1970s had the EXACT same clips).  </li>
            <li> They might be fine for women with short hair who wish to have a curly result, but are not the right product for long hair in loose unstructured waves.</li>
            <li> Only down side, did not come with the clips, so check to make sure they did not leave yours out.</li>
            <li> , maybe i can buy one of those in their store.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that I can only say positive things about this product.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair that curls perfectly using Conair&#x27;s soft flocked curlers, so I hoped these would work, but they were a disappointment.</li>
            <li> My set barely got warm even though I left them plugged in for over 20 minutes while I showered and dried my hair.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I don&#x27;t get the satisfying click when I place the curler on it&#x27;s base, but for the most part it&#x27;s doing exactly what I wanted it to:  </li>
            <li> The clips included have their own little pocket so you don&#x27;t loose them and the rollers heat up well.</li>
            <li> The actual box the rollers came in was worn and slightly torn and looked like it had been opened many times.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much out of these but wanted something that would heat quickly &amp; not take up much space.</li>
            <li> The only moderate curl I got was on the very first one I managed to put</li>
            <li> Every other rollers I&#x27;ve had get so hot that you can hardly stand to handle them, but these were barely warm at all.</li>
            <li> I only wish the \\&quot;large\\&quot; rollers were actually large.</li>
            <li> The large ones are smaller than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> The REM&#x27;s \\&quot;large rollers&#x27; are a tad thicker, but you only get 4 of them?</li>
            <li> I purchased these to replace a set of Conair Big Curls after a large piece of the case broke off.</li>
            <li> Wish the large rollers were slightly larger.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a second set this week as 12 rollers really aren&#x27;t enough to give the set I like, but 2 sets of these rollers is still less than a lot of setters out there with more rollers--and I&#x27;ll have a compact set for travel.  </li>
            <li> I like the little pocket the wires fit into too.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy with the rapidity of the delivery and the product works just fine, but was disappointed that the rollers were so small.</li>
            <li> I found that the curls from this roller set quickly fell out and the curls made from my other set stayed in for hours.</li>
            <li> The small curler posts also fit the big rollers so you could purchase 4 more large rollers to replace the 4 small ones if you wanted to.</li>
            <li> I thought the rollers would be bigger, but they really are for shorter hair or tighter curls than I like . .</li>
            <li> They hear fast and the curls last.</li>
            <li> Since she travels frequently she loves the soft sides and the variety of curlers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it much and the curl does not last as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I like the compact size and the soft sided carring case makes it easier for packing to take on trips.</li>
            <li> I use the old clips that came with my old set</li>
            <li> wow............</li>
            <li> Everyone said, the curl looks natural and look like I walk out from the salon.</li>
            <li> &quot; you need for longer lasting styles, you really need to let them heat up about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> They work just like my larger set but are much easier to travel with.</li>
            <li> I bought these while traveling and am surprised at how well they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If they had just heated up more I would have given it least 4 stars.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty long.</li>
            <li> Stuck with them now as it would cost too much to ship back.  </li>
            <li> these rollers are NOT round.</li>
            <li> The clips that hold the roller in the hair are much too short.  </li>
            <li> It is soft sided</li>
            <li> My hair is poker straight and just above my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I like them, but I really wish they all heated up at the same rate</li>
            <li> Compact, soft case, weighs about 1 lb.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> - this may be really undesirable for some people who want big waves.</li>
            <li> Doing those two things worked well as far as heating the curlers.  </li>
            <li> This was supposed to arrive with clips to secure the curlers and those were missing from the box.  </li>
            <li> but I like them so far.</li>
            <li> But after reading much research on voltage converters - they are not suggested for heating elements such as curlers, irons, straighteners and stuff.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised with these travel curlers.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get stuck in your hair like the old type.  </li>
            <li> Second, the medium-sized rollers really didn&#x27;t work very well for me, as my hair was too short for them</li>
            <li> Do not buy these rollers they are not round but oval</li>
            <li> I wondered if it really was dual voltage between the US and Europe, but it actually is, without any visible switch to turn on.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping this was going to work for travel, but there not enough curlers to set all my hair.</li>
            <li> but I manage to get a complete set.  </li>
            <li> There are not enough to get the curls you really want with this.</li>
            <li> Only reason I am rating a 4 is because I wish there were a few more rollers.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast, holds heat enough to curl my hair, easy to use the two sizes of curlers and It takes up little space in my suitcase!</li>
            <li> They heat up and cool down as needed.  </li>
            <li> Or reheat some if hair is not dry enough the first time.</li>
            <li> (Conair has two or three other roller sets with 580 watts or more--the one with 580 watts heat up and ready for use in two minutes!!</li>
            <li> My curls looked pretty but didn&#x27;t hold very long.</li>
            <li> However, only the curlers sold with or in addition to this set will fit the heating rod so don&#x27;t plan on using any other curlers you have with this set.</li>
            <li> Small, compact and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li> The small compact design makes for easy storage.</li>
            <li> i have normal hair, not too thick but not too fine.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin straight hair, and let the rollers warm up for almost 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I returned it, didn&#x27;t have instant heat, didn&#x27;t even get hot enough to style my hair.</li>
            <li> all the rolling would go quickly, in about half the time.</li>
            <li> The larger roller size that I used in the past seemed to straighten my hair more than curl it, but these leave my medium length hair with loads of curls and body.</li>
            <li> they do get hot enough, just not instantly (like it says on the box)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mainly use the larger curlers and don&#x27;t have any issues with the clips.</li>
            <li> There are 8 medium-sized rollers and 4 smaller rollers, and this is the main flaw of this set.  </li>
            <li> I compared these sets under the exact same conditions, since I used them at the same time.</li>
            <li> I compared these sets under the exact same conditions, since I used them at the same time.</li>
            <li> Heated up fast and cooled down fast.</li>
            <li> size of the large rollers in this set is just a bit smaller than the large in my other Conair set-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Jumbo is a non-existent size,far as I know,  in this old style of heavier/better type of rollers, apparently.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I recently had my hair styled and thought curlers would help me maintain the style--unfortunately the curlers were too small, they really didn&#x27;t heat up as fast as the instructions said they would, I also had trouble making sure they were connected to the heat source--</li>
            <li> For minimal money, makes these and all hot curlers a breeze.</li>
            <li> I have a larger set of heat curlers I normally use and bought these for a trip since  they are compact.</li>
            <li> I have choose to use my large plastic clips from Hot Rollers past.  </li>
            <li> By the end of 3 hours with the Conair compact, my hair would be pretty much uncurled, with maybe some slight curling left at the ends.</li>
            <li> A new hairstyle needed different size curlers.  </li>
            <li> I plug them in when I start to blow dry and they are ready by the time I am done, which is probably about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in nearly 40 years, I have let my hair grow long, but I can&#x27;t let the hair dry naturally</li>
            <li> I have so much hair that when dyeing my hair at salons I need double the amt of chemicals) and yet one set was enough.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, considered frizzy and unmanageable cut into a long bob that touches my shoulders and these rollers and thier long lasting heat is enough to control my hair and gives it really soft shiny frizz free curls.</li>
            <li> I ordered several extra curlers which work well and heat up fast.  </li>
            <li> Or at least for the whole day, depending on your hair of course.&lt;br /&gt;These CONAIR ROLLERS are really worth tryin.</li>
            <li> Or at least for the whole day, depending on your hair of course.&lt;br /&gt;These CONAIR ROLLERS are really worth tryin.</li>
            <li> I even bought a second one because not all my ear fits on this set, and the ones that had too much hair didn&#x27;t stay as well, so Second set ordered to help keep it all curly</li>
            <li> No matter how long the preheat, the rollers do not get hot enough to hold the curl.</li>
            <li> But these rollers will not burn your fingers unless you hold them closed in your hand for long minutes, then I wonder if they wouldnt cool to the point of non burning anyway..</li>
            <li> The cool down part is key for packing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> set does not get nearly as hot as my other set.</li>
            <li> The first time I used them I only left them in for about 10 minutes, but the styling didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> The rollers did not get so hot that I got burned as I did with two other sets I tried.</li>
            <li> but I would get the other clips if you keep this hot roller set.</li>
            <li> The metal clips tuck into a small slot inside the case and are easily accessible.</li>
            <li> Small enough to easily pack.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to get a new one - my old one was starting to take longer to heat up.  </li>
            <li> First, these 12 rollers were barely enough to set all of my hair--and, as I mentioned earlier, my hair is relatively short (just touching my shoulders) and rather thin, so no way would this set work for someone with longer or thicker hair.  </li>
            <li> The wire clips hold fine for my hair (shoulder length, medium thick).  </li>
            <li> I have thick, fine hair and these curlers</li>
            <li> These are medium to small, nice for shorter styles or really tight curls.</li>
            <li> With this said, the product itself is fine and it is indeed small enough to throw in your luggage without taking up heaps of room.</li>
            <li> I recommend the &#x27;super clips&#x27; as well, as they are much easier on the scalp than the supplied U shaped ones (which work fine, they&#x27;re just a little uncomfortable).</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair and though it was ok, the rollers were a little too small to create a voluminous wave, they gave a tighter curl.  </li>
            <li> These are great for those bad hair days where you need to force your hair to behave.  </li>
            <li> It barely heats at all</li>
            <li> I marked mine with a dab of red nail polish.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get hot and are not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I tried them anyway and barely got any curl in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Tried only once but took a long time to get hot and not enough rollers.</li>
            <li> They completely did not stay on the roller, or in my hair and hurt when I tried to push them in so they&#x27;d properly hold.  </li>
            <li> Not large and medium, more like medium and small.</li>
            <li> The main reason I am knocking some stars off this review, however, is that they recently broke for apparently no reason, just stopped heating up at all.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new travel size curler set and although this is a bit larger than my last set</li>
            <li> The issue is that it is only 85 watts so it takes very very long time to get ready for the job.</li>
            <li> They heat quickly and take up very little room in the cabinet.  </li>
            <li> the only thing I don&#x27;t love is that they are a little smaller than I expected them to be and the curls tend to be tighter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and includes adequate amount of curlers.</li>
            <li> A quick makeover from the usual look.</li>
            <li> The curlers get hot but because I have thick hair, eight large rollers aren&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> Now that I am older and need to get stuff done and can&#x27;t spend a solid 30 minute curling my long mane</li>
            <li> Plus there are 12 curlers in the pack--also very unlike other models.</li>
            <li> The blue curlers are big enough for nice loose curls and are sufficient to do all of my shoulder length, medium thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It did not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> first time I let these curlers heat up, I thought they were broken; they just didn&#x27;t get that hot.</li>
            <li> I usually let them heat a full 5 minutes, not the 90 seconds that these instant heat rollers say they need.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is if you have really long thick hair you may need bigger and more rollers.  </li>
            <li> and I need bigger rollers to keep bigger curls and not tight curls.  </li>
            <li> other set I have is the Remington H-1015 Ceramic Compact, Large and Medium Roller set, also sold on Amazon for a similar price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently, my idea of jumbo and the manufacturer&#x27;s idea are different.</li>
            <li> these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of product- rollers are pretty narrow.</li>
            <li> so I called Conair 800-326-6247 and ordered RP 106- 3 large rollers for less than $7.  </li>
            <li> As soon as one got done, put the curlers back in to heat and less than 10 minutes later the next lady was ready to roll!  </li>
            <li> but I did not think that the unit got hot enough and the rollers seemed to heavy for the pins that secured them.  </li>
            <li> product may work well for people with short hair that is thick or medium, but I would not recommend it for anyone with fine hair that is medium length or long.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, are compact and manage to curl my thick medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> Only trouble is they don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Heat is gentle and the rollers did provide a slight lift (I left them in for 30 minutes).  </li>
            <li> Would rather have larger rollers, but I use the 8 larger size rollers for less than a minute and my hair curls fast.</li>
            <li> found that the little set of teeth on one side of these rollers really helped grip my hair</li>
            <li> you are a business traveler who just wants something to put a little bounce in your hair for day-time, this set does the trick.</li>
            <li> They are far too small to do a decent job in styling my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time curling my hair and getting curlers to stay, but this one was easy to put in, stayed where they should, and curled my hair, lasting a long while.</li>
            <li> Even tho these Conairs are also not huge rollers- for longer hair, they do work really well, if you have 2 sets.</li>
            <li> have long (just below bra strap), thick, coarse, slightly wavy hair that is very easy to curl, and holds curl for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the wide no tangle hair separators that encircle most of the roller and the tightly spaced holding comb that makes a single line down the cylinder.</li>
            <li> But, I left them in for at least 20 minutes, and the curls they made were nearly identical to those made by the older set of rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The second time I left them in about twice that long (while I put on my make-up, etc.)</li>
            <li> If you leave them in ten min or so, you get long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> It says 8 large rollers and 4 small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just missed it, but when I ordered it said Medium and Large rollers.</li>
            <li> They do a good job but not great as other electric curlers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> I like that they do not get so hot that they are hard to handle.</li>
            <li> They are small, but do hold the curl very well.</li>
            <li> Roller were much too small for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Usually my hair holds curl averagely to very well</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t tangle in long hair, and they don&#x27;t  do the damage that some curling irons deliver to fragile hair.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, this one will last long.</li>
            <li> These are functional enough but take a long time to heat and leave some ridges on the hair.</li>
            <li> wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to try these out or they would have been a definite return.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> They are the type that were in my old set, you insert it like the photo then go down and up as you insert.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I need to purchase additional large rollers for my longer hair.</li>
            <li> Hold the edges, they are less hot, but not exactly cool.</li>
            <li> This curlers set is exact exactly the size I was looking for but the curlers themselves are disappointing.  </li>
            <li> These rollers could heat up a bit more, and I definitely do not like the awkward metal clips that are to hold the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> Much less bulky than my old rollers.</li>
            <li> This was a complete and utter waste of money...</li>
            <li> Have even tried one consumers hint to use toilet paper to hold hair on rollers.  </li>
            <li> I was wary because I have used flocked rollers in the past, but I definitely wanted a set where each roller sits on its own peg.</li>
            <li> I only wish instead of the multiple sizes, it had only 12 of the larger blue and none of the green!</li>
            <li> Although it heats somewhat slowly, there are just enough curlers, and at a decent heat,  to encourage my &#x27;do.</li>
            <li> You can heat 12 big blue rollers on one heatpad, since you can put the big rollers where the little ones are, to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The clips hold securely, but the design of the curler leaves weird dents in my hair.</li>
            <li> I spend more time on my hands and knees looking for the dang blasted things than I do curling my hair.</li>
            <li> The clips in this small set are much smaller than the old school set.  </li>
            <li> and they hold the curl for a long time&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and it doesnt take a long time to heat up.</li>
            <li> If I keep the lid closed, they heat up faster than if the lid is open.</li>
            <li> So even if you have long hair, I think this set would work for you.</li>
            <li> Growing up on sponge curlers &amp; spiral curlers and the long process of getting</li>
            <li> I have waist long hair, so not every product works for me, this one does.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, and during the unrolling process, these curlers tangle in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have longish hair and the end result is dependant on how long I leave the curler in and also if I use hair spray.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use them for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair and want lots of va va voom that is.</li>
            <li> they offer what the &#x27;old&#x27; heavy clunkers did.</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t even curl (grey hair).</li>
            <li> i expected the curlers to be larger.....</li>
            <li> I have used it twice and find it takes a long time to heat up which I will need to adjust to on a trip.  </li>
            <li> My daughter, a long time electric roller user, took one look at this and...</li>
            <li> I have really long and fin hair.</li>
            <li> The cardboard box it came in was faded like it sat in the sun for a long time, and it was all beat up.</li>
            <li> I used these while on a month long vacation</li>
            <li> you have long hair</li>
            <li> My hair is long and requires two sets of these.</li>
            <li> I can see where these might be a challenge for those with considerably long hair...</li>
            <li> I still use hot rollers, so when I travel I got tired of lugging my big set with me!</li>
            <li> They are very lightweight; which I thought was beneficial, but wrapping my hair around the roller was an effort and the rollers did not stay in place because the weight of the hair forced them to move and shift.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, you don&#x27;t move that cover around much, so it turns out that it doesn&#x27;t need to be very tough, and it&#x27;s more durable as flimsy thin vinyl than it was as rigid plastic 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> Compact - curlers work fast- small to travel with- no complaints!</li>
            <li> I am actually pleasantly surprised that they made curls identical to the hotter set, as it seems there is less heat damage I will subject my hair to if I continue to use these on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It could be the lack of flocking that my other rollers had, but they just don&#x27;t seem to heat up enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this set to because the other travel set I have didn&#x27;t have enough rollers.</li>
            <li> Very reliable, just be sure to push and twist them down to the base of the post, so they are not wobbling, or they wont heat up.</li>
            <li> or it looks frizzy nor can I blow it dry without it looking frizzy.</li>
            <li> blue and green rollers are about 1/4 larger  than the two smallest sizes that come in the 30 piece set</li>
            <li> I wear a bob so the back is short and the green size worked well.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal as it&#x27;s the same product but just a different color.....</li>
            <li> I was worried that it was not new.</li>
            <li> The pins did not hold my hair at all....will not use and not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> Works well, and as usual Amazon delivers prompt and professional.</li>
            <li> --it is annoying to have to constantly move the curlers to the center section to get them to warm up thus the 2-star rating.</li>
            <li> once they hit the open air the start cooling down.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy a few extras, as my hair is very long and pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to wait until I take them out to see how they do, but my hopes are not high.</li>
            <li> I also like that the set is small and compact and takes up much less counter space than my older set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having purchased a set of Hot Tools flocked rollers that had the most horrible smell and smoke coming out from them, I decided to try these.  </li>
            <li> Shorter hair (above the ears or just less hair below the ears) probably will manage with one set of these Conairs.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Roll close to the scalp, as tight as possible.</li>
            <li> : rollers sit on heating base; cord runs out of small opening in back of bag; a reinforced pocket in rear of bag for roller clips; zips around sides and front; clear top with handle; cord fits inside for packing.&lt;br /&gt;Five</li>
            <li> I have very limited space</li>
            <li> The curlers are a little on the smaller side</li>
            <li> just got the Remington H1015 set, with the little red satin case, travelin size as they say.</li>
            <li> A little while later I cut my hair to medium length, but I still had the tangling problem.</li>
            <li> They are a little smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Rollers are not very hot to the touch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> the ends only, I still need at least 10 rollers to get the ends to curl well, AND last.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is they don&#x27;t give you enough rollers</li>
            <li> rollers are too heavy for short hair.  </li>
            <li> They could a bit hotter faster, but that really is not a problem.  </li>
            <li> I spent about an hour to set my hair with this unit.</li>
            <li> I think I expected a \\&quot;large\\&quot; curler would be like a \\&quot;large\\&quot; curling iron, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> They instantly heat up and curl my hair in a few mins.</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> If you have a ton of heavy hair, you will want extra rollers.</li>
            <li> Ordered these and got the all pink set.</li>
            <li> Curlers have uneven heat and were smaller then I thought.</li>
            <li> They both heated for about 10 minutes before I used them, with the pouches closed.</li>
            <li> They both heated for about 10 minutes before I used them, with the pouches closed.</li>
            <li> , the instructions are murky and the clips for fastening are color-coded: the wider ones are for the largest rollers and the narrow ones are for the smaller rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> So much easier to travel with than my outdated set I&#x27;ve used for almost 20 years.  </li>
            <li> drawback so far is that it&#x27;s not easy to identify which are the clips for the smaller curlers - at least in my set.  </li>
            <li> These are NOT large.  </li>
            <li> I was initially concerned about ordering curlers as small as these, as I had shoulder length hair, and I didn&#x27;t want tight, tiny curls.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair (little shorter than the middle of my back...</li>
            <li> I like them, but they are much smaller than I expected and gave a very tight curl.</li>
            <li> I let them heat up for half an hour and left them in for half an hour.  </li>
            <li> No wasted counter space with these, the set is very small.  </li>
            <li> First the actual curler base is oval not round.</li>
            <li> Wish they came in a bigger size, the curl was a little tight for me and maybe it&#x27;s just an adjustment of time in hair and amount of hair per roller.</li>
            <li> The rolls size are a bit too small for big curl results.</li>
            <li> The included wire fasteners are very difficult to manipulate and do not hold the curlers securely in place.  </li>
            <li> However, if you have arthritis or other dexterity issues, this does not work.  </li>
            <li> Rollers were too small and were returned for larger rollers.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what these other people are talking about.</li>
            <li> I needed lg, but only got med and small.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a place to store the cord other than stuffing it in the container and trying to zip it up.  </li>
            <li> extremely compact</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how compact this unit is, absolutely no excess space!  </li>
            <li> so I have substituted the 4 small rollers with the  larger ones.  </li>
            <li> There are 8 basic rollers and 4 small rollers with the clips in an interior pocket.</li>
            <li> The actual size s medium and small.</li>
            <li> Pretty lame of Conair as this has been a problem for some time.</li>
            <li> other reviewers for travel or at home</li>
            <li> They are really small and tiny.  </li>
            <li> I had some from my other curlers.</li>
            <li> The smaller rollers are almost too small for my liking.</li>
            <li> It took up no space in my suitcase unlike the other travel models out there.</li>
            <li> I might try buying small replacements for the larger rollers and see if that helps.</li>
            <li> defeats the small size - except while traveling...and while traveling you just wont get the same effect on your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trouble with that method is, I have to stay inside for two hours waiting for my hair to dry.</li>
            <li> And on the third day it looks like a blow out and still very tame.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the proper ratio of sizes in one set, so I think I will order another set of these</li>
            <li> and when she finally finished you could hardly see any difference.</li>
            <li> think the key with this set is to let it heat up with the lid zipped for at least 10 minutes, if not a bit</li>
            <li> but rollers are small not for long hair</li>
            <li> I usually use Paul Mitchell extra firm spray styling gel.</li>
            <li> I usually use Paul Mitchell extra firm spray styling gel.</li>
            <li> My only negative is that there is not an &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; button you have to unplug the cord yourself and sometimes I forget to do that.  </li>
            <li> Much to small to long hair.</li>
            <li> They barely heat up and, as such, are useless to me.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the box looked like it came out of a salvage sale.</li>
            <li> These are too small for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need a dual voltage, buy a stronger watts unit for faster heat.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, 12 rolls are not enough for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I leave the lid closed as recommended and give these a few minutes to heat up</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping I could possibly create a shortcut to my hairstyling regime, but his product did not hold up with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used a curling iron for years, but with my hair is not as thick as it use to be, this still give me my volume without dragging my larger set around!</li>
            <li> There are enough rollers to curl all of my thick hair at once.</li>
            <li> I have below-the-shoulder thick hair and these are just enough.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the VERY few &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; items I have bought in the last few years that is sturdy and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remember to push the curlers all the way down before heating them up.  </li>
            <li> I do my hair with the rollers, I can never leave it down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the one to sit down while fixing my hair.</li>
            <li> The small rods were smaller than I expected for my thick shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length thick hair and have a few roller left over.</li>
            <li> A slight wave, but not a curl.</li>
            <li> and I have less than shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Heats up in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to taking this set on business trips and also on vacation as it will not take up half of my suitcase.</li>
            <li> you are going to get less reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes less space to store and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length and these curlers do the trick.  </li>
            <li> After a month and a half, the heating elements quit working on one end, so those curlers don&#x27;t heat up.  </li>
            <li> I have had 2 previous hard-cased travel curler sets whose covers got crack from being packed tightly in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li> its pretty crazy that the options are limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so this has not been a problem, but if you have long and/or thick hair</li>
            <li> They give me a slight curl and a little body.  </li>
            <li> I have owned these rollers for a few years now and hands down</li>
            <li> If you want really tight curls, this is the set for you.</li>
            <li> The roller pins hold curlers tightly in place.  </li>
            <li> I like that the rollers don&#x27;t grab so tightly in your hair that you have a problem</li>
            <li> * Curler size - There are four small and 8 medium curlers - no large.</li>
            <li> These rollers, packed tightly in a lightweight travel case, have solved my frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they don&#x27;t seem to heat sufficiently to make long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair and there is enough rollers in this small package to curl all of my hair.</li>
            <li> the curls a little frizzy</li>
            <li> The little \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the rollers grab my hair while I&#x27;m rolling so not to miss any stray hairs.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t position the little starter strip</li>
            <li> Little place to hold the pins on the inside</li>
            <li> Also found the little spikes on the rollers pull my hair and make it frizz.</li>
            <li> like the dark case - as it doesnt show handling marks!</li>
            <li> I just leave them in a little longer.</li>
            <li> Not worth the risk!</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to get my hair to stay put while I rolled it up because they would keep slipping out.  </li>
            <li> I am still using these because they are not for everyday</li>
            <li> Returned immediately: could not secure them.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the pin that holds them in place, but they do need to be placed just so.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is not too heavy</li>
            <li> The secret to getting the metal clips to work is to insert them from the same side you rolled up from.</li>
            <li> Heats up in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> the ends look round</li>
            <li> I use the plastic clips instead which you can purchase anywhere for a few bucks.</li>
            <li> And dont bend over, they will fall out, they are heavy after all.</li>
            <li> has already recommended to a few of her friends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rollers are too narrow.</li>
            <li> I plan on using these on my trip to Europe in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> just fall out after a few min.</li>
            <li> This unit has 4 small, and 8 medium size rollers from a typical conair roller set.  </li>
            <li> I like them small because I want a tight curl</li>
            <li> you want small, tight curls</li>
            <li> well (hair is a little past shoulders)..</li>
            <li> They made my curls too tight, it looked like I was going to an 80&#x27;s prom!</li>
            <li> I have long but thin hair</li>
            <li> I had to find small flocked rollers to use for everyday.</li>
            <li> My enormous, clunky set (a Remington version) used clips which left terrible crimps near the root of my hair.</li>
            <li> These made very tight curls in my hair - it looked like I was going to an 80s prom.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for very tight curls, these curlers would work well for you.</li>
            <li> CONAIR set has 4 truly little rollers for your neck area or side-tendrils as they say, or spit curls- as we used to say!</li>
            <li> These curlers are quite small and the curls made me look a bit like Shirley Temple as a youngster (which probably dates me by the reference -- but let&#x27;s put it this way, not becoming on an-at-least-middle-aged person)  </li>
            <li> Electric hair setters have been around since the sixties and have changed very little.</li>
            <li> They took up very little room in my bag.  </li>
            <li> To small.</li>
            <li> : I am not sure whether this product damages my hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I found that the diameter of the curlers was too small for my hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> They were too small for my hair, so had to return.</li>
            <li> When I first saw these I was really disappointed with its size.  </li>
            <li> I tried those butterfly clips in the past and they just don&#x27;t hold in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The curlers stated as &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; are too small</li>
            <li> but the clips are way too short and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This is a small set of rollers.</li>
            <li> The curler sizes are predominantly small to medium.</li>
            <li> These take up no more than 6x6x6 in your luggage.  </li>
            <li> , I just wish that there were plastic clips to hold them in place rather than the metal u-clips because they are very difficult to figure out how to use effectively without getting frustrated.</li>
            <li> so small and compact and work so well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but packs a wallop.  </li>
            <li> too small.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length hair, 2 inches or so past my shoulders</li>
            <li> Too Small....  </li>
            <li> I am also disappointed with how hot the rollers get.</li>
            <li> This set makes the cut because of its small size and weight, and the ease of use.</li>
            <li> The small are 1inch.  </li>
            <li> To me that would be 8 medium rollers and 4 small.  </li>
            <li> Small and compact and work well.  </li>
            <li> Kinda pointless</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Amazon will only refund or replace it for one month.  </li>
            <li> Plus the rollers are way too small.</li>
            <li> This was a big disappointment and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I hate to leave bad reviews, but I felt that I should since this set didn&#x27;t really work for me, and I bought it based on the positive reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I have long, very thin hair.</li>
            <li> Downside is the starting strip on the roller - it&#x27;s unnecessary (at least for me with thick and slightly coarse hair), and it pulls my hair worse than a fine-tooth comb (ouch!), and makes it difficult to insert the roller clip onto the roller.</li>
            <li> Hard to get the clips on, too.  </li>
            <li> When I tried to put these in it was so hard to get the hair to stay on.</li>
            <li> My hair is hard to curl, but the rollers do provide body.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes its hard not to touch the metal contacts on the bottom of the rollers.</li>
            <li> I need at least 20 to do all of my hair.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t fabulous but they aren&#x27;t terrible either.</li>
            <li> Leave them in for at least 15 min and done.</li>
            <li> These were a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see this working for people with thick hair, though.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and was worried that they would not work.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and not too thick anymore.</li>
            <li> I was annoyed by the missing clips as there is no way to use the curlers without them.  </li>
            <li> However, I have lots of thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is chin length but is too thick and wavy for these rollers.</li>
            <li> I bought separate clips as my hair is thin and the rollers seem heavy with the clips provided.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length hair that isn&#x27;t overly thick.</li>
            <li> Very small curlers</li>
            <li> The clips take a time or two to understand how they work, and yes, they can be a little uncomfortable, but, woman, you are putting curlers in your hair...</li>
            <li> No good for me.</li>
            <li> and I find the clips to be very hard to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to roll curlers and attach wire holders.  </li>
            <li> These rollers heat up at the very least in 5 min</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and the 12 rollers</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair &amp; a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of use out of them, but a couple years is really not a great life span.</li>
            <li> I was tired of wasting valuable space in my suitcase on my standard-size tabletop electric curlers, so I went shopping for a travel-size version.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy.    </li>
            <li> Since purchasing the set I have used it two or three times per week for approximately 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Am going to try the &amp;#34;pro clips&amp;#34; but am not hopeful as I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> rather then the thin pins they give you.</li>
            <li> but I just got tired of burning my fingers handling the curlers.</li>
            <li> One other mildly annoying thing- zipper breaks and I mean immediately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the rollers are SMALL, which encourages layers to go crazy -</li>
            <li> Half the base for the curlers didn&#x27;t heat.</li>
            <li> , so a thermal glove helps, otherwise can be difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the unit does not perform well.  </li>
            <li> Any opinion would be unfair to the product.</li>
            <li> The hair grips they talk about are useless.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> but where you wind your hair is oval which results in a weird curl.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately one of the curls does not heat up.</li>
            <li> I was wrong to try the Remingtons.</li>
            <li> If I wanted a faint scent I would use body moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll keep try, maybe i made something wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> They are color coded so you can&#x27;t go wrong, the pins are colored on the tip.</li>
            <li> found it difficult to attach the clip to the roller....</li>
            <li> wrong size rollers, did not like product</li>
            <li> I waited about five minutes and then just started to randomly touch it</li>
            <li> Leave it heating for at least 4 minutes, you will be disappointed if you don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Just keep adding cold rollers to the heat pad,as you roll.</li>
            <li> Perfume was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Even used a cold curling iron?</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> attempt produced a poofy mop of crazy curls.  </li>
            <li> Resulting curls disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very difficult and cumbersome for me to use.  </li>
            <li> The pins are very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> and  the pins were impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These bad boys create a hell of a curl in no time.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know whether it just doesn&#x27;t work or a bad product</li>
            <li> LADIES - I asked before purchase and got a bad answer.</li>
            <li> I guess I just had bad luck</li>
            <li> Get them, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with that</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was disappointed in this set.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s suppposed to help grip one&#x27;s hair, it FAILS MISERABLY at that task.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re not They&#x27;re basically worthless</li>
            <li> I think included metal clips are worthless-</li>
            <li> Worthless rollers don&#x27;t heat up well.</li>
            <li> , I absolutely HATE the pins that come with them.</li>
            <li> Worthless for my use.</li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t make a \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; rollers version of this!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> so I was very disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> The clips leave a nasty looking kink in my hair.</li>
            <li> The pins are the WORST and not do stay in place.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> They are much smaller than I thought they would be. I guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the dimensions.</li>
            <li> To small. ...my falt I did not buy the right size.</li>
            <li> Dual voltage makes this great for travel.  It heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Love the compact size. Fits great in luggage &amp; works well! Finally have hot rollers I don&#x27;t mind bringing along on my travels since they don&#x27;t take much space and are lightweight yet do the job.</li>
            <li> Very difficult and cumbersome for me to use.  Burned my fingers several times. Hard to get the clips on, too.  Returned</li>
            <li> Great little set to travel with.  If you want really tight curls, this is the set for you.</li>
            <li> These are terrific. They heat quickly and stay hot for long periods of time. I have pretty thick shoulder length hair and they hold the curl for a long time&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Remember to push the curlers all the way down before heating them up.  They get very hot, so a thermal glove helps, otherwise can be difficult to use. The clips hold securely, but the design of the curler leaves weird dents in my hair. Hoping that is just part of the learning curve and with more use and familiarity of the item, I can eliminate that.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase.  They do not get hot at all and therefore do not work to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of the VERY few &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; items I have bought in the last few years that is sturdy and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very straight and the combs on the rollers help to keep each section on the roller as I am turning the curler.  The size of the rollers are fine for my short hair and the heat is a good temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect them to work like hot rollers once made in the US, however.  I have a set of Clairol Hot Rollers from 1969 that I STILL use (no lie).  But, since the old rollers do not have dual voltage, are heavy, and bulky---this new set was a GREAT find!</li>
            <li> I thought the rollers would be bigger, but they really are for shorter hair or tighter curls than I like . . .They&#x27;re easy to use, but not for me, so I&#x27;ll sell them at my next garage sale.</li>
            <li> This set is good for traveling.  Much better than another brand I bought. The set heats well and retains the heat.</li>
            <li> I am still using these because they are not for everyday but they do may the curls a little frizzy</li>
            <li> I know that the original purpose for these curlers was as a travelling set.  I use them when I want super curly hair.  They hear fast and the curls last.</li>
            <li> My last set of rollers died last week so I did a lot of research trying to find another set.  I have very limited space so thought this compact set would be perfect!  They work amazing!  The little \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the rollers grab my hair while I&#x27;m rolling so not to miss any stray hairs.  Very easy to take out, no pull on any strands of hair.  Love them!!</li>
            <li> I totally love these.  They are small, but do hold the curl very well.</li>
            <li> This curlers set is exact exactly the size I was looking for but the curlers themselves are disappointing.  First the actual curler base is oval not round. Second the curlers have teeth which I thought was great at first but they totally get tangled in my fine hair when I&#x27;m trying to remove them.  On a positive note, they do heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> My six year old grand daughter loves her instant hair styling set.&lt;br /&gt;It is quick to heat but doesn&#x27;t get so hot that she can&#x27;t touch the curlers.&lt;br /&gt;It is portable, compact and light to carry for her.</li>
            <li> I like these rollers very much.  They do not heat up as quickly as I would like but they curl well, and the clips stay in well.  I would definitely purchase these again.</li>
            <li> We are stationed overseas and have 220 plugs. My regular ceramic hot rollers would have required a huge energy transformer to use, so I put them in storage and got these with the clips to make it easy. They work great for me. I have long but thin hair and I use all of the rollers and it comes out perfect. I don&#x27;t see this working for people with thick hair, though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my daughter in law.  She was ecstatic when she saw it.  Since she travels frequently she loves the soft sides and the variety of curlers.</li>
            <li> Rollers are considered large , not jumbo as I needed. I don&#x27;t use it much and the curl does not last as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> These rollers are as good as the non-travel rollers. It would have 5 stars if there were some large rollers, which is my preference. These are medium to small, nice for shorter styles or really tight curls. They are really light and compact and heat just as well as my regular ones. I still prefer them to a curling iron for travel, electric rollers seem to smooth out the frizz in my hair.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my conair hair setter. I like the compact size and the soft sided carring case makes it easier for packing to take on trips. The rollers make a better curl than the rollers I was previously using. All in all I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these recently at a local drugstore, and tried them today for the first time. I have never used hot rollers before, and was apprehensive about having to do it for my sister&#x27;s wedding in a month. But these were just perfect... easy easy easy to use, and even as a beginner I did an almost perfect job, just by following the enclosed instructions (which were simple as pie). I had a couple of rollers in the back of my head get a tiny bit tangled when I tried to take them out, but I attribute this to \\&quot;pilot error\\&quot; and not any deficiency in the product. I think they are great!!!! Get them, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice little space saver for traveling. The rollers are hot on your fingers. Would love it though if I could find a set like this with eight rollers one size bigger.</li>
            <li> rollers are too heavy for short hair.  plug not uk standard.. i will return this item to amazon.</li>
            <li> A new hairstyle needed different size curlers.  These are so compact, heat up very quickly and create a great curl and a lot of body and bounce.  So much easier to travel with than my outdated set I&#x27;ve used for almost 20 years.  Definitely a smart purchase.</li>
            <li> grat item for the price but i got something that works better for think wavy hair that I am trying to make  shine. but it cost 4x as much.</li>
            <li> I love this item because it has enough curlers to finish all my hair w/ one set.  I have long thick hair (little shorter than the middle of my back...I have so much hair that when dyeing my hair at salons I need double the amt of chemicals) and yet one set was enough.  One reviewer didn&#x27;t like the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; in this, but I found it helped me.  I also found that the youtube link that one other posters put was helpful because I never thought about putting the little rollers at the bottom, but they work great this way and only needed the one set.    LIKES:  -compact  -one set completes hair  -easy to pack  DISLIKES:  -pins should have 2 compartments because there are two sizes  -pins sometimes pop off  -kind of wish it was all just the bigger rollers, but small ones do the job</li>
            <li> I had these for about 2-3 years and I was pretty happy with them.  The curlers are a nice design, the clips work well, and overall I liked them.  The layout of the set was nice and small/compact but a little bulky for travelling--the new ones I just bought, Remington H-1015, have a more streamlined design for about the same amount of curlers and so I think will be better for travel.  The main reason I am knocking some stars off this review, however, is that they recently broke for apparently no reason, just stopped heating up at all.  I got a lot of use out of them, but a couple years is really not a great life span.</li>
            <li> This set of hot curlers is just right for me...for my length of hair.  They could a bit hotter faster, but that really is not a problem.  I just love the compact size...great for travel!</li>
            <li> Curlers Would not heat up hot enough to roll. Even after I let them warm up for an hour and after that I could hold the rollers in my palm without even burning my hand. Only became a mild warm just would not heat up. Had to return and buy another brand.</li>
            <li> I have the large 30 set of hot rollers and this 12 piece travel set gets so much hotter in just 3-4 minutes and they also retain their heat much longer as well. The 30 piece set takes 30 minutes to heat properly so i dont even use it anymore and instead I am using two of these travel kits. I put away one of the heating elements and just insert a extras rollers into the heating element when i take one out, and its hot by the time I get to that roller. They really work wonderfully, and I am so happy I decided to get these over any other travel size out there.&lt;br /&gt;The blue and green rollers are about 1/4 larger  than the two smallest sizes that come in the 30 piece set and they are not concave rollers (thank goodness). The pins work fine but I prefer to use claw clips. I have a lot of hair, considered frizzy and unmanageable cut into a long bob that touches my shoulders and these rollers and thier long lasting heat is enough to control my hair and gives it really soft shiny frizz free curls. On the second day my hair will be wavy and it still looks awesome. And on the third day it looks like a blow out and still very tame. I say try them!</li>
            <li> I love these! I only wish the \\&quot;large\\&quot; rollers were actually large. They made my curls too tight, it looked like I was going to an 80&#x27;s prom! Otherwise, they worked great. I have long, thin straight hair, and let the rollers warm up for almost 10 minutes. They were definitely hot enough, but not too hot to hold. The clips held my hair very well. The case is small, perfect for traveling. Too bad they don&#x27;t make a \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; rollers version of this!</li>
            <li> I bought these rollers to take with me when I travel.  They heat up fast and work really well.  They fit perfectly in my carry on.  The size was a concern for me because the last set of hot rollers I had were in my check in luggage and the case got destroyed by the airlines.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about them was the clips that hold the rollers in, so I use the old clips that came with my old set and they work great.</li>
            <li> Wanted larger curlers, returned product. Besides that, it was good.</li>
            <li> Compact.  Heats fast.  Would rather have larger rollers, but I use the 8 larger size rollers for less than a minute and my hair curls fast.</li>
            <li> My wife has a set of these curlers, has for years, and wanted a second, matching set.  They weren&#x27;t available locally, so Amazon.com to the rescue.  They&#x27;re an identical match.  As a bonus, I needed something to get a USB extension cable up over $25 for free shipping...mission accomplished!</li>
            <li> i live in the philippines so im happy to report that the plug works here with voltage range from 120 to 250 volts. its compact and the clips hold my hair. i have normal hair, not too thick but not too fine. even with the heat and humidity here, curls last for more than 10 hours! amazing. and it doesnt take a long time to heat up. i put the curlers on, do my make up, and after 20 minutes, i have beautiful curls that last all day!  love!</li>
            <li> Love love these! I use them everyday not just for travel, nice and compact, heat fast enough for me tho maybe not quite as quickly as others and the curl they give is fantastic. The grooves on each one seem to grab onto the hair and separate to give more curl and don&#x27;t get the loose ends to retrieve onto the curler like others I have had. I have always liked the metal holders better than all the newer style ones as they leave no ridges and keep the curler in place really snugly. I had an old one by conair that only had 8 curlers which were never enough nor did they curl so well and twelves is perfect for me at least. Shipping was super quick as always with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I remember why I like curling irons now.  It&#x27;s been awhile since I used hot rollers and was hoping I could use these They&#x27;re neatly put together, compact and the clips secure the rollers very well.  Only trouble is they don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl hair.  I let them heat up for half an hour and left them in for half an hour.  I have a lot of body and wave in my hair, so curling is not a problem, but these curlers don&#x27;t do it?  Stick with the curling iron!</li>
            <li> wow............ fantastic, I am realy happy</li>
            <li> I have fine, shoulder length hair--these curlers are great!  The starter strip is a small row of little prongs that grip your hair perfectly, allows you to NOT make fishhook ends--and DON&#x27;T tangle.  I would buy another one of these JUST for the starter strips!  Like other reviewers, I would like more of the large curlers, but that&#x27;s just personal preference.  Love this!</li>
            <li> I have a set of Conair rollers from 2008 that are flocked and work great, but the set only has 8 large rollers in it. I need at least 20 to do all of my hair. So I bought this to supplement that set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (just below bra strap), thick, coarse, slightly wavy hair that is very easy to curl, and holds curl for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used both sets at the same time so I could compare how they worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set does not get nearly as hot as my other set. But, I left them in for at least 20 minutes, and the curls they made were nearly identical to those made by the older set of rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the little set of teeth on one side of these rollers really helped grip my hair so I could wrap it around each roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the large rollers in this set is just a bit smaller than the large in my other Conair set- but those also have the fuzzy coating on them. This difference in size between the two sets did not seem to make the curls look any different, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the key with this set is to let it heat up with the lid zipped for at least 10 minutes, if not a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my first use of the set, I feel it gives me what I was looking for: nice full waves and smooth, shiny hair. I also like that the set is small and compact and takes up much less counter space than my older set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that these rollers do not ever reach a high temperature, they might not work as well for people whose hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl well. I am actually pleasantly surprised that they made curls identical to the hotter set, as it seems there is less heat damage I will subject my hair to if I continue to use these on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these rollers. The rollers have no rubbery feel which helped rolling my hair easy with another set I owned. Needing to replace that set I read reviews. These rollers have a neat shape, are smooth, and work great. If I keep the lid closed, they heat up faster than if the lid is open. The clips are very easy to work with. Thrilled with the way they curl. I have shoulder-length thick hair and have a few roller left over. So even if you have long hair, I think this set would work for you.</li>
            <li> Great for travelling. Good that there are more big rollers than the small.</li>
            <li> This set is wonderfully compact (my favorite part!) and easy to use.  I&#x27;ve been using it for months (when I travel) and it still heats up really nicely (takes about 10 minutes).  The curlers are a little on the smaller side and sometimes I don&#x27;t get the satisfying click when I place the curler on it&#x27;s base, but for the most part it&#x27;s doing exactly what I wanted it to:  Gives me decent curls without taking up all my luggage space.</li>
            <li> It would have been very helpful if the size of the rollers was included in the description of the product. I wanted much larger rollers and from the description given, thought that they would be. The actual box the rollers came in was worn and slightly torn and looked like it had been opened many times. Luckily I was able to sell them to a friend so I don&#x27;t have to deal with a return. Also, NO packing slip was included in the box.</li>
            <li> They work great on my long hair. I&#x27;m glad these rollers do not burn or dry out my hair like a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Just like the one before it that lasted many years.  Ceramic rollers are just the right temperature, never get dirty, and clean easily if they would.  Cord is now attached which is fine with me.  What a joy to lose the felt rollers clogged with hair!  Properly priced and arrived promptly.  If you are concerned about lice, bugs or bacteria hiding in your rollers, this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers a couple of weeks ago and love them.  They heat up quickly, are pretty easy to roll (thanks to the extra strip of teeth on each roller) and the clips hold the rollers very well, even with my very fine, slippery hair.  I just purchased a second set this week as 12 rollers really aren&#x27;t enough to give the set I like, but 2 sets of these rollers is still less than a lot of setters out there with more rollers--and I&#x27;ll have a compact set for travel.  Although the rollers themselves are somewhat oval in shape, I really didn&#x27;t think the finished curl looks any different than with a round roller; however, I think the oval shape allows you to set the roller closer to your head for a more secure set.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Purchased these with high hopes but they do not even get hot enough to do the job. I have long, very thin hair. Usually curls and holds curls very easily. These curlers couldn&#x27;t even hold a curl for 5 mintues.</li>
            <li> This hot roller set is dual voltage. It is good for traveling outside the US. The issue is that it is only 85 watts so it takes very very long time to get ready for the job. (Conair has two or three other roller sets with 580 watts or more--the one with 580 watts heat up and ready for use in two minutes!! And it is only $9 more). This set does warm up with 90 seconds as advertised but it is not hot enough. I waited for about 30-40 minutes before I used it. The clips that come with this unit do not work so I bought jumbo clips separately. If you don&#x27;t need a dual voltage, buy a stronger watts unit for faster heat.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, 12 rolls are not enough for thick hair. The rolls size are a bit too small for big curl results. I spent about an hour to set my hair with this unit. But, the process would be cut by half, if I had have used a strong watts unit. I need a dual voltage set so I don&#x27;t have many choices.&lt;br /&gt;Update.....a month later...&lt;br /&gt;Now I use it in Thailand. I am very surprised to learn that this unit heat up within 10 minutes!!!! With more experience, I can do my hair to look professional in less than 30 minutes. Everyone said, the curl looks natural and look like I walk out from the salon. I would recommend this product to all travelers.&lt;br /&gt;PS: I am not sure whether this product damages my hair. But I guess all products with high heat will eventually damage hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered these compact hot rollers for a trip we are planning to the UK.  Tried them out this morning, they are wonderful.  They heat up fast and curlers have grip teeth that really work.  The compact size is going to fit in my suitcase just fine.  Waiting on the UK adaptor I also ordered then I&#x27;ll be ready to go.</li>
            <li> I had a set of these from about 8 years ago.  My daughter wanted some as she always loved using mine when she came to stay. I couldn&#x27;t find them for the longest time and found them on Amazon one day so ordered for her.  These grip better and curl better than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Heats up well. Love the size. Wish the clips were easier to use. Overall, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am returning this product.  I was looking for a compact unit for travel and this seemed like a great product in the description.  Unfortunately, the unit does not perform well.  After the it had been plugged in for at least 30 minutes, the curlers were barely warm.  The included wire fasteners are very difficult to manipulate and do not hold the curlers securely in place.  Also, I found that the diameter of the curlers was too small for my hairstyle.  They might be fine for women with short hair who wish to have a curly result, but are not the right product for long hair in loose unstructured waves.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Conair hot rollers to replace a \\&quot;vintage\\&quot; set.  It is as advertised, heats fast, is compact and great for travel.  However, if you have arthritis or other dexterity issues, this does not work.  The pins are very difficult to use. I will probably regift this to one of my granddaughters.</li>
            <li> I purchased these based on their compact size for travel. Unfortunately they don&#x27;t seem to heat sufficiently to make long lasting curls. I debated whether to send these back, tried them 2 times, and this morning decided to return them. I made my decision based on how my hair looks today after using a standard size curling setter. My hair is much fuller, much bouncier, with much more long lasting curls. By the end of 3 hours with the Conair compact, my hair would be pretty much uncurled, with maybe some slight curling left at the ends. It just doesn&#x27;t justify the price. I&#x27;ll be looking for a replacement that heats better and provides better curling.</li>
            <li> For me these curlers worked perfectly - I had them in for about 15 minutes, and the curl stayed in my past-shoulder-length-hair for the rest of the day. However, I would have preferred larger rollers. These made very tight curls in my hair - it looked like I was going to an 80s prom. Also, it would have helped to have maybe 2 or 3 more rollers to fit all of my hair. If you&#x27;re looking for very tight curls, these curlers would work well for you.</li>
            <li> Works great!  No problems with heating.</li>
            <li> Rollers arrived without the clips!!!  Fortunately - had my \\&quot;old\\&quot; con-air clips that worked.  Great for travel -- and will use at home.  Just wish it had a \\&quot;power light\\&quot; or indicator of some type to signal when it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
            <li> These would be great for short hair. They were too small for my hair, so had to return.</li>
            <li> I have owned these rollers for a few years now and hands down they are the best I have ever owned! Perfect for travel, and I use them almost every day. Compact size is great and they heat up very fast! Love them!</li>
            <li> nice and small and heats up really fast</li>
            <li> These are a great product, and it&#x27;s difficult to find this style of roller in the market (and I&#x27;ve been shopping awhile), and it&#x27;s great to have 8 of the \\&quot;right size\\&quot; roller in a travel-size pack, and if one reads the directions (wink) then it really is better to follow the directions and leave the lid on while the rollers heat up so that they&#x27;ll heat up quicker. Downside is the starting strip on the roller - it&#x27;s unnecessary (at least for me with thick and slightly coarse hair), and it pulls my hair worse than a fine-tooth comb (ouch!), and makes it difficult to insert the roller clip onto the roller. But for someone else with thin hair or super-fine hair that slides off the roller, then the starting strip is a great idea. But for me, I wish I could find this same roller kit but without the starting strip.....</li>
            <li> Growing up on sponge curlers &amp; spiral curlers and the long process of getting \\&quot;curls\\&quot; I just resorted to using the curling iron as I grew up. Now that I am older and need to get stuff done and can&#x27;t spend a solid 30 minute curling my long mane so I got these to warm them up, pop them in and do my other thing like make-up and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bad boys create a hell of a curl in no time. I love this purchase. Best money I have spent in a long time.</li>
            <li> Great compact rollers to take on the go with you and takes up a little room in your suitcase or bag.  They heat up quickly and are reasonably price too.  I love them.</li>
            <li> Cannot review this item.  Rollers were too small and were returned for larger rollers.  Any opinion would be unfair to the product.</li>
            <li> Packs easily, works great.  I ordered several extra curlers which work well and heat up fast.  I have waist long hair, so not every product works for me, this one does.  Price is a great value.</li>
            <li> I travel often between my two homes, one in the US and one in Ukraine.  This compact set of curlers works on both currents, in both places.  Although it heats somewhat slowly, there are just enough curlers, and at a decent heat,  to encourage my &#x27;do.</li>
            <li> I was tired of wasting valuable space in my suitcase on my standard-size tabletop electric curlers, so I went shopping for a travel-size version.  Amazon had the best selection all in one place for easy comparison.  I finally settled on the Conair HS28X Instant Heat Compact Styling Setter primarily for its compact size and the fact that the curlers came in two sizes.  My tabletop curlers are jumbo size, but since I recently had my hair relaxed these large and medium size rollers would do just fine.  Before making my purchase I read reviews from others who had purchased these curlers on Amazon, so I was prepared for certain shortcomings.  First, while they do indeed heat up in just a couple of minutes, it is only a \\&quot;surface charge.\\&quot;  For the \\&quot;deep heat\\&quot; you need for longer lasting styles, you really need to let them heat up about 20 minutes.  It is also necessasry to leave them in your hair longer than you might normally do so.  The first time I used them I only left them in for about 10 minutes, but the styling didn&#x27;t last.  The second time I left them in about twice that long (while I put on my make-up, etc.) with much more satisfactory results and much longer lasting styling.  By comparison, my tabletop curlers take about 10-20 minutes to build up the \\&quot;deep heat\\&quot; for long-wearing curls, but I only have to leave each curler in my hair about 2-3 minutes.  Overall, I like this product.  It is very compact and light weight, and it does a great job as long as you take the time to do it right.  Best of all, the price was right.</li>
            <li> I really like these compact rollers.  Work well, grip the hair well without pulling, and get nice and hot.  Make sure they are pushed down in their case while heating.  Looking forward to taking them on my next trip.</li>
            <li> Great for travel. Small and lightweight so fit great in carry on.</li>
            <li> Product heats up quickly and produces a good curl. They work just like my larger set but are much easier to travel with. However, only the curlers sold with or in addition to this set will fit the heating rod so don&#x27;t plan on using any other curlers you have with this set. And even though the product is dual voltage, you still need an outlet adapter. Overall I highly recommend it though!!</li>
            <li> Returned immediately: could not secure them. I had a great small travel set used 4 times a week for 10 plus years. Replaced those with another travel Remington set (still working) &amp; bought these to have more large hot rollers. Was not to be.</li>
            <li> Excellent value. Performed well.</li>
            <li> I took it on my trip to Hawaii and I was so pleased.  It really curled my hair and the curl lasted throughout the day.  Small, compact and easy to pack.  I recommend these styling curls to all.</li>
            <li> I recently had my hair styled and thought curlers would help me maintain the style--unfortunately the curlers were too small, they really didn&#x27;t heat up as fast as the instructions said they would, I also had trouble making sure they were connected to the heat source--the casing is just too floppy for that I think--also, I didn&#x27;t like the pins--the curlers kept on flopping around on my head and just weren&#x27;t hot enough to do the job.  I returned them and will stick with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers work great.  They heat quickly and take up very little room in the cabinet.  The clips are stored conveniently in the pouch.</li>
            <li> These got warm, but not really warm enough to make a good curl. A slight wave, but not a curl.</li>
            <li> works great,  very small and compact-love it,  also great for travel</li>
            <li> Bought this for my trip to France and it worked perfectly!  Definitely recommend! Easy to use and the small size makes it easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. I let it heat up for 30 minutes and it got barely warm. I left the rollers in for 45 minutes. It really did nothing! I tried it 5 times and used different sprays to give it a good try. Must return.</li>
            <li> I read all of the great reviews so I thought these rollers would be great. But they&#x27;re not They&#x27;re basically worthless and I&#x27;m throwing them away. I have normal weight hair and length. When I tried to put these in it was so hard to get the hair to stay on. The hair grips they talk about are useless. You can&#x27;t even call them grips. And the curlers don&#x27;t get hot enough. My hair looked whack when done. I&#x27;m going back to my curling iron. What a waste of money. I don&#x27;t know what these other people are talking about. Maybe they were paid to write some of these reviews.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using hot rollers and I will say that they work great.  the only thing I don&#x27;t love is that they are a little smaller than I expected them to be and the curls tend to be tighter.  It&#x27;s not a bad thing, but I will buy some larger ones now to supplement.  they heat up quickly and come with clips color coded.</li>
            <li> **I revised this because, after contacting Conair customer service, they readily shipped a new type of clip, the pin-like ones, for free. I searched the beauty supply stores and online and could not locate the exact size pins I needed. Now, I can actually use the product!! The pins hold the rollers and the curlers work great in my long hair. I recommend buying this if and only if it has the u shaped pins and not the claw clips to hold your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers are great, they curl my hair well. The clips do a pretty good job of holding the rollers in my hair. So, no complaints there. Should be perfect then, right? WRONG. The clips leave a nasty looking kink in my hair. The spot where the clip attaches, it looks hideous. I have to pull my hair back each time I do my hair with the rollers, I can never leave it down. So I just have a nice, curly, 1950&#x27;s sock-hop pony tail look when I&#x27;m done. Useless. I have to find better clips, the pin-like ones, but I&#x27;m worried they won&#x27;t hold since they don&#x27;t come with the rollers.</li>
            <li> smaller rollers than i anticipated</li>
            <li> Work well and they&#x27;re great for travel.  Just be sure they are connected to the heating element on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I like them, but they are much smaller than I expected and gave a very tight curl. The \\&quot;large\\&quot; size is equal to a regular-sized (3/4\\&quot;?) curling iron. I think I expected a \\&quot;large\\&quot; curler would be like a \\&quot;large\\&quot; curling iron, but it isn&#x27;t. These are significantly smaller than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if I wanted a tight curl, these would be awesome. I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the pin that holds them in place, but they do need to be placed just so.</li>
            <li> I thought I might have a problem with the clips, but they work just fine. This is a nice, compact unit, heats quickly and provides the kind of smooth ends and curl that I am looking for. I would really have liked about 3 more larger rollers, but then it wouldn&#x27;t be so nice and compact for traveling. Guess we can&#x27;t have it all, but all in all very happy.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I bought this styling set to take it overseas.  I just have given it a try and it is working fine. I like it because it is not too heavy and it is compact.  The case is really fantastic, keep everything in place. The only thing I am not too happy is the amount of rollers, should have at least a pair more, but I will manage.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, and during the unrolling process, these curlers tangle in my hair.  The rollers do produce a good curl and don&#x27;t cost the earth.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my new set of hot rollers.  They are all that I had hoped they would be: compact and easy to cary or store, heat up fast and don&#x27;t burn your fingers when you use them, give lasting curl in a short amount of time (left them in 5 to 10 min.)  Also, you certainly can&#x27;t beat the cost.  Love them and plan to keep them until they wear out.</li>
            <li> Dissapointed the description did not say which size the rollers are. I needed lg, but only got med and small.</li>
            <li> My set barely got warm even though I left them plugged in for over 20 minutes while I showered and dried my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the curlers.  They are the perfect size for travel; they do a great job on my hair in very little time.  The only two things I don&#x27;t like:  I wish it had a place to store the cord other than stuffing it in the container and trying to zip it up.  I bought [[ASIN:B000R87B1Q Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count]] (also purchased on Amazon) b/c I wanted to not have to depend on the little metal clips; the super clips work really well, but there&#x27;s no place to store them which kind of defeats the purpose of having a travel size curlers, but if you like the wire clips, then you are all set.  I would definitely buy these again!</li>
            <li> When I first saw these I was really disappointed with its size.  The large ones are smaller than I thought it would be.  I have really thick hair and was worried that they would not work.  They work great even though they are smaller.  They heat up quickly and stay in my hair well.  The curls stay all day, and sometimes two days if I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  I really am impressed with these and would buy them again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! The culers heat quickly. My style lasts all day and I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple times and it heats up quickly in the zipper pouch, sets great, there are just enough rollers for what I need, and it&#x27;s compact.  I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I thought rollers were a little bigger, but they are still great.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, are compact and manage to curl my thick medium length hair.  I have bigger sets of hot rollers but I always go back to these.</li>
            <li> I was very reluctant to buy this at all, especially on line because like most women my hair is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;I am really glad I did. I like it a lot better than my large set of Conair Ion shine curlers. Easier(faster!) to use and better curls too! A happy surprise!</li>
            <li> Yes, the description states curlers are 1 1/4&amp;#34; each.  I thought they were 2 1/4 &amp;#34;.  They required 10-15 min. to be fully heated.  I used them anyway.  Boy, my chin length bob became earlobe level!  I&#x27;m stuck with them since I needed them for a trip to Costa Rica.  Will be looking for another set.</li>
            <li> I thought being the brand as well known it would be ok to order on line but it is most unsatisfactory.  It barely heats at all and I don&#x27;t know whether it just doesn&#x27;t work or a bad product Conair HS28X Instant Heat Compact Styling Setter I had to check on star on the rating but it deserves none.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to get these to stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> these work fine but for some reason these curlers make my hair kinda frizzy and poofy.  they don&#x27;t seem like they get hot but it does curl your hair.  I bought this set to use in the car before work.  I purchased a power inverter that plugs in your cigarette lighter and because this set is dual voltage It works great.  I have to leave early in the morning to park for free in a parking garage before they start charging so I have lots of time to sit and do my make up and hair in the car.  so these curlers work for my purposes.</li>
            <li> I bought these while traveling and am surprised at how well they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. extremely compact&lt;br /&gt;2. heat up in the case, so they&#x27;re fast to use&lt;br /&gt;3. there&#x27;s no unpacking/repacking - you zip up the case, fold up the cord, and go!  Great if you want to keep your rollers put away at home.&lt;br /&gt;4. they heat up FAST&lt;br /&gt;5. they don&#x27;t get too hot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. If you don&#x27;t position the little starter strip the clips won&#x27;t go over it.  Sometimes you have to wind/unwind a roller a bit so that the clip can go over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have other rollers that cost 3x as much, but they really aren&#x27;t 3x better.</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up very well and quickly; curls very nicely. However, they do tangle very easily. Good for occasional use, but a bit of a pain for everyday. I had to find small flocked rollers to use for everyday.</li>
            <li> Having purchased a set of Hot Tools flocked rollers that had the most horrible smell and smoke coming out from them, I decided to try these.  They heated up quickly, came with the metal clips (these are the ones I learned to use way back when hot rollers first came out), and had no odor.  I just wish there were more of them.  It&#x27;s hard to get the proper ratio of sizes in one set, so I think I will order another set of these and I&#x27;ll be okay.  These gave my hair a nice curl (not too tight), lots of body and shine, and the style lasted all day.  I have very fine, short to medium length hair and had no problems keeping these in my hair.  I tried those butterfly clips in the past and they just don&#x27;t hold in my hair.  The secret to getting the metal clips to work is to insert them from the same side you rolled up from.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this product. The rollers did not get warm enough to really do anything for your hair.I did like the rollers because they were just the right size and my hair stayed in them well . If they had just heated up more I would have given it least 4 stars. May send mine back.</li>
            <li> This hot roller set is fantastic and takes up so little room.  The rollers did not get so hot that I got burned as I did with two other sets I tried. Heats up in a few minutes.  The roller pins hold curlers tightly in place.  My curls came out great and lasted all day.  That&#x27;s pretty amazing considering I have very fine hair.  My only complaint is that I need to purchase additional large rollers for my longer hair.</li>
            <li> Bought these for Christmas for my girlfriend and they just do not work well. They do not get hot enough to really make any difference. I remember she had kept reheating them and was in bathroom for almost two hours and when she finally finished you could hardly see any difference. The pins to hold them in place are cheap and flimsy. So i also bought her the larger clamps that are made for these and sold separatly , this still made no difference. I guess you get what you pay for and the cost being so cheap also delivers cheap results.</li>
            <li> The wife got these for travel and her only comment was after using them, &amp;#34;they&#x27;ll do&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> The curlers stated as &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; are too small</li>
            <li> did not hold heat and took forever to get somewhat hot,  much prefer the Remington travel rollers</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mom who has fine hair but a ton of it and it&#x27;s pretty long. She needed something travel size and this was perfect.</li>
            <li> These are good curlers. I have longish hair- they could be a tad larger but are ok. I think included metal clips are worthless- buy separately sold conair clips.  For minimal money, makes these and all hot curlers a breeze. Only snag is they come in a box of 10- and there are 12 curlers. One other mildly annoying thing- zipper breaks and I mean immediately. WTH?  Still solid buy.</li>
            <li> It did not heat up as advertised.  I was surprised as I always use Conair hot curlers and love them.  Don&#x27;t know what happened here.  Stuck with them now as it would cost too much to ship back.  Dottie Indiana</li>
            <li> I leave the lid closed as recommended and give these a few minutes to heat up and they work great.  I prefer to use plastic clips that you can buy separately instead of the metal ones it come with.  It is light and easy to transport which is why i bought it.</li>
            <li> WORKS FAST, AND NO PROBLEMS WITH IT.</li>
            <li> They are a little smaller than I expected.  They are not the smooth kind so they left my hair a bit frizzy.  They do heat up fast and they work well.</li>
            <li> LADIES - I asked before purchase and got a bad answer. these rollers are NOT round. they are oval. the ends look round but where you wind your hair is oval which results in a weird curl. Feel the roller - under the combs. There are two flatter sides which allow the clips to go on.  I did not like the clips at all They are way too short to stay in and constantly fall out.They do heat up fast</li>
            <li> Only reason I am rating a 4 is because I wish there were a few more rollers.  They heat great with no issues.  I use these 2-3 times a week.  Curl holds well.  Very compact, which is what I was looking for.  Little place to hold the pins on the inside so everything stays right together.  Great for traveling or for a small space.</li>
            <li> It is very light and easy to pack but took forever to heat up. I recommend using this for travel because of it&#x27;s weight and size but keep in mind that it needs time to heat up.</li>
            <li> Incredibly low-end. The case is made of junk. You&#x27;ll get a curl out the roller, but I&#x27;m stunned at how cheep this is.</li>
            <li> This product is described in the Amazon description as dual voltage. The one I received is 120 only - not dual voltage. Now I have to deal with the private vendor. Since I am leaving on a trip, I do not have time to return and receive a new item. I am not happy.    Update - I called the vendor (at my expense.) The person I spoke to said Conair described it as dual voltage but it is not. Do not order this product if you need dual voltage.</li>
            <li> I like that the rollers don&#x27;t grab so tightly in your hair that you have a problem but the clips are way too short and difficult to use. I am disappointed with that but the unit heats up quickly and is easy to put away. I have longish hair and the end result is dependant on how long I leave the curler in and also if I use hair spray. It makes nice curls.</li>
            <li> Great for travel without sacrificing quality.  Very happy with this choice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping I could possibly create a shortcut to my hairstyling regime, but his product did not hold up with thick hair.  They are very lightweight; which I thought was beneficial, but wrapping my hair around the roller was an effort and the rollers did not stay in place because the weight of the hair forced them to move and shift.&lt;br /&gt;The idea I&#x27;d this travel set is good, just not for thick longer hair.</li>
            <li> Great curlers!!!  I took them on a three week trip and my hair never looked better!  Very compact for travel, fast heat up and cool down.  I liked them so well that I use them at home now.  I will purchase another one.</li>
            <li> I needed a travel curler set, and purchased Conair HS28X! It works great! Heats up fast, holds heat enough to curl my hair, easy to use the two sizes of curlers and It takes up little space in my suitcase! The  U shaped clips that come with it, have a neat stoarge pouch inside the bag. I use the plastic clips instead which you can purchase anywhere for a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly..not too hot, packs easily, just wish rollers were slightly bigger.</li>
            <li> The clips that hold the roller in the hair are much too short.  Rollers fall out.  If clips were longer, they would probably work.  Suggestion: Make longer clips. Other than that, It&#x27;s looks to be a nice product even though I wasn&#x27;t able to try it out.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I do a good deal of traveling and this is the perfect size to fit in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> works well but rollers are small not for long hair</li>
            <li> I really like these compact rollers. They instantly heat up and curl my hair in a few mins. Can not complain. Unfortunately one of the curls does not heat up. I guess I just had bad luck, maybe i can buy one of those in their store.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that I can only say positive things about this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased and surprised by this set.  Works really well, and is super light and easy to pack. Be sure to completely peel back the plastic cover when the rollers are heating.</li>
            <li> These work great, travel well and are compact but still get hot and do a great job on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I say that I love them on a regular basis...</li>
            <li> I tried to use these when I first go them. Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use them correctly. They are a pain to use. The curl don&#x27;t hold. Now they&#x27;re just taking up space in the cabinet.</li>
            <li> They work well, willprobably buy a second set</li>
            <li> I havent curled my hair in years but wanted to do something different for a wedding we were traveling to.  I didn&#x27;t have high expectations but let me tell you, I was so blown away by the how good my hair looked, even my husband was like WOW you should curl your hair more often.  Friends at the wedding said the same thing.  Here&#x27;s the extra bonus, they curlers are super light weight and compact so it was easy to pack in my luggage.  I am so happy with this product! The only thing I would say is if you have really long thick hair you may need bigger and more rollers.  I have shoulder length hair and not too thick anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a small set of rollers. It does heat up nicely and it certainly does what it says it does. They aren&#x27;t fabulous but they aren&#x27;t terrible either. I will continue to use them for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> The size and number of rollers are perfect for my travel, but the rollers have not yet heated up enough for me - still contemplating whether or not to return.</li>
            <li> Just my experience, don&#x27;t care for the type of curl for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I got this set to take on a week-long trip, and with airlines charging for extra baggage, etc. I wanted to pack as compactly as possible.  I was amazed at how compact this unit is, absolutely no excess space!  It tucks very nicely into a corner of the suitcase.  I also like the &#x27;fabric&#x27; zipper case...I have had 2 previous hard-cased travel curler sets whose covers got crack from being packed tightly in my suitcase.  Although the cord comes wrapped up outside the case, I&#x27;ve found it can be easily coiled around the top of all the curlers, tucking the plug down inside, and the zipper can be zipped virtually all the way around the case.  I was initially concerned about ordering curlers as small as these, as I had shoulder length hair, and I didn&#x27;t want tight, tiny curls.  But I found that by experimenting with the length of time heating, and amount of time the curlers were left in the hair, the curls turned out great, and also held their curl much better than my regular electric curlers would do.  So, I use these most of the time at home now, not just for traveling.  The special &#x27;gripper teeth&#x27; on the curlers really do help hold the hair as you roll the curler, making these stay the most securely of any of the curler sets I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;m very pleased I bought them!</li>
            <li> These are ok - don&#x27;t seem to get that hot and the pins don&#x27;t stay in my hair (maybe because my hair is quite long). I&#x27;ve had better heated rollers before, but if you&#x27;re in need of something cheap and fairly functional, they do the trick.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a trip.  It is small &amp; compact - works great.</li>
            <li> This item didn&#x27;t really heat up hot enough for me to get a good curl.  I have use many hot rollers and these are the first ones that just don&#x27;t do it for me.  Very compact and would travel well, but I would get the other clips if you keep this hot roller set.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product.  I bought it for traveling so it would fit in my luggage instead of dragging my large set and it works great. I have used a curling iron for years, but with my hair is not as thick as it use to be, this still give me my volume without dragging my larger set around!</li>
            <li> I returned it, didn&#x27;t have instant heat, didn&#x27;t even get hot enough to style my hair. The largest roller was at best a medium size.</li>
            <li> What a great change from a curling iron.  Using hot rollers as opposed to a curling iron, my hair is fuller, curlier and softer.  On advice from my stylist I just run my fingers through my hair after removing the rollers. I do wish it had auto off but I&#x27;ve unplugged it every time immediately after using the last roller.  I like the compact size-it should fit in my suitcase without taking up a lot of room.</li>
            <li> Have had these about 3-4 years. Very reliable, just be sure to push and twist them down to the base of the post, so they are not wobbling, or they wont heat up. They do heat up pretty fast but I give them about 10 minutes to truly sizzle. Hold the edges, they are less hot, but not exactly cool. You will get used to it, like baking! They hold the heat about 5 minutes, enough to do the job you want, and then some.&lt;br /&gt;I just got the Remington H1015 set, with the little red satin case, travelin size as they say. Its smaller and heavier. I tried them because thought the rollers were much bigger on the Rem set. I was wrong to try the Remingtons. The REM&#x27;s \\&quot;large rollers&#x27; are a tad thicker, but you only get 4 of them? vs 8 in these CONAIRS...RemReds are not a deal. You cant heat them up  with Conairs, the post is different. Also,I smelled &#x27;pukey plastic&#x27; on the Rems after about 5 minutes, the Remingtons seem to just be one more toxic-junk roller set, with no grip, and an extra sheet of soft plastic on the outside of the roller, making the gaseous smell when heated. Our millionares who own the China plants, dont pay for quality, dont blame the Chinese for U.S. greed.  ~I am gonna stick with CONAIR!&lt;br /&gt;Jumbo is a non-existent size,far as I know,  in this old style of heavier/better type of rollers, apparently. Even tho these Conairs are also not huge rollers- for longer hair, they do work really well, if you have 2 sets. They are especially easy if you just want some NICE curl toward the ends. Shorter hair (above the ears or just less hair below the ears) probably will manage with one set of these Conairs.&lt;br /&gt;They curl pretty fast (maybe 7 minutes or less) and the curl holds on fine, flat, overbleached, overcooked, dried-out hair, shoulder length, -for one example! If you want crown height on longer hair, you can roll your crown area, but you have to  leave the ends hang out..to get the lift. Roll close to the scalp, as tight as possible. You can easily curl the left-out ends after that. Yup, it WOULD help if there really were JUMBO rollers just like these.. all the rolling would go quickly, in about half the time. If you have long hair and want lots of va va voom that is. Short hair is so much easier to manage! Of course using a flat iron at the roots, and lifting spray or some sort of super-hold- gel will help lift the root area really nicely. Just a tiny amount. Fekkai makes a great lifting spray, it is pricey, but it takes very little to just do the crown area.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing REALLY IMPORTANT about these, is THEY HAVE THE NICE TEETH to grip your hair-a really big deal. You can get the hair to roll nice and tight without a lot of slippage.&lt;br /&gt;This CONAIR set has 4 truly little rollers for your neck area or side-tendrils as they say, or spit curls- as we used to say! Make sure the curl is wound good and tight, to the roller or your scalp. And dont bend over, they will fall out, they are heavy after all. Practice, lasting results are worth the learning curve on updated, ion- clunkers.&lt;br /&gt;SO I DO RECOMMEND THESE, (they are not very big but) they offer what the &#x27;old&#x27; heavy clunkers did. These CONAIRS -are THE reliable hot roller~ with nice gripping teeth.&lt;br /&gt;PLUS, if you need to buy 2 sets, and when you travel, you can just bring one heatpad for all of them. Just keep adding cold rollers to the heat pad,as you roll. Or reheat some if hair is not dry enough the first time. You can heat 12 big blue rollers on one heatpad, since you can put the big rollers where the little ones are, to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;I heard you can buy rollers, I have not found out where.?.&lt;br /&gt;Doing the ends only, I still need at least 10 rollers to get the ends to curl well, AND last. Just doing your ends is fairly quick, much easier and faster than a curling iron or twisting a flat iron over and over.&lt;br /&gt;If you like felt, there is probably a bigger set of rollers here that work. I tried one rated best, someone I know liked them. I just dont have anyluck with felt rollers&lt;br /&gt;I use a &#x27;product&#x27; spray for heat appliances, like Rusk- theirs is mousse..but I think  some kind of light dampness is the key to lasting longer. If you set daily you may not have to add a lot of product. I usually use Paul Mitchell extra firm spray styling gel. You can get about 16 , or maybe its 24 ozs. for about $20,+ it lasts forever. I got P.M. at cos metics.com. They have sales pretty often on many drug store, and some department store stuff. It might not all be &#x27;fresh&#x27; but hair products are ok from them! You need very ylittle spritz to get the curls to stay nice for a few days. Or at least for the whole day, depending on your hair of course.&lt;br /&gt;These CONAIR ROLLERS are really worth tryin. Even with longer hair. And hey, they last for years.

            <li> This is a great product. It heats up very quickly and is very compact.&lt;br /&gt;Just right for someone on the go.</li>
            <li> The case is much smaller than it looks, and yet it has plenty of curlers for my hair.  It is soft sided so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting cracked in my suitcase.  Each curler has it&#x27; own pin to match.  Heats up quickly and curls beautifully!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my new instant heat curlers - within two minutes they are well heated and was able to use.</li>
            <li> These curlers work ok. Just ok. They don&#x27;t get very hot though. They are convenient for traveling abroad.  My curls looked pretty but didn&#x27;t hold very long.</li>
            <li> The size of this set is great for travel and convenience, but the rollers do not get very hot and do nothing for my hair. The hair doesn&#x27;t even curl (grey hair). No good for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is poker straight and just above my shoulders. These are easy to wrap around the curler, quick to heat up, and leave a great long lasting wave.</li>
            <li> Quick heating.  It seems to be ready in 5 min.  Nice compact design.  The blue curlers are big enough for nice loose curls and are sufficient to do all of my shoulder length, medium thick hair.  I don&#x27;t use the smalls.  I read that the set is dual voltage but have yet to try them out overseas.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with more curlers..but overall, it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time curling my hair and getting curlers to stay, but this one was easy to put in, stayed where they should, and curled my hair, lasting a long while. I even bought a second one because not all my ear fits on this set, and the ones that had too much hair didn&#x27;t stay as well, so Second set ordered to help keep it all curly</li>
            <li> Easy,quick heat...very compact..practical for refrshing your do.&lt;br /&gt;Iif you have short or medium length hair the starter grab row really works.</li>
            <li> Great compact travel curlers - they heat up fast and don&#x27;t take up much room in your suitcase.  I have longer hair so I have substituted the 4 small rollers with the  larger ones.  They need to be ordered separately but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to replace a set of Conair Big Curls after a large piece of the case broke off. I decided to try these after shopping around and reading many reviews. I was wary because I have used flocked rollers in the past, but I definitely wanted a set where each roller sits on its own peg. This set does not take up much counter space, and it heats up quickly. The rollers get hot enough, but not so hot that they burn my hands. There are enough rollers to curl all of my thick hair at once. Since purchasing the set I have used it two or three times per week for approximately 6 weeks. I love the size of the rollers. The larger roller size that I used in the past seemed to straighten my hair more than curl it, but these leave my medium length hair with loads of curls and body. I bought the Conair plastic clips at the same time because I don&#x27;t like the metal pins that come with the set. I would definitely recommend these rollers to anyone, and I would purchase again if given the choice.</li>
            <li> I love this product and  I got a lot of compliments about my hair recently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; CON-- do not forget to turn it off after using ...&lt;br /&gt;There is no auto switch off!!</li>
            <li> it is ok....i expected the curlers to be larger.....for the money  ii&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li> I just returned from Europe, which is why I bought this product.  Everything about these rollers is great -- incredibly fast heat-up time, and they really curl your hair very well.  I love them!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for travel.  I have used it twice and find it takes a long time to heat up which I will need to adjust to on a trip.  I like the size and weight.  Wish the large rollers were slightly larger.</li>
            <li> These rollers work great.  Just wish there were a few more of them in the set.  Very lightweight &amp; easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Works well. Great deal for the price :)</li>
            <li> This is a great set of hot rollers if you have short hair or want tight curls.  These are NOT large.  There isn&#x27;t a product description so I took a chance.  The &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; is just over 1&amp;#34; not quite 1 1/4&amp;#34;.  The  &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; is just under 1&amp;#34;.  That is the measurement of the top.  The actual roller is slightly smaller.  I really want Large rollers.  I used to have the hot rollers from years ago.  These are like the smaller sizes of the three in those sets. I returned these and bought the Conair Heatwaves set with the Jumbo-1 1/2&amp;#34; and Super Jumbo-1 3/4&#x27; rollers. I hope these will work in my longer hair.  Both sets come with the wire clips and NOT the plastic comb clips.  Preferred by me.  The clips in this small set are much smaller than the old school set.  They will probably work fine.  The on/off switch in non-existent.  Just plug and un-plug.  They are a great size for travel and very light weight.  Wish they were bigger.</li>
            <li> Like it,fast heating could be more hot.Easy to use and storage</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase.  My handy, residential electrical engineer tried to fix my first one with a blown fuse.  No one had a fuse like it.  However, for the price, I liked the size and decided to try again.  These are great for those bad hair days where you need to force your hair to behave.  They are nice and small and traveled well to London without be a suitcase hog.  I would have rated them higher if my first set hadn&#x27;t died a very, very premature death.</li>
            <li> This little package of curlers takes up minimum space while supplying a fair amount of curlers.  The curler sizes are predominantly small to medium.</li>
            <li> The perfume fragrance isn&#x27;t strong enough and doesn&#x27;t last more then an hour.  If I wanted a faint scent I would use body moisturizer.  Perfume was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Knots your hair! This is not made for people with longer hair!</li>
            <li> I already had one of these and always wished I had bought two. I was so happy to find this product again. Theses rollers heat up quickly and set your hair fast. They travel very well. I take them with me on all my travels.</li>
            <li> it is a great choice when you have a short time and need gorgeous hair. I brush mine straight and use conair in the ends. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Good quality product and my wife is very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;She has already recommended to a few of her friends.&lt;br /&gt;We think one has already placed an order.</li>
            <li> i have shoulder length hair and am so impressed with these compact rollers. they heat right up quickly and the curl lasts all day. would recommend that you put a gel or mousse on your hair first that way the curl lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I read soooo many reviews before I settled on buying these.&lt;br /&gt;And the verdict is: They&#x27;re great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how compact the box is and yet everything you need is there. I thought I might need two boxes since I prefer the blue rollers and wasnt sure I&#x27;d have enough, but the 8 rollers provided do the job just fine (my hair is medium texture, wavy and below my shoulders).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat up is fast and the more you use them the better/faster they heat up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have the patience to learn how to use these well.  They heated up quickly.  I practiced on my daughter and it was easily to curl her hair and the pins work wonderfully.  I left them in for about 30 minutes and her hair looked great.  When I tried on me...not so good as the ends were frizzy.  It was hard for me to get my hair to stay put while I rolled it up because they would keep slipping out.  Very nice and compact case.  Again, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I had owned a Conair set of travel hair setter from the 90&#x27;s which I loved.  I wish they still made the Curl N Carry Set;  it was excellent and if not for the base gradually breaking apart where the rollers fit (probably a fire hazard) I would still use them.  I bought these thinking they would be just as good.  The problem I have with this set is that some of the rollers do not heat up correctly and others only get warm.  I have to constantly reposition curlers so that they all get warm enough to curl my hair.  I like them, but I really wish they all heated up at the same rate--it is annoying to have to constantly move the curlers to the center section to get them to warm up thus the 2-star rating.</li>
            <li> These take up no more than 6x6x6 in your luggage.  Extremely light weight and I can pack these in my carry on with no problems!  They heat up super quick and set my hair in just a few minutes.  Have grip teeth that help start your hair rolled,</li>
            <li> the rollers are smaller than I thought they would be. The curl is a lot tighter than I want for my hair.</li>
            <li> works amazingly for such a small set ... works 110 and 220 no problem</li>
            <li> So easy to travel with!  Fast to heat and three of us used them to get ready for New Years Eve 2013.  As soon as one got done, put the curlers back in to heat and less than 10 minutes later the next lady was ready to roll!  Great product, small and very packable.</li>
            <li> I love these.  I got myself two sets and moved all the blue/larger ones  in one container. I use them all the time and only aftrt I apply a heat protecting product. And then a curling cream. Leave them in for at least 15 min and done.</li>
            <li> I love it ! It was just what I wanted and expected. It  was a very easy way of buying just what I wanted</li>
            <li> The pins did not hold my hair at all....will not use and not worth sending back. You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> The hot rollers work well, I just wish that there were plastic clips to hold them in place rather than the metal u-clips because they are very difficult to figure out how to use effectively without getting frustrated. So if you are in a hurry to set your hair in the morning I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> Really like these, easy to put in, don&#x27;t get super hot as some others do</li>
            <li> Perfect name for this product -- instant heat and compact! These fit well on small countertops and in any suitcase very easily.  There are 8 basic rollers and 4 small rollers with the clips in an interior pocket. These heat almost immediately and work perfectly.  I like these rollers so much, I bought three!  I bought the first one just for travel, but liked them so much, I use them regularly now at home.  I keep one at my daughter&#x27;s apartment and one in our vacation home just for convenience.  Great product -- can&#x27;t say enough good things.  GREAT product!</li>
            <li> Awesome ... bought it for traveling due to it&#x27;s compact size and finally a unit with more than &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; large curlers in it (something I&#x27;ve been searching for years to find) -- however it provides such a great curl -- I&#x27;m using it exclusively now.  Heats up in minutes ... Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li> love this! and love the case. how convenient!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get a chance to use this.  My daughter, a long time electric roller user, took one look at this and...zoom...it was out of the house!  I&#x27;ll order one for myself and hide it!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  My hair is hard to curl, but the rollers do provide body.  It is also very compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Excited! Box says international plug in. Better than hoped.</li>
            <li> Leave it heating for at least 4 minutes, you will be disappointed if you don&#x27;t.  The wire clips hold fine for my hair (shoulder length, medium thick).  They are the type that were in my old set, you insert it like the photo then go down and up as you insert.  You get 8 Large and 4 medium but I wanted more large ones so I called Conair 800-326-6247 and ordered RP 106- 3 large rollers for less than $7.  If you need 3 medium rollers, it is RP 107. Compact, soft case, weighs about 1 lb.</li>
            <li> For anyone who uses hot rollers, the picture looks as if you would be receiving large and medium sized rollers.  The actual size s medium and small.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the travel hot rollers. Heat up fast, work well, and pack well for travel.</li>
            <li> They work very well...are compact and great for travel and for  quick styles at home.  This is my second set and would buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s GREAT, used it today, best electric curlers found. The heat up fast and don&#x27;t burn my fingers. Plus the ridges in the rollers grip my hair best. Good for travel as well. The only thing I wish it had is an on/off s found. The heat up fast and don&#x27;t burn my fingers. Plus the ridges in the rollers grip my hair best. Good for travel as well. The only thing I  we should had was an on/off switch rather than unplugging it. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Conair makes excellent product but when ppl say size doesn&#x27;t matter,,not so, I just thought it would be bigger. Works well, and as usual Amazon delivers prompt and professional.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers in decades but purchased these for a recent trip.  They heat up quickly, are very compact and find I&#x27;m using them quite a bit at home to freshen my hair or change the look. Good product and value.</li>
            <li> They heat quickly and do a good job. Need to order another set of larger rollers if they have a size bigger than the blue ones. I wear a bob so the back is short and the green size worked well. My hair is longer on top and need a few more rollers.</li>
            <li> Bought these for times when I haven&#x27;t planned ahead and slept in my bamboo curlers.  These heat up fast (they say two minutes, but I always give them five for more holding power).  I will probably buy a few extras, as my hair is very long and pretty thick. I recommend the &#x27;super clips&#x27; as well, as they are much easier on the scalp than the supplied U shaped ones (which work fine, they&#x27;re just a little uncomfortable). The design is excellent, they get hot where they need to for curling, but there are little nubs on them that allow handling without getting my fingers burned. They work best if not overloaded with too large an amount of hair, trial and error will soon let you know how much is just right.  The compact size is great for traveling, the soft case is easy to fit in a small suitcase. I love these!</li>
            <li> Great to get back to hot rollers...much better for my hair and styles better!  My only negative is that there is not an &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; button you have to unplug the cord yourself and sometimes I forget to do that.  However, at this price, this is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I liked these curlers initially, and thought that they would be ideal for traveling, since the set is compact.  However, after not too much use, two of the rollers are dead, and I will need to get another set.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the rapidity of the delivery and the product works just fine, but was disappointed that the rollers were so small. Apparently, my idea of jumbo and the manufacturer&#x27;s idea are different. If you have short hair, this is ideal, but for longer hair, it makes the curl too tight, hence the need for JUMBO rollers. With this said, the product itself is fine and it is indeed small enough to throw in your luggage without taking up heaps of room. If you are looking for rollers that will give hair below your shoulders a nice bounce, these rollers are to small to do the job.</li>
            <li> I really like these curlers. I use them every morning.  They heat up quickly, are easy to use and take about 20 minutes to set.</li>
            <li> These are the best little set of rollers I&#x27;ve ever used .... That&#x27;s why ordered another set</li>
            <li> Lightweight and beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> Roller were much too small for my hair.  I have naturally curly hair and I need bigger rollers to keep bigger curls and not tight curls.  If you want real curly hair, then you need to get these.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use while traveling, but I find I use them at home, too.  I love that they have 8 large rollers.</li>
            <li> Love these curlers.  I bought them for a quick curl in my hair, it&#x27;s perfect as it is all inclusive.  They heat up quick and store away nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this little set.  It heats quickly and curls my hair very well.  I have long straight hair.  It is nice and small and fit well in my suitcase for travel.</li>
            <li> The curlers are great for travel and every day use.  I find that the clips hold the curlers securely in place (unlike other brands!) and they heat quickly.  I use them every day in place of a much larger set that wasn&#x27;t nearly as easy to use.</li>
            <li> I give this 4 stars because they are super compact, heat up quickly and look nice. But they are not for big curls..they made my hair super curly..not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Works great! Compact, travels well. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Worthless rollers don&#x27;t heat up well.</li>
            <li> I needed a compact set of hot rollers to trow in my suitcase for weekend trips and would heat up very quickly, and this product exceeded my expectations.  One review stated that the rollers did not heat up in the 9 min or something like that and all i can say is they must have received a defective product.  These rollers heat up at the very least in 5 min and I only leave them in for 2 min and then I am ready to go.</li>
            <li> just what I was after..great for traveling, take up very little space, and work great!</li>
            <li> I brought these for travelling. I was very impressed by the compact size and shape as it fits nicely into my small suitcase. The clips included have their own little pocket so you don&#x27;t loose them and the rollers heat up well. I now use these on a regular basis instead of my Babyliss heated rollers.</li>
            <li> These work great and take up so little room in my already cramped bathroom. I am going to buy another set to keep in my RV.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that this set heats up INSIDE the carrying case!  It does take a little more than the \\&quot;instant\\&quot; that is advertised by Conair, but it does heat up nicely in a shorter period of time than my full set of Clairol rollers.  I would also mention that it should be emphasized that the curlers must be \\&quot;clicked into\\&quot; their posts for proper heating. Overall,this is a really great little set of hot rollers.  They don&#x27;t tangle in long hair, and they don&#x27;t  do the damage that some curling irons deliver to fragile hair.  There are just enough curlers for a complete hair setting, and more than enough for a touchup...... and it traveled neatly in my suitcase without hassle, worry about space, or worry about weight in my suitcase.... it only weighs about a pound......  excellent traveler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate on this one..... it&#x27;s just a great buy and a really great product!</li>
            <li> I bought these in the united states for travel to Europe.  I used them in the Netherlands, switzerland, germany and Italy, all with just an adapter, no converter neccessary.  only took about 10 minutes to heat up and they worked great.  I have very thick hair and the 12 rollers were plenty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, very light in weight to carry. Good for travel &amp; work as well.  I love it. Hopefully, this one will last long. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love it! Curls my fine hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> they are OK, but I am still looking for good powerful travel curlers.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go on vacation.  It is the perfect size, not too bulky or heavy.  It fit into my carry on bag.  It heats up quickly.   Actually stays in your hair with the clips provided.   It did not dry out my hair. It does make your hair curly.  So you do have to judge the amount of time the curlers are in your hair, if you don&#x27;t want a curly look. My hair is to the middle of my neck.  By the time I had the last curler in, it was time to take out the first one. I would recommend this product for travel.  It&#x27;s also good if you do not have the space to store the regular size one and need a quick curl every one in a while.</li>
            <li> I just loved these curlers. so small and compact and work so well. same as a big clunky set. these are really good for travelling. so glad I got them. thought so well of them I bought two sets.</li>
            <li> Surprising how many curlers you get in a small package, especially when compared to my 20+-year-old 5-curler travel set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback so far is that it&#x27;s not easy to identify which are the clips for the smaller curlers - at least in my set.  I marked mine with a dab of red nail polish.</li>
            <li> I love this set!  It&#x27;s compact &amp; works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this hairsetter for travel and loved it so much that I bought another one to use at home.</li>
            <li> Rollers are too narrow.</li>
            <li> seems like it takes a while to heat up, sure isn&#x27;t instant like advertised.  but I bot it to travel with and won&#x27;t need it too much.</li>
            <li> I found that the appliance did not heat up and  the pins were impossible to use.  The extra clipsI I purchased which were supposed be better also didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> I returned these. They don&#x27;t get hot and are not worth the money. Too bad, it could have been perfect for use at home and for travel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the pins to stay in! Occasionally, if you get it just right, the pins hold but otherwise they fire across the room like intercontinental missiles. I spend more time on my hands and knees looking for the dang blasted things than I do curling my hair. Am going to try the &amp;#34;pro clips&amp;#34; but am not hopeful as I have thin hair. Pretty lame of Conair as this has been a problem for some time.</li>
            <li> First curlers, very satisfied with it. The price is award winning too :-)</li>
            <li> I just got these today, and bought them on the recommendation of the many people who reviewed them, after first asking a number of questions. My hair is fine, short to medium length, and very layered.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the rollers are SMALL, which encourages layers to go crazy - so instead of giving me body, they&#x27;re just making my hair look flyaway.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I absolutely HATE the pins that come with them. I will definitely  use clamps instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WAS setting my hair with velcro rollers after a shower, and that worked much better. The trouble with that method is, I have to stay inside for two hours waiting for my hair to dry. That&#x27;s why I tried the quick method of hot rollers instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - the jury is out.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter for short to shoulder length hair. Mine runs slightly longer, but they still hold pretty good. I bought the finger clips instead. I feel they have a better grip than the ones they come with. I love how it&#x27;s compact and I can store them without having to use a lot of space under my vanity.  I will more than likely purchase another just to have more curlers since I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out a little and don&#x27;t want to risk not having enough.</li>
            <li> This is the second set of Conair hot rollers that I&#x27;ve purchased in two years.  The first set barely got warm enough to put a little wave in my hair, and my hair curls fairly easily.  Finally giving up, I bought this set, hoping for a different result.  They are equally as warm as the first and don&#x27;t curl.  Don&#x27;t listen to the 5-star results.  I did and these are getting returned.    What happened to the old days when hot rollers really were \\&quot;hot\\&quot;?  Have they cheapened them so much to save money that they no longer work?    These are definitely compact and a nice size for travel, but DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> The Conair Hot (Warm) Rollers work, but the clips are tight and they don&#x27;t get as hot as I had expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to take on a cruise (haven&#x27;t left yet, but I will update later). After three uses, here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) they are super small and will be perfect for travel&lt;br /&gt;2) there are twelve rollers and that is not enough for me, but is probably enough for most people&lt;br /&gt;3) they do get hot enough, just not instantly (like it says on the box)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I let these curlers heat up, I thought they were broken; they just didn&#x27;t get that hot. The next time, I let them heat up for a good 15-20 minutes and they did get quite hot (not as hot as my regular Conair curlers, but hot enough). Also, you need to leave them in for a good while if you want a solid curl. All the way until the curler gets cool, is a good rule of thumb. If you really want a good set, try a thermal setting spray, like Redken&#x27;s Hot Sets 22. That will give you curl for a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* Size - they are small and will be ideal in a suitcase&lt;br /&gt;* 12 curlers - that&#x27;s as many as you get in many full size hot roller sets&lt;br /&gt;* Curler size - There are four small and 8 medium curlers - no large. I like them small because I want a tight curl - this may be really undesirable for some people who want big waves. If that&#x27;s the case, just put more hair on the curler.&lt;br /&gt;* Price - the price is perfect for this set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* they don&#x27;t heat up &amp;#34;instantly&amp;#34; - that&#x27;s just silly&lt;br /&gt;* I need three more rollers, but I&#x27;ll use a curling iron as well</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work for my hair.  Not enough rollers!!!  I am growing out layered hair, and my hair is fairly fine.  I was hoping for more curls and pizzazz, but the curls were just sort of...limp.  I will stick to my curling irons or my foam curlers to get real curls, real fast, with real convenience.  These were a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but packs a wallop.  Perfect for taking on a trip because it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  Heats up quickly and gets the job done.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, as it is fast heating, and contains more rollers than I have ever had in a small, very portable hair setter.</li>
            <li> I am learning how to use this things, but i love the way it make my hair look and feel,&lt;br /&gt;i have curly hair ( latina) and it give me a lot of volume and waves that made me look&lt;br /&gt;even better.</li>
            <li> these are great.  After years of abuse ( leaving it on all day -lots) I finally decided to get a new one - my old one was starting to take longer to heat up.  This heats up in minutes which is perfect for my busy schedule.  Compact - curlers work fast- small to travel with- no complaints!</li>
            <li> Great for traveling.  Compact and rollers get nice and hot for a good curl.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to put the clips in.  No directions.</li>
            <li> Nice to travel with. Works well.  Quick delivery</li>
            <li> returned - didn&#x27;t open - found one cheaper</li>
            <li> good for when you&#x27;re in a pinch or for travel</li>
            <li> Heated up fast. But not for me. Have shoulder length hair and rollers were&lt;br /&gt;way too small.  but someone with short hair would be fine.  Two or three inch&lt;br /&gt;lengths of hair on roller would work well.</li>
            <li> These are a good value &amp;  if you have long hair they might work better than they did for me.  I couldn&#x27;t get them to stay in my hair</li>
            <li> The write up says these rollers are large and jumbo.  Not at all the case.  Much to small to long hair.</li>
            <li> These curlers are quite small and the curls made me look a bit like Shirley Temple as a youngster (which probably dates me by the reference -- but let&#x27;s put it this way, not becoming on an-at-least-middle-aged person)  There is no way to know when the curlers are hot.  The curlers stayed in just fine and are easy to keep clean.  It is certainly compact for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want small, tight curls this is a good option for travel because you get more than the five jumbos in other travel cases.  But it doesn&#x27;t work for those of us that like jumbo and super jumbo rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers for travel or at home, I am looking for hot air curlers of sufficient number that are all super-jumbo or at least a true jumbo size!</li>
            <li> My wife uses it every day! Compact for easy storage and travel.  Easy to use.  Heats up quickly.  The rollers hold the hair well.  Right number of rollers in each size.</li>
            <li> The set was misrepresented.  The rollers are advertised as large and medium.  They are really small and tiny.  I can&#x27;t use it.  I have already bought one elsewhere that suits but have not figured out how to ship this one back yet.  Actually, I have never had to ship something back to Amazon before. I have gotten movies that were not what I thought I was getting but kept them anyway but nothing totally unsuitable before.</li>
            <li> This beats having a large set that takes up too much room.  I have thick, fine hair and these curlers are just enough.  I love them.  Everything is handy in a small case.</li>
            <li> They give me a slight curl and a little body.  They work okay.</li>
            <li> Great buy!  I bought these for travel, but I love these curlers so much I&#x27;m now using them at home!  They&#x27;re faster and hold better than my old clunky set.</li>
            <li> Compact, easy to transport and very functional. This product is a great and economic purchase which allows curl to be added to your styl.</li>
            <li> These curlers work really good and heat up really fast.  Only down side, did not come with the clips, so check to make sure they did not leave yours out. I had some from my other curlers.</li>
            <li> Regrettably, this hair setter is no improvement over the one I used 20 years ago:&lt;br /&gt;rollers are heavy, the starter strip doesn&#x27;t really help the roller grip hair stands for a smooth, neat roll-up and the metal clips are a pain to slip on the rollers. &#x27;Medium&#x27; rollers are small diameter, but the 8 larger rollers were  adequate to set the top layers of my med. length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat is gentle and the rollers did provide a slight lift (I left them in for 30 minutes).  The unit is compact and therefore easy to store or travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Credit card &#x27;points&#x27; covered the price of the unit; for that reason, I&#x27;ll keep it but use it only occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this again, although such setting products are probably all pretty much alike.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t warm up evenly.  Curlers won&#x27;t stay in.  Worthless for my use.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a compact set of rollers that would travel well.  These are perfect! They heat up fast. I have below-the-shoulder thick hair and these are just enough.  When I opened the package, there was an order form for getting more rollers, which I may do.  It would be nice to have a set of all larger rollers.  The smaller rollers are almost too small for my liking.</li>
            <li> I tried it just once and it is not work on my hair. But I&#x27;ll keep try, maybe i made something wrong. I have really long and fin hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great little set.  It heats up ultra-fast, and creates great curls with lots of bounce and shine.  A++</li>
            <li> great compact set of heated rollers. Heats up quickly and is light and easy to carry in travel bag.</li>
            <li> This is great for travel. The starter combs on the rollers are useless and cause some issues when putting the clips in but great product.</li>
            <li> These are all right in a pinch.i wish they where larger rollers.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, along with large clamps for her to use instead of the pins that are included with the curlers.  Heats quickly.  Very compact for travel.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Very handy little kit. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and it does provide great results. My only complaint is they don&#x27;t give you enough rollers and I have less than shoulder length hair. This was for my wife she is reviewing the product.</li>
            <li> Heats up in less than 2 minutes. Works great and the portability is great. Doesn&#x27;t take much room in the suitcase? Thanks conair.</li>
            <li> Used the product for the first time today.  I had read the reviews to push the curlers into the base--and the instructions said to close the top when heating.  Doing those two things worked well as far as heating the curlers.  After placing the curlers, 15 minutes later I had a nice curl.  Only comment--I would have liked 2 more curlers but got by with the 12.</li>
            <li> Listen, I don&#x27;t know what some other reviewers thought they were buying when they bought this set, but it works, it;s cheap, it;s well-made and incredibly convenient. Electric hair setters have been around since the sixties and have changed very little. The rollers get hot, yes - they have to to do their job. Even used a cold curling iron? But these rollers will not burn your fingers unless you hold them closed in your hand for long minutes, then I wonder if they wouldnt cool to the point of non burning anyway.. Pick them up, roll your hair, and clip them in place. The clips take a time or two to understand how they work, and yes, they can be a little uncomfortable, but, woman, you are putting curlers in your hair...do you expect them to feel pleasant?&lt;br /&gt;These heat up quickly, and curl nicely. If you have a ton of heavy hair, you will want extra rollers. My hair is collar length and I am fine with these. I use them for body, curve, and bounce, I do not expect to look like Shirley Temple when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you leave them in a few minutes, you get light body that will last a few hours, especially if you spray or gel. If you leave them in ten min or so, you get long lasting curls. If you heat them for ten min they&#x27;re good to go for a quick pick me up, heat them longer, the curl lasts longer. Follow the directions, use the thing the way it&#x27;s meant o be used and it&#x27;s a life-saver. I took the with me to a weekend wedding - series of parties, dinners, ceremony. They were way quicker than curling iron, I could do my make up while they heated and get dressed while I wore them Loved them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the set resides in a vanity drawer, fits nicely, and I heat them up right in the drawer when I need them. If you want a wonderful, inexpensive tool that&#x27;s excellent for what it is MEANT to do, buy this one. Buy two - keep one in your desk at work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, perfect for traveling. Heats up fast. I may have to use hair spray to hold my curls, it depends on your hair volume and thickness. I don&#x27;t need to buy more. lips, the quantity is just right for my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item while on a trip.  The hot rollers are compact and fit easily in your suitcase.  The rollers are smaller and will provide tighter curls.  There are enough to do your entire head. They heat up and cool down as needed.  The cool down part is key for packing in the morning.  The unit has held up across many trips.  I can leave it in my suitcase so it is always at the ready.</li>
            <li> Great Item! Perfect for traveling and takes up no space! Heats up super fast and leaves my normally impossible to curl pin straight hair with beautiful bouncy perfect curls!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! I travel a lot and these are perfect.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this. My curls didn&#x27;t hold up for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> The curlers get hot very quickly and remain hot long enough to thoroughly set the curl.  Zippered top is superior to the velcro-held flap of some sets, so the clips don&#x27;t get lost in your travels.</li>
            <li> The curlers get hot but because I have thick hair, eight large rollers aren&#x27;t enough. Also found the little spikes on the rollers pull my hair and make it frizz. I&#x27;d never had hot rollers so I didn&#x27;t know the difference between these and the smooth ones. It&#x27;s a good concept but didn&#x27;t really give me the results I was looking for. I&#x27;m looking at buying smooth rollers to see if that works better.</li>
            <li> Great travel curlers!</li>
            <li> Ordered these and got the all pink set. Not a huge deal as it&#x27;s the same product but just a different color.....but image was misleading. This has happened several times with my Amazon purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is great. Extremely compact case that seems easy to travel with. I am looking forward to taking this set on business trips and also on vacation as it will not take up half of my suitcase. Honestly, my sneakers take up more room than these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of product- rollers are pretty narrow. I have long but fine hair so this has not been a problem, but if you have long and/or thick hair this set probably will not work. I like that the set has the traditional skinny hair pins to secure each roller. My enormous, clunky set (a Remington version) used clips which left terrible crimps near the root of my hair. Trashed that set (which I paid about $35 for) and paid half as much for this one which is a better size and creates nicer looking curls for me.</li>
            <li> The are compact and most efficient.  I really appreciate them</li>
            <li> These rollers are perfect for home or for the road warrier!  Heat fast and work great!  Lightweight and soft-sides make it easy to pack!</li>
            <li> great for travel!  they heat up fast and the dont take up much space! like the dark case - as it doesnt show handling marks!</li>
            <li> Have used these numerous times and love them.  Easy and convenient to use and work well.  Perfect for traveling too!</li>
            <li> I had a set of these that I used very often and they gave out on me so purchased another set since I loved them so much.</li>
            <li> When I first got these, I was concerned over how old it looked. The cardboard box it came in was faded like it sat in the sun for a long time, and it was all beat up. But I thought I&#x27;ll go ahead and give them a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the rollers in my hair right now and my first impressions are how hot they didn&#x27;t get. I let them sit for a good 15 minutes before putting them in my hair and they weren&#x27;t very warm. Every other rollers I&#x27;ve had get so hot that you can hardly stand to handle them, but these were barely warm at all. In addition, they didn&#x27;t seem to grip my fine, straight hair very well. I had to reroll each one multiple times to get it to stay in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing. I&#x27;m going to wait until I take them out to see how they do, but my hopes are not high.</li>
            <li> Quick heat/ dual voltage. Compact and well-priced.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd one. One for home, one for travel, and&lt;br /&gt;on for office.</li>
            <li> These are functional enough but take a long time to heat and leave some ridges on the hair. They are, however, much preferable to the Remington H-1015 set.</li>
            <li> Okay product, does the job, I hate having to write more words, I&#x27;m done, if you want more words you are going to get less reviews.</li>
            <li> Although this item is compact and is great for travel, I use it all of the time!&lt;br /&gt;It takes less space to store and gets the job done.  Much smaller than my last&lt;br /&gt;larger set and just as good.</li>
            <li> I bought thinking this would be great for travel.  The reviews were good but I did not think that the unit got hot enough and the rollers seemed to heavy for the pins that secured them.  Should have sent back.  I do not use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent, in a few minutes you have a wonderful  hair stile, they are easy to put on and they dont fall like other brand</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for because I wanted more bigger rollers and the price was unbelievably good. Travels well because of the compact size.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and found these curlers perfect for taking with me when I travel. I mainly use the larger curlers and don&#x27;t have any issues with the clips. They heat up quickly and produce great curls.</li>
            <li> perfect for traveling and curl hair well.  just make sure you leave them in the pouch and have the pouch closed while heating.  once they hit the open air the start cooling down.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time this a.m. ....pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is so compact.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light and compact to travel with&lt;br /&gt;Rollers heat up SUPER fast&lt;br /&gt;Rollers are not very hot to the touch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None!</li>
            <li> It was a cute idea for travel, but for my purposes, it had too few rollers and never quite got hot enough. I ended up buying and keeping the Conair Compact Hairsetter (in blue); it&#x27;s a little clunkier to travel with but delivers much better results and has the right number of rollers.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to arrive with clips to secure the curlers and those were missing from the box.  The curlers do an adequate job but they don&#x27;t really heat well.  I was annoyed by the missing clips as there is no way to use the curlers without them.  I went to a beauty supply store and purchased them as it was cheaper than returning the item.  I would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers they heat up fast, &amp; stay hot. They take up very little space &amp; are very easy to use. I am a beginner when it comes to using hot rollers &amp; these have turned out to be a perfect first set.</li>
            <li> Very good for traveling.</li>
            <li> My wife loved the curlers. They work fast and the curl lasts</li>
            <li> Disappointing. Very small curlers</li>
            <li> Good design and heats well. The rollers do heat well and curl hair well. Clips hold rollers on place. Portable for travel.</li>
            <li> The small compact design makes for easy storage. Heats up quick and the curlers are easy to handle! More importantly it works...makes nice curls!!</li>
            <li> I have yet to master these but I like them so far. I have medium length hair, 2 inches or so past my shoulders and I can get all my hair up in these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: If done correctly these give great curls that last. With the catch-strip they are easy to roll. Nice color-coated clips don&#x27;t leave dent in your hair, they heat up fast and take up very little room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the curls can be inconsistent but i blame that more on me than the product. Sometimes its hard not to touch the metal contacts on the bottom of the rollers. The clips are kind of tricky to use.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect curlers for a traveler - Dual Voltage!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these for my mom for a recent trip to Europe. My mom was planning to take her current curlers she uses in the U.S. and just purchase a voltage converter to travel oversees.  But after reading much research on voltage converters - they are not suggested for heating elements such as curlers, irons, straighteners and stuff.  So we searched &amp; searched for Dual Voltage hot rollers - its pretty crazy that the options are limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews for these curlers - I bought these hot rollers.  They worked perfectly! They heat up quickly! They are light for packing &amp; travel! Just the perfect accessory for the hot roller travelers :) My mom loved them!!</li>
            <li> I love these and have used them often over the past two years. They are nicely compact for use on travel vacations. Heat very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set. This is my second set, only because I needed more larger sizes. I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Too Small....  And made my hair Fuzzy!  Recommended for short hair, or a Teen.  I could not use them. Sorry</li>
            <li> This is more intended for pack and travel....very cute. However, I have lots of thick hair. Could use a couple extra rollers. Does not get as hot as I am accustomed to, but works just the same.</li>
            <li> I am using the same product currently and love it.  Wanted one at my son&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;and a new one for me.</li>
            <li> I left them plugged in for 20 minutes and they were only slightly warm to the touch. I tried them anyway and barely got any curl in my hair.  I am very surprised that they got as good of reviews as they did.  I am returning them.&lt;br /&gt;The pins held the hair well and the  size of this mini set was good.  If they would have just heated up they would get a much higher review.</li>
            <li> Eh... that about sums it up.  Nice rollers.  Nice bag.  Nice concept.  NO HEAT!  They just don&#x27;t curl the way I&#x27;m used to hot rollers curling.  It could be the lack of flocking that my other rollers had, but they just don&#x27;t seem to heat up enough.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and easy to use. The small rods were smaller than I expected for my thick shoulder-length hair. I would prefer all 12 curlers to be the larger size.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Compact is ease at home and perfect for traveling.  It comes with pin clips... I have choose to use my large plastic clips from Hot Rollers past.  Curls lasted all day and woke up the next morning with curls.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little traveler pack.  Stores great and has a nice variety of sizes. Would have given it five starts but does not get as hot as my old set but it works ok.  I just leave them in a little longer.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Compact. My curls lasted 2 days</li>
            <li> Small enough to easily pack. Fast heating up right in bag.  Love this item--so compact, so efficient</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Ratings are accurate!</li>
            <li> I think this would work well as a travel or home set.  I rarely use hair curlers so my first (and to date only) attempt produced a poofy mop of crazy curls.  My kids thought I looked hilarious.  If I use again, would leave them in just momentarily.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised with these travel curlers.  I took the set on a two week vacation packing only a carry on.  They took up very little room in my bag.  They heated well and worked great!  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I have fine, long-ish hair and these curlers worked really well for me. They warmed up very fast (I&#x27;d say 2-5 minutes), and gave my hair a nice curl, (though a little bumpy in places). But the size is amazing; it&#x27;s tiny! It took up no space in my suitcase unlike the other travel models out there. Plus there are 12 curlers in the pack--also very unlike other models. For those two reasons I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy this cute curling system. In just 15 minutes I have bundles of beautful curls. Just make sure you use the right pins for the color of the curler rods. They are color coded so you can&#x27;t go wrong, the pins are colored on the tip. The pouch is the right size for home or travel. Conair made me very happy with this,there is no return on this product.</li>
            <li> I use these compact rollers every day.  The unit heats up in a matter of minutes and they do a great job!  So convenient on trips--they fit anywhere, and take up next to no room in a suitcase.  I love, love, love these!</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this seller and this purchase.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for traveling</li>
            <li> It was a gift, but my mom likes them!</li>
            <li> Curlers have uneven heat and were smaller then I thought. Some curlers were extremely hot and some were barley warm. Not worth the risk!</li>
            <li> I had long, fine hair when I first received this. I had a lot of problems with my hair tangling in the rollers. A little while later I cut my hair to medium length, but I still had the tangling problem. Sometimes it takes a minute or more to untangle a roller. I am also disappointed with how hot the rollers get. They never get truly hot and so the curl does not hold up well during the day. I also get crinkles in my hair from the roller clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may work well for people with short hair that is thick or medium, but I would not recommend it for anyone with fine hair that is medium length or long.</li>
            <li> This is a perfectly sized travel set of electric rollers.  I have another which are all the same sized rollers and therefore not quite as good since my hair at the back is too short to hold them.</li>
            <li> I have alot of hair and when I saw these, I feared they would not be large enough to roll my whole head. They are actually perfect. My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length and these curlers do the trick.  They heat up fast and REALLY curl. On top of that the curl lasts me a second day!  I have a larger set of heat curlers I normally use and bought these for a trip since  they are compact. I have to be honest, there are better than my regular set and now I use these at home instead to. Fastest and longest lasting curls I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up quickly and make styling your hair very easy.  They don&#x27;t get stuck in your hair like the old type.  They are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I read many reviews of many many hot rollers before deciding on this one. I&#x27;m very pleased with this--it heats up quickly, it&#x27;s easy to use (no hot poles to burn your hand on as you reach for more rollers), it&#x27;s compact and it works. I leave the rollers in for about 7 minutes and the curls turn out great. The clips are easy to use and they don&#x27;t leave clip marks or dents. I would buy this exact same one if I had it to do over again.</li>
            <li> I was replacing another brand of electric rollers. These are easy to use and they heat up quickly, but the curl doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long. The rollers are adequate for what I need; I just wish the curls were more long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness someone still makes good rollers that don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. Please keep a good product around. I love them.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this product a stellar review, as the unit is compact and ideal for travel. However, to my regret, the rollers do not heat up quickly or get hot enough to give my hair a real curl. I might try buying small replacements for the larger rollers and see if that helps. If you like smaller, hot curlers, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> These rollers are the perfect size and heat up quickly. I like that they do not get so hot that they are hard to handle.</li>
            <li> This product works as it should and was promoted to do what it does.  I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These rollers didn&#x27;t work for me.  They are far too small to do a decent job in styling my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Had my old set for years...was so glad to see they still make these.  Small set, heat up quickly, great results, easy to travel with....I just love them.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> These rollers could heat up a bit more, and I definitely do not like the awkward metal clips that are to hold the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> Great for travel, small and compact. Hair looks great after use.</li>
            <li> It was the right size, light weight and worked great. Heated up fast and cooled down fast. Perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> I received this roller set as a gift last Christmas.  I have fine, straight hair that just touches my shoulders, and I like curling it once and awhile for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I found that these rollers heated up quickly, and they gripped the hair well thanks to a combination of the combs on the rollers themselves and the included metal clips (although I would have preferred something a bit more updated--my old roller set from the 1970s had the EXACT same clips).  There are 8 medium-sized rollers and 4 smaller rollers, and this is the main flaw of this set.  First, these 12 rollers were barely enough to set all of my hair--and, as I mentioned earlier, my hair is relatively short (just touching my shoulders) and rather thin, so no way would this set work for someone with longer or thicker hair.  Second, the medium-sized rollers really didn&#x27;t work very well for me, as my hair was too short for them (but yet there wouldn&#x27;t be enough for someone with longer hair).  The smaller rollers were better, yet there was only four of them, so their use was limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was disappointed in this set.  There are definitely some good things about it--and it is certainly sized nicely for travel if that&#x27;s your main purpose in purchasing it--but due to both the roller size and limited number of rollers, the usefulness of this set restricted.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair that curls perfectly using Conair&#x27;s soft flocked curlers, so I hoped these would work, but they were a disappointment. They took 5 minutes to heat up, and even then weren&#x27;t hot enough to hold a good curl. I&#x27;ll be returning them.</li>
            <li> Five stars because the size is perfect for travel and fitting in drawer at home.&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for quickly heating and cooling. I begin taking rollers out as soon as I place last roller in.&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for the well thought out case: rollers sit on heating base; cord runs out of small opening in back of bag; a reinforced pocket in rear of bag for roller clips; zips around sides and front; clear top with handle; cord fits inside for packing.&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for the price!</li>
            <li> Twelve curlers just doesn&#x27;t do it for my shoulder length hair. Despite the fact that my hair is thinner than it was back when I first used hot rollers, I still need 20 of them: sixteen large and four medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem with the heating speed of this product as it is. Note: it IS important to leave the case closed as directed. (An indicator dot would have been a helpful addition.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curler design is excellent. I like the wide no tangle hair separators that encircle most of the roller and the tightly spaced holding comb that makes a single line down the cylinder. The end flanges to avoid burning your fingers are great, too. Since I&#x27;m accustomed to the wire holders, they don&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, Conair, I didn&#x27;t want two sets, and I didn&#x27;t want any jumbo rollers. I wanted one set of 20 rollers, which is a fairly standard number of rollers for setting a full head of hair. I thought I&#x27;d object to the flimsy plastic cover. In fact, you don&#x27;t move that cover around much, so it turns out that it doesn&#x27;t need to be very tough, and it&#x27;s more durable as flimsy thin vinyl than it was as rigid plastic 40 years ago. Go figure!</li>
            <li> super love the curls!</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with these rollers. They heat up quickly and put a nice curl to my hair rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love these rollers but just couldn&#x27;t. My hair is chin length but is too thick and wavy for these rollers. Have to heat up twice to have enough and the look was straight out of the 80s!</li>
            <li> Tried only once but took a long time to get hot and not enough rollers.</li>
            <li> I just received these rollers today, just tried them out and I already love them.  They heat up quickly, get nice and hot, and my hair has soft, bouncy curls.  Make sure the rollers are pushed all the way down onto the posts so they make contact and can heat up.  I also own the  Conair Compact Hairsetter, Blue, but don&#x27;t like it nearly as much.  If you use \\&quot;end papers\\&quot; (I just use a sheet of folded toilet paper), it will grab your hair ends better when rolling it.  I also use the Conair Hot Roller Super Clips. These hold the rollers in place nicely. This little hair setter is so compact and will be great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how quickly they heated up and the amount of curl it produced. Wish they came in a bigger size, the curl was a little tight for me and maybe it&#x27;s just an adjustment of time in hair and amount of hair per roller. Overall, excellent!</li>
            <li> I purchased this set to take with me on business travel. I pack light, so each item I bring has to be worth the precious space in my carry-on bag. This set makes the cut because of its small size and weight, and the ease of use. I just take out the case, plug it directly into the wall, and within a few minutes I unzip the top and have 12 curlers hot and ready. The metal clips tuck into a small slot inside the case and are easily accessible. For home use, I would go with a full-sized set, but I definitely recommend this set for travel.</li>
            <li> Do not buy these rollers they are not round but oval and they crimp the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> Curlers work great. Picks are included. I plan on using these on my trip to Europe in a few weeks. Much less bulky than my old rollers. Oh, and they gave off no odor when heated. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Conair HS28X Instant Heat Compact Styling Setter.  The rollers are a good size, the clips secure effectively, and the unit is a compact size to pack for travel.  However, ... I have tried to heat these rollers from multiple electrical outlets.  They barely heat up and, as such, are useless to me.  Every electrical outlet works perfectly and other products work as they should, so obviously there is a defect in the product that I received.  When I recently traveled, I used another, larger set of rollers that heat up quickly and hot.  I was looking forward to a more compact set.  This was a big disappointment and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Makes things VERY easy in the morning. I&#x27;m not the one to sit down while fixing my hair. I prefer moving around while doing so and these are perfect for that kind of lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I used these while on a month long vacation and they worked just fine. They heat up quickly and the starter strip helps hold the hair to get the roller started. Very compact. I&#x27;m taking them to Hawaii next month.</li>
            <li> I hate to leave bad reviews, but I felt that I should since this set didn&#x27;t really work for me, and I bought it based on the positive reviews I read. I bought this set to because the other travel set I have didn&#x27;t have enough rollers. I planned to use them together. I found that the curls from this roller set quickly fell out and the curls made from my other set stayed in for hours. I love my other set, but thought I&#x27;d try this one to see if I liked it better. I ended up returning this Conair set. I&#x27;ll compare the two:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other set I have is the Remington H-1015 Ceramic Compact, Large and Medium Roller set, also sold on Amazon for a similar price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Quantity: Remington set has 10 rollers. Conair set has 12 rollers.&lt;br /&gt;-Pins: They both use similar pins to secure the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;-Surface: The Remington rollers a kind of velvety black smooth surface with some slight ridges. The Conair rollers are hard plastic, with a &amp;#34;starting strip.&amp;#34; I thought the starting strip made it easier to wrap my hair around the roller without the shorter hair popping out, and they stayed more securely in my hair while it was setting, however, when removing the rollvers, they kind of got stuck in my hair and &amp;#34;combed&amp;#34; out the curl a bit, making the curl fuzzy. When removing the Remington rollers, the rollers fall right out and the curl is shiny and in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;Handling: The Conair rollers were easier to handle and they didn&#x27;t seem to get as hot to the touch. I think this probably detracts from their effectiveness. The Remington rollers are fine to handle on the ends, but sometimes a little too hot to hold in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;Travel Pouch: They&#x27;re both nice and compact. The Remington pouch is slightly smaller, only because it has fewer rollers. I preferred the Remington pouch. It was thicker and seemed more durable.&lt;br /&gt;MOST IMPORTANTLY...&lt;br /&gt;Results: The curls from the Conair set fell out within about an hour. The curls from my Remington set looked great all day. As soon as I took out the Conair rollers, I noticed the curls were not as springy as they were with the Remington set. I compared these sets under the exact same conditions, since I used them at the same time. They both heated for about 10 minutes before I used them, with the pouches closed. The rollers were left in for about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the Conair set and got another Remington set. I understand that everyone&#x27;s hair behaves differently, so maybe this set will work for you. I just thought I&#x27;d share my experience.ooked great all day.

            <li> The size of these is so perfect! This is a great little cube of curlers and they are just the perfect hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have long hair then it might give you smaller curls so I recommend this for shorter hair and medium lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was well worth the price and they work great!</li>
            <li> These are the coolest curlers - they have replaced my big set. No wasted counter space with these, the set is very small.  And there are more of the large rollers than there were in my big set.  The small curler posts also fit the big rollers so you could purchase 4 more large rollers to replace the 4 small ones if you wanted to. I plug them in when I start to blow dry and they are ready by the time I am done, which is probably about 5 minutes.  I like the wires because they don&#x27;t leave marks in my hair.  I like the little pocket the wires fit into too.  The only thing I miss is there is no indicator light to remind me the set is still plugged in.</li>
            <li> This roller set is a nice compact set perfect to throw in your suitcase, but has a big issue.  The rollers do not heat evenly so I ended up sending it back.</li>
            <li> Nice set of rollers for travel/works well for mid-length to shorter hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the box looked like it came out of a salvage sale. I was worried that it was not new. It was taped up and the corners were worn. I presume it was a new product. Another point is that there is no change switch for the dual voltage. Does it automatically change when using it abroad? I bought separate clips as my hair is thin and the rollers seem heavy with the clips provided.</li>
            <li> This is a nice compact set of rollers.  I wondered if it really was dual voltage between the US and Europe, but it actually is, without any visible switch to turn on.  It heats up faster in Europe (France) than it does on 110 voltage.  It is the answer to my needs for travel.  You will like it.</li>
            <li> Nice, compact set, recommended.</li>
            <li> These are great for travel! They heat up relatively quickly and it&#x27;s great they fit so well into a packed suitcase.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this was going to work for travel, but there not enough curlers to set all my hair.</li>
            <li> These work perfect for travel rollers. They heat up pretty fast and are easy to use. I only wish instead of the multiple sizes, it had only 12 of the larger blue and none of the green!</li>
            <li> These were bought for my daughter to roll her hair before her stage shows.  If you follow the instructions, they say to heat them in the bag with the lid closed for more efficient heating.  I usually let them heat a full 5 minutes, not the 90 seconds that these instant heat rollers say they need.  After that 5 minutes, they are really hot!  We have had no problems at all with them not getting warm enough like some reviewers and they stay in her hair (super thick, long, and straight) very well.  Love this set and would buy again in a heartbeat if it dies.</li>
            <li> you have to make sure all the rolles are pushed down on the heater. The way the pins hold the rolles isn&#x27;t that easy.</li>
            <li> Very compact. They do take longer to warm up than my previous hot rollers and don&#x27;t get as hot but hot enough for me.</li>
            <li> Just returned from a trip. The curlers worked great and it was really nice to be able to take them and not use up so much space in my suitcase!</li>
            <li> Great size and dual voltage to boot.  great for foreign travel and cruise ships.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used curlers in a while and I find the clips to be very hard to use.  They do a good job but not great as other electric curlers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  I bought two so I could easily pack them.</li>
            <li> I really love these rollers.  They are quick to heat up and use.  I happen to hold them with hair clips (butterfly version) rather then the thin pins they give you.</li>
            <li> These are really great.  They are convenient and extremely fast to heat up.  My only problem is with the description.  It says 8 large rollers and 4 small.  The &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; rollers are 1.25 inches.  The small are 1inch.  To me that would be 8 medium rollers and 4 small.  If you&#x27;re looking for a set of rollers on the small side you should love these.</li>
            <li> I always get a ton of compliments every time I curl my hair with these curlers. My hair is long and requires two sets of these. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are great! Love that I can pack them!</li>
            <li> Great for travelling or office purposes. Small and handy</li>
            <li> Very happy!  I did do my homework and feel I made the right chose.  Good quality, very compact and&lt;br /&gt;will travel well.  I give a few minutes to get good and hot and I can easily handle them, clips are tight so they&lt;br /&gt;stay put.  I have a lot of hair but I manage to get a complete set.  I get nice soft curls and body with the&lt;br /&gt;large rollers.  I would highly recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> When ordering these rollers I had hoped for a larger size roller.  This unit has 4 small, and 8 medium size rollers from a typical conair roller set.  But,  the set looked like a great concept.</li>
            <li> found it difficult to attach the clip to the roller....</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much out of these but wanted something that would heat quickly &amp; not take up much space. These did the trick! I have VERY thick hair &amp; a lot of it. I let these heat, roll my hair, let it set for 5 minutes or so &amp; the curls are great. I recommend these if you want lots of style in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Just received this product. It did not come with the clips</li>
            <li> I still use hot rollers, so when I travel I got tired of lugging my big set with me! I decided to give these a try...and they are compact, heat fairly quickly, and did a good job curling my long hair. I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Really love these curlers.  Small and compact and work well.  Took off 1 star because there is nowhere to store cord.  The company should add an attached pouch to store the cord.  Otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers have saved my frizzy hair! For the first time in nearly 40 years, I have let my hair grow long, but I can&#x27;t let the hair dry naturally or it looks frizzy nor can I blow it dry without it looking frizzy. These rollers, packed tightly in a lightweight travel case, have solved my frizzy hair problem!&lt;br /&gt;In just about ten minutes, my hair is transformed into bouncy curls that I&#x27;ve never been able to have.&lt;br /&gt;The rollers heat up quickly, are easy to use and do not tangle the hair. I had to learn quickly to handle only the ends.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the instructions are murky and the clips for fastening are color-coded: the wider ones are for the largest rollers and the narrow ones are for the smaller rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product was delivered to my door in two days!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and gives great curls.  I love how compact the case is and easy for travel.  I have medium thick hair and there is enough rollers in this small package to curl all of my hair.</li>
            <li> Curlers heat quickly and clips work well.  Great travel size.  I have shoulder-length hair.  These would probably be better for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> No matter how long the preheat, the rollers do not get hot enough to hold the curl.</li>
            <li> too much work and I don&#x27;t really get the curls I wanted.</li>
            <li> The size is great for squeezing into a carry-on. Functionality-wise, they&#x27;re lackluster. I don&#x27;t feel like they get as hot as my full-size set so they don&#x27;t do much for the roots. The gripper teeth just get in the way, IMO (I always roll with end papers) and the roller itself is kind of oval rather than round. I have shoulder-length hair that isn&#x27;t overly thick. I am able to roll all of my hair on this set if I really push it but I do not get any kind of meaningful curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a business traveler who just wants something to put a little bounce in your hair for day-time, this set does the trick. If you really want to do your hair for the evening, you&#x27;re going to need something more.</li>
            <li> these wonderful little rollers give my hair an incredible bounce and curl, lots of compliments on my hair after using this product, easily to use heats up in minutes and is so small it is a pleasure to use, Highly recommend,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to roll curlers and attach wire holders.  Resulting curls disappointing.</li>
            <li> The curlers are a great styling tool.  Easy to use and does a fabulous job in creating curls.</li>
            <li> Absolutely brilliant, very easy to use. Heats up quickly and curls are very good</li>
            <li> These curlers work well for daily use and travel well.</li>
            <li> Good rollers! Not large and medium, more like medium and small. Would prefer larger and even better if flocked! They are lightweight and do work well.</li>
            <li> I needed a new travel size curler set and although this is a bit larger than my last set it is much easier to use and doesn&#x27;t burn my fingers. The manufacturer of my other set was Remington and it was compact, did a great job with curling my hair but I just got tired of burning my fingers handling the curlers. Its going out in the next yard sale!</li>
            <li> wrong size rollers, did not like product</li>
            <li> Heat up fast, compact for traveling and really get the job done.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping the large rollers would be 1.25 inch diameter where the hair goes.  The large rollers are 1.25 inch where your fingers touch on the outer rim.  They are about an inch where the hair rolls around.  These are too small for my long hair.  PLEASE Amazon, get the diameters of rollers in the descriptions and specify whether the diameter given is outer rim or where the hair rolls around.  Imprecise words like &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; are not helpful at all.  These seem to be fine for what they are  -very compact. Would love a compact set of 8 rollers in a soft case just a 1/4 inch larger in diameter than the largest ones in this set.</li>
            <li> Can anyone please tell me how to get the clips on? Tried many times and still couldn&#x27;t clip my hair on the rollers.</li>
            <li> These are not the hot rollers your mother used!  Heats quickly, styles nicely, great value.</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s compact and works great!</li>
            <li> Very Handy...great for travel!</li>
            <li> Did not realise it was American. I had to buy 2 plugs  Please delete, have changed  my mind in having my name submitted</li>
            <li> these don&#x27;t work at all. I heated these up for a very long time (just to make sure) and then left them on my hair until they well fully cooled and then when I took them off, my hair was already straight again by the time I was finished taking them out. I tried them twice trying to use them to their full potential and both times the curlers did nothing for me. Usually my hair holds curl averagely to very well so I was very disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> Would not stay in my hair.  Did not curl very well so I sent them back.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for travel and they really get hot.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for traveling</li>
            <li> This was a complete and utter waste of money...here&#x27;s the beginning of my laundry list of complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  There is no indication of when it&#x27;s heated up.  I waited about five minutes and then just started to randomly touch it (that&#x27;s what she said).  Impractical and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The rollers don&#x27;t stay hot for long and generally didn&#x27;t seem all that hot.  The only moderate curl I got was on the very first one I managed to put in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The pins are the WORST and not do stay in place.  They completely did not stay on the roller, or in my hair and hurt when I tried to push them in so they&#x27;d properly hold.  My hair slid out of the roller before I could secure them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  The rollers are shaped oddly...with grooves.  What for?  I have no idea.  Do you want ridges in your hair?  If it&#x27;s suppposed to help grip one&#x27;s hair, it FAILS MISERABLY at that task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to try these out or they would have been a definite return.  I have fine textured long hair, straight with a slight wave, easy to curl but tends to fall flat.  If you have thicker or coarser hair, perhaps this may be a better tool.</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast. The curlers stay in so so - not bad - not great.&lt;br /&gt;My big issue is the same as most everyone else. There are not enough to get the curls you really want with this. I would have to order two.&lt;br /&gt;That defeats the small size - except while traveling...and while traveling you just wont get the same effect on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly - because I had to use SO much hair in each roller the curls just fall out after a few min. Kinda pointless</li>
            <li> My wife bought this.  After a month and a half, the heating elements quit working on one end, so those curlers don&#x27;t heat up.  Unfortunately Amazon will only refund or replace it for one month.  So I either have to get warranty service with Conair or just throw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> No different than the hot curlers of 40 years ago...disappointed.</li>
            <li> Care should be taken as it&#x27;s fragile. Half the base for the curlers didn&#x27;t heat. It&#x27;s small and includes adequate amount of curlers. If I look forward, I hope it lasts one year as it&#x27;s used on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Lightweight thus easy to carry. Good results while you do your make up or get dressed. I have fine hair and the amount of rollers is perfect. A quick makeover from the usual look. Hair does not look too curly and with volume</li>
            <li> Am trying to figure out how to use these. I just ordered clips to see if rollers stay in better. I&#x27;m thinking it could be my stick straight hair that won&#x27;t cooperate.  The pins that come with it go flying across the room when I try to put them in. Have even tried one consumers hint to use toilet paper to hold hair on rollers.  Order did arrive quickly and were packaged appropriately. I would order from seller again and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot, so this ended my hunt for a dual voltage set. I can see where these might be a challenge for those with considerably long hair...my hair is medium length and this set works perfectly...I even use then at home as they give excellent results without taking up a lot of counter space...so glad I tried them :)</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter to use when traveling, easier than a curling iron, she absolutely loves them and wants more.</li>
            <li> It takes more than fifteen minutes for mine to heat up completely and even then it doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough because the curls will fall after about an hour with hairspray. I leave them on for thirty to forty minutes. Also doesn&#x27;t curl all the way to the roots, mostly just the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li> I used these like 3 times.. they don&#x27;t get very hot, they didn&#x27;t curly my hair well (hair is a little past shoulders).. I stuck them under the sink and completely forgot that I was once excited about them.  I&#x27;d go a different route in the future.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, but just barely hot enough.  But they ARE hot enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this set to take on a trip.  I have pretty long hair and though it was ok, the rollers were a little too small to create a voluminous wave, they gave a tighter curl.  I would recommend this if you have short to medium length hair.  It is very compact, easy to travel with.  Rollers take about 10 minutes to get really hot.</li>
            <li> These were great at first. nice full bouncy curls.  But about a month in they stopped getting hot and would only get slightly warm.  I returned them with no problems.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to heat up - if it ever does, I can&#x27;t tell! Plus the rollers are way too small. I&#x27;m not sure if I just missed it, but when I ordered it said Medium and Large rollers. I do not consider 1&amp;#34; medium and 1 1/4&amp;#34; large. Sending back!</li>
            <li> Very nice set. Heats quickly.</li>
