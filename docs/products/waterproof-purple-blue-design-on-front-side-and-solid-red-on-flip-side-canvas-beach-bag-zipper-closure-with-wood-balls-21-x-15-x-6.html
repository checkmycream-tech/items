            <li>Thinking to buy some more for gifts.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>but this is a very nice large bag.  </li>
            <li>Looks great colors vibrant</li>
            <li>Folds easily into a suitcase.</li>
            <li>so you can easily hang the bag up.</li>
            <li>It does come with a strong manufacturing odor.  </li>
            <li>Well made, I like the full zip along the top and</li>
            <li>it did fade some, but overall I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Overall great bag that I would buy again.</li>
            <li>Cheerful colors too.</li>
            <li>They were very colorful.</li>
            <li>Very Colorful...</li>
            <li>It is smaller than the beach bags from Costco, so it is a good medium sized bag.</li>
            <li>The handles have cute wooden accent beads, which makes it look like more than a cloth shopping bag.  </li>
            <li>A great bag for summer fun or any other time.</li>
            <li>Overall a nice bag for the beach.</li>
            <li>I wanted it to look nice enough to take out to dinner after the beach, too.  </li>
            <li>It held all the necessities, looked nice, and kept everything clean and dry.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected - the reverse side is very bright red.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s going to keep my belongings dry and sand-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We took it on a catamaran and everything stayed nice and dry!</li>
            <li>exactly met my expectiations</li>
            <li>very durable!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready for the beach!  </li>
            <li>I needed a large sturdy, waterproof bag this spring.  </li>
            <li>Through the sand, in the wind and splash of pool water and sea spray it held up very well.</li>
            <li>but I would just say not to put too much in it.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to carry because the handles are padded and long enough to easily go over your shoulder.</li>
            <li>I purchased this bag because the dimensions would be large enough to fit all the items I needed to take back and forth with me, and it would be also useful later as a beach bag.  </li>
            <li>You should really make that clear that picture is not necessarily what you will be getting.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a new tote for the beach - waterproof or water resistant, colorful, big enough for camera/sunscreen/snacks/cell phone/book/rolled up hat, etc., but not huge enough to hold towels.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of colorful fabric on the outside (one side only, the other side is solid red) with vinyl backing inside.  </li>

            <li> The bag is a bit small, but I just used it for books, lotion, sunglasses,etc.  </li>
            <li> You can hold a towel and some other items in it, but probably not two towels unless they are really thin.</li>

            <li> Very cute bag, well made and functional. Holds 2 beach towels, sunblock, paddle tennis rackets, coverup. Also there is an outside zip up waterproof pocket for phone and keys. The outside back panel of the bag is red.</li>
            <li> Looks great colors vibrant</li>
            <li> No compartments on the inside. One small zipper compartment on the outside. Overall a nice bag for the beach.</li>
            <li> This item is very nice.  I liked them.  They did not leak and the color stayed nice. They were very colorful.</li>
            <li> Used this bag for a vacation to Mexico.  Great for the beach and to carry when shopping.  I even used it for a carry-on on the airplane.  It does come with a strong manufacturing odor.  I recommend getting it, wiping down with a household cleaner, turning it inside out and letting it air out before using it.  I got it a week before we left and the smell was not noticeable by the time we got to the beach. Love it!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for a week on the beach vacation.  It never rained so can&#x27;t tell if it is waterproof.  Love the zipper closer.  The bag is a bit small, but I just used it for books, lotion, sunglasses,etc.  it did fade some, but overall I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> My other review never was published, that&#x27;s not right.  The bag is ok, but I wanted stars on the handles like the picture indicated they would be and not suns, if I wanted suns I would have bought suns.  You should really make that clear that picture is not necessarily what you will be getting.</li>
            <li> Waiting for drier weather to head to a beach....but this is a very nice large bag.  Hopefully it will hold up to many uses!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect beach bag. Used it for a week at the beach. Perfect size. Love the colors</li>
            <li> I needed a large sturdy, waterproof bag this spring.  I purchased this bag because the dimensions would be large enough to fit all the items I needed to take back and forth with me, and it would be also useful later as a beach bag.  This bag definitely met all my expectations.  The construction seems sturdy, and hopefully it will stand up to many years of use.</li>
            <li> The bag is roomy, waterproof, light, very attractive.  exactly met my expectiations and I would recommend it to other beach lovers.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Held all of our things and its waterproof. Through the sand, in the wind and splash of pool water and sea spray it held up very well.</li>
            <li> It is great.  It arrived on time and did its job.  Took it with me to water world and everything stayed dry.</li>
            <li> I use it often.  It is smaller than the beach bags from Costco, so it is a good medium sized bag. You can hold a towel and some other items in it, but probably not two towels unless they are really thin.</li>
            <li> Great quality! very durable! Great purchase for a great price! Putting it to use in a week for our family vacation! Thanks!</li>
            <li> fast ship and was perfect for the beach great size and waterproof...</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new tote for the beach - waterproof or water resistant, colorful, big enough for camera/sunscreen/snacks/cell phone/book/rolled up hat, etc., but not huge enough to hold towels.  I wanted it to look nice enough to take out to dinner after the beach, too.  I don&#x27;t plan to take this bag into the water but it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s going to keep my belongings dry and sand-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bag arrived today and I&#x27;m thrilled with it.  It has one big inner compartment for all the necessities, and one small pocket on the side for hotel-room and car keys, and both compartments zip closed.  It&#x27;s made of colorful fabric on the outside (one side only, the other side is solid red) with vinyl backing inside.  The handles are the perfect length to wear on my shoulder or carry by hand without it dragging on the ground.  The handles have cute wooden accent beads, which makes it look like more than a cloth shopping bag.  The colors of this design will match everything from swimsuits to flip-flops to sunglasses, although it also comes in several other beach themed designs (starfish, palm trees, tropical fish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my bag in two days with Prime shipping and for under $20 I&#x27;m ready for the beach!  Come on, summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited May 2013:  We took a weekend trip to the beach recently, and this bag was truly perfect.  It held all the necessities, looked nice, and kept everything clean and dry.</li>
            <li> Have not used yet, but like the looks and fact that it is waterproof. Will write more once I use it on a vacation.</li>
            <li> Not as waterproof as I had hoped. Water resistant might be a better description. The stitching is starting to separate. You get what you pay for. I still like and use the bag. I am just careful of where I place it.</li>
            <li> Great bag. The outside pocket came unsewn but I would just say not to put too much in it. Overall great bag that I would buy again. We took it on a catamaran and everything stayed nice and dry!</li>
            <li> Good quality.like the bright color.got many compliments.shipping was fast.Thinking to buy some more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Very cute and very appealing for a sporty day at the lake/beach.  Love the design, very bright, and pretty.  Love it</li>
            <li> Beautiful bag....everything I need for the beach fits into it...Very Colorful...Thank You</li>
            <li> This was given at an auction and many people really liked it. The quality is very nice. Perfect size for the beach.</li>
            <li> perfect size, waterproof, extra pocket outside of the bag is a great addition, light weight, excellent for beach or pool.</li>
            <li> I bought this tote for an upcoming cruise and wanted something that could hold towels or other beach items. This is great because it is a good size and has a zipper. It is comfortable to carry because the handles are padded and long enough to easily go over your shoulder. The print is bright and vibrant on the bag and feels very cheery. A great bag for summer fun or any other time. Folds easily into a suitcase. It is so nice and my daughter borrowed it for a trip too and I hope I get it back.</li>
            <li> Well made, I like the full zip along the top and the handles are roomy so you can easily hang the bag up. Great beach bag. Cheerful colors too.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected - the reverse side is very bright red.</li>
