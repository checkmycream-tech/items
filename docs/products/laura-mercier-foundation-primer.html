            <li>you will be very happy....</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s wonderful though.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful product and my make up stays put all day.</li>
            <li>this products are very good.</li>
            <li>I use this product with the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and have great results.  </li>
            <li>Great price, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, works great with my foundation.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>It provides this smooth canvas and fills in your creases creating a flawless effect.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product in a monthly subscription box and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>keeps me looking good</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>

            <li>Feels nice and keeps your foundation on</li>
            <li>find the primer to be very light on my skin and is does absorb well to create an “invisible layer”.  </li>
            <li>Ideal for all skin types, oilier skins will notice their foundation staying color true throughout the day [the darkening occurs when oils secreted by the skin mix with the makeup and give it a darker look] and are happy this oil-free and pigment-free Primer won&#x27;t add an extra layer to makeup.</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love this primer</li>
            <li>Works well love Laura mercier</li>
            <li>Once when I had the honor of meeting the famous Makeup Artist Laura Mercier in person, I asked her what one beauty product she would want if stranded on a desert island.</li>
            <li>course, my Foundation Primer is more than just a primer.</li>
            <li>is Laura&#x27;s Foundation Primer more than just a primer?&lt;br /&gt;Laura</li>
            <li>Potent antioxidants</li>
            <li>If you find you require more, it may be an indication that your skin is dehydrated and you may need to up your moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I don&#x27;t see any real difference in my skin after I put on my foundation that makes me think that this is doing something truly great.</li>
            <li>Now I am sure to make time for it in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>There are much better primers available then this one!</li>
            <li>This primer has truly amazing..absolutely love this...</li>
            <li>I had used this as a sample and fell in love with it</li>
            <li>I love this product and it goes on with a cooling feeling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Laura Mercier line, currently using three of the four steps to the flawless face:  primer, foundation, and powder.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Sephora&#x27;s foundation primer, English Ideal&#x27;s and this one</li>
            <li>and you have a smooth and luminous, beautiful and natural, barefaced</li>
            <li>as an artist woudn&#x27;t think of painting on an un-primed canvas, Foundation Primer fills in the little lines and pores, evening the skin tone and texture for a more flawless finish to makeup.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quick.</li>
            <li>Laura Mercier&#x27;s product is good, and really helps keep the make up stay longer, but the skin does not feel as smooth as when I use Estee lauder&#x27;s Idealist or Clinique&#x27;s Pore Minimizer Refining Lotion, which I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was my first primer purchase, and, to be honest, I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy another one.  </li>
            <li>Foundation glides on the skin more easily and stays looking fresh longer by creating a silky barrier between skin and foundation.</li>
            <li>I tried this primer and thought it went on OK but wasn&#x27;t especially impressed until about an hour later when I looked in the mirror and realised that my pores were minimised and I had a matte but soft focus finish.</li>
            <li>Drier skins will enjoy the benefit Foundation Primer has in sealing in the moisturizer</li>
            <li>The same soft focus appearance makes bare skin look beautiful and naturally flawless.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly over my moisturizer with a light consistancy.</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t as important for filling in lines/roughness etc.</li>
            <li>After reading fabulous reviews about her cosmetics I decided to take the plung.</li>
            <li>just didn&#x27;t fit my schedule.  </li>
            <li>My makeup definitely stays put longer and looks great all day.  </li>
            <li>it is so light.</li>
            <li>it belongs and smooth out your skin--and found that this one is far superior.</li>
            <li>primer contains \\&quot;unique light-reflecting ingredients\\&quot; which create a \\&quot;soft-focus appearance.\\</li>
            <li>While the tinted moisturizer is incredibly good, I found that products from other lines do the foundation primer&#x27;s job better.</li>
            <li>The primer not only makes a better canvas of the skin for make-up by helping it blend more easily and evenly but make-up stays in place and true to color until you take it off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The best so far that I have found for my skin type (dry) is \\&quot;The Present\\&quot; by Philosophy.  </li>
            <li>It did smooth out my skin and the foundation glided right over</li>
            <li>Laura Mercier Foundation Primer has a fresh, clean</li>
            <li>The biggest problem I have with this primer that it seems to age quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes rancid rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>Without hesitation she replied in her beautiful, soft, and very French accent, \\&quot;Foundation Primer, of course!\\</li>
            <li>Makeup even stays put in hot, humid weather!</li>
            <li>&quot; This soft focus causes fine lines and imperfections to  smooth over as well as gives skin a soft, luminous, and healthy looking glow.</li>
            <li>It does make your make-up last all day and if you use her oil-free foundation the two of them together have a nice velvety finish.</li>
            <li>Foundation Primer also contains botanicals such as lavender, orange, jasmine, rose, geranium, grape, kiwi and aloe extracts to soothe and refresh the skin.</li>
            <li>Laura Mercier Foundation Primer feels so fresh on moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>I put this on under Lancome foundation is does seem to keep my face fresh looking longer.</li>
            <li>keeps my makeup fresh for hours, without shine..</li>
            <li>When I put this on I do agree that my skin does feel smoother and the primer in theory puts down a good groundwork for foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s simple and easy to use:&lt;br /&gt;Apply a liberal amount of this lightweight creme-gel on clean skin, after moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Laura Mercier&#x27;s #1 Top Makeup Tip:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Place Foundation Primer in the refrigerator, the coolness is extra refreshing and helps reduce puffiness.\\&quot; (This tip is especially pampering in the summertime.)</li>
            <li>this sit a couple minutes before applying your foundation for  healthy lasting coverage.</li>
            <li>But it makes my makeup last so much better throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Garden Botanika and English Ideas make much better primers.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Take a few minutes to gently massage into the skin; a light massage is stimulating and healthy for the skin.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it would do much of anything...</li>
            <li>Most women choose lipstick, concealer, or mascara; why would Ms. Mercier choose a makeup prep step above all other products -- something most women have never even heard of?</li>
            <li>I ran accross this to further improve my look and found the extra step to be very worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Laura Mercier Foundation Primer is a creamy white gel that easily rubs into the skin and disappears leaving no trace of color.  </li>
            <li>This includes one large, cycstic blemish on my cheek.</li>
            <li>A large pea-sized amount, think garbanzo bean or chick pea, is all you need.</li>
            <li>The others have a bit too much slip to them -- they don&#x27;t feel greasy just slippery.  </li>
            <li>It kept my skin looking photo ready with no touch ups required all day.</li>
            <li>Foundation Primer also helps prevent the skin from absorbing talc and pigment from foundation and powder -- a boon to blemish-prone skin.</li>
            <li>This product is an absolute must for all my brides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did wonder though if this was really needed.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>but she has used it before and really likes it.</li>
            <li>This primer goes along very well with the foundation and the powder</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Take a few minutes to gently massage into the skin; a light massage is stimulating and healthy for the skin.\\&quot;(This tip is especially pampering in the summertime.)</li>
            <li>I find I can apply my foundation with Foundation Primer underneath, teach my morning aerobics classes, and my makeup still looks fresh enough to work the rest of the day as a makeup artist under the intense scrutiny all my clients consciously or unconsciously give.</li>
            <li>It tends toward oily in the T-zone, but it&#x27;s normal on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>special, moderate price for such product.</li>
            <li>With fingertips, massage all over face, including eyelids, lips and throat (those with sensitive eyes may wish to avoid the eye area).  </li>
            <li>and if you aren&#x27;t careful can slide right off of your fingers.  </li>
            <li>Top with a little Loose Setting Powder</li>
            <li>&quot; This left me curious as to how she chose one product so quickly out of the myriad in her arsenal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge waste of money!</li>
            <li>The only thing I would caution is that those with oily skin may become a little too glowing by the end of the day and need a light dusting of powder.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it because, at the time, I really needed to streamline my morning and waiting for a primer to dry</li>
            <li>I wore it over moisturiser with no other</li>
            <li>Foundation Primer does not contain sunscreen, however all of Laura&#x27;s daytime moisturizers have broad spectrum (UVA and UVB) protection in the form of avobenzone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>leave it more radiant and it never gets dry or dull.</li>
            <li>I think I may be adding step 3, the concealer, back to my routine in the near future.  </li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t evaporate during the day keeping the face soft and radiant as well as preventing talc (a common ingredient in foundation and powder) from drawing much needed oil out of the skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Sephora&#x27;s foundation primer, English Ideal&#x27;s and this one and this is my favorite.  The others have a bit too much slip to them -- they don&#x27;t feel greasy just slippery.  This one feels like a super-light gel moisturizer.  It does make your make-up last all day and if you use her oil-free foundation the two of them together have a nice velvety finish.</li>
            <li> I use this product with the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and have great results.  I even wear it on its own when I can&#x27;t be bothered to apply makeup.  It evens out your skin tone and makes your skin glow.  My makeup lasts a lot longer and never looks oily.  I tend towards the oily side and have replaced my moisturizer with this product.  I think using both would be overkill with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried Benefit&#x27;s Dr. Feelgood--a product meant to keep your makeup were it belongs and smooth out your skin--and found that this one is far superior.</li>
            <li> Great price, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, works great with my foundation.</li>
            <li> After trying several products, I heard so much good reveiws on this primer, and was very disappointed at the size of the tube and it didn&#x27;t provide the fill in coverage that it states.  The best so far that I have found for my skin type (dry) is \\&quot;The Present\\&quot; by Philosophy.  It provides this smooth canvas and fills in your creases creating a flawless effect.</li>
            <li> I tried this primer and thought it went on OK but wasn&#x27;t especially impressed until about an hour later when I looked in the mirror and realised that my pores were minimised and I had a matte but soft focus finish. Stage two was to see what it&#x27;s staying power would be like. I wore it over moisturiser with no other make up on. It kept my skin looking photo ready with no touch ups required all day. I love this primer and I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,but I can&#x27;t find the production date and the expiration date anywhere！&lt;br /&gt;What the hell is going on？</li>
            <li> After just one day of use, my skin felt oily and itchy and by dinnertime, I was broken out. This includes one large, cycstic blemish on my cheek. And I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s! If you have dry skin, go for it. But otherwise, avoid at all costs!</li>
            <li> Works well love Laura mercier</li>
            <li> Once when I had the honor of meeting the famous Makeup Artist Laura Mercier in person, I asked her what one beauty product she would want if stranded on a desert island. Without hesitation she replied in her beautiful, soft, and very French accent, \\&quot;Foundation Primer, of course!\\&quot; This left me curious as to how she chose one product so quickly out of the myriad in her arsenal. Most women choose lipstick, concealer, or mascara; why would Ms. Mercier choose a makeup prep step above all other products -- something most women have never even heard of? \\&quot;Even if you didn&#x27;t have foundation to put on top?\\&quot; I cautiously countered, not wanting to insult her choice. \\&quot;Of course, my Foundation Primer is more than just a primer. I wear it even when not wearing makeup at all,\\&quot; she replied sweetly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is Foundation Primer?&lt;br /&gt;Just as an artist woudn&#x27;t think of painting on an un-primed canvas, Foundation Primer fills in the little lines and pores, evening the skin tone and texture for a more flawless finish to makeup. Foundation glides on the skin more easily and stays looking fresh longer by creating a silky barrier between skin and foundation. Ideal for all skin types, oilier skins will notice their foundation staying color true throughout the day [the darkening occurs when oils secreted by the skin mix with the makeup and give it a darker look] and are happy this oil-free and pigment-free Primer won&#x27;t add an extra layer to makeup. Drier skins will enjoy the benefit Foundation Primer has in sealing in the moisturizer so it won&#x27;t evaporate during the day keeping the face soft and radiant as well as preventing talc (a common ingredient in foundation and powder) from drawing much needed oil out of the skin. Foundation Primer also helps prevent the skin from absorbing talc and pigment from foundation and powder -- a boon to blemish-prone skin. Did I mention it extends makeup wear? I find I can apply my foundation with Foundation Primer underneath, teach my morning aerobics classes, and my makeup still looks fresh enough to work the rest of the day as a makeup artist under the intense scrutiny all my clients consciously or unconsciously give. Makeup even stays put in hot, humid weather! This product is an absolute must for all my brides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is Laura&#x27;s Foundation Primer more than just a primer?&lt;br /&gt;Laura&#x27;s primer contains \\&quot;unique light-reflecting ingredients\\&quot; which create a \\&quot;soft-focus appearance.\\&quot; This soft focus causes fine lines and imperfections to  smooth over as well as gives skin a soft, luminous, and healthy looking glow. Not just for under foundation, in fact Laura considers Foundation Primer a must for non-foundation wearers. The same soft focus appearance makes bare skin look beautiful and naturally flawless. Top with a little Loose Setting Powder and you have a smooth and luminous, beautiful and natural, barefaced look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Primer also has added skin care benefits to improve the skin&#x27;s appearance. Potent antioxidants Vitamins A, C, and E help protect skin from the harmful and dramatically aging effects of the environment. Foundation Primer also contains botanicals such as lavender, orange, jasmine, rose, geranium, grape, kiwi and aloe extracts to soothe and refresh the skin. Foundation Primer does not contain sunscreen, however all of Laura&#x27;s daytime moisturizers have broad spectrum (UVA and UVB) protection in the form of avobenzone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple and easy to use:&lt;br /&gt;Apply a liberal amount of this lightweight creme-gel on clean skin, after moisturizer. With fingertips, massage all over face, including eyelids, lips and throat (those with sensitive eyes may wish to avoid the eye area).  A large pea-sized amount, think garbanzo bean or chick pea, is all you need. If you find you require more, it may be an indication that your skin is dehydrated and you may need to up your moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura Mercier&#x27;s #1 Top Makeup Tip:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Place Foundation Primer in the refrigerator, the coolness is extra refreshing and helps reduce puffiness.\\&quot; (This tip is especially pampering in the summertime.) \\&quot;Take a few minutes to gently massage into the skin; a light massage is stimulating and healthy for the skin.\\&quot;(This tip is especially pampering in the summertime.) \\&quot;Take a few minutes to gently massage into the skin; a light massage is stimulating and healthy for the skin.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I thought I had tried everything in make-up but after reading about foundation primer thought I might be missing something. I did wonder though if this was really needed. After putting it on in the morning every day for a week now I don&#x27;t want to be without it. The primer not only makes a better canvas of the skin for make-up by helping it blend more easily and evenly but make-up stays in place and true to color until you take it off at the end of the day. There&#x27;s also a slightly reflective glow that makes skin look younger and healthier. What more can you ask for? It goes on smoothly over my moisturizer with a light consistancy. I think it even locks in the benefits of my moisturizer. My skin tends towards dryness and this together with my moisturizer leave it more radiant and it never gets dry or dull. I also like the idea of a barrier between my skin and my make-up -- less foundation or powder clogging the skin. The only thing I would caution is that those with oily skin may become a little too glowing by the end of the day and need a light dusting of powder. I even would if I preferred a matte appearance. When the weather gets humid I probably will. Just when I thought I had everything and looked the best I could with the products I use I ran accross this to further improve my look and found the extra step to be very worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I got the primer because all the reviews say its the best. I like it but I don&#x27;t this it is 5 stars. i also the smashbox primer as a gift and I love it!</li>
            <li> Laura Mercier Foundation Primer feels so fresh on moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;Let this sit a couple minutes before applying your foundation for  healthy lasting coverage.</li>
            <li> I put this on under Lancome foundation is does seem to keep my face fresh looking longer.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moETRY2S6B29H6]]</li>
            <li> I purchased both the tinted moisturizer and the foundation primer by Laura Mercier. While the tinted moisturizer is incredibly good, I found that products from other lines do the foundation primer&#x27;s job better. Laura Mercier&#x27;s product is good, and really helps keep the make up stay longer, but the skin does not feel as smooth as when I use Estee lauder&#x27;s Idealist or Clinique&#x27;s Pore Minimizer Refining Lotion, which I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  It did smooth out my skin and the foundation glided right over, the only thing I did not like is it made my skin break out. I have combination skin so maybe that is the problem. I noticed they have a non-oil primer too and I might try that.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I have with this primer that it seems to age quickly. I have bought two tubes, had multiple samples, and they all turn out the same within a month or so. It goes rancid rather quickly.  You can tell by the smell.  Other than that, its okay...if I believe that it works. lol.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and keeps your foundation on</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of the make up salesperson when I asked what the two must have products from Laura Mercier were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was my first primer purchase, and, to be honest, I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy another one.  When I put this on I do agree that my skin does feel smoother and the primer in theory puts down a good groundwork for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t see any real difference in my skin after I put on my foundation that makes me think that this is doing something truly great. Maybe because I have a bit of a babyface this isn&#x27;t as important for filling in lines/roughness etc. as for some others out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one purchase I&#x27;ll probably skip next time around.</li>
            <li> After reading fabulous reviews about her cosmetics I decided to take the plung. I purchased the primer, moisturizing foundation, and translucent powder. Personally they are not worth the $$$ and I returned them. I actually looked worse and washed out. It may work for some individuals but not me. I am going back to my Mary Kay!</li>
            <li> I recently rediscovered Laura Mercier Foundation Primer and it&#x27;s now a part of my daily makeup routine.  I stopped using it because, at the time, I really needed to streamline my morning and waiting for a primer to dry just didn&#x27;t fit my schedule.  After a recent makeover at the Laura Mercier counter, the makeup artist showed me how my current foundation looked without primer and then made me up with the primer.  It was a noticeable difference and I was sold (again) on the Laura Mercier Foundation Primer.  Now I am sure to make time for it in the morning.  Laura Mercier&#x27;s Description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin.  It tends toward oily in the T-zone, but it&#x27;s normal on my cheeks.  Laura Mercier Foundation Primer is a creamy white gel that easily rubs into the skin and disappears leaving no trace of color.  The gel appears a little thick when squeezed out of the tube, but it&#x27;s quite slippery and if you aren&#x27;t careful can slide right off of your fingers.  Laura Mercier Foundation Primer has a fresh, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse your face and apply moisturizer before using the primer.  Massage the primer into your moisturized skin just before applying your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the primer to be very light on my skin and is does absorb well to create an “invisible layer”.  My makeup definitely stays put longer and looks great all day.  It does not clog my pores or cause my skin to break out, which is something I did worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Laura Mercier line, currently using three of the four steps to the flawless face:  primer, foundation, and powder.  I think I may be adding step 3, the concealer, back to my routine in the near future.  If your makeup doesn&#x27;t last all day, I would definitely recommend that you give Laura Mercier Foundation Primer a try.  It&#x27;s worked for me.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed!  This is not the same Laura Mercier primer I previously purchased at Nordstroms. This product is a knock off.  The smell and consistency of the primer is different.  The size of the tube varies. I will be very careful ordering from amazon again. Will not order this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Arrived very quick. Easy to apply, not greasy, feels great on skin, makeup stays on longer. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in a monthly subscription box and absolutely loved it.  At first I didn&#x27;t think it would do much of anything...it is so light. But it makes my makeup last so much better throughout the day. It is non greasy and does not provide coverage. It does help to minimize pores. I would recommend it for any skin type.</li>
            <li> Frankly this primer did nothing at all to prevent shine or to make my makeup stay longer. It makes no difference at all whether I put it on or not. I would never buy this product again! It&#x27;s a huge waste of money! There are much better primers available then this one!</li>
            <li> was given as a gift but she has used it before and really likes it.</li>
            <li> This primer goes along very well with the foundation and the powder this products are very good. And are perfect for oily/acne skin because does not make your face oily at all.</li>
            <li> This primer has truly amazing..absolutely love this...keeps my makeup fresh for hours, without shine..I have oily skin and you would never know it when I wear this.....a definete must buy...you will be very happy....</li>
            <li> Product is easy to use, delivered as promised, packaging great. I had used this as a sample and fell in love with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this primer after switching to it from Laura Geller.  I find the Mercier to be non-oily and it provides a good base for other face mkeup.  I wish it had a sunscreen in it though.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money - used twice, then threw it away. Garden Botanika and English Ideas make much better primers.</li>
            <li> watery non-creamy gel like texture, it&#x27;s wonderful though. low price but nothing special, moderate price for such product. Paula&#x27;s Choice rates it POOR and not surprise me at all</li>
            <li> I love this product and it goes on with a cooling feeling.  Love all of Laura Mercier products even though they are expensive.</li>
            <li> keeps me looking good</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product and my make up stays put all day.</li>
