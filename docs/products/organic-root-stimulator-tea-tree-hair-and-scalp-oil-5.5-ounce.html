            <li>and I love the way the hair smells.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work too well for root stimulation, but it is fantastic for sunburn.  </li>
            <li>So far this product has been good for my hair.</li>
            <li>great for the price, it does help with dry scalp</li>
            <li>It has a very mild clean fresh scent (evergreen?)</li>
            <li>This hair oil has a light clean fragrance, it&#x27;s very soothing and on the scalp and upon initial application I could feel a nice light tingling/cooling sensation.  </li>
            <li>This is very good product for my hair...thick and hard to manage.</li>
            <li>After a fresh haircut and relaxer, I oiled my scalp and combed it through my hair...</li>
            <li>The hair supply stores I normally go to rarely have it</li>
            <li>This is some great stuff, it relieves the itch I was experiencing from dry scalp and plus it is light and not too heavy.  </li>

            <li>Just use a very small amount into palm of your hands and disperse through scalp and hair, very little goes a long way,  Great for some hair control and sheen.</li>
            <li>Certain areas of my scalp itched a little</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is some great stuff, it relieves the itch I was experiencing from dry scalp and plus it is light and not too heavy.  This is a great product.  Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> So far this product has been good for my hair. My hair is soft and feels oiled, I shared a bottle with my daughter.  We wear a natural hairstyle and we are African-American. I bought another bottle to see real results.</li>
            <li> I used the tea tree oil in my hair for a short time. I stopped because it left my hair sticky and greasy feeling. Had to wash my hair to take it out. I maybe used to much but this product is not for me. I went back to the Organic Root Stimulator Olive oil.</li>
            <li> Like this product. I use it a couple times a week instead of hair gel.</li>
            <li> maybe i applied to much, but almost ruined my hair. Left my hair sticky and looking dirty. I applied on friday night and 5 washes A DAY till next friday, and the product still dont come out. It was horrible.</li>
            <li> I have about this product before I know its a good product will purchase again</li>
            <li> This is very good product for my hair...thick and hard to manage. I can feel the scalp as it tingles from application. My hair is left with a smooth, no fly away or oily condition. It has grown and I&#x27;m always getting compliments about it. I would recommend it to anyone with thick somewhat curly natural hair.</li>
            <li> great for the price, it does help with dry scalp</li>
            <li> I bought this because I do not like how dandruff shampoos dry my hair out.  I rub a very small amount of this on my scalp after shampoo &amp; conditioning while my hair is still wet.  It has a very mild clean fresh scent (evergreen?) and I do not even notice it after my hair dries.  I found that if I put it on while my hair is dry or if I use too much my hair looks dirty and very flat so don&#x27;t use too much!  My scalp is still a bit dry but not as bad as it used to be.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to find the product in my local stores.  It&#x27;s not too oily on my scalp. I will purchase it again and again...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work too well for root stimulation, but it is fantastic for sunburn.  I put it on some sunburn and the pain went away immediately.  That area didn&#x27;t hurt for the rest of the day.  It should be marketed for that instead of what it is marketed for.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. My race is mixed, mostly African American, and my hair is super thick and full. I&#x27;ve been meaning to try this for a while because I hear good things. After a fresh haircut and relaxer, I oiled my scalp and combed it through my hair... Oh...my...GOD. MY HAIR HAS NEVER FELT SO SOFT!!! It was smooth, not too greasy, stayed soft and manageable for a few days, smells nice too. The hair supply stores I normally go to rarely have it so I got it (cheaper) here on Amazon, even with shipping. Happy hair &#x3D; happy me! :D</li>
            <li> It did not help my scalp psoriasis</li>
            <li> I tried it in my own hair and it feels minty, it&#x27;s for my daughter and if it does anything like the shampoo then it should work really good.</li>
            <li> I TRIED THIS ON MY HAIR BECAUSE IT&#x27;S GETTING VERY THIN.&lt;br /&gt;THIS WAS SO HARD TO GET OUT OF MY HAIR, AND I WON&#x27;T USE IT AGAIN</li>
            <li> I can get this same brand and size product from my local Dollar Tree, not worth it. Plus it is ridiculously greesy</li>
            <li> Been searching for this product, the one I have almost used up.  Just use a very small amount into palm of your hands and disperse through scalp and hair, very little goes a long way,  Great for some hair control and sheen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently wearing a protective weave style because my hair has been thinning.  Weaves make my scalp itch terribly and I hated the smell of the different medicated  hair oils that my beautician used to stop the itch.  I purchased this product because I believe one of the ingredients is menthol.  This hair oil has a light clean fragrance, it&#x27;s very soothing and on the scalp and upon initial application I could feel a nice light tingling/cooling sensation.  I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it did not completely eliminate all of the itch.  Certain areas of my scalp itched a little (it&#x27;s possible that I may have needed a heavier coating), but I don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;beat the weave&amp;#34; for relief and I love the way the hair smells.  I will not go back to those medicated hair oils that almost knock me out from the smells.</li>
