            <li>I wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t buy this hair better in the store for buying your hair</li>
            <li>this hair is okay for 2 weeks, nothing longer.</li>

            <li>okay</li>
            <li>it also looks great straight.</li>
            <li>soooo pleased</li>
            <li>The weft from the weave looked kind of cheap.</li>

            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>Love the flow of the waves.</li>

            <li>They sent a letter with SO many typos</li>
            <li>But i still love my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the hair</li>
            <li>I could&#x27;ve have gotten sumn way better</li>
            <li>So the hair is just okay.</li>
            <li>I try to wash it to see if that would make the hair better</li>
            <li>but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>and i am so glad that i didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The hair is so light on my head!</li>
            <li>This hair was on time I have combed it no shedding it curls like a dream it straights like a dream love love love</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good hair .</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with all my orders they were delivered on time and the were exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Smelled kind of like a Barbie dolls hair fresh out the pack.</li>
            <li>it  feels very nice and soft</li>
            <li>Anyway the hair from ElizaWigs lasted me for my full 8 month deployment and then some!</li>
            <li>other than that great purchase!</li>
            <li>I have ordered some virgin hair before from other places and the waves did not survive the wash, but this hair did, I am really impressed</li>
            <li>the hair tangled to easily.</li>
            <li>It gets matted very quickly.</li>
            <li>with good care it is exactly what your looking for TRUE VIRGIN BRAZILIAN REMY And  </li>
            <li>When the hair arrived it had an really strong petroleum order to it.  </li>
            <li>I highlighted the hair and it came out pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I cowashed and conditioned it &amp; it came out fine.</li>
            <li>and it was worth more than I paid for.</li>
            <li>Honestly i received my 18in yesterday in the mail and it seemed very synthetic.</li>
            <li>light brown)&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair was very wavy and the texture was nice</li>
            <li>Ive straighten my hair and once i washed it the hair started to feel like cheap hair....</li>
            <li>this is good soft hair..</li>
            <li>but it clearly wasn&#x27;t the hair was a good texture</li>
            <li>My batch had a tint of red that was beautiful, though I only ordered 1b, it was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>IT IS NOT THE REAL DEAL!!!</li>
            <li>&quot; Very Pissed!!!</li>
            <li>The hair is perfect for clip ins, and has very little shedding.</li>
            <li>I love my hair soooooooooooooo much!</li>
            <li>Good investment I will gladly buy more in the near future !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t seem to be 18&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>TO BE FULL</li>
            <li>It was true to length.</li>
            <li>i purchased three bundles for my full head &amp; it covered it all</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t as full as i wanted it,</li>
            <li>I really loved the hair and it was delivered way too earlier than expected which made me extremely happy.</li>
            <li>I love it really I do</li>
            <li>it was not a bad smell at all.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super cute anf soft!!!</li>
            <li>I love this hair, the older</li>
            <li>It looks good for the first hour after installation, then from there, it tangles and sheds constantly.</li>
            <li>First of all, the hair that you receive isn&#x27;t the hair in the picture!</li>
            <li>not the best and not the worse</li>
            <li>liked the hair, but one is not enough.</li>
            <li>ESTIMATED DELIVERY WAS RIGHT ON POINT.</li>
            <li>The hair was good, didn&#x27;t last as it normally would</li>
            <li>This came in a tiny pack with one piece and shed very easily.</li>
            <li>Real Brazilian can dye easily, will not tangle, can be bone straight and and will not frizz.</li>
            <li>I have worn several different brands of Remy Brazillian and this is by far one of the best.</li>
            <li>It feels great in the pack but please, PLEASE, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>I think its best that this hair gets taken out everyday and brushed thoroughly.</li>
            <li>The bundle came with alot of hair and it soooo soft and haven&#x27;t tangled much and not alot of shedding I love it</li>
            <li>It was so hard out of the package but when you press it its beautiful now that i have had it in for a few weeks its still looking good but getting nappy .</li>
            <li>do better next time.</li>
            <li>You are  better off buying saga Brazilian remy Same price on here.</li>
            <li>Hair exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>First, the hair is darker than 1b should be.</li>
            <li>You can get brazilian body waves on aliexpress for the same price and the hair is 10x better quality</li>
            <li>It is very versatile!</li>
            <li>the hair so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>This batch of hair was better than same type of hair bought at a wig store at $160.00.</li>
            <li>you also should co wash the hair before sewing it in overall its ok</li>
            <li>so i cannot use the first</li>
            <li>First off this is not remy hair.</li>
            <li>I must say that I paid for my hair first and then read all the reviews which was all backwards</li>
            <li>It also sheds so much!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get straight like it did when I first received it.</li>
            <li>It is soft and true to length, and arrived before on time.</li>
            <li>The next day after getting the install I had HUGE knots in my hair.</li>
            <li>Just regular cheap beauty supply hair.</li>
            <li>Once I washed the hair it became very tangled and sheds a lot.</li>
            <li>No Smell and Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>&amp; one bundle did do my whole head .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this hair is real \\&quot;brazilian \\&quot;</li>
            <li>This weave is cheap and will not last in your hair.</li>
            <li>I got it fast like I think in 2 days</li>
            <li>so much&lt;br /&gt;Holding the curl very well  </li>
            <li>Im very dissatisfied and wont order this again....</li>
            <li>this product shipped fast so thumbs up for that</li>
            <li>i dont know if this hair is real or not</li>
            <li>but i really dont think so</li>
            <li>Very affordable .</li>
            <li>It really was 10&amp;#34;s.</li>
            <li>Thinking of placing another order very soon</li>
            <li>At first it was soft and silky when I first got it.</li>
            <li>THIS HAIR WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED !</li>
            <li>so i recommend getting double the bundles if you really want a full look.</li>
            <li>i think you have to be willing to work with the hair in order for it to be right for you, but if you don&#x27;t want to i recommend different hair.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be longer and more fuller; this really looks like one track cut in half</li>
            <li>It was really pretty and soft for four days</li>
            <li>so I made it look decent</li>
            <li>the hair is decent.</li>
            <li>then bantu knotted it &amp; the hair come out soft and fluffy with nice waves like its natrual stage</li>
            <li>naturally silky!!</li>
            <li>First of all let me start by saying that i&#x27;m a professional hair stylist, I have received my order today this hair supposed to be a brazilian remy natural wave hair ,</li>
            <li>I normally keep it in for about a month</li>
            <li>The hair in the pic actually is like a loose wave, the hair that I got has a more tighter wave; I did a co-wash</li>
            <li>I live in jersey .</li>
            <li>and I cannot wait to create my new u-part wig.</li>
            <li>This particular business isn&#x27;t professional at all.</li>
            <li>Very soft ..</li>
            <li>Virgin hair should have no dye added to the hair it should be in its natural state!</li>
            <li>Ummmm, not exactly what I expected but nice soft hair</li>
            <li>When I first recieved the hair it was soft and managable, but TWO days later it is contantly tangling!</li>
            <li>The hair was very frizzy, dry, tangley, shed alot and very unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>but I will never waste my money on this seller Again</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s naturally wavy</li>
            <li>I kinda do like it so far because I have to make it work.</li>
            <li>and it goes back to its normal wavyness!</li>
            <li>This is about the quality of the $20 packs of hair I used to get locally when I was a teen and first started weaving.  </li>
            <li>I have had some shedding but that could be due to hair style choice other than that I love the hair so five stars from me......</li>
            <li>My two problems were my bundle had numerous colorful strands such as gray and yellow.</li>
            <li>it is very soft but is a tiny bundle.</li>
            <li>In general yes,they way it was expected.only</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m only vouching for the brazilian natural wave from ElizaWigs, i tried their Peruvian curly</li>
            <li>-- I wore hair from there for months and it barely shedded and never tangled.</li>
            <li>Sheds too much matted too easily really not the vest at all when I washed the hair it looked like dye was coming off it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great buy and no regrets</li>
            <li>THIS HAIR IS SOFT AND %100 HUMAN HAIR.</li>
            <li>I wash it and the natural wave came back.</li>
            <li>The 100% remi hair I ordered is perfect its thick soft and exactly 100 grams I recommend women to start ordering their hair on amazon u will not be disappointed!</li>

            <li> Anyway the hair from ElizaWigs lasted me for my full 8 month deployment and then some!</li>
            <li> other than that great purchase!</li>
            <li> I have ordered some virgin hair before from other places and the waves did not survive the wash, but this hair did, I am really impressed</li>
            <li> the hair tangled to easily.</li>
            <li> It gets matted very quickly.</li>
            <li> with good care it is exactly what your looking for TRUE VIRGIN BRAZILIAN REMY And  </li>
            <li> When the hair arrived it had an really strong petroleum order to it.  </li>
            <li> I highlighted the hair and it came out pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I cowashed and conditioned it &amp; it came out fine.</li>
            <li> and it was worth more than I paid for.</li>
            <li> Honestly i received my 18in yesterday in the mail and it seemed very synthetic.</li>
            <li> light brown)&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair was very wavy and the texture was nice</li>
            <li> Ive straighten my hair and once i washed it the hair started to feel like cheap hair....</li>
            <li> this is good soft hair..</li>
            <li> but it clearly wasn&#x27;t the hair was a good texture</li>
            <li> My batch had a tint of red that was beautiful, though I only ordered 1b, it was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT THE REAL DEAL!!!</li>
            <li> &quot; Very Pissed!!!</li>
            <li> The hair is perfect for clip ins, and has very little shedding.</li>
            <li> I love my hair soooooooooooooo much!</li>
            <li> Good investment I will gladly buy more in the near future !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t seem to be 18&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> TO BE FULL</li>
            <li> It was true to length.</li>
            <li> i purchased three bundles for my full head &amp; it covered it all</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t as full as i wanted it,</li>
            <li> I really loved the hair and it was delivered way too earlier than expected which made me extremely happy.</li>
            <li> I love it really I do</li>
            <li> it was not a bad smell at all.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super cute anf soft!!!</li>
            <li> I love this hair, the older</li>
            <li> It looks good for the first hour after installation, then from there, it tangles and sheds constantly.</li>
            <li> First of all, the hair that you receive isn&#x27;t the hair in the picture!</li>
            <li> not the best and not the worse</li>
            <li> liked the hair, but one is not enough.</li>
            <li> ESTIMATED DELIVERY WAS RIGHT ON POINT.</li>
            <li> The hair was good, didn&#x27;t last as it normally would</li>
            <li> This came in a tiny pack with one piece and shed very easily.</li>
            <li> Real Brazilian can dye easily, will not tangle, can be bone straight and and will not frizz.</li>
            <li> I have worn several different brands of Remy Brazillian and this is by far one of the best.</li>
            <li> It feels great in the pack but please, PLEASE, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> I think its best that this hair gets taken out everyday and brushed thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The bundle came with alot of hair and it soooo soft and haven&#x27;t tangled much and not alot of shedding I love it</li>
            <li> It was so hard out of the package but when you press it its beautiful now that i have had it in for a few weeks its still looking good but getting nappy .</li>
            <li> do better next time.</li>
            <li> You are  better off buying saga Brazilian remy Same price on here.</li>
            <li> Hair exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> First, the hair is darker than 1b should be.</li>
            <li> You can get brazilian body waves on aliexpress for the same price and the hair is 10x better quality</li>
            <li> It is very versatile!</li>
            <li> the hair so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> This batch of hair was better than same type of hair bought at a wig store at $160.00.</li>
            <li> you also should co wash the hair before sewing it in overall its ok</li>
            <li> so i cannot use the first</li>
            <li> First off this is not remy hair.</li>
            <li> I must say that I paid for my hair first and then read all the reviews which was all backwards</li>
            <li> It also sheds so much!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get straight like it did when I first received it.</li>
            <li> It is soft and true to length, and arrived before on time.</li>
            <li> The next day after getting the install I had HUGE knots in my hair.</li>
            <li> Just regular cheap beauty supply hair.</li>
            <li> Once I washed the hair it became very tangled and sheds a lot.</li>
            <li> No Smell and Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li> &amp; one bundle did do my whole head .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this hair is real \\&quot;brazilian \\&quot;</li>
            <li> This weave is cheap and will not last in your hair.</li>
            <li> I got it fast like I think in 2 days</li>
            <li> so much&lt;br /&gt;Holding the curl very well  </li>
            <li> Im very dissatisfied and wont order this again....</li>
            <li> this product shipped fast so thumbs up for that</li>
            <li> i dont know if this hair is real or not</li>
            <li> but i really dont think so</li>
            <li> Very affordable .</li>
            <li> It really was 10&amp;#34;s.</li>
            <li> Thinking of placing another order very soon</li>
            <li> At first it was soft and silky when I first got it.</li>
            <li> THIS HAIR WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED !</li>
            <li> so i recommend getting double the bundles if you really want a full look.</li>
            <li> i think you have to be willing to work with the hair in order for it to be right for you, but if you don&#x27;t want to i recommend different hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be longer and more fuller; this really looks like one track cut in half</li>
            <li> It was really pretty and soft for four days</li>
            <li> so I made it look decent</li>
            <li> the hair is decent.</li>
            <li> then bantu knotted it &amp; the hair come out soft and fluffy with nice waves like its natrual stage</li>
            <li> naturally silky!!</li>
            <li> First of all let me start by saying that i&#x27;m a professional hair stylist, I have received my order today this hair supposed to be a brazilian remy natural wave hair ,</li>
            <li> I normally keep it in for about a month</li>
            <li> The hair in the pic actually is like a loose wave, the hair that I got has a more tighter wave; I did a co-wash</li>
            <li> I live in jersey .</li>
            <li> and I cannot wait to create my new u-part wig.</li>
            <li> This particular business isn&#x27;t professional at all.</li>
            <li> Very soft ..</li>
            <li> Virgin hair should have no dye added to the hair it should be in its natural state!</li>
            <li> Ummmm, not exactly what I expected but nice soft hair</li>
            <li> When I first recieved the hair it was soft and managable, but TWO days later it is contantly tangling!</li>
            <li> The hair was very frizzy, dry, tangley, shed alot and very unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> but I will never waste my money on this seller Again</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s naturally wavy</li>
            <li> I kinda do like it so far because I have to make it work.</li>
            <li> and it goes back to its normal wavyness!</li>
            <li> This is about the quality of the $20 packs of hair I used to get locally when I was a teen and first started weaving.  </li>
            <li> I have had some shedding but that could be due to hair style choice other than that I love the hair so five stars from me......</li>
            <li> My two problems were my bundle had numerous colorful strands such as gray and yellow.</li>
            <li> it is very soft but is a tiny bundle.</li>
            <li> In general yes,they way it was expected.only</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m only vouching for the brazilian natural wave from ElizaWigs, i tried their Peruvian curly</li>
            <li> -- I wore hair from there for months and it barely shedded and never tangled.</li>
            <li> Sheds too much matted too easily really not the vest at all when I washed the hair it looked like dye was coming off it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great buy and no regrets</li>
            <li> THIS HAIR IS SOFT AND %100 HUMAN HAIR.</li>
            <li> I wash it and the natural wave came back.</li>
            <li> The 100% remi hair I ordered is perfect its thick soft and exactly 100 grams I recommend women to start ordering their hair on amazon u will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have been swimming and brushed it, styled it, straightened it,with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> each bundles is about 80 dollars ( a little high</li>
            <li> Its amazin,IT WASHES UP VERY WELL ,VERY LITTLE TANGELS,</li>
            <li> I washed it the next day while taking a bath my water turned black from all the dye they used to make it look a natural color.</li>
            <li> It is soft but not worth over 15$. Email my Gmail account</li>
            <li> The hair is not soft at all it definitely feels synthetic ..</li>
            <li> its lasting long</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed yet with pristine hair, they sell really good hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only pretty when it is dripping wet and oily other than that it is a tangled, itchy mess.</li>
            <li> This was very few but other than that it seems to not get tangled and pretty low maintenance.</li>
            <li> now i&#x27;m dying for long hair again.</li>
            <li> i compared it to the brazilian hair i had left over from a previous seller and it was two totally different types of texture.</li>
            <li> after the wash condition and dry</li>
            <li> i expected a little more lenght and body the hair just seems a little thin like it would require three packs to do your hair</li>
            <li> This hair is NOT high quality.</li>
            <li> Not virgin or unprocessed......</li>
            <li> unprocessed?</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a waste of almost $400 total including the price of the install.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is wet it</li>
            <li> This hair was everything I expected in</li>
            <li> This hair is not real Brazilian hair at all.</li>
            <li> This is not what i expected.</li>
            <li> I comb it with a wide tooth comb and my curls are here still .</li>
            <li> It has lasted me four months with minimal upkeep</li>
            <li> The hair is so rough.</li>
            <li> and it did nt do a jystice garbage not real brazillian</li>
            <li> Has lots of gray and other stringy material.</li>
            <li> Starts to look very dull and old.</li>
            <li> It was not worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON ILL PASS THE WORD...</li>
            <li> Not worth a dollar.</li>
            <li> I took my hair down after 2 weeks because of all the issues.</li>
            <li> Extreme shedding!</li>
            <li> It was dry and stiff unless you washed it everyday which should not be the case.</li>
            <li> (I couldn&#x27;t find the length I wanted from the previous seller</li>
            <li> so back to this ridiculous hair, Ladies DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR</li>
            <li> This hair also contains dye because when you wash it, the water turns black.</li>
            <li> The hair was almost 3 ,l expect less hair on the floor..and deeper...</li>
            <li> The hair had an odd smell, I ordered #2 and got 1b</li>
            <li> This is my very first bad experience with Amazon.</li>
            <li> but it does shed a little, but hair growing form your scalp does that as well.</li>
            <li> i just wish it was a little longer</li>
            <li> The hair does tangle a little.</li>
            <li> It was only soft and tamable for a week after that it went bad.</li>
            <li> It is cheap, nasty, gross hair.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this stuff, I will probably have to take it out</li>
            <li> Waste of money smh</li>
            <li> Which is not unheard of but there were quite a few.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s when I discovered that the hair had been heavily died.  </li>
            <li> Hair had a few light/gray?</li>
            <li> PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of time and money..</li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted my money</li>
            <li> I just wasted a lot of Money.</li>
            <li> anything shit look like giraffes tail don&#x27;t waste ur money ladies</li>
            <li> I never will give a penny for this hair no more</li>
            <li> Not sure if it tangles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I want too..</li>
            <li> the truth I have no more to say</li>
            <li> The length is very uneven.</li>
            <li> I have never seen such very poor product experience.</li>
            <li> I naively thought, well I know how to take care of my hair, so I wont fall into the trap.</li>
            <li> so i was forced to ordered from this one.</li>
            <li> I hate this hair when I washed it the color came out and it sheds sooooo much also it tangles and does not hold curls</li>
            <li> , the hair is thick</li>
            <li> it sheds a ill but other than that</li>
            <li> but the bundle is thin and small.</li>
            <li> i am a little skeptical</li>
            <li> Definitely not a good buy.  </li>
            <li> It was not good.</li>
            <li> I usually order from Ebony J Hair and thats what ill continue to do.</li>
            <li> was disappointed to find out it was only one bundle not the five they have shown on the picture .wondering</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I was disappointed about an order for hair.</li>
            <li> It is so thin on the edges that you can see the scalp through it.</li>
            <li> The hair is thin the bundle is thin.....</li>
            <li> Yes it came extremely fast however the quality of the hair was horrible.</li>
            <li> I am not happy</li>
            <li> a Awful Very Nappy</li>
            <li> To make matters worse after 3 weeks I had to have the weave removed because it kept tangling</li>
            <li> In the end, I am not happy.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with product.</li>
            <li> Once again amazon are allowing vendors to false advertise.</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t false advertise like that though...</li>
            <li> You guys are selling False hair.</li>
            <li> Not good quality at all!</li>
            <li> It got so bad, that I was stuck wearing a bun until I found time to take it down!</li>
            <li> That little ass amount of hair!!!!</li>
            <li> I hope there will be no more bad experiences.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package the hair was missing!!!!</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like this in my life, so never again!</li>
            <li> Not good bad hair</li>
            <li> Second, the quality of the hair is terrible because it tangles like crazy.  </li>
            <li> i used this hair after few days it tangled very badly, i would not recommend this product, it was aweful</li>
            <li> Tangles like crazy, you end up looking like a matted dog.</li>
            <li> And it sheds like crazy.  </li>
            <li> but my hair looked crazy after 2 weeks of the weave being in my hair.</li>
            <li> It tangles like crazy.</li>

            <li> OMG, I cannot believe that this is so inexpensive for the quality. I have had the hair sewn in for about 2 weeks. I have been swimming and brushed it, styled it, straightened it,with a flat iron. Still looking great!! About to order it again before they raise the price!</li>
            <li> Once again amazon are allowing vendors to false advertise. This hair is nothing but beauty supply hair. Not virgin or unprocessed...... Just regular cheap beauty supply hair. Tangles like crazy, you end up looking like a matted dog. I would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon do better next time.</li>
            <li> the hair tangled to easily. its wasn&#x27;t what it said it was. I  was very disappointed  with this hair. the price is good,but  not for what u  get.</li>
            <li> The hair was good, didn&#x27;t last as it normally would but I guess you get what you pay for. The bundle size were great and accurate. I was satisfied with this purchase and I would buy again in emergency cases.</li>
            <li> You are  better off buying saga Brazilian remy Same price on here. This hair is NOT high quality. It is 14 inch on top of 10 inch. It is so thin on the edges that you can see the scalp through it. The length is very uneven. It is soft but not worth over 15$. Email my Gmail account hopesafem@gmail.com  for pics of the hair on mannequin. And after installing. I do hair so I made it look decent but I will never waste my money on this seller Again #thatisall</li>
            <li> Once I washed the hair it became very tangled and sheds a lot. It doesn&#x27;t get straight like it did when I first received it. I wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li> Extreme shedding! Every time I run my hands through the hair it&#x27;ll be all over.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a good buy.  I will only purchase from the store from now on.  My daughter&#x27;s hair was tangled and matted within one week&#x27;s time.  I am sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This hair is beautiful.. I cowashed and conditioned it &amp; it came out fine. NO SHEDDING NO TANGLING I haven&#x27;t got it installed yet but I can&#x27;t wait !! I&#x27;m inlove with this hair already. I gotta two 20 inches and a 18 inch. I will recommend this product to FAMILY &amp; friends !!</li>
            <li> The hair is thin the bundle is thin..... It&#x27;s nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t seem to be 18&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> Hair exactly as pictured. Ordered the 18&amp;#34; came in 1B. The quality of the hair is not that great. There are grays and shedding. I haven&#x27;t installed the hair yet. Will update</li>
            <li> Not good bad hair this not a Brazilian hair and I didn&#x27;t like bad hair bad hair I never will give a penny for this hair no more</li>
            <li> This product was bull s*** to hate hate hate don&#x27;t buy this hair better in the store for buying your hair</li>
            <li> This hair is NOT virgin hair. I co-washed the hair and dye wash in the water bad! Virgin hair should have no dye added to the hair it should be in its natural state! I have not even installed this hair but I have no choice but to deal with this hair. please beware this is not virgin hair!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received my hair today I&#x27;m very pleased with the  Hair it  feels very nice and soft I would give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> The hair was not 100% Brazilian hair.  I thought was getting 3 bundles of hair for the price . I only received one bundle of hair.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews. I saw the the risk. I bought the hair. I naively thought, well I know how to take care of my hair, so I wont fall into the trap. I was wrong. Bad decision. Trust the reviews. this hair is okay for 2 weeks, nothing longer. probably better as clip-ins</li>
            <li> okay so i purchased this hair a couple weeks ago. Yes it came extremely fast however the quality of the hair was horrible. I initially purchased this hair to match some brazilian hair i already had from another seller  (I couldn&#x27;t find the length I wanted from the previous seller so i was forced to ordered from this one. UGH HORRIBLE MISTAKE) this hair smelled which was no biggie for me so i washed it. during the was i noticed color coming out as i washed it, like ALOT. unprocessed? i don&#x27;t think so... after the wash condition and dry i compared it to the brazilian hair i had left over from a previous seller and it was two totally different types of texture. UGH need i say more this is not virgin brazilian hair! Ladies if you are looking for good hair i would recommend buying from seller ElizaWigs. I purchased 6 bundles of 16in Brazilian Remy natural wave hair from this seller while i was deployed and it was absolutely amazing!! (i bought some for me and my friend who i was deployed with and we loved it, along with everyone else.) Anyway the hair from ElizaWigs lasted me for my full 8 month deployment and then some! with good care it is exactly what your looking for TRUE VIRGIN BRAZILIAN REMY And  naturally silky!! I would still have it today but i cut it into a short style now i&#x27;m dying for long hair again. so back to this ridiculous hair, Ladies DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR IT IS NOT THE REAL DEAL!!! I would go with another seller anyone but this one and my recommendation would be ElizaWigs. (I&#x27;m only vouching for the brazilian natural wave from ElizaWigs, i tried their Peruvian curly and i hated it!!....)</li>
            <li> THIS HAIR WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED ! No Smell and Fast Delivery. i will order again.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that it sheds a lot it&#x27;s pretty good hair . I love it honestly I have no problem with it . Never gets nappy, does What I want and everything</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with all my orders they were delivered on time and the were exactly what I ordered. The 100% remi hair I ordered is perfect its thick soft and exactly 100 grams I recommend women to start ordering their hair on amazon u will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> BUNDLES ARE VERY VERY SMALL!!!!! I DNT HAVE A BIG HEAD AT ALL BUT IT WOULDVE TOOK BOUT 10/11 OF THESE BUNDLES FOR MY HAIR TO BE FULL THE WAY I LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> I am not happy I thought it would be longer and more fuller; this really looks like one track cut in half</li>
            <li> I Do Not Like It At All It Keeps Getting Nappy &amp; Tangled Like What The Crap</li>
            <li> Hair is beautiful! Got it very cheap and it was worth more than I paid for. Now I haven&#x27;t worn it as yet so I&#x27;ll be writing another review when i&#x27;ve worn it for a while. But for now it looks really pretty in the package lol.</li>
            <li> Honestly i received my 18in yesterday in the mail and it seemed very synthetic. i did the burn test and it FAILED! It was true to length. I usually order from Ebony J Hair and thats what ill continue to do. Shes the best. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> the hair is decent. it is very soft but is a tiny bundle. i purchased three bundles for my full head &amp; it covered it all but it wasn&#x27;t as full as i wanted it, so i recommend getting double the bundles if you really want a full look. the hair sheds very easily &amp; once it&#x27;s straighted it doesn&#x27;t go back to its natrual stage once wetted. i washed and conditioned the hair then bantu knotted it &amp; the hair come out soft and fluffy with nice waves like its natrual stage it looks gorgeous. i think you have to be willing to work with the hair in order for it to be right for you, but if you don&#x27;t want to i recommend different hair. blossom bundles are great! each bundles is about 80 dollars ( a little high i know ) but the hair lasts for up to a year! you guys should check it out!</li>
            <li> i used this hair after few days it tangled very badly, i would not recommend this product, it was aweful i used it fir fusion it cost me alot of money to install it and to take it out in just 3 days when it should have lasted a longer time</li>
            <li> First, the hair is darker than 1b should be. Second, the quality of the hair is terrible because it tangles like crazy.  The next day after getting the install I had HUGE knots in my hair. And it sheds like crazy.  This is about the quality of the $20 packs of hair I used to get locally when I was a teen and first started weaving.  You can get brazilian body waves on aliexpress for the same price and the hair is 10x better quality -- I wore hair from there for months and it barely shedded and never tangled. Dont waste your money on this stuff, I will probably have to take it out and it&#x27;s a waste of almost $400 total including the price of the install.</li>
            <li> Horrible Would Not Recommend To Buy Looked a Awful Very Nappy I Order A 18\\&quot; Received A 12\\&quot; Very Pissed!!! Tried To Color Turn Like A Green|Gray White With Powder All Over It Could Not Believe.... Pleaseeeeeeeee DO NOT ORDER!!!!!!!!! I Would Not Lie Infact I Took Picture</li>
            <li> This hair was horrible. It matted really bad. This hair also contains dye because when you wash it, the water turns black. DO NOT purchase from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Ummmm, not exactly what I expected but nice soft hair but the bundle is thin and small. Not sure if it tangles but it does shed a little, but hair growing form your scalp does that as well. I highlighted the hair and it came out pretty nice. Overall, would I recommend to a friend, yes I would. For $30 I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This came in a tiny pack with one piece and shed very easily. It was not worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> oh please Brazilian Remy hair my foot i hate it !!!!! can not bleach the end because it can not take it</li>
            <li> This hair is horrible it feels synthetic mixed and is not 100 percent remi hair. Soon as I saw how it was packaged I wanted to return it and once I felt it, i knew it wasnt what I bargained for</li>
            <li> The hair isn&#x27;t 18inch but it&#x27;s super cute anf soft!!! ♥ nice and curly i just wish it was a little longer</li>
            <li> loved this hear i had it in for 6mounths then its started shedding and getting shorter but besides that it was great</li>
            <li> The hair is great, came as described and on schedule, I recommend buyers who would want to get this hair to go ahead.</li>
            <li> Horrible do not buy. I have this in for not even 2 hours and it started to get all matter and nasty looking. It is cheap, nasty, gross hair. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Sheds too much matted too easily really not the vest at all when I washed the hair it looked like dye was coming off it I would never use it again</li>
            <li> I love this hair, the older it gets the more beautiful it gets!</li>
            <li> The worst hair ever!!! Cheap thin sheds</li>
            <li> 🚨🚨🚨🚨This not 18&#x27; Bad hair bundle no have 100g 🚨🚨🚨&lt;br /&gt;👎👎👎👎👎👎😡😡😡😡</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality of hair. I have worn several different brands of Remy Brazillian and this is by far one of the best. Good length and I have gotten tons of compliments on this hair.</li>
            <li> It says 100% human hair I believe that&#x27;s a lie... The hair is not soft at all it definitely feels synthetic .. I did not install it yet I&#x27;m not sure if I want too.. I was expecting something totally different but I guess for synthetic hair the price is good ... Shouldn&#x27;t false advertise like that though...</li>
            <li> This hair looks great when first installed. I washed it the next day while taking a bath my water turned black from all the dye they used to make it look a natural color. It&#x27;s only pretty when it is dripping wet and oily other than that it is a tangled, itchy mess. I took my hair down after 2 weeks because of all the issues.</li>
            <li> I order a 18 inch hair and q received was crap 14&#x27;&#x27; hair&#x27;s all haggard as if you have already used over and over again a TOTAL FRAUD</li>
            <li> Tha length is good but the color looks more like a 4 than a 1b . But the length is good .</li>
            <li> The hair was very frizzy, dry, tangley, shed alot and very unmanageable.  I will not be buying that hair again.</li>
            <li> I hate this hair when I washed it the color came out and it sheds sooooo much also it tangles and does not hold curls I will never order this hair again...... warning do not order</li>
            <li> First of all let me start by saying that i&#x27;m a professional hair stylist, I have received my order today this hair supposed to be a brazilian remy natural wave hair , well that is what the seller said. This hair is very coarse it also sheds the color also runs when wash and the wave doesn&#x27;t stay after wash, i will not recommend anyone to purchase this hair at all........................ i will be posting a video on youtude about this hair and the seller.</li>
            <li> The hair is great!! Even though it&#x27;s naturally wavy it also looks great straight. It&#x27;s flawless</li>
            <li> This hair is amazing! It is very versatile! You can curl, wave, moose, straighten, and style any way you want! All you have to do is wet it and it goes back to its normal wavyness! The hair is perfect for clip ins, and has very little shedding. I think its best that this hair gets taken out everyday and brushed thoroughly. ive had this hair for over a month and I only need one pack because I have shoulder length hair. I have the 18 inch now I might try the 22 inches in a couple months! 5 stars!! I dont know how this hair is to layer, I dont think you need to if.youknow how to put in clip ins correctly. anyone who says this hair is crap is lying and doesnt know how to take care of hair!!!</li>
            <li> ladies you can order from this store my product took about two to three weeks and  it was just like the picture posted online. I loved it and looked good wearing it. Im going to wash it and wear it again. I cant wait.</li>
            <li> NEVER AGAIN. I put this hair in Friday and went to the pool Saturday it was ruined. I had 2 wear a pony tail the rest of the time. Waste of money smh</li>
            <li> This hair was everything I expected in soooo pleased I hope anyone who is thinking about buying this product definitely does..  Thank you</li>
            <li> this is good soft hair.. although i would recommend you to order two bundles instead of one.. it is a good buy. &amp; one bundle did do my whole head .</li>
            <li> Soo I just received my hair. At first it was soft and silky when I first got it. Uhmm it did have a smell to it .. Smelled kind of like a Barbie dolls hair fresh out the pack. The hair does tangle a little. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my curls or what. I don&#x27;t think this hair is real \\&quot;brazilian \\&quot; either so don&#x27;t buy it. The weft from the weave looked kind of cheap. I kinda do like it so far because I have to make it work. I have had compliments on it though. Overall I give it a 3 or 2.5.</li>
            <li> Very soft .. no shedding nothing seemed to be off .. Wish it was more hair in the pack though .. other than that great purchase!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I bought this hair and I didn&#x27;t care for it at all.  So I did more research and found The Good Life Hair Company and I haven&#x27;t looked back since!  I&#x27;m team Good Life Hair Company now.</li>
            <li> I give four stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️for quality 💯of hair. But would be nice if the package📦 came with two bondles for the price of item..</li>
            <li> Hair didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture and I was disappointed ! It looks as if it had been worn before ,but the good thing is it arrived at the time of shipping I was told</li>
            <li> It was only soft and tamable for a week after that it went bad. It was dry and stiff unless you washed it everyday which should not be the case.</li>
            <li> The hair was almost 3 ,l expect less hair on the floor..and deeper...color,the hair need to improve..will go with another. Brand</li>
            <li> This was the worst hair ever do not order from here</li>
            <li> In general yes,they way it was expected.only some doesnt meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> its okay. not the best and not the worse</li>
            <li> Was disappointed with delay in arrival.  Oh but when I got the product I was very,  very satisfied!  Beautiful texture and color.  Love the flow of the waves. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> We are in South Africa and for the Same Product we could have paid $120,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wifes looks great and she is happy with the overall product quality,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and no regrets</li>
            <li> The hair had an odd smell, I ordered #2 and got 1b instead anyway the hair lost all its curls upon installation overall i would not purchase this hair again...</li>
            <li> This hair is not real Brazilian hair at all. Real Brazilian can dye easily, will not tangle, can be bone straight and and will not frizz. I will never recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I made it last three weeks but would not buy again took four days to get it. It was really pretty and soft for four days then I had to wear it pent up most of the time</li>
            <li> The bundle came with alot of hair and it soooo soft and haven&#x27;t tangled much and not alot of shedding I love it I will be buying more asap</li>
            <li> This is not what i expected. It was not good.</li>
            <li> This weave is cheap and will not last in your hair. I ordered this thinking that I was getting a deal but my hair looked crazy after 2 weeks of the weave being in my hair. It gets tangled and does not look nice.</li>
            <li> I got it fast like I think in 2 days but when I got it ,it didnook 18 ins it looks like its 14 ins but its lasting long but I take it out every 2 weeks and resew it back in it sheds a ill but other than that I guess its good</li>
            <li> Hair is just okay..There are better brands out there. My two problems were my bundle had numerous colorful strands such as gray and yellow. Which is not unheard of but there were quite a few. My mom even noticed alot of gray hairs and shes not that into hair. The second problem was there seem to be dirt patches or dandruff in it. This was very few but other than that it seems to not get tangled and pretty low maintenance.</li>
            <li> thes hair so beautiful I loved it so much&lt;br /&gt;Holding the curl very well  the hair so soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;And no shedding and no tangle</li>
            <li> Its amazin,IT WASHES UP VERY WELL ,VERY LITTLE TANGELS,LOVE IT, LOVE IT.I WILL BE ORDERING MORE ,THANKS AMAZON ILL PASS THE WORD...</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t 1b it was more of a 2 (light brown)&lt;br /&gt;The hair was very wavy and the texture was nice&lt;br /&gt;Overall the hair was alright</li>
            <li> First of all, the hair that you receive isn&#x27;t the hair in the picture! Its of horrible quality and the customer service is terrible. I called and left a message with no return call. Please anyone reconsider before you buy this hair! I&#x27;ve been wearing sew-ins for awhile now and I know good hair when I see it and these people aren&#x27;t selling good hair at all! False Advertisement!!! I REPEAT DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE! You will be unsatisfied and when you call for your money back...they will not return your call! I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like this in my life, so never again!</li>
            <li> When l recieved the hair l was so dissapointed becoz the hair wasn&#x27;t 18 inch and as well it had no volume at the bottom , am dissapointed ..</li>
            <li> Plz don&#x27;t not buy,order this hair and it&#x27;s a disgrace,don&#x27;t buy,I didn&#x27;t even wanted to rate it but can&#x27;t submit if I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The hair does she&#x27;s quite a bit but all hair does that . I happen to like the hair . You have know how to take care of it . I Plait it at night &amp; it don&#x27;t be tangled after that . I comb it with a wide tooth comb and my curls are here still . You just know what you gotta do to it to keep it from tangling . I like the hair .</li>
            <li> I only buy hair from them. I normally keep it in for about a month</li>
            <li> This hair is beautiful! My batch had a tint of red that was beautiful, though I only ordered 1b, it was a pleasant surprise. It has lasted me four months with minimal upkeep and I&#x27;m still getting compliments. The quality it great and my hairdresser even complimented me on the quality and color. Fast shipping and a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> was disappointed to find out it was only one bundle not the five they have shown on the picture .wondering if its a mistake or that is it ?</li>
            <li> When the hair arrived it had an really strong petroleum order to it.  I thought it might have been from the plastic sleeve.  I let it air till my appointment about a week after I received it, the order was still their.  After getting my hair done I went home and washed my hair to remove the order, that&#x27;s when I discovered that the hair had been heavily died.  It took five shampoos to get rid of the order and two subsequent washings before I stopped seeing the die.  To make matters worse after 3 weeks I had to have the weave removed because it kept tangling I looked like I had a rats nest.</li>
            <li> Hair had a few light/gray? strands,but not enough to be dissatisfied. This batch of hair was better than same type of hair bought at a wig store at $160.00. So, considering the price, it is damn good quality. I would definitely purchase this hair again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I openned the packaging and saw what appeared to be quality product at a good price. I was happy with the teture and color. There was some run off after the initial wash to get the factory smell out of the hair. This made me think that the hair was processed, unlike it stated 100% REAL HUMAN HAIR. I tried to dye a test piece and ther hair would not dye with a 40 volume lifter and booster. In the end, I am not happy.</li>
            <li> This particular business isn&#x27;t professional at all. They sent a letter with SO many typos and there was only ONE bundle of Brazilian Remy hair. The hair was manufactured incorrectly and I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it because of how badly the hair was stitched together.</li>
            <li> THIS HAIR IS SOFT AND %100 HUMAN HAIR. WHAT WAS ADVERTISED IS WHAT YOU GET. ESTIMATED DELIVERY WAS RIGHT ON POINT. NO COMPLAINTS. I WOULD BUY THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN</li>
            <li> May need to try a diffenet bunch cause that was a bad bundle. Because it tangled and mattered up after two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a hair stylist for 28 years! It shows 3 packs! I only got 1. Too thin to even began a weave job!!!!</li>
            <li> WORST HAIR EVER!!Do not buy gets tangled and matted very easily.Starts to look very dull and old. Not worth a dollar.</li>
            <li> Looks good until it is washed. Then it looks and behaves like the worst artificial hair.</li>
            <li> This drys out and it shed you also should co wash the hair before sewing it in overall its ok</li>
            <li> liked the hair, but one is not enough. need a second but not availble so i cannot use the first</li>
            <li> PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Unless you plan on wearing braided pigtails, dont buy this s***. It looks good for the first hour after installation, then from there, it tangles and sheds constantly. It gets matted very quickly. I had to keep a brush all the time. It got so bad, that I was stuck wearing a bun until I found time to take it down! It feels great in the pack but please, PLEASE, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> When I opened the package the hair was missing!!!! it was a waste of time and money.. I can&#x27;t believe it</li>
            <li> I see 3 bundles of Brazilian Remy hair and I only recieved 1 bundle. I am so upset about this. This is the second time that I was disappointed about an order for hair. Then It shows a completely different packaging when you click on the link for the hair, and that shows 2 bundles, But like I said I only recieved one. If I am not compensated i do not believe I will get hair from this site again.</li>
            <li> Ive had my hair in for a week and its nothing like ive order from someone else. It sheads alot and when i put it in a bun the hair knots up bad... Ive straighten my hair and once i washed it the hair started to feel like cheap hair....it matted up at the track and was a hassel to comb through. Also once its straighten it doesnt get back wavy. Im very dissatisfied and wont order this again....</li>
            <li> This was some bull!!!! That little ass amount of hair!!!!</li>
            <li> this product shipped fast so thumbs up for that I have had some shedding but that could be due to hair style choice other than that I love the hair so five stars from me......</li>
            <li> Please buyer beware, use caution when purchasing this hair. i call myself saving a few dollars and really regret it i dont know if this hair is real or not but i really dont think so this seems to be over priced futura hair</li>
            <li> It was so hard out of the package but when you press it its beautiful now that i have had it in for a few weeks its still looking good but getting nappy . But i still love my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the hair I order two bundle 18 inch the length on point, the hair is thick No shedding r tangle. I wash it and the natural wave came back. I recommend this hair to anybody.</li>
            <li> Dis place is a scam I ordered a 18 inch n was sent a 12 inch that had 18 inch written on it but it clearly wasn&#x27;t the hair was a good texture but it wasn&#x27;t Brazilian at all I feel like I wasted my money I could&#x27;ve have gotten sumn way better</li>
            <li> I live in jersey . Not a thing to dislike about this product . Very affordable . Good investment I will gladly buy more in the near future ! 😍💳</li>
            <li> So the hair is just okay. It sheds horribly!!! Has lots of gray and other stringy material. It is soft and true to length, and arrived before on time.</li>
            <li> I have never seen such very poor product experience. I am so dissapointed in such a product. My wife is so upset with me about this hair. It was suppose to be 18&amp;#34;. It really was 10&amp;#34;s. If my wife had not opened it, I would have just thrown it away. This is my very first bad experience with Amazon. I hope there will be no more bad experiences. Thank You , but no thank you.  Dwayne Smith</li>
            <li> I really loved the hair and it was delivered way too earlier than expected which made me extremely happy. Thinking of placing another order very soon</li>
            <li> i expected a little more lenght and body the hair just seems a little thin like it would require three packs to do your hair i am a little skeptical</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed yet with pristine hair, they sell really good hair. My particular hair came from China (kingkongmall) and this hair is flawless.The hair in the pic actually is like a loose wave, the hair that I got has a more tighter wave; I did a co-wash and I will add pics later, but the wave pattern stayed the same. I have ordered some virgin hair before from other places and the waves did not survive the wash, but this hair did, I am really impressed and I cannot wait to create my new u-part wig. This hair has a beautiful wave pattern. I do recommend this hair.</li>
            <li> I would like a refund. I had this hair sitting for a while  and i just installed it.I just got a sew-in May 3. This hair was so horrible that I couldn&#x27;t even keep it in a month. First off this is not remy hair. It tangles like crazy. The hair is so rough. I try to wash it to see if that would make the hair better but it made it worst and it didn&#x27;t go back curly. I&#x27;m so disappointed. I just wasted a lot of Money. You guys are selling False hair. If I don&#x27;t get my money back I will be contacting Amazon myself. Plz no one bye this hair. It&#x27;s Awful !!!</li>
            <li> I must say that I paid for my hair first and then read all the reviews which was all backwards but I am glad I did. I almost stop shipping of my hair like 6 times but i didn&#x27;t and i am so glad that i didn&#x27;t. I love my hair soooooooooooooo much! It is the best! I had to wash it becuz I didn&#x27;t like the smell bt it was not a bad smell at all. The hair is so light on my head! I love it really I do</li>
            <li> This hair was on time I have combed it no shedding it curls like a dream it straights like a dream love love love I say get this hair awesome and got it in two days</li>
            <li> good product, ideal for what is required, affordable price, good material, totally recommended. the truth I have no more to say</li>
            <li> When I first recieved the hair it was soft and managable, but TWO days later it is contantly tangling! I have t o brush it out at lease4-5 times a day! i will never ever buy this hair again!  It also sheds so much! Not good quality at all!</li>
            <li> This hair was well  taken care of and it did nt do a jystice garbage not real brazillian anything shit look like giraffes tail don&#x27;t waste ur money ladies</li>
            <li> The product shipped in a timely manor. The hair felt like synthetic hair, tangled a lot, and shedded a great deal. Was not happy with product.</li>
