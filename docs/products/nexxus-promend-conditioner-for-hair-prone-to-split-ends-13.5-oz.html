    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is awesome.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, my hair had not been cut in about 6-7 months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Nexxus products, but this one is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner were probably some of the best smelling hair care products I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is the perfect lightweight moisturizer for your hair.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome conditioner</li>
            <li>This nexxus pro-mend conditioner does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>Amazing and cheaper than a hair cut to get rid of the damaged ends!!</li>
            <li>I will say that I do have some Pro-Mend Heat Protexx heat protectant that I purchased before I bought the rest of this line, and it is great.</li>
            <li>I recommend not buying this product now that I have experienced it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is great.  </li>
            <li>this is OK conditioner, haven&#x27;t seen any awesome split end improvement.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own!</li>
            <li>it does smell vanilla coconut cookie-ish - but my friends LOVED the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There are overwhelmingly good reviews for this product, and I didn&#x27;t make the connection in time.  </li>
            <li>Both smell clean and delicious without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>my stylist of 10 years is super impressed with the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>The scent is like cotton candy and very enjoyable</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>it leaves your hair smelling amazing.</li>
            <li>All three products are great my hair is smooth</li>
            <li>I washed my hair with the shampoo which felt nice and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really liked it</li>
            <li>With my split ends no longer catching, (or maybe the hair cuticle is just smoother)</li>
            <li>It looks nice now.</li>
            <li>It smells nice.  </li>
            <li>She said she liked it, that it worked</li>
            <li>An excellent salon hair product i have definetly found my new conditioner that i am sticking with,</li>
            <li>Literally the most amazing smell ever.</li>
            <li>Honestly that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but sometimes you can get coupons on the retailer&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>With a household filled with daughters, I am always looking for good shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to say that it has significantly improved the look &amp; feel of my hair after about two weeks of use!</li>
            <li>I love using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I agree the products do smell lovely.</li>
            <li>I seem to be getting more compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>I did not have this luck with most of the Nexxus Pro-Mend Line.</li>
            <li>Nice, light weight, and leaves no sticky residue.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many products.</li>
            <li>I had gotten a sample of the shampoo and conditioner from nexxus before purchasing and do think it works even better with the coordinating shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I also notice my ends are a lot curlier and there is more body and bounce in my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li>but I love the moisture my hair gets from this product.</li>
            <li>but for the most part my hair is totally healthy looking again..</li>
            <li>I get split ends and dryness from highlights (on top of highlights, and so on).</li>
            <li>But I needed more fixing than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Truthfully in 2 days I noticed smoother hair.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but sometimes you can get coupons on the retailer&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>sure you thoroughly rinse out your hair after use.</li>
            <li>Sauve with shea works better at smoothing out my hair.</li>
            <li>my ends seemed much more hydrated.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was interesting.</li>
            <li>Now for my favorite part - the leave in creme.</li>
            <li>but it helps the pieces lie closer together and look more like 1 strand which will of course help you with your frizz problems.</li>
            <li>More than anything I love the way it makes my hair smell and feel.</li>
            <li>but I would say it probably does better at preventing them by keeping your hair healthy</li>
            <li>I know most people will think okay</li>
            <li>We have certainly enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>I love their shampoo as well.</li>
            <li>However I will continue to use as my hair seems to be improving with more use</li>
            <li>Also Real Simple magazine gave it excellent reviews.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>When I first bought the shampoo and conditioner at Ulta, the sales clerk told me she had a friend who tried it and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>It was icing on the cake to find out I could order it on \\&quot;Subscribe and Save,\\&quot; saving 20% over Amazon&#x27;s already pretty good price.</li>
            <li>At first I loved this product</li>
            <li>This worked great on my hair; my hair had been drying out and becoming frizzy as I could not find a decent shampoo/conditioner after the one I use was discontinued.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the shampoo - it has a good lather and feels like it really cleans, but leaves my hair moisterized.</li>
            <li>It feels great on my hair, and my hair gets really soft and feels healthier immediately after this product touches my hair in the shower!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this off and on for several years and it is a very good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic and makes my hair feel really soft and great.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is wavy and gets frizzy and damaged from coloring and styling.</li>
            <li>It feels like a salon-quality product, but you can find it at any beauty supply store, or even drug stores and places like Wal-Mart or Target if you&#x27;re lucky!  </li>
            <li>You can tell a huge difference in the silkiness of your hair after just ONE use.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, I don&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job, but I suppose it is.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice scent, but that is really all I can say that I like about it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my damaged hair silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>nexus has fabulous products</li>
            <li>I was so happy because I thought I had finally found a solution for my split ends and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>So I truely enjoy and reccomend this product to others.</li>
            <li>I used this on my color-treated hair to smooth out split ends.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner in particular does an excellent job for those with long hair -- not me, I&#x27;m lucky to still have hair!</li>
            <li>I began using them when Paul Mitchell stopped making the original Awapuhi line and then Suave stopped making the knock-off that worked just as well for my hair and as soon as I did then Nexxus discontinued me.</li>
            <li>I too have experienced a dry straw feeling on my ends from this.</li>
            <li>I just switched from a special keratin shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>When I saw this line on sale at Costco, I took two sets because I had read such good things about it.</li>
            <li>I like this conditioner because in the end it has a good smoothing effect on my hair, so I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner combo are nice, but the reviews on here which grant them lower stars do so in complete honesty.</li>
            <li>and I assume that is what gives my hair the look and feel I love so much.</li>
            <li>My daughters all love the product and claim that it makes it so much easier to comb out their hair.</li>
            <li>It turned my hair straw-like and so full of tangles.</li>
            <li>#34;strong&amp;#34; at first but with more uses it seems to effectively perform in a way opposite of its intention.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I saw this product advertised on the telly as it looked like something worth the money to buy, according to the claims they made.</li>
            <li>The other really great effect has been the ease with which I can now brush my damp hair.</li>
            <li>Worth the money though if you use it as a special occasion treatment.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is no longer available at Costco, so we order ours from Amazon now.</li>
            <li>Its effects are great and usually is not needed more than a few times a week.</li>
            <li>Overall, the product has a great short term effect, allowing your hair to look split-end free for the majority of the day, but after using it all the way through the end of the bottles, they didn&#x27;t seem to have any affect on the health or look of my hair.  </li>
            <li>To me, this product is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It completely changed my hair for the better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.</li>
            <li>have thick, naturally very wavy/curly hair; my friends could not believe how wonderful my hair looked after one wash and</li>
            <li>Honestly, I now, after using it for a couple of months, don&#x27;t see what the big deal was.</li>
            <li>and I think this product is going to help me keep long hair that looks healthy!</li>
            <li>I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.</li>
            <li>I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.</li>
            <li>Not sure I would purchase again, still on the hunt for the perfect product like the old days...</li>
            <li>I believe it fused most of them together as it appears today that they are more or less gone.</li>
            <li>that saved time in the morning is worth the higher price of the conditioner, all on</li>
            <li>Have been using all for about 3 weeks, I have very fine hair that weighs down easily.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when reading the reviews about how great this product line is, but am so glad I tried them.</li>
            <li>To be fair I so far have only used it twice</li>
            <li>Good conditioner helped with dry frizzy hair good product to use on hair that is hard to comb.</li>
            <li>It also smells great..not floral and not strong, just lightly pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is also very reasonably priced for a higher end hair product.</li>
            <li>(Different from Nexxus Emergencee, I like Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor better).</li>
            <li>and it has done a stellar job at reducing the appearance of split ends in my bangs.</li>
            <li>Dare I say, a stellar job?</li>
            <li>This is exactly what Pro-Mend was supposed to do, except the Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>I really do recommend this product to anyone with damaged hair!</li>
            <li>I have wavy to curly hair (used to be a lot curlier when I was younger, but now is more wavy)</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>I first heard about this Nexxus product on the radio, during a time when I have been wishing for smoother hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nexxus has a winner that does do exactly what it claims it will do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and while I love the smell of this product I am still undecided as to whether it is actually going to help mend my split ends.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.</li>
            <li>and my hair gets dry very easily.  </li>
            <li>This is a great item for damaged hair especially in these dry winter months.</li>
            <li>I have tried may products to help with the frizz and protect my hair from damage but none have really worked well and many of them just weighed down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing and surprisingly one bottle lasts me about an entire month or so, which is longer than I actually expected it to last.  </li>
            <li>they discontinued what I liked and what worked for me about two months after I started; I do not like the way any of their other products work</li>
            <li>This was a huge waste of time and money, and cost me a lot of hair that took me many months to grow.</li>
            <li>I typically do not spend a lot on shampoos and conditioners, but this is well worth the money!  </li>
            <li>There was a noticeable difference after the first time I used it and after using the whole bottle along with the shampoo</li>
            <li>I ran across the Nexxus ProMend on special at Costco a year ago, and it was so good, that we went back the next week and bought ten bottles.</li>
            <li>It smells great, it detangles, my hair is more manageable and my hair is down to my butt and has been overly processed, so I definitely have damage, I really do not want to cut it</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product for anyone who has a problem with split ends or fine hair.</li>
            <li>I also think it really does help with the split end problem.</li>
            <li>This one really works</li>
            <li>I have been using Nexxus Pro-Mend conditioner (along with the leave-in and over-night treatment, I don&#x27;t use the shampoo very often as I use another product) and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I started using this system about four months ago, and I really do like it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would go as far to say that my hair feels \\&quot;freshly cut,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use this very often because I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole system and started with the overnight treatment.</li>
            <li>It was very creamy</li>
            <li>My hair felt very silky when it rinsed out.     </li>
            <li>Now for what you really want to know - did it fix my split ends???</li>
            <li>but it does really improve your split ends.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product to my friends and will continue to use it because I feel it makes my hair look and feel much healthier.</li>
            <li>I have been using this conditioner, along with the matching shampoo, for about a month now, and I have seen real improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me</li>
            <li>My hair is really prone to split ends</li>
            <li>It really has helped my hair out a lot.</li>
            <li>I purchased the whole system: shampoo, conditioner and leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair and am always searching for good products.</li>
            <li>It did not dry my hair out more; it did exactly what it advertises: It &#x27;glued&#x27; my split ends together and basically coated my hair with this same &#x27;glue&#x27; so that it was not frizzy at all.</li>
            <li>Certainly better results than any of the other &amp;#34;strengthening&amp;#34; products I tried.</li>
            <li>and I felt my hair was weighed down a bit more after each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you will not receive this same dramatic effect over and over precisely because it does actually work; don&#x27;t expect to see the same incredible difference each and every time after that very first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just have realistic expectations - there won&#x27;t be 100% improvement in 3 days.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really binds my split ends and makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I highly rec.</li>
            <li>I encourage you to try it at least once w/o worrying about cost as most likely you&#x27;ll be surprised as I was and like my friends were and as so many women swear by this stuff</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li>I could probably get even better results if I used the shampoo too, but it&#x27;s a little pricey for both.</li>
            <li>The only down side is the smell which is quite strong, it&#x27;s not unpleasant but just too perfumed.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is nowhere to be found in stores, but it&#x27;s great that I can order it here to have for use when my hair is on the frizzy or damaged side.</li>
            <li>By the end of the bottle I noticed my hair was worse, I figured it couldn&#x27;t be this product because it has so amazing at first.</li>
            <li>I did feel after applying the conditioner and then rinsing out that it immediately felt soft and manageable, but after drying not so much.</li>
            <li>Although there&#x27;s a definite binding/mending action, my hair feels heavy and unclean, as if heaps of product is in my hair despite good rinse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would say that my hair looked better than usual when styled - both when curly and straight.     </li>
            <li>Okay long story short, lost some hair due to an accident and some neurological meds, growing it back, really want to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>I think everyone is a little skeptical of this product at first because it just sounds too good to be true!</li>
            <li>Usually after styling it feels good but by the end of the day there is this really dry feeling.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and the seller got this product to me very quickly but just not sure if this is for me.</li>
            <li>it was so soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, it is best to get a hair cut if your hair is in bad condition, but as in my case, sometimes it just isn&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li>I generally use products costing 2-3 times as much as this line, so I was surprised that this system worked so well.     </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference since using this complete system than I did with my regular conditioner and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The next time I styled it straight.</li>
            <li>it feels so soft at the ends.</li>
            <li>so this stuff is one of the few that actually softens it up somewhat and provides better post shower control</li>
            <li>(I have super long hair, it takes long enough as is) but it seems to work pretty well even if you&#x27;re not using it after every wash.</li>
            <li>It leaves it super soft, shiny, and manageable without weighing down at all.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I styled my hair wavy, and it looked better than usual - it did not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li>I saw the most dramatic difference the first time I used the product (like the commercial says).</li>
            <li>: you will secure a dramatic effect the first time you use it</li>
            <li>After a month of daily use, I&#x27;d say at least 60% of my split ends have mended, which is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I left it on for a few minutes and tried to rinse expecting it to be silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It nourishes my hair like no other.</li>
            <li>and I expected it to soak right in, but it initially just sits on your hair like a film.</li>
            <li>I have baby-fine, long hair that breaks and splits easily, so I had quite a few split ends before using this product.</li>
            <li>My hair was better, slightly less frizz on the ends, but I could feel that the back was still in rough shape.</li>
            <li>After the major haircut, I went back to using my old shampoo and conditioner, and guess what?  </li>
            <li>When I went to get my hair cut after a year or so, the lady cutting it commented on how great my hair looked considering that I hadn&#x27;t gotten it cut in so long.</li>
            <li>Apparently all these split end binding conditioners do is apply an adhesive to your hair.</li>
            <li>As for mending split ends, Im not sure how true that is</li>
            <li>I have very damaged hair due to 2 unsuccessful hair relaxation treatments.</li>
            <li>and I was worried that it would be very weighed down.</li>
            <li>That is not typically normal because my hair&#x27;s ends is usually dry and very brittle, and well split.</li>
            <li>This affects the texture of my hair to the touch slightly, and doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>It feels less brittle and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>Not sure it really fixes split ends, but makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>Now when I touch my hair after straightening my hair (because my hair is naturally tight really curly hair)</li>
            <li>well received item &amp; highly recommend it to other&#x27;s as well!</li>

            <li> It is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, my hair had not been cut in about 6-7 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Nexxus products, but this one is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner were probably some of the best smelling hair care products I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the perfect lightweight moisturizer for your hair.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome conditioner</li>
            <li> This nexxus pro-mend conditioner does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> Amazing and cheaper than a hair cut to get rid of the damaged ends!!</li>
            <li> I will say that I do have some Pro-Mend Heat Protexx heat protectant that I purchased before I bought the rest of this line, and it is great.</li>
            <li> I recommend not buying this product now that I have experienced it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great.  </li>
            <li> this is OK conditioner, haven&#x27;t seen any awesome split end improvement.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own!</li>
            <li> it does smell vanilla coconut cookie-ish - but my friends LOVED the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are overwhelmingly good reviews for this product, and I didn&#x27;t make the connection in time.  </li>
            <li> Both smell clean and delicious without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> my stylist of 10 years is super impressed with the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> The scent is like cotton candy and very enjoyable</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> it leaves your hair smelling amazing.</li>
            <li> All three products are great my hair is smooth</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with the shampoo which felt nice and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really liked it</li>
            <li> With my split ends no longer catching, (or maybe the hair cuticle is just smoother)</li>
            <li> It looks nice now.</li>
            <li> It smells nice.  </li>
            <li> She said she liked it, that it worked</li>
            <li> An excellent salon hair product i have definetly found my new conditioner that i am sticking with,</li>
            <li> Literally the most amazing smell ever.</li>
            <li> Honestly that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but sometimes you can get coupons on the retailer&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> With a household filled with daughters, I am always looking for good shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to say that it has significantly improved the look &amp; feel of my hair after about two weeks of use!</li>
            <li> I love using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I agree the products do smell lovely.</li>
            <li> I seem to be getting more compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> I did not have this luck with most of the Nexxus Pro-Mend Line.</li>
            <li> Nice, light weight, and leaves no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many products.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a sample of the shampoo and conditioner from nexxus before purchasing and do think it works even better with the coordinating shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I also notice my ends are a lot curlier and there is more body and bounce in my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li> but I love the moisture my hair gets from this product.</li>
            <li> but for the most part my hair is totally healthy looking again..</li>
            <li> I get split ends and dryness from highlights (on top of highlights, and so on).</li>
            <li> But I needed more fixing than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Truthfully in 2 days I noticed smoother hair.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but sometimes you can get coupons on the retailer&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> sure you thoroughly rinse out your hair after use.</li>
            <li> Sauve with shea works better at smoothing out my hair.</li>
            <li> my ends seemed much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was interesting.</li>
            <li> Now for my favorite part - the leave in creme.</li>
            <li> but it helps the pieces lie closer together and look more like 1 strand which will of course help you with your frizz problems.</li>
            <li> More than anything I love the way it makes my hair smell and feel.</li>
            <li> but I would say it probably does better at preventing them by keeping your hair healthy</li>
            <li> I know most people will think okay</li>
            <li> We have certainly enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> I love their shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> However I will continue to use as my hair seems to be improving with more use</li>
            <li> Also Real Simple magazine gave it excellent reviews.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> When I first bought the shampoo and conditioner at Ulta, the sales clerk told me she had a friend who tried it and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> It was icing on the cake to find out I could order it on \\&quot;Subscribe and Save,\\&quot; saving 20% over Amazon&#x27;s already pretty good price.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this product</li>
            <li> This worked great on my hair; my hair had been drying out and becoming frizzy as I could not find a decent shampoo/conditioner after the one I use was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the shampoo - it has a good lather and feels like it really cleans, but leaves my hair moisterized.</li>
            <li> It feels great on my hair, and my hair gets really soft and feels healthier immediately after this product touches my hair in the shower!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this off and on for several years and it is a very good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic and makes my hair feel really soft and great.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is wavy and gets frizzy and damaged from coloring and styling.</li>
            <li> It feels like a salon-quality product, but you can find it at any beauty supply store, or even drug stores and places like Wal-Mart or Target if you&#x27;re lucky!  </li>
            <li> You can tell a huge difference in the silkiness of your hair after just ONE use.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, I don&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job, but I suppose it is.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice scent, but that is really all I can say that I like about it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my damaged hair silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> nexus has fabulous products</li>
            <li> I was so happy because I thought I had finally found a solution for my split ends and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> So I truely enjoy and reccomend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I used this on my color-treated hair to smooth out split ends.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner in particular does an excellent job for those with long hair -- not me, I&#x27;m lucky to still have hair!</li>
            <li> I began using them when Paul Mitchell stopped making the original Awapuhi line and then Suave stopped making the knock-off that worked just as well for my hair and as soon as I did then Nexxus discontinued me.</li>
            <li> I too have experienced a dry straw feeling on my ends from this.</li>
            <li> I just switched from a special keratin shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> When I saw this line on sale at Costco, I took two sets because I had read such good things about it.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner because in the end it has a good smoothing effect on my hair, so I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner combo are nice, but the reviews on here which grant them lower stars do so in complete honesty.</li>
            <li> and I assume that is what gives my hair the look and feel I love so much.</li>
            <li> My daughters all love the product and claim that it makes it so much easier to comb out their hair.</li>
            <li> It turned my hair straw-like and so full of tangles.</li>
            <li> #34;strong&amp;#34; at first but with more uses it seems to effectively perform in a way opposite of its intention.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw this product advertised on the telly as it looked like something worth the money to buy, according to the claims they made.</li>
            <li> The other really great effect has been the ease with which I can now brush my damp hair.</li>
            <li> Worth the money though if you use it as a special occasion treatment.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is no longer available at Costco, so we order ours from Amazon now.</li>
            <li> Its effects are great and usually is not needed more than a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product has a great short term effect, allowing your hair to look split-end free for the majority of the day, but after using it all the way through the end of the bottles, they didn&#x27;t seem to have any affect on the health or look of my hair.  </li>
            <li> To me, this product is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It completely changed my hair for the better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.</li>
            <li> have thick, naturally very wavy/curly hair; my friends could not believe how wonderful my hair looked after one wash and</li>
            <li> Honestly, I now, after using it for a couple of months, don&#x27;t see what the big deal was.</li>
            <li> and I think this product is going to help me keep long hair that looks healthy!</li>
            <li> I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.</li>
            <li> I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would purchase again, still on the hunt for the perfect product like the old days...</li>
            <li> I believe it fused most of them together as it appears today that they are more or less gone.</li>
            <li> that saved time in the morning is worth the higher price of the conditioner, all on</li>
            <li> Have been using all for about 3 weeks, I have very fine hair that weighs down easily.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when reading the reviews about how great this product line is, but am so glad I tried them.</li>
            <li> To be fair I so far have only used it twice</li>
            <li> Good conditioner helped with dry frizzy hair good product to use on hair that is hard to comb.</li>
            <li> It also smells great..not floral and not strong, just lightly pleasant.</li>
            <li> It is also very reasonably priced for a higher end hair product.</li>
            <li> (Different from Nexxus Emergencee, I like Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor better).</li>
            <li> and it has done a stellar job at reducing the appearance of split ends in my bangs.</li>
            <li> Dare I say, a stellar job?</li>
            <li> This is exactly what Pro-Mend was supposed to do, except the Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> I really do recommend this product to anyone with damaged hair!</li>
            <li> I have wavy to curly hair (used to be a lot curlier when I was younger, but now is more wavy)</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> I first heard about this Nexxus product on the radio, during a time when I have been wishing for smoother hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nexxus has a winner that does do exactly what it claims it will do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and while I love the smell of this product I am still undecided as to whether it is actually going to help mend my split ends.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.</li>
            <li> and my hair gets dry very easily.  </li>
            <li> This is a great item for damaged hair especially in these dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I have tried may products to help with the frizz and protect my hair from damage but none have really worked well and many of them just weighed down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It also smells amazing and surprisingly one bottle lasts me about an entire month or so, which is longer than I actually expected it to last.  </li>
            <li> they discontinued what I liked and what worked for me about two months after I started; I do not like the way any of their other products work</li>
            <li> This was a huge waste of time and money, and cost me a lot of hair that took me many months to grow.</li>
            <li> I typically do not spend a lot on shampoos and conditioners, but this is well worth the money!  </li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference after the first time I used it and after using the whole bottle along with the shampoo</li>
            <li> I ran across the Nexxus ProMend on special at Costco a year ago, and it was so good, that we went back the next week and bought ten bottles.</li>
            <li> It smells great, it detangles, my hair is more manageable and my hair is down to my butt and has been overly processed, so I definitely have damage, I really do not want to cut it</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product for anyone who has a problem with split ends or fine hair.</li>
            <li> I also think it really does help with the split end problem.</li>
            <li> This one really works</li>
            <li> I have been using Nexxus Pro-Mend conditioner (along with the leave-in and over-night treatment, I don&#x27;t use the shampoo very often as I use another product) and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I started using this system about four months ago, and I really do like it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would go as far to say that my hair feels \\&quot;freshly cut,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this very often because I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole system and started with the overnight treatment.</li>
            <li> It was very creamy</li>
            <li> My hair felt very silky when it rinsed out.     </li>
            <li> Now for what you really want to know - did it fix my split ends???</li>
            <li> but it does really improve your split ends.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product to my friends and will continue to use it because I feel it makes my hair look and feel much healthier.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner, along with the matching shampoo, for about a month now, and I have seen real improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me</li>
            <li> My hair is really prone to split ends</li>
            <li> It really has helped my hair out a lot.</li>
            <li> I purchased the whole system: shampoo, conditioner and leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and am always searching for good products.</li>
            <li> It did not dry my hair out more; it did exactly what it advertises: It &#x27;glued&#x27; my split ends together and basically coated my hair with this same &#x27;glue&#x27; so that it was not frizzy at all.</li>
            <li> Certainly better results than any of the other &amp;#34;strengthening&amp;#34; products I tried.</li>
            <li> and I felt my hair was weighed down a bit more after each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you will not receive this same dramatic effect over and over precisely because it does actually work; don&#x27;t expect to see the same incredible difference each and every time after that very first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just have realistic expectations - there won&#x27;t be 100% improvement in 3 days.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really binds my split ends and makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I highly rec.</li>
            <li> I encourage you to try it at least once w/o worrying about cost as most likely you&#x27;ll be surprised as I was and like my friends were and as so many women swear by this stuff</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li> I could probably get even better results if I used the shampoo too, but it&#x27;s a little pricey for both.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the smell which is quite strong, it&#x27;s not unpleasant but just too perfumed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is nowhere to be found in stores, but it&#x27;s great that I can order it here to have for use when my hair is on the frizzy or damaged side.</li>
            <li> By the end of the bottle I noticed my hair was worse, I figured it couldn&#x27;t be this product because it has so amazing at first.</li>
            <li> I did feel after applying the conditioner and then rinsing out that it immediately felt soft and manageable, but after drying not so much.</li>
            <li> Although there&#x27;s a definite binding/mending action, my hair feels heavy and unclean, as if heaps of product is in my hair despite good rinse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say that my hair looked better than usual when styled - both when curly and straight.     </li>
            <li> Okay long story short, lost some hair due to an accident and some neurological meds, growing it back, really want to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> I think everyone is a little skeptical of this product at first because it just sounds too good to be true!</li>
            <li> Usually after styling it feels good but by the end of the day there is this really dry feeling.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and the seller got this product to me very quickly but just not sure if this is for me.</li>
            <li> it was so soft!</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, it is best to get a hair cut if your hair is in bad condition, but as in my case, sometimes it just isn&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li> I generally use products costing 2-3 times as much as this line, so I was surprised that this system worked so well.     </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference since using this complete system than I did with my regular conditioner and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next time I styled it straight.</li>
            <li> it feels so soft at the ends.</li>
            <li> so this stuff is one of the few that actually softens it up somewhat and provides better post shower control</li>
            <li> (I have super long hair, it takes long enough as is) but it seems to work pretty well even if you&#x27;re not using it after every wash.</li>
            <li> It leaves it super soft, shiny, and manageable without weighing down at all.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I styled my hair wavy, and it looked better than usual - it did not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> I saw the most dramatic difference the first time I used the product (like the commercial says).</li>
            <li> : you will secure a dramatic effect the first time you use it</li>
            <li> After a month of daily use, I&#x27;d say at least 60% of my split ends have mended, which is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I left it on for a few minutes and tried to rinse expecting it to be silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> It nourishes my hair like no other.</li>
            <li> and I expected it to soak right in, but it initially just sits on your hair like a film.</li>
            <li> I have baby-fine, long hair that breaks and splits easily, so I had quite a few split ends before using this product.</li>
            <li> My hair was better, slightly less frizz on the ends, but I could feel that the back was still in rough shape.</li>
            <li> After the major haircut, I went back to using my old shampoo and conditioner, and guess what?  </li>
            <li> When I went to get my hair cut after a year or so, the lady cutting it commented on how great my hair looked considering that I hadn&#x27;t gotten it cut in so long.</li>
            <li> Apparently all these split end binding conditioners do is apply an adhesive to your hair.</li>
            <li> As for mending split ends, Im not sure how true that is</li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair due to 2 unsuccessful hair relaxation treatments.</li>
            <li> and I was worried that it would be very weighed down.</li>
            <li> That is not typically normal because my hair&#x27;s ends is usually dry and very brittle, and well split.</li>
            <li> This affects the texture of my hair to the touch slightly, and doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> It feels less brittle and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> Not sure it really fixes split ends, but makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> Now when I touch my hair after straightening my hair (because my hair is naturally tight really curly hair)</li>
            <li> well received item &amp; highly recommend it to other&#x27;s as well!</li>
            <li> The Nexus shite washed out in a few weeks and my hair went back to normal.  </li>
            <li> I would say that at least 50% of my split ends disappeared after the first use.</li>
            <li> It is thick and soaks right into the dry ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> First of all I have very dry color treated hair and after reading the reviews was really anxious to try this product.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this since I&#x27;ve loved other nexxus products in the past, but I was extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> I got this just to try it out to see if I could save my long hair..</li>
            <li> so it does take a long time to rinse out.</li>
            <li> After a few washes it tends to coat my hair and leave it a bit stiff and very straight.</li>
            <li> my hair is dry and NEEDS all the help it can get.</li>
            <li> when I let it air dry as I wasn&#x27;t feeling well.</li>
            <li> It feels like straw now that it&#x27;s dry and has no shine.</li>
            <li> One of the Nexxus products that my wife had ordered for dry, damaged hair and split ends.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it can ever fully repair split ends, breakage or tame wild or damaged hair, but it makes my hair so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> and I blow dry it every single day.</li>
            <li> I was very much under the impression that you could not fix broken hair.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every single day</li>
            <li> I figured it might change after I flat ironed the next day, but it was still stiff.</li>
            <li> This stuff left my hair a dry tangled mess.</li>
            <li> So it does what it says it does - gets rid of split ends - and it left my hair feeling moisterized and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It left my hair a tangled mess</li>
            <li> It has also had lots of sun &amp; pool exposure so needless to say my hair was pretty fried!  </li>
            <li> I followed up with the very thick conditioner, which also seemed like it might be promising.</li>
            <li> I finally happened upon Hi Def Curls Conditioner after a few years of searching so now I use that in tandem to or with Pro Mend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thus I will be buying this again when the bottle is empty...</li>
            <li> Then I had to use a different shampoo and conditioner for a few days while I was away</li>
            <li> i guess its working but noT real creamy for a contioner</li>
            <li> This consistency is like Elmer&#x27;s glue, and I couldn&#x27;t even work my brush through my hair while wet.</li>
            <li> She said buying the Nexxus products she needed was an expensive experiment and just doesn&#x27;t think they were worth the money they cost.</li>
            <li> have always been a problem and while this stuff has not completely eliminated the split ends, they are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, naturally curly, but takes about 5 minutes to blow dry (convenient).  </li>
            <li> In two days, using all four products there was an extreme and noticeable difference in the smoothness of my hair.</li>
            <li> shampoo is like any other shampoo, lather, rinse.</li>
            <li> other plus is: you can find it in stores everywhere</li>
            <li> This is what I said on my review of the shampoo because I use them in conjunction with each other</li>
            <li> It does not feel tacky and greasy like a lot of other products.</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair very heavy</li>
            <li> With it being so fragile, I used to spend at least 10 minutes carefully brushing my hair out and using detangling spray.</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ll have no problem selling it to a friend or co-worker if you do not like it or if it&#x27;s not &#x27;right&#x27; for your hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves this dull lack of shine for your hair though, it definitely weighs it down.</li>
            <li> I have just past shoulder length, layered, dark brown (dyed), medium texture, naturally wavy Latina hair that has been blow dried and straight-ironed on almost a daily basis for at least the past five years.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth the price...doesn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
            <li> I was never able to grow long hair until I found this and its companion shampoo-it delivers!  </li>
            <li> My bangs are badly damaged at the ends due to the perm and the fact that I hit this part of my hair hardest with the flat iron, but I just can&#x27;t go much shorter.</li>
            <li> Seriously bummed, especially for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> It felt a little greasy going on, but it soaked in and by the morning</li>
            <li> When my hair dried, I was a bit dismayed....</li>
            <li> I gave it a few days, then returned both sets when I didn&#x27;t see any visible improvement in my hair to justify the sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I see a few split ends here and there</li>
            <li> The leave in conditioner you put a quarter sized amount in your hand and run through your hair, concentrate on trouble zones and/or ends.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for everyday use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However: for me this is not an everyday use conditioner.</li>
            <li> Everyday use does give me the &#x27;Elmer&#x27;s glue backlash effect&#x27;.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> your hair feels dried out.</li>
            <li> I combed it through and after a few minutes it felt like it had soaked in -</li>
            <li> I only wish it also helped volumizing my thin hair too.</li>
            <li> I had really bad split ends from too much processing, I&#x27;ve tried a few other things that didn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li> With less breakage my hair will get longer!</li>
            <li> Silkier, smoother, and less split ends!</li>
            <li> And: I used a very small amount of it as its thick and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have been trying to grow my hair long, so I haven&#x27;t been cutting it regularly (</li>
            <li> I did notice that my hair feels like it has a very slight film over it -</li>
            <li> I permed my hair in August 2011 thinking I might go for that look rather than messing with my hair each day, but unfortunately couldn&#x27;t stand the look, so I reverted back to heat styling.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my hair has taken a beating for the past several months.</li>
            <li> Well its not magic in a bottle</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands, even expensive ones</li>
            <li> Then I found it at Amazon, a few dollars less expensive.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to rinse out under the water.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s also very thick, so I tend to stay away from heavy products.</li>
            <li> Got thick hard hair</li>
            <li> which I know I should, but my hair grows really slow once it gets to be shoulder length).  </li>
            <li> I was then forced to try just about every product there is and to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> To make things worse, every time I touched my hair, I got a sticky residue on my hand.</li>
            <li> But I do have some broken ends because I am trying to grow my hair out from the hair loss I suffered</li>
            <li> After using it, and seeing my hair get progressively worse and worse, I had no idea what was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I realized it is expensive</li>
            <li> I actually got so frustrated because I hate the feeling of leftover conditioner, that I would add just a dap of shampoo after conditioning just to make myself feel as if I was getting it out.  </li>
            <li> She came to the conclusion that the Nexxus products are too expensive for what they are.  </li>
            <li> and they all make my hair feel terrible, look dry and frizz.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s manageable but can be inconvenient given that you&#x27;re supposed to use it every time you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle shape makes it awkward in the shower, the contents don&#x27;t want to come out.</li>
            <li> I have lots of split ends that drive me crazy, even though I cut my hair every six weeks.</li>
            <li> I recommend just doing the leave-in, which can be dangerously greasy if you are not meticulous in using it.  </li>
            <li> I ended up cutting four inches off of my hair, but my hairdresser said my hair was \\&quot;evenly damaged\\&quot; from the roots to the ends.  </li>
            <li> this is impossible</li>
            <li> So maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought, or maybe it was because I&#x27;d already been treating my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t stand feeling of dirty hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate when you wash out shampoo and</li>
            <li> Not that it&#x27;s terrible</li>
            <li> Came home tried my nexxus and that awful straw feeling returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is OK conditioner, haven&#x27;t seen any awesome split end improvement.</li>
            <li> I was never able to grow long hair until I found this and its companion shampoo-it delivers!  Strengthens hair and keeps split ends to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I love using this conditioner. It&#x27;s fantastic and makes my hair feel really soft and great. I also think it really does help with the split end problem. When I went to get my hair cut after a year or so, the lady cutting it commented on how great my hair looked considering that I hadn&#x27;t gotten it cut in so long. I could probably get even better results if I used the shampoo too, but it&#x27;s a little pricey for both.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when reading the reviews about how great this product line is, but am so glad I tried them. I&#x27;m thrilled to say that it has significantly improved the look &amp; feel of my hair after about two weeks of use! (I am using the shampoo, conditioner and leave-in treatment.) I have just past shoulder length, layered, dark brown (dyed), medium texture, naturally wavy Latina hair that has been blow dried and straight-ironed on almost a daily basis for at least the past five years.  It has also had lots of sun &amp; pool exposure so needless to say my hair was pretty fried!  Split ends &amp; frizzies have always been a problem and while this stuff has not completely eliminated the split ends, they are much less noticeable. It is A LOT shinier, smoother looking and softer feeling. I agree the products do smell lovely. I seem to be getting more compliments on my hair. I plan to get the overnight treatment and the protector.</li>
            <li> I permed my hair in August 2011 thinking I might go for that look rather than messing with my hair each day, but unfortunately couldn&#x27;t stand the look, so I reverted back to heat styling. Needless to say, my hair has taken a beating for the past several months. I tried to preserve it, but I just didn&#x27;t have any luck. When I saw this line on sale at Costco, I took two sets because I had read such good things about it. I washed my hair with the shampoo which felt nice and moisturizing. I followed up with the very thick conditioner, which also seemed like it might be promising. I also tried the leave in included. When my hair dried, I was a bit dismayed....my hair felt like straw. I figured it might change after I flat ironed the next day, but it was still stiff. To make things worse, every time I touched my hair, I got a sticky residue on my hand. It appears that this is how this product works. Another reviewer likened this product to glue. I have to agree. Also, I tried not using the leave in to see if that would help...it didn&#x27;t. My hair was still sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know that no shampoo, conditioner, or leave in is going to get rid of split ends, but rather just reduce the appearance of the split ends. I did not have this luck with most of the Nexxus Pro-Mend Line. I gave it a few days, then returned both sets when I didn&#x27;t see any visible improvement in my hair to justify the sticky feeling. I will say that I do have some Pro-Mend Heat Protexx heat protectant that I purchased before I bought the rest of this line, and it is great. Nice, light weight, and leaves no sticky residue. I will continue to use that. Just not the shampoo, conditioner, or leave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, it is best to get a hair cut if your hair is in bad condition, but as in my case, sometimes it just isn&#x27;t practical. My bangs are badly damaged at the ends due to the perm and the fact that I hit this part of my hair hardest with the flat iron, but I just can&#x27;t go much shorter. If youare looking for something that reduces the appearance of split ends, you might try Nexxus Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor (Different from Nexxus Emergencee, I like Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor better). I used it just last night and it has done a stellar job at reducing the appearance of split ends in my bangs. Dare I say, a stellar job? I believe it fused most of them together as it appears today that they are more or less gone. I know they are still there, but I can&#x27;t see them. It is awesome. This is exactly what Pro-Mend was supposed to do, except the Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for something that will actually repair split ends, reverse damage and prevent breakage, this does it all. It smells great, it detangles, my hair is more manageable and my hair is down to my butt and has been overly processed, so I definitely have damage, I really do not want to cut it and I think this product is going to help me keep long hair that looks healthy! With less breakage my hair will get longer! I really do recommend this product to anyone with damaged hair!</li>
            <li> I saw the difference in my hair in two weeks. I really liked it and I have tried many products. This one really works</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, my hair had not been cut in about 6-7 months and I used this and it became manageable again!  I love it!  I typically do not spend a lot on shampoos and conditioners, but this is well worth the money!  I had gotten a sample of the shampoo and conditioner from nexxus before purchasing and do think it works even better with the coordinating shampoo.  I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nexxus Pro-Mend conditioner (along with the leave-in and over-night treatment, I don&#x27;t use the shampoo very often as I use another product) and I really like it.  I have wavy to curly hair (used to be a lot curlier when I was younger, but now is more wavy) and my hair gets dry very easily.  I also have been trying to grow my hair long, so I haven&#x27;t been cutting it regularly (which I know I should, but my hair grows really slow once it gets to be shoulder length).  I started using this system about four months ago, and I really do like it.  I&#x27;m not sure if it can ever fully repair split ends, breakage or tame wild or damaged hair, but it makes my hair so soft and silky.  I also notice my ends are a lot curlier and there is more body and bounce in my hair after using this product. I don&#x27;t know if I would go as far to say that my hair feels \\&quot;freshly cut,\\&quot; but I love the moisture my hair gets from this product. It feels great on my hair, and my hair gets really soft and feels healthier immediately after this product touches my hair in the shower!  It also smells amazing and surprisingly one bottle lasts me about an entire month or so, which is longer than I actually expected it to last.  To me, this product is worth the price.  It feels like a salon-quality product, but you can find it at any beauty supply store, or even drug stores and places like Wal-Mart or Target if you&#x27;re lucky!  Or of course, Amazon!  I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Nexxus products, but this one is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I got this just to try it out to see if I could save my long hair.. I had really bad split ends from too much processing, I&#x27;ve tried a few other things that didn&#x27;t work.. This did however.. I see a few split ends here and there but for the most part my hair is totally healthy looking again.. Amazing and cheaper than a hair cut to get rid of the damaged ends!!</li>
            <li> I highly rec. this along with the entire nexxus promend line for those trying to hide their split ends while growing out their hair at the same time.  This will help you extend the time interval between trims while improving your hair texture as well.  THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product enough. I literally want to call Nexxus and thank them for making this conditioner. It completely changed my hair for the better. Silkier, smoother, and less split ends! Not to mention the smell of it is orgasmic. Literally the most amazing smell ever. It&#x27;s like vanilla sugar milk that you&#x27;re soaking into your hair. Just ordered the shampoo and overnight treatment as well, cant wait!!!</li>
            <li> I first heard about this Nexxus product on the radio, during a time when I have been wishing for smoother hair. I get split ends and dryness from highlights (on top of highlights, and so on). When I first bought the shampoo and conditioner at Ulta, the sales clerk told me she had a friend who tried it and LOVED it. I realized it is expensive and I&#x27;d have to buy it only now and then, as a splurge. Then I found it at Amazon, a few dollars less expensive. It was icing on the cake to find out I could order it on \\&quot;Subscribe and Save,\\&quot; saving 20% over Amazon&#x27;s already pretty good price.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner were probably some of the best smelling hair care products I&#x27;ve ever used.  However, i felt like i was putting Elmer&#x27;s glue in my hair and then trying to get it out again.  Overall, the product has a great short term effect, allowing your hair to look split-end free for the majority of the day, but after using it all the way through the end of the bottles, they didn&#x27;t seem to have any affect on the health or look of my hair.  Worth the money though if you use it as a special occasion treatment.</li>
            <li> Okay long story short, lost some hair due to an accident and some neurological meds, growing it back, really want to keep it healthy. I have had some breakage in the back of my head. I have been using satin pillowcases to reduce breakage and a satin nightcap on my restless nights to stop snarls. But I do have some broken ends because I am trying to grow my hair out from the hair loss I suffered and I&#x27;m going a lot longer in between haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I tried the leave in day conditioner as a stand alone product and it smoothed frizz and controlled flyaways. But I needed more fixing than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I tried the overnight treatment in combination with the leave in treatment. My hair was better, slightly less frizz on the ends, but I could feel that the back was still in rough shape. I tried the leave in conditioner for 1 week before adding the overnight. I tried the overnight cream with the day cream for 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I decided to splurge and try the Nexxus ProMend shampoo and conditioner. 2 days. In two days, using all four products there was an extreme and noticeable difference in the smoothness of my hair. I was very much under the impression that you could not fix broken hair. Truthfully in 2 days I noticed smoother hair. The bottle says in 3 days use you will see results. So maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought, or maybe it was because I&#x27;d already been treating my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is like any other shampoo, lather, rinse. The conditioner you leave on for 3 minutes, comb through, I recently switched to the Tool Structure Shower Detangling Comb (http://www.amazon.com/Tool-Structure-Shower-Detangler-Comb/dp/B003JMWOR8) . Both smell clean and delicious without being overpowering. The leave in conditioner you put a quarter sized amount in your hand and run through your hair, concentrate on trouble zones and/or ends. I used more than a quarter sized amount to nourish all my ends and the troubled back spot. For the nigt time treatment you do not need to rewash your hair - unless you have a lot of product in there. I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue. In the morning, wash it out. I followed with the Nexxus shampoo and conditioner and started all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but sometimes you can get coupons on the retailer&#x27;s website. It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair. Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between. I also like John Freida&#x27;s Frizz repair shampoo and conditioner.ed to rewash your hair - unless you have a lot of product in there.

            <li> I have been using this off and on for several years and it is a very good conditioner.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like hair glue. You can&#x27;t actually repair split ends they just need to be cut off. This is sort of a band aid for that problem. I would recommend if you are going to use this make sure you thoroughly rinse out your hair after use. The build up and residue leaves your have feeling like you just use Elmer&#x27;s glue to wash it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this very often because I don&#x27;t like it. Although there&#x27;s a definite binding/mending action, my hair feels heavy and unclean, as if heaps of product is in my hair despite good rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stand feeling of dirty hair! I won&#x27;t repurchase this or the Pro Mend Shampoo.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth the price...doesn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> my hair is dry and NEEDS all the help it can get. This conditioner really binds my split ends and makes my hair very soft and manageable. I am on my second bottle, this will be a staple for a looong time for me!</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, I don&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job, but I suppose it is.  Not sure I would purchase again, still on the hunt for the perfect product like the old days...</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it at all. the hair feel like straw after using it. no difference</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner because in the end it has a good smoothing effect on my hair, so I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;One warning - it&#x27;s very thick so it does take a long time to rinse out. That&#x27;s manageable but can be inconvenient given that you&#x27;re supposed to use it every time you wash your hair. I don&#x27;t have time to do that (I have super long hair, it takes long enough as is) but it seems to work pretty well even if you&#x27;re not using it after every wash.</li>
            <li> So, I bought this stuff before reading the reviews. The shampoo and conditioner combo are nice, but the reviews on here which grant them lower stars do so in complete honesty. The product will make your hair feel &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; at first but with more uses it seems to effectively perform in a way opposite of its intention. I too have experienced a dry straw feeling on my ends from this. Usually after styling it feels good but by the end of the day there is this really dry feeling. It leaves this dull lack of shine for your hair though, it definitely weighs it down. I recommend not buying this product now that I have experienced it. If I could go back and not buy it I would. Not that it&#x27;s terrible it&#x27;s just not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This is a great item for damaged hair especially in these dry winter months. The scent is like cotton candy and very enjoyable but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for everyday use. Unfortunately it is nowhere to be found in stores, but it&#x27;s great that I can order it here to have for use when my hair is on the frizzy or damaged side. Its effects are great and usually is not needed more than a few times a week. (think of it as a hair mask for repair)</li>
            <li> This stuff doesnt work at all.Sauve with shea works better at smoothing out my hair. This stuff left my hair a dry tangled mess.Save you money buy something else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s me, Susan, not Brian as he shaved his head: This worked great on my hair; my hair had been drying out and becoming frizzy as I could not find a decent shampoo/conditioner after the one I use was discontinued. I was then forced to try just about every product there is and to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, naturally very wavy/curly hair; my friends could not believe how wonderful my hair looked after one wash and when I let it air dry as I wasn&#x27;t feeling well. It did not dry my hair out more; it did exactly what it advertises: It &#x27;glued&#x27; my split ends together and basically coated my hair with this same &#x27;glue&#x27; so that it was not frizzy at all. And: I used a very small amount of it as its thick and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However: for me this is not an everyday use conditioner. I wash my hair every single day and I blow dry it every single day. After a few washes it tends to coat my hair and leave it a bit stiff and very straight. But: this helps hold a style; if you style your hair this effect aids and abets styling. Everyday use does give me the &#x27;Elmer&#x27;s glue backlash effect&#x27;. Now I use it once a week and/or I add a tiny bit to my regular conditioner if I want to use it a second or third time in a week. I finally happened upon Hi Def Curls Conditioner after a few years of searching so now I use that in tandem to or with Pro Mend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: you will secure a dramatic effect the first time you use it but you will not receive this same dramatic effect over and over precisely because it does actually work; don&#x27;t expect to see the same incredible difference each and every time after that very first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can take or leave the smell - it does smell vanilla coconut cookie-ish - but my friends LOVED the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I abandoned Nexxus products about ten years ago as just as I began using them they discontinued what I liked and what worked for me about two months after I started; I do not like the way any of their other products work and they all make my hair feel terrible, look dry and frizz. I began using them when Paul Mitchell stopped making the original Awapuhi line and then Suave stopped making the knock-off that worked just as well for my hair and as soon as I did then Nexxus discontinued me. I&#x27;ve been on the hunt ever since. I took a chance on Pro-Mend based upon these reviews and I agree:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus has a winner that does do exactly what it claims it will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other plus is: you can find it in stores everywhere so you do not have to order it and wait on it; you can purchase it when you do your regular shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use it everyday but I will use it once a week or so thus I will be buying this again when the bottle is empty...I encourage you to try it at least once w/o worrying about cost as most likely you&#x27;ll be surprised as I was and like my friends were and as so many women swear by this stuff then you&#x27;ll have no problem selling it to a friend or co-worker if you do not like it or if it&#x27;s not &#x27;right&#x27; for your hair.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw this product advertised on the telly as it looked like something worth the money to buy, according to the claims they made. Honestly, I now, after using it for a couple of months, don&#x27;t see what the big deal was. I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference since using this complete system than I did with my regular conditioner and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent, but that is really all I can say that I like about it. The bottle shape makes it awkward in the shower, the contents don&#x27;t want to come out. I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my hair (not colour treated) and I felt my hair was weighed down a bit more after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe it has helped the condition of my hair at all. Apparently all these split end binding conditioners do is apply an adhesive to your hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my damaged hair silky and smooth.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is wavy and gets frizzy and damaged from coloring and styling. I have lots of split ends that drive me crazy, even though I cut my hair every six weeks. I have tried may products to help with the frizz and protect my hair from damage but none have really worked well and many of them just weighed down my fine hair. I generally use products costing 2-3 times as much as this line, so I was surprised that this system worked so well.     I bought the whole system and started with the overnight treatment. It felt a little greasy going on, but it soaked in and by the morning my ends seemed much more hydrated. I then washed it out with the shampoo. I LOVE the shampoo - it has a good lather and feels like it really cleans, but leaves my hair moisterized. I hate when you wash out shampoo and your hair feels dried out. The conditioner was interesting. It was very creamy and I expected it to soak right in, but it initially just sits on your hair like a film. I combed it through and after a few minutes it felt like it had soaked in - you should definitely leave it on for the recommended time. My hair felt very silky when it rinsed out.     Now for my favorite part - the leave in creme. It is thick and soaks right into the dry ends of my hair. My hair felt fully saturated with moisture and I was worried that it would be very weighed down. The first time I tried it I styled my hair wavy, and it looked better than usual - it did not weigh down my hair. The next time I styled it straight. I did notice that my hair feels like it has a very slight film over it - I&#x27;m guess that is how it works. This affects the texture of my hair to the touch slightly, and doesn&#x27;t really bother me. I would say that my hair looked better than usual when styled - both when curly and straight.     Now for what you really want to know - did it fix my split ends??? I would say that at least 50% of my split ends disappeared after the first use. I don&#x27;t even know how that is possible, but they are gone. I still have some - but I have to search for them instead of seeing tons of them every time I look. So it does what it says it does - gets rid of split ends - and it left my hair feeling moisterized and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this line of shampoo and conditioners. I have oily hair that&#x27;s also very thick, so I tend to stay away from heavy products. This conditioner is the perfect lightweight moisturizer for your hair. It leaves it super soft, shiny, and manageable without weighing down at all. It is also very reasonably priced for a higher end hair product. I definitely suggest that you use the shampoo along with the conditioner. It also smells great..not floral and not strong, just lightly pleasant.</li>
            <li> It works so well! I look at my ends now and have to search for a split end! I only wish it also helped volumizing my thin hair too.</li>
            <li> An excellent salon hair product i have definetly found my new conditioner that i am sticking with, well received item &amp; highly recommend it to other&#x27;s as well!</li>
            <li> nexus has fabulous products</li>
            <li> This is what I said on my review of the shampoo because I use them in conjunction with each other and I assume that is what gives my hair the look and feel I love so much. I think everyone is a little skeptical of this product at first because it just sounds too good to be true! Well its not magic in a bottle but it does really improve your split ends. It doesnt seem to me like it actually mends mine but it helps the pieces lie closer together and look more like 1 strand which will of course help you with your frizz problems. I saw the most dramatic difference the first time I used the product (like the commercial says). More than anything I love the way it makes my hair smell and feel. I do recommend this product to my friends and will continue to use it because I feel it makes my hair look and feel much healthier. As for mending split ends, Im not sure how true that is but I would say it probably does better at preventing them by keeping your hair healthy so start using it after you get a haircut.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I orderEd the Nexxus Pro-Mend Shampoo and Conditioner as an ongoing subscription to get the cheaper price. I WILL continue to receive the shipments! You can tell a huge difference in the silkiness of your hair after just ONE use. It does NOT leave your hair feeling greasy or weighted at all. Feels like your just got out of the salon. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this product I was so happy because I thought I had finally found a solution for my split ends and damaged hair. By the end of the bottle I noticed my hair was worse, I figured it couldn&#x27;t be this product because it has so amazing at first. Then I had to use a different shampoo and conditioner for a few days while I was away noticed my hair do a 180 it was so soft! Came home tried my nexxus and that awful straw feeling returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> i guess its working but noT real creamy for a contioner</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, naturally curly, but takes about 5 minutes to blow dry (convenient).  This conditioner left my hair very heavy and it is hard to rinse out under the water.  I actually got so frustrated because I hate the feeling of leftover conditioner, that I would add just a dap of shampoo after conditioning just to make myself feel as if I was getting it out.  I bought the shampoo, condition, and leave-in.  I recommend just doing the leave-in, which can be dangerously greasy if you are not meticulous in using it.  I don&#x27;t think it is really necessary to have the conditioner on hand and do not notice a difference when I use it followed by the leave-in.</li>
            <li> I know most people will think okay this is impossible but yes this conditioner does work and it leaves your hair smelling amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner, along with the matching shampoo, for about a month now, and I have seen real improvement in my hair. I have baby-fine, long hair that breaks and splits easily, so I had quite a few split ends before using this product. After a month of daily use, I&#x27;d say at least 60% of my split ends have mended, which is fantastic! Certainly better results than any of the other &amp;#34;strengthening&amp;#34; products I tried. The other really great effect has been the ease with which I can now brush my damp hair. With it being so fragile, I used to spend at least 10 minutes carefully brushing my hair out and using detangling spray. With my split ends no longer catching, (or maybe the hair cuticle is just smoother) now I can skip the spray and be done in 2 minutes - that saved time in the morning is worth the higher price of the conditioner, all on it&#x27;s own! It even smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who has a problem with split ends or fine hair. Just have realistic expectations - there won&#x27;t be 100% improvement in 3 days.</li>
            <li> With a household filled with daughters, I am always looking for good shampoos and conditioners. I ran across the Nexxus ProMend on special at Costco a year ago, and it was so good, that we went back the next week and bought ten bottles. The conditioner in particular does an excellent job for those with long hair -- not me, I&#x27;m lucky to still have hair! My daughters all love the product and claim that it makes it so much easier to comb out their hair. We have certainly enjoyed this product. Unfortunately, it is no longer available at Costco, so we order ours from Amazon now.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands, even expensive ones but none had the effect on my hair this one has. It nourishes my hair like no other. I love their shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> Nexxus PRO Mend System I Started It With Shampoo Conditioner Straightener Curly PRO ducts too. It works very well for me</li>
            <li> Good conditioner helped with dry frizzy hair good product to use on hair that is hard to comb.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference after the first time I used it and after using the whole bottle along with the shampoo my stylist of 10 years is super impressed with the condition of my hair. It feels less brittle and looks much healthier. But a heads up that I did get dandruff when using this for prolonged periods of time.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and am always searching for good products. I was excited to try this since I&#x27;ve loved other nexxus products in the past, but I was extremely disappointed! As soon as I put the product in my hair, I could tell it was different. This consistency is like Elmer&#x27;s glue, and I couldn&#x27;t even work my brush through my hair while wet. I left it on for a few minutes and tried to rinse expecting it to be silky and smooth. It left my hair a tangled mess and I had to use another conditioner just to get it apart. It feels like straw now that it&#x27;s dry and has no shine. Seriously bummed, especially for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the Promend shampoo and heat protecting spray. Have been using all for about 3 weeks, I have very fine hair that weighs down easily. All three products are great my hair is smooth and I can see the difference in the split ends. It does not feel tacky and greasy like a lot of other products. The only down side is the smell which is quite strong, it&#x27;s not unpleasant but just too perfumed. However I will continue to use as my hair seems to be improving with more use</li>
            <li> First of all I have very dry color treated hair and after reading the reviews was really anxious to try this product. Also Real Simple magazine gave it excellent reviews. To be fair I so far have only used it twice and while I love the smell of this product I am still undecided as to whether it is actually going to help mend my split ends. I did feel after applying the conditioner and then rinsing out that it immediately felt soft and manageable, but after drying not so much. The price was reasonable and the seller got this product to me very quickly but just not sure if this is for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is really prone to split ends and I thought that just using this product might help me with my hair... and it DID! Now when I touch my hair after straightening my hair (because my hair is naturally tight really curly hair) it feels so soft at the ends. That is not typically normal because my hair&#x27;s ends is usually dry and very brittle, and well split. So I truely enjoy and reccomend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Got thick hard hair so this stuff is one of the few that actually softens it up somewhat and provides better post shower control</li>
            <li> This is an awesome conditioner it&#x27;s almost like a deep conditioner. It really has helped my hair out a lot. Truly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used this on my color-treated hair to smooth out split ends.  It turned my hair straw-like and so full of tangles. It seems to have some sort of sticky glue in it.  I purchased the whole system: shampoo, conditioner and leave-in treatment. After using it, and seeing my hair get progressively worse and worse, I had no idea what was wrong.  There are overwhelmingly good reviews for this product, and I didn&#x27;t make the connection in time.  I ended up cutting four inches off of my hair, but my hairdresser said my hair was \\&quot;evenly damaged\\&quot; from the roots to the ends.  After the major haircut, I went back to using my old shampoo and conditioner, and guess what?  The Nexus shite washed out in a few weeks and my hair went back to normal.  It looks nice now. This was a huge waste of time and money, and cost me a lot of hair that took me many months to grow.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great.  I have very damaged hair due to 2 unsuccessful hair relaxation treatments. I just switched from a special keratin shampoo &amp; conditioner. This nexxus pro-mend conditioner does a wonderful job. It leaves my hair feeling nice and smooth. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It smells nice.  Not sure it really fixes split ends, but makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> One of the Nexxus products that my wife had ordered for dry, damaged hair and split ends.  She said she liked it, that it worked okay but didn&#x27;t like the results of her hair after using the recommended ProMend shampoo.  She came to the conclusion that the Nexxus products are too expensive for what they are.  She said buying the Nexxus products she needed was an expensive experiment and just doesn&#x27;t think they were worth the money they cost.</li>
