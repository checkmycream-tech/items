            <li>but, way better than the D*ve for my hair!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>and we both love the smell!</li>
            <li>so I can afford to use a lot, but it&#x27;s also effective</li>
            <li>Something about it kind of reminds me of cat urine.</li>
            <li>this is nice to help get them out, and does contain the soap...</li>
            <li>The grape scent is nice, but doesn&#x27;t linger and make me sneeze like the perfume-y scents</li>
            <li>works great - no tangles and smells great, our two year old loves it.....</li>
            <li>All my kids has curly/wavy hair, so their hair gets tangle very easy.</li>
            <li>The results have been wonderful thus far.</li>
            <li>Nice and light!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good and paraben free.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really speak about how great it is for the hairs as we kind of focused on the rash.</li>
            <li>Strangers stop me to compliment his beautiful hair; I believe that&#x27;s largely a gift from God, but this conditioner helps too.</li>
            <li>I have been using the conditioner on my daughter&#x27;s hair for about 2.5 weeks and her hair smells great, but the ends still get pretty tangled.</li>
            <li>and I love that I can comb through her curls.</li>
            <li>But there are better products out there.  </li>
            <li>But for our oldest, it doesn&#x27;t do anything for the tangles or even make it more</li>
            <li>My kids love this grape-scented conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love that it doesn&#x27;t burn the kids eyes.</li>
            <li>My daughter love the scent.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely, cleans well, and leaves a light scent on your hair for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Most kid shampoos claim to be 2 in 1, but that is never the case.</li>
            <li>This one is more cheaper</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the grape fragrance</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and everyone who uses it when bathing their child at my house asks where I got it.</li>
            <li>Really helps with brushing, great price too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and smells so good, I want to use it!</li>
            <li>We do use a good (large) amount though, to ensure the desired results (no tangles!).</li>
            <li>Smells really nice, not greasy and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>smells really good and makes my daughter&#x27;s curly hair nice and soft and easy to comb</li>
            <li>Cheap, works for kids, love the smell</li>
            <li>This is great conditioner, and doesn&#x27;t bother my ridiculously sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Smells really good and leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair nice and soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>The shampoos smell very nice, so I was surprised how this grape smelled.</li>
            <li>After showering with this stuff her hair is easy to comb/brush and doesn&#x27;t hurt the noggin.</li>
            <li>Works great for my girls very affordable and well worth it</li>
            <li>Takes out all the knots that children so easily get.</li>
            <li>daughter&#x27;s hair was easy to comb but the conditioner didn&#x27;t make it any easier to comb.</li>
            <li>Because the strands are fine, it tends to tangle easily.</li>
            <li>My seven-year-old has fine hair</li>
            <li>This is a must-have product for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li>the ingredients arent the safest according to ewg but leaves her hair silky smooth and easy to brush</li>
            <li>best for little girls</li>
            <li>As a huge fan of the Loreal kids shampoos, I have been very happy with this conditioner for my little girl.</li>
            <li>The suave that we used to use worked great, left her hair smooth and tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I use a LOT of it, and it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>Worth our money!</li>
            <li>Just hope that they offer more scents to choose from: the current grape one is OK but a bit too strong.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works great on her hair, so that I&#x27;m able to come it out without snagging the comb, and it leaves her hair extra soft once it dries.</li>
            <li>stuff does exactly what its supposed to, and I like that it is tear free, and cheap</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing, and makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>The smell brings back good memories.</li>
            <li>my kid&#x27;s hair feels very silky and healthy after this conditioner, and she swims twice per week.</li>
            <li>It leaves her hair nice and soft</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li>Great tear free conditioner for my little girl.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the smell and the cute containers, and the conditioner has been wonderful for everyday use as it does not dry her hair out.</li>
            <li>We have 2 daughters with fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>It is useful and make her hair very shinny and smoothly.</li>
            <li>It makes it soft &amp; easy to comb after her bath/shower.</li>
            <li>The bottle does not contain much product and we run out quickly, which is why I did not give it a five-star rating.</li>
            <li>I use this for my two year old who has terribly fine hair that tangles.  </li>
            <li>Helps keep my 2 year old&#x27;s fine, curly hair in order.  </li>
            <li>it works for our 2nd daughter who still has really fine hair that doesn&#x27;t get too full of tangles unless she decides the needs to put ranch in her hair.</li>
            <li>It works but has sort of a funny smell.  </li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner and works well on thick hair.  </li>
            <li>so once we run out of that, we&#x27;re likely going to be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>I will come back to buy more</li>
            <li>Rinses clean and leaves no heavy residue!</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t use this product again, but I will say it worked VERY well for the first 12-18 months of their lives.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair since she&#x27;s about nine months old.</li>
            <li>While it does do a fine job conditioning my children&#x27;s hair, the scent is so foul I had to rewash their hair the next day.</li>
            <li>It is better than when she didn&#x27;t have the conditioner, but her ends still feel very dry.</li>
            <li>Many kids shampoos have conditioner built right in, but I find that it is beneficial to use a separate conditioner with her hair as it makes combing her hair after her shower less traumatic for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so much I don&#x27;t feel like I need to look for anything else.</li>
            <li>Her hair gets very knotty and tangles.  </li>
            <li>but wish it was available in a larger size.</li>
            <li>or 3-in-1 combos when all I want is straight kids conditioner.</li>
            <li>The scent rinses from my daughter&#x27;s hair though, and the conditioner really minimizes knots and snarles, so it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works really well on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>We are going back to the thicker strawberry conditioner that you buy for cheap at any drugstore (also on Amazon.)</li>
            <li>Makes it so much easier to comb through after her showers and makes her hair softer.</li>
            <li>This really makes my granddaughter&#x27;s hair easier to comb</li>
            <li>The first time my kid used the conditioner she was taking a cool bath and the conditioner seemed ok, not pleasant, but it didn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li>We particularly now like the leave in conditioner ...</li>
            <li>It makes my hair incredibly soft and tangle free, and it smells terrific.</li>
            <li>My 2 year-old son has very curly hair, hence is it prone to drying, especially with fun in the sun and pool.  </li>
            <li>I got this for a couple of dollars on sale and it does a very nice job of keeping my dry, coarse, thick hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>The 2-in-1 shampoos alone leave their hair clean but not soft and shiny -</li>
            <li>The smell is a little over the top for adults, but my kids like it.  </li>
            <li>My kids are 3 and 4 years old, there is no reason for them to smell that way!!</li>
            <li>, it smells gr8 &amp; leaves my daughters hair very soft &amp; moisturized</li>
            <li>My 3 yr old now enjoys washing her hair!</li>
            <li>My 7 year old likes the smell and feel of this.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft.  </li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter has curly hair that ends up in tangles if we don&#x27;t use conditioner.</li>
            <li>Her hair is soft and tangle-free, even after swimming every day.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair, and my kids&#x27; hair, soft, manageable, and easier to detangle.</li>
            <li>(We&#x27;ve been using for a week so far).</li>
            <li>- her hair hasn&#x27;t been nearly as staticky.</li>
            <li>get a free shipping on my Amazon Prime so no time wasted looking for it in stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult, and I use with the grape conditioner.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old has a tender head, so this conditioner is a must.</li>
            <li>I buy this to use on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>but it definitely does not moisturize or penetrate the hair as much as the Suave kid&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>They do not sell this brand of conditioner/shampoo where I live, but my cousins from CA had some during their recent visit.</li>
            <li>My two year old daughter has very fine, somewhat thin hair that gets easily tangled and becomes quite a rat&#x27;s nest if you so much as look at it wrong.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 6 years old and has long, soft hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves their hair soft and shiny and it&#x27;s a breeze to brush - even the next morning.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and only have to leave it on for a minute or two.</li>
            <li>my 3yo has very fine hair that got very dried out after a few days in the pool.  </li>
            <li>(she uses way too much and typically gets it everywhere, including her eyes).</li>
            <li>Our 15 month old has super fine, staticky hair, and I bought this hoping use would help tame her crazy winter hair.</li>

            <li> After showering with this stuff her hair is easy to comb/brush and doesn&#x27;t hurt the noggin.</li>
            <li> Works great for my girls very affordable and well worth it</li>
            <li> Takes out all the knots that children so easily get.</li>
            <li> daughter&#x27;s hair was easy to comb but the conditioner didn&#x27;t make it any easier to comb.</li>
            <li> Because the strands are fine, it tends to tangle easily.</li>
            <li> My seven-year-old has fine hair</li>
            <li> This is a must-have product for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li> the ingredients arent the safest according to ewg but leaves her hair silky smooth and easy to brush</li>
            <li> best for little girls</li>
            <li> As a huge fan of the Loreal kids shampoos, I have been very happy with this conditioner for my little girl.</li>
            <li> The suave that we used to use worked great, left her hair smooth and tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I use a LOT of it, and it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> Worth our money!</li>
            <li> Just hope that they offer more scents to choose from: the current grape one is OK but a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great on her hair, so that I&#x27;m able to come it out without snagging the comb, and it leaves her hair extra soft once it dries.</li>
            <li> stuff does exactly what its supposed to, and I like that it is tear free, and cheap</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing, and makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li> The smell brings back good memories.</li>
            <li> my kid&#x27;s hair feels very silky and healthy after this conditioner, and she swims twice per week.</li>
            <li> It leaves her hair nice and soft</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li> Great tear free conditioner for my little girl.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the smell and the cute containers, and the conditioner has been wonderful for everyday use as it does not dry her hair out.</li>
            <li> We have 2 daughters with fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> It is useful and make her hair very shinny and smoothly.</li>
            <li> It makes it soft &amp; easy to comb after her bath/shower.</li>
            <li> The bottle does not contain much product and we run out quickly, which is why I did not give it a five-star rating.</li>
            <li> I use this for my two year old who has terribly fine hair that tangles.  </li>
            <li> Helps keep my 2 year old&#x27;s fine, curly hair in order.  </li>
            <li> it works for our 2nd daughter who still has really fine hair that doesn&#x27;t get too full of tangles unless she decides the needs to put ranch in her hair.</li>
            <li> It works but has sort of a funny smell.  </li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner and works well on thick hair.  </li>
            <li> so once we run out of that, we&#x27;re likely going to be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> I will come back to buy more</li>
            <li> Rinses clean and leaves no heavy residue!</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use this product again, but I will say it worked VERY well for the first 12-18 months of their lives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair since she&#x27;s about nine months old.</li>
            <li> While it does do a fine job conditioning my children&#x27;s hair, the scent is so foul I had to rewash their hair the next day.</li>
            <li> It is better than when she didn&#x27;t have the conditioner, but her ends still feel very dry.</li>
            <li> Many kids shampoos have conditioner built right in, but I find that it is beneficial to use a separate conditioner with her hair as it makes combing her hair after her shower less traumatic for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so much I don&#x27;t feel like I need to look for anything else.</li>
            <li> Her hair gets very knotty and tangles.  </li>
            <li> but wish it was available in a larger size.</li>
            <li> or 3-in-1 combos when all I want is straight kids conditioner.</li>
            <li> The scent rinses from my daughter&#x27;s hair though, and the conditioner really minimizes knots and snarles, so it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> We are going back to the thicker strawberry conditioner that you buy for cheap at any drugstore (also on Amazon.)</li>
            <li> Makes it so much easier to comb through after her showers and makes her hair softer.</li>
            <li> This really makes my granddaughter&#x27;s hair easier to comb</li>
            <li> The first time my kid used the conditioner she was taking a cool bath and the conditioner seemed ok, not pleasant, but it didn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> We particularly now like the leave in conditioner ...</li>
            <li> It makes my hair incredibly soft and tangle free, and it smells terrific.</li>
            <li> My 2 year-old son has very curly hair, hence is it prone to drying, especially with fun in the sun and pool.  </li>
            <li> I got this for a couple of dollars on sale and it does a very nice job of keeping my dry, coarse, thick hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> The 2-in-1 shampoos alone leave their hair clean but not soft and shiny -</li>
            <li> The smell is a little over the top for adults, but my kids like it.  </li>
            <li> My kids are 3 and 4 years old, there is no reason for them to smell that way!!</li>
            <li> , it smells gr8 &amp; leaves my daughters hair very soft &amp; moisturized</li>
            <li> My 3 yr old now enjoys washing her hair!</li>
            <li> My 7 year old likes the smell and feel of this.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft.  </li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter has curly hair that ends up in tangles if we don&#x27;t use conditioner.</li>
            <li> Her hair is soft and tangle-free, even after swimming every day.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my hair, and my kids&#x27; hair, soft, manageable, and easier to detangle.</li>
            <li> (We&#x27;ve been using for a week so far).</li>
            <li> - her hair hasn&#x27;t been nearly as staticky.</li>
            <li> get a free shipping on my Amazon Prime so no time wasted looking for it in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult, and I use with the grape conditioner.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old has a tender head, so this conditioner is a must.</li>
            <li> I buy this to use on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> but it definitely does not moisturize or penetrate the hair as much as the Suave kid&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> They do not sell this brand of conditioner/shampoo where I live, but my cousins from CA had some during their recent visit.</li>
            <li> My two year old daughter has very fine, somewhat thin hair that gets easily tangled and becomes quite a rat&#x27;s nest if you so much as look at it wrong.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 6 years old and has long, soft hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves their hair soft and shiny and it&#x27;s a breeze to brush - even the next morning.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and only have to leave it on for a minute or two.</li>
            <li> my 3yo has very fine hair that got very dried out after a few days in the pool.  </li>
            <li> (she uses way too much and typically gets it everywhere, including her eyes).</li>
            <li> Our 15 month old has super fine, staticky hair, and I bought this hoping use would help tame her crazy winter hair.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and makes brushing her hair after bath time and in the mornings so much easier.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old niece came over the other day and had a bath while she was here.  </li>
            <li> This is very watery and we burn through the small bottle in no time</li>
            <li> My one and a half year old loves the bottle and helping me put it in her hair</li>
            <li> My three daughters each have different hair, ranging from thing and straight to thick and curly.  </li>
            <li> It takes me back to when I was little and used the same shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I noticed that if the shower was hot it seemed to smell even worse.</li>
            <li> Especially after a day at the pool, when her hair (a dark blond color normally) would turn green and stiff, the conditioner works wonders and restores the shine and softness to her hair.</li>
            <li> My six year old granddaughter has long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding conditioner for my 3 year old daughters curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and I found that regular shampoo had a harsh effect on her hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her, but I think it smells a little strange.</li>
            <li> 2 little girls, long hair, lots of knots...</li>
            <li> The other product I have found that we like is Aussie Kids Coconut Conditioner, but that seems to be unavailable anywhere at the moment...</li>
            <li> This condition serves each well, without weighing the hair down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thin conditioner that didn&#x27;t do much for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long thick hair and it gets out every tangle with no problems.</li>
            <li> After that she used it in the warm shower and the smell was nasty.</li>
            <li> The grape scent alone was noxious but after their hair dried it had a body odor or stinky sock smell.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the smell is not good.  </li>
            <li> Never really got any on her face or eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t appear irritating.</li>
            <li> No more tangles and shiny, manageable hair.</li>
            <li> Not easy to find just that!</li>
            <li> My children have wavy thin hair and the conditioner does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Her hair would be too tangled and hard to manage without a separate conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a conditioner for kids.</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t ever complained about it hurting her eyes or anything.</li>
            <li> I use it after the L&#x27;Oreal 2 in one shampoo because my daughter has thick hair.  </li>
            <li> a lot of hair products leave behind.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal I&#x27;m not sure who put together this scent, approved it, and marketed it to the public, because it smells nasty!</li>
            <li> brand don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I also adore the fake grape scent-</li>
            <li> She likes it too because of the silly bottle.  </li>
            <li> I had a lot of 2 in 1 shampoos which just weren&#x27;t cutting it.  </li>
            <li> The artificial grape smells like medicine.</li>
            <li> We used it on her hair (which was terribly tangled) and it almost eliminated her tangles.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My daughter loves the container and the smell and I love that I can comb through her curls.</li>
            <li> We have 2 daughters with fine, straight hair.  The 2-in-1 shampoos alone leave their hair clean but not soft and shiny - and it&#x27;s a pain to brush out.  This conditioner leaves their hair soft and shiny and it&#x27;s a breeze to brush - even the next morning.  Gave it 4 of 5 stars because I wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding conditioner for my 3 year old daughters curly hair.  I had a lot of 2 in 1 shampoos which just weren&#x27;t cutting it.  Her hair would be too tangled and hard to manage without a separate conditioner.  I was really happy to find this L&#x27;Oreal Kids Conditioner.  It smells great, is in a cute bottle (which my daughter likes), and works great on her hair.  I have this product set as a subscribe and save item because I like it so much I don&#x27;t feel like I need to look for anything else.</li>
            <li> But there are better products out there.  We particularly now like the leave in conditioner ... I probably won&#x27;t use this product again, but I will say it worked VERY well for the first 12-18 months of their lives.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product. It smells very nice and refreshing. we allways use it in the bath for my daugher and she can not take a bath with out it.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old likes the smell and feel of this.  Her hair gets very knotty and tangles.  After showering with this stuff her hair is easy to comb/brush and doesn&#x27;t hurt the noggin.</li>
            <li> Every day product for my kids, love the smell!</li>
            <li> Our baby loves this conditioner and it has a very nice aroma.</li>
            <li> It works but has sort of a funny smell.  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I use this for my two year old who has terribly fine hair that tangles.  It does a great job of getting rid of the tangles.  My 5 year old niece came over the other day and had a bath while she was here.  We used it on her hair (which was terribly tangled) and it almost eliminated her tangles.  I use a LOT of it, and it&#x27;s cheap so I can afford to use a lot, but it&#x27;s also effective</li>
            <li> Wife likes it. I have no hair so don&#x27;t  use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner and works well on thick hair.  Leaves hair soft.  Great price but wish it was available in a larger size.</li>
            <li> We purchased this conditioner for our daughters when our local walmart stopped selling the suave conditioner for kids as well as any kids conditioner. Everywhere I look i can only find 2-in-1 or 3-in-1 combos when all I want is straight kids conditioner. My four year olds hair turns into a rats nest without any conditions and the combos don&#x27;t seem to do anything for the tangles. The suave that we used to use worked great, left her hair smooth and tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;This brand don&#x27;t get me wrong it works for our 2nd daughter who still has really fine hair that doesn&#x27;t get too full of tangles unless she decides the needs to put ranch in her hair. But for our oldest, it doesn&#x27;t do anything for the tangles or even make it more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell amazing though! Like grape koolaid!</li>
            <li> My kids love this grape-scented conditioner. My two year old daughter has very fine, somewhat thin hair that gets easily tangled and becomes quite a rat&#x27;s nest if you so much as look at it wrong. This conditioner works great on her hair, so that I&#x27;m able to come it out without snagging the comb, and it leaves her hair extra soft once it dries. Two-in-one products just don&#x27;t cut it for us.</li>
            <li> This is very watery and we burn through the small bottle in no time</li>
            <li> My seven-year-old has fine hair and I found that regular shampoo had a harsh effect on her hair. After reading several reviews of the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Kids hair care products, I decided to purchase the shampoo, conditioner, and swim shampoo. The results have been wonderful thus far. My daughter loves the smell and the cute containers, and the conditioner has been wonderful for everyday use as it does not dry her hair out. I&#x27;m even using it myself. I just wish the range came in larger containers.</li>
            <li> As a huge fan of the Loreal kids shampoos, I have been very happy with this conditioner for my little girl. It doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her, but I think it smells a little strange. The shampoos smell very nice, so I was surprised how this grape smelled. The scent rinses from my daughter&#x27;s hair though, and the conditioner really minimizes knots and snarles, so it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Cheap, works for kids, love the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair since she&#x27;s about nine months old. Never really got any on her face or eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t appear irritating. It works well, smoothing and moisturizing her baby curls. Not a big fan of the smell. Wish they had different conditioner scents.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter has curly hair that ends up in tangles if we don&#x27;t use conditioner. Many kids shampoos have conditioner built right in, but I find that it is beneficial to use a separate conditioner with her hair as it makes combing her hair after her shower less traumatic for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does exactly what its supposed to, and I like that it is tear free, and cheap so I can let my daughter use it all by herself (she uses way too much and typically gets it everywhere, including her eyes). She loves it. I, however can&#x27;t stand the smell. Something about it kind of reminds me of cat urine. The other product I have found that we like is Aussie Kids Coconut Conditioner, but that seems to be unavailable anywhere at the moment... so once we run out of that, we&#x27;re likely going to be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> i just started using this conditioner with the l&#x27;oreal kids shampoo &amp; it&#x27;s just wonderful, it smells gr8 &amp; leaves my daughters hair very soft &amp; moisturized</li>
            <li> My daughter had a rash after using this product, and doesn&#x27;t have one when using generic ones. Can&#x27;t really speak about how great it is for the hairs as we kind of focused on the rash.</li>
            <li> best for little girls</li>
            <li> My six year old granddaughter has long thick hair. Because the strands are fine, it tends to tangle easily. This conditioner works great and smells even better. No more tangles and shiny, manageable hair. We&#x27;re both happy now!</li>
            <li> Smells really good and leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair nice and soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Wonderful conditioner that smells delicious and doesn&#x27;t leave children&#x27;s hair greasy at all. Nice and light! My daughter has long thick hair and it gets out every tangle with no problems.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Her hair is soft and tangle-free, even after swimming every day.  My only complaint is that the smell is not good.  The artificial grape smells like medicine.</li>
            <li> We would never get through a shower without it. 2 little girls, long hair, lots of knots...this is nice to help get them out, and does contain the soap... it&#x27;s just Conditioner. Not easy to find just that! Smells great too</li>
            <li> smells really good and makes my daughter&#x27;s curly hair nice and soft and easy to comb</li>
            <li> My 3 yr old now enjoys washing her hair! It&#x27;s so soft and smells so good, I want to use it!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.It&#x27;s so hard to find a conditioner for kids.My kids have thick,curly hair and need more than a 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner and the added bonus is that it smells awesome.I also mix it with water in a spray bottle for detangler, it saves a ton of money and works well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It makes my hair incredibly soft and tangle free, and it smells terrific.</li>
            <li> This is great conditioner, and doesn&#x27;t bother my ridiculously sensitive skin. The grape scent is nice, but doesn&#x27;t linger and make me sneeze like the perfume-y scents a lot of hair products leave behind. This leaves my hair, and my kids&#x27; hair, soft, manageable, and easier to detangle. It&#x27;s been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have product for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair. It makes it soft &amp; easy to comb after her bath/shower.</li>
            <li> The smell brings back good memories. Makes my hair soft and only have to leave it on for a minute or two. Rinses clean and leaves no heavy residue!</li>
            <li> I love it and it works great with Loreal shampoo!</li>
            <li> This smells great and works well for my toddler who has very fine hair.  We use it once or twice a week and so one bottle has lasted us for months! Worth our money!</li>
            <li> Smells really nice, not greasy and rinses clean. I use it after the L&#x27;Oreal 2 in one shampoo because my daughter has thick hair.  It&#x27;s really good and paraben free.</li>
            <li> Our 15 month old has super fine, staticky hair, and I bought this hoping use would help tame her crazy winter hair. It smells great (she likes to sniff the air when I&#x27;m applying it), and it does seem to be helping some, but she definitely still has some &amp;#34;flyaways&amp;#34;. (We&#x27;ve been using for a week so far). Overall I think this is helping though - her hair hasn&#x27;t been nearly as staticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thin conditioner that didn&#x27;t do much for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. The grape scent kind of stinks too. We are going back to the thicker strawberry conditioner that you buy for cheap at any drugstore (also on Amazon.)</li>
            <li> my kid&#x27;s hair feels very silky and healthy after this conditioner, and she swims twice per week. Just hope that they offer more scents to choose from: the current grape one is OK but a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love that it doesn&#x27;t burn the kids eyes. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Works great for my daughter&#x27;s hair. Makes it so much easier to comb through after her showers and makes her hair softer.</li>
            <li> My 2 year-old son has very curly hair, hence is it prone to drying, especially with fun in the sun and pool.  This conditions his hair beautifully and leaves it silky smooth.  Strangers stop me to compliment his beautiful hair; I believe that&#x27;s largely a gift from God, but this conditioner helps too.</li>
            <li> Smells great and acctually does a great job on my tangled litlle girl&#x27;s hair and makes hair silky and shinny after drying.&lt;br /&gt;I get a free shipping on my Amazon Prime so no time wasted looking for it in stores.</li>
            <li> Perfect for kids.  My daughter loves it, and it helps with the tangles.</li>
            <li> Works great for my girls very affordable and well worth it</li>
            <li> My daughter love the scent. It is useful and make her hair very shinny and smoothly. I will come back to buy more</li>
            <li> I use both the shampoo and the conditioner from L&#x27;Oreal Kids and are very happy with the results. My daughter is 6 years old and has long, soft hair. Especially after a day at the pool, when her hair (a dark blond color normally) would turn green and stiff, the conditioner works wonders and restores the shine and softness to her hair. We do use a good (large) amount though, to ensure the desired results (no tangles!).</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing, and makes your hair soft. I&#x27;m an adult, and I use with the grape conditioner. It lathers nicely, cleans well, and leaves a light scent on your hair for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> They do not sell this brand of conditioner/shampoo where I live, but my cousins from CA had some during their recent visit. I love this product. Most kid shampoos claim to be 2 in 1, but that is never the case. My 5 year old has a tender head, so this conditioner is a must. It smells great and makes combing through hair a breeze.</li>
            <li> The first time my kid used the conditioner she was taking a cool bath and the conditioner seemed ok, not pleasant, but it didn&#x27;t stink. After that she used it in the warm shower and the smell was nasty. I noticed that if the shower was hot it seemed to smell even worse. L&#x27;Oreal I&#x27;m not sure who put together this scent, approved it, and marketed it to the public, because it smells nasty! And looking through all the reviews I&#x27;m not the only one who notices this! Yuck!</li>
            <li> I have been using the conditioner on my daughter&#x27;s hair for about 2.5 weeks and her hair smells great, but the ends still get pretty tangled. It is better than when she didn&#x27;t have the conditioner, but her ends still feel very dry. I am planning to give her ends a hair cut and continue using the conditioner. Will update on the progress or lack of at a later date...</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells delicious and does a great job taming my children&#x27;s hair. My children have wavy thin hair and the conditioner does not weigh it down. The bottle does not contain much product and we run out quickly, which is why I did not give it a five-star rating.</li>
            <li> I buy this to use on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair. It works great. A little bit goes a long way and makes brushing her hair after bath time and in the mornings so much easier. Takes out all the knots that children so easily get. It smells like grape too, which she loves. She hasn&#x27;t ever complained about it hurting her eyes or anything.</li>
            <li> Great tear free conditioner for my little girl.</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner for children&#x27;s hair.  My three daughters each have different hair, ranging from thing and straight to thick and curly.  This condition serves each well, without weighing the hair down.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the L&#x27;Oreal shampoo/conditioner.  The shampoo/Conditioner worked well.  My 4 y/o daughter&#x27;s hair was easy to comb but the conditioner didn&#x27;t make it any easier to comb.</li>
            <li> my 3yo has very fine hair that got very dried out after a few days in the pool.  this made hair washing day bearable, as she no longer screamed at all the tangles! Great product...she loved the grape smell too.</li>
            <li> I always need a conditioner after shampoo my hair. This one is more cheaper but, way better than the D*ve for my hair!</li>
            <li> Love this! My one and a half year old loves the bottle and helping me put it in her hair and we both love the smell! It takes me back to when I was little and used the same shampoo/conditioner. It leaves her hair nice and soft</li>
            <li> A surprsingly nice conditioner!  I got this for a couple of dollars on sale and it does a very nice job of keeping my dry, coarse, thick hair smooth and shiny.  I also adore the fake grape scent- it reminds me of the grape bubblegum of my youth.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get the tangles out like needed for my daughters hair--smells good though!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but it definitely does not moisturize or penetrate the hair as much as the Suave kid&#x27;s products. I&#x27;ll only buy this again as back up if I can&#x27;t find Suave.</li>
            <li> works great - no tangles and smells great, our two year old loves it..... the ingredients arent the safest according to ewg but leaves her hair silky smooth and easy to brush</li>
            <li> This really makes my granddaughter&#x27;s hair easier to comb and I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it in her eyes.  She likes it too because of the silly bottle.  I don&#x27;t love the grape fragrance but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li> All my kids has curly/wavy hair, so their hair gets tangle very easy. This stuff helps get rid of the tangles. I love it. Smells great to :) My daughter loves the fact the bottle looks like a fish.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little over the top for adults, but my kids like it.  Helps keep my 2 year old&#x27;s fine, curly hair in order.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t the best but it does condition hair good</li>
            <li> While it does do a fine job conditioning my children&#x27;s hair, the scent is so foul I had to rewash their hair the next day. The grape scent alone was noxious but after their hair dried it had a body odor or stinky sock smell. My kids are 3 and 4 years old, there is no reason for them to smell that way!! Pass!</li>
            <li> I love it and everyone who uses it when bathing their child at my house asks where I got it. Really helps with brushing, great price too.</li>
