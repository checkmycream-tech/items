            <li>Maybe I’m breaking the ladies code by using a men’s product (and the scent is pretty manly) but whatever, this is my favorite spray gel that I’ve used and it works really good on keeping my curls without making me crunchy (just use sparingly with a curl cream)</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff...</li>
            <li>Also this particular Crew product has a very nice fragrance which I could not find in the &amp;#34;firm hold&amp;#34; of this product.</li>
            <li>For me it worked best on dry hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Might be good in a pinch if you don&#x27;t have much time to style your hair and spray a lot of it on your hair.</li>
            <li>Allows easy application  without all the sticky fingers.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t hold fine hair at all.  </li>
            <li>The bottle I received was exactly what I was looking for and at a much better price that I have been able to find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic without being strong.</li>

            <li>High winds will no longer be a problem for you, Mr. Looking-Professional-All-The-Time-Man, so take a load off, and know that everybody is looking at you, and wishing they had your hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too many pumps or it will get stiff.</li>
            <li>Results  in a very natural look and feel.  </li>
            <li>Not sticky like hairspray, leaves hair soft and movable but in place.</li>
            <li>It provides a soft hold for hair and allows for proper styling.</li>

            <li> This is not a heavy product, but gives my hair just enough body to give it that little pick me up....kudos</li>
            <li> I normally have to wet down my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using just a few quick squirts seems to work just as well if not better than using a lot.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I find that the spray is easier to use, and gives me same style hold that regurlar gel does, with less effort.</li>
            <li> Hair still appeared very dry</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> No real hold.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and was having trouble finding it in our local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to firm hold and this medium hold is a big difference.  </li>
            <li> Lasts Longer than Any Other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Break its spirit and douse it with American Crew Spray Gel, and worry no more if your hair it out of place.</li>
            <li> and I have not found any other product that is works as well.  </li>
            <li> If you have longer hair check out Jack Black Sleek Finish Texture Cream with Olive and Rosemary.</li>
            <li> If you use on wet hair use no more than two.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot to get less than half the hold of firm hold.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m in a hurry and need to go a few sprays</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect it like the firm hold gel.</li>
            <li> I have been buying it every few months for over a year.</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair stiff as it is a &amp;#34;medium hold&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> While moderately expensive and difficult to find in retail stores, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It will leave your hair looking wet if you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> We have frizzy, thick hair</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;medium hold&amp;#34; is very hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I have wavy very thick hair with curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray since my hair began to thin (about 15 years).  </li>
            <li> They smell really bad to me.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> I hate hairsprays...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold my hair well. Just made it sticky and flaked later in the day. Hair still appeared very dry</li>
            <li> This is not a heavy product, but gives my hair just enough body to give it that little pick me up....kudos</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t hold fine hair at all.  Agreed there is no film created or residue but what&#x27;s the point if it doesn&#x27;t hold?</li>
            <li> I find that the spray is easier to use, and gives me same style hold that regurlar gel does, with less effort.</li>
            <li> it keeps my hair place initially and through the day with a water touch up keeps it neat.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m in a hurry and need to go a few sprays and I&#x27;m good to go. I normally have to wet down my hair apply the gel. This is great if you need something quick.. It is a medium hold so don&#x27;t expect it like the firm hold gel.</li>
            <li> Eh, not what I wanted. I got other Crew products that I really liked. Went for cheap Axe gel after this one and am very happy with those.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have been buying it every few months for over a year. Having been through a number of different hair gels and mousse, this is by far the best balance of cost and quality for what I need.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray gel through Amazon and saved a lot of money.  Regular retail of this product can be for times the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray since my hair began to thin (about 15 years).  It works great with no order.  I save about 40% by ordering from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I would have given this a five star rating had it not been for the spray nozzle that does not form into a spray pattern but almost into a stream pattern when the nozzle is suppressed.</li>
            <li> My hubby got hooked on this at the shop where he was getting his hair cut and the last few times he&#x27;s wanted more we haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally. Very please with the product and the delivery.</li>
            <li> This is amazing gel for active guys. I love to just be able to spray my hair and style and go and it holds my style all day. I love the shine it adds to my hair as well. The smell is fantastic without being strong. I will be using this product for a long time. I love the entire Crew line. Great products.</li>
            <li> I hate hairsprays...the smell, the aerosol spray that gets all over everything. This product keeps my hair from getting messed up at work and doesn&#x27;t have all those negatives. I find it&#x27;s exactly what I need. I bought 2 bottles...</li>
            <li> You use it like hair spray.  Results  in a very natural look and feel.  You (or someone else) can run your fingers through your hair.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I really love this spray gel (and I’m a girl) Maybe I’m breaking the ladies code by using a men’s product (and the scent is pretty manly) but whatever, this is my favorite spray gel that I’ve used and it works really good on keeping my curls without making me crunchy (just use sparingly with a curl cream) deal with it, I’m using your stuff boys!</li>
            <li> One of The Best Spray Gel&#x27;s By far, Not Perfumy And Holds very Strong, Lasts Longer than Any Other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a long time. Works great.</li>
            <li> Got this for the hubby….. he loves this stuff…. good price online….</li>
            <li> I like it. Don&#x27;t use too many pumps or it will get stiff. I didn&#x27;t like it on wet hair. For me it worked best on dry hair. If you use on wet hair use no more than two. It gives a good hold! I have wavy very thick hair with curls.</li>
            <li> keeps my husband in style</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift from my Uncle who no longer needs hair care products. Skeptical at first, I have grown very fond of it.  Medium hold does a great job of holding my hair in place without looking wet, or leaving residue on your hands after touching it.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love Love this product. My hair dresser recommend me to use even though it is for men. Even my daughter has started using it for her hair.  We have frizzy, thick hair and this keeps it tamed.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It provides a soft hold for hair and allows for proper styling.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these to try and it works great</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was exactly what I was looking for and at a much better price that I have been able to find it anywhere else. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> No real hold. Doesn&#x27;t really seem to do much. Haven&#x27;t really touched it after the handful of times I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely prefer the American Crew fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might be good in a pinch if you don&#x27;t have much time to style your hair and spray a lot of it on your hair.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff... Works as described. If you have longer hair check out Jack Black Sleek Finish Texture Cream with Olive and Rosemary.</li>
            <li> The gel holds my hair in place all day and it is not sticky.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t being sold here locally anymore, I don&#x27;t know why. It is my honey&#x27;s fav man hair tamer. It is exactly what he had gotten in the past, and I was glad to get it online for him.</li>
            <li> Good stuff at great price</li>
            <li> Great product I will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> I really like this hair product. It does not make my hair stiff as it is a &amp;#34;medium hold&amp;#34;. Also this particular Crew product has a very nice fragrance which I could not find in the &amp;#34;firm hold&amp;#34; of this product. The &amp;#34;medium hold&amp;#34; is very hard to find in stores so I was very happy to find it here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> My hair looks awesome.</li>
            <li> Buy this if you want a heavier spray gel. It will leave your hair looking wet if you have thin hair. If you want a lighter gel that doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; then I recommend  going with the Crew &amp;#34;grooming spray&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair in place without making my hair feel sticky.  One tip: less is more.  I&#x27;ve found that using just a few quick squirts seems to work just as well if not better than using a lot.</li>
            <li> Great quality product @ a super price! Fast shipping and well packaged!</li>
            <li> While moderately expensive and difficult to find in retail stores, it is worth it. Cheaper products have caused rashes on the scalp. Great holding power in a spray gel.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS HAIR PRODUCT ABSOLUTELY!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and have no plans to change. The only problem is finding a store that carries the product but Amazon solves that.</li>
            <li> Do you have hair that just won&#x27;t hold form, no matter how many times you brush it, or tell it nice things? Break its spirit and douse it with American Crew Spray Gel, and worry no more if your hair it out of place. High winds will no longer be a problem for you, Mr. Looking-Professional-All-The-Time-Man, so take a load off, and know that everybody is looking at you, and wishing they had your hair.</li>
            <li> Holds through all weather.</li>
            <li> Great product on my hair</li>
            <li> Item arrived earlier than promised and it is as advertised</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband, but I use it the most.  It&#x27;s not just for men in my opinion.  It really helps set the curls with the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and was having trouble finding it in our local stores.Great product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to firm hold and this medium hold is a big difference.  It takes a lot to get less than half the hold of firm hold.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of crew products. They smell really bad to me. The gels and the sprays just smell funky. Not into it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this spray gel for several years now and I have not found any other product that is works as well.  Not sticky like hairspray, leaves hair soft and movable but in place.</li>
            <li> Great form of gel.  Spray is the innovation here.  Allows easy application  without all the sticky fingers.  Spray to appropriate level of coverage/hold and brush in.  Reignite the hold/look with a bit of water later in day.  Nice outcome with every application.</li>
            <li> Great product just right not to stiff and decent hold...</li>
