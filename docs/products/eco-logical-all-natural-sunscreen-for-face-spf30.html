    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with the quality of this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This product was named as one of the best.</li>
            <li>These are the best, but could not get them on Amazon or in the USA.    </li>
            <li>Superb!</li>
            <li>Great purchase!</li>
            <li>and you do have to re-apply but very good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen works great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan and will be a happy customer for many years to come!  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m guessing that it is fairly long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen works fairly well.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure it would work great.</li>
            <li>Most items good or ok.</li>
            <li>very* easy to rub in</li>
            <li>I still have a tube from Dr. Hauschka from pre-2009 and it was the most amazing product ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have them add a safe ingredient with a nice smell that would cover up this chemical-type smell.</li>
            <li>I have tried and reviewed many sunscreens and can honestly say that this is definitely my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is the best physical sunscreen I have found.  </li>
            <li>I hope I will be able to get it all out when I get to the end.</li>
            <li>To echo another reviewer, Eco packages the 1.8 oz in a tube that could hold much much more without any danger of bursting.</li>
            <li>As many did, I purchased this product after researching safe sunscreens and wasn&#x27;t pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked at the EWG guidelines and most that they recommend are $$$.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed that this sunscreen didn&#x27;t leave a white cast on my face.</li>
            <li>I am sensitized to most sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands of sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>, it is one of the best natural and animal friendly sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I could put makeup over it easily.</li>
            <li>But currently, there just isn&#x27;t a good, safe sunscreen that is cosmetically elegant.  </li>
            <li>would HIGHLY recommend trying those, which are just as safe and effective.</li>
            <li>I also must remark that the tube looks nice and large, and deceptive at that, as contents is in USA seems to go weight NOT VOLUME, hehe.</li>
            <li>Good if you are looking for a natural alternative.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a natural way to block the suns harmful ways this is good.</li>
            <li>It might be environmentally friendly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to Kiss My Face although the safety ratings aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use it daily as I&#x27;d rather have something with moisturizer in it, but it&#x27;s good for the pool.</li>
            <li>other safe sunscreens, this one applies on purely WHITE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product, I have found better alternatives such as THINKbaby and TruKid (both of which smell great and apply on easily).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>eco was effective but white on the skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is a very positive development in the sun block arena.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen recently after trying to be more environmental friendly and also looking for a more natural product.  </li>
            <li>A good smooth application that I can use prior to my make up application but no such luck.</li>
            <li>and I rate it very highly!</li>
            <li>There are many zinc oxide sunscreens, but this is the only one I have found that is non greasy, non drying and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li>and I found it with Eco logical face sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Since it is a physical blocker, you&#x27;ll need to reapply frequently but for this is a great sun block if you too are allergic to the chemicals in nearly all sunscreens on the market.</li>
            <li>Kept us from burning, but felt uncomfortably hot on the skin.</li>
            <li>But I really like it!</li>
            <li>Most of the Environment Working Group&#x27;s recommended sunscreens leave a white film on the skin.  </li>
            <li>so I was pretty psyched to have found this product.  </li>
            <li>We used blue lizard which is good but turns your skin ghostly white.  </li>
            <li>but you have to blend it in, which is easy to do unlike blue lizard or badger.</li>
            <li>and this really does work</li>
            <li>1.8 oz isn&#x27;t much.  </li>
            <li>Makes me very suspicious to feel something heating up my face - and not stopping to do so for hours on end.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and not greasy.</li>
            <li>, only FULL of goodness and value for money.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad enough to make me gag or anything.</li>
            <li>I used to use the main bran dsunscreens but they are loaded with junk and garbage you cannot pronounce.</li>
            <li>As the claim to no cast (non-whitening) is one of the main reasons I purchased this, I am quite disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eco Logical is fantastic when used sparingly on the face, helps block harmful UV rays and makes my face look less oily.  </li>
            <li>I bought it since it was highly rated on the website for sunscreen safety.  </li>
            <li>[...] I see  a thread mentioning the EU forced them to kill their amazing sunscreen products</li>
            <li>this rubbed in clear!</li>
            <li>Felt sort of hot and tingly till we scrubbed it off some hours later when we got home.    </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s a pretty big flaw.</li>
            <li>It does have a pretty gross smell.</li>
            <li>I had to use it on my shoulders one day, and they were a little toasty by the time I got inside, but my face has always been fine.</li>
            <li>Burn out clear and disappears.</li>
            <li>The texture is so light and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy and cloggy, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>We always purchased natural sunscreen products from Weleda and Dr. Hauschka line, when we lived in Europe.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have much of a heavy feeling to it.</li>
            <li>If they added fragrance it wouldn&#x27;t be as natural</li>
            <li>The sunscreen texture somehow seem to be separated or old?</li>
            <li>I contacted the company about the small amount of product that is in this large tube and they are working on their next batch and the tubes will be smaller but contain more product.  </li>
            <li>I used several resources to find a suitable everyday use facial sunblock.</li>
            <li>I ordered this with really high hopes of finally getting a sunscreen that was going to be all natural and work for me.  </li>
            <li>My only concern is that the 1.8 oz comes in a pretty big tube.</li>
            <li>Same size as the American Eco Logical</li>
            <li>[likely as part of their fight against natural producers in order to help the big drug companies reduce competition].</li>
            <li>It is rated very highly on the Environmental Working Group website and is one of the few sunscreens that I feel confidant wearing as my daily protection on my face, neck and chest.</li>

            <li> It is rated very highly on the Environmental Working Group website and is one of the few sunscreens that I feel confidant wearing as my daily protection on my face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li> suncreens(almost EVERYTHING they sell in store)so options are few and far between for her.</li>
            <li> This one rates well on their page and is far less expensive than most of the other brands they mention while also meeting my other criteria.</li>
            <li> They must have fixed the packaging because mine didn&#x27;t seem half empty like others mentioned.</li>
            <li> My main complaint with this sunscreen is that it smells.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It does create a slight white cast but not very noticable.&lt;br /&gt;1.8 oz by weight is not very much so ordering my second tube.</li>
            <li> (feels good going on, doesn&#x27;t leave much white residue), but the smell is terrible.</li>
            <li> The product is not wonderful but not bad but the smell when first applying really stinks.  </li>
            <li> It is free of bad chemicals</li>
            <li> I did find that this sunscreen is not as bad as some others in terms of the white cast, but I wonder if, because of the small amount in the tube, one will be inclined to put less on and not get the full protection?</li>
            <li> It leaves a white cast on your face, it is not smooth and very hard to spread it evenly.  </li>
            <li> It does have an unpleasant odor when you first apply but it dissipates.</li>
            <li> However, after a few minutes you don&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice any pale cast, and it&#x27;s *</li>
            <li> So there&#x27;s very little in there for the price they charge.    </li>
            <li> I want to look past that, but I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product was a major failure for me.</li>
            <li> I know that unnecessary perfumes aren&#x27;t natural but this sun screen has an unpleasant smell to it.  </li>
            <li> The bottle arrived a bit dirty, with the cap not fully closing no matter how I pushed down to close it, it wouldn&#x27;t snap shut.</li>
            <li> texture was very thick and chunky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am about Kelly Rowlands complexion, and though i used this sparingly, it left a horrible cast on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not water proof and that is not the worst, but immediately after applying it on our faces, my daughter and I felt like we had a sunburn.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best physical sunscreen I have found.  There are many zinc oxide sunscreens, but this is the only one I have found that is non greasy, non drying and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a non nano particle/large particle zinc sunscreen and I found it with Eco logical face sunscreen. It is not whitening, not greasy, and a non pore clogging sun screen. I wear it every day. It is free of bad chemicals and I rate it very highly! My only concern is that the 1.8 oz comes in a pretty big tube. I hope I will be able to get it all out when I get to the end.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, but despite the company&#x27;s claims, it DOES leave a white residue, both an all-over pallor as well as cake-y bits of white.  On the plus side, it&#x27;s unscented, which means there is the slightest ingredient odor which dissipates almost immediately.  And from the effort it takes to get the product off, I&#x27;m guessing that it is fairly long-lasting.  But currently, there just isn&#x27;t a good, safe sunscreen that is cosmetically elegant.  I will probably use ECO, but if I&#x27;m going anywhere but my yard, I&#x27;ll use a sunhat.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the quality of this sunscreen.  The texture is so light and fluffy.  I will definitely re-order when I run out, it is one of the best natural and animal friendly sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen recently after trying to be more environmental friendly and also looking for a more natural product.  I don&#x27;t think that the tube was open when i purchased it however after only using it twice it seems like there isn&#x27;t that much left.  My main complaint with this sunscreen is that it smells.  I know that unnecessary perfumes aren&#x27;t natural but this sun screen has an unpleasant smell to it.  I just can&#x27;t bear to put it on my face.  It might be environmentally friendly but i don&#x27;t think i can handle the smell.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and cloggy, I have sensitive skin and this really does work and you do have to re-apply but very good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is allergic to your standard chemical suncreens(almost EVERYTHING they sell in store)so options are few and far between for her. We used blue lizard which is good but turns your skin ghostly white.  Eco Logical is fantastic when used sparingly on the face, helps block harmful UV rays and makes my face look less oily.  Since it is a physical blocker, you&#x27;ll need to reapply frequently but for this is a great sun block if you too are allergic to the chemicals in nearly all sunscreens on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought it since it was highly rated on the website for sunscreen safety.  The product is not wonderful but not bad but the smell when first applying really stinks.  Smell goes away after application, then you smell it here and there throughout the day.  I&#x27;m going back to Kiss My Face although the safety ratings aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> To echo another reviewer, Eco packages the 1.8 oz in a tube that could hold much much more without any danger of bursting. I can&#x27;t help but suspect deceptive packaging. 1.8 oz isn&#x27;t much.  I did find that this sunscreen is not as bad as some others in terms of the white cast, but I wonder if, because of the small amount in the tube, one will be inclined to put less on and not get the full protection?</li>
            <li> As many did, I purchased this product after researching safe sunscreens and wasn&#x27;t pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture was very thick and chunky.&lt;br /&gt;The smell wasn&#x27;t pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Like other safe sunscreens, this one applies on purely WHITE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product, I have found better alternatives such as THINKbaby and TruKid (both of which smell great and apply on easily).&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend trying those, which are just as safe and effective.</li>
            <li> I used several resources to find a suitable everyday use facial sunblock. This product was named as one of the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not water proof and that is not the worst, but immediately after applying it on our faces, my daughter and I felt like we had a sunburn. Felt sort of hot and tingly till we scrubbed it off some hours later when we got home.    Kept us from burning, but felt uncomfortably hot on the skin. I never had such a sensation from a sun screen.  We always purchased natural sunscreen products from Weleda and Dr. Hauschka line, when we lived in Europe. These are the best, but could not get them on Amazon or in the USA.    Makes me very suspicious to feel something heating up my face - and not stopping to do so for hours on end. I worried what was in there and got rid of the thing.    I also must remark that the tube looks nice and large, and deceptive at that, as contents is in USA seems to go weight NOT VOLUME, hehe. So there&#x27;s very little in there for the price they charge.    I still have a tube from Dr. Hauschka from pre-2009 and it was the most amazing product ever. Same size as the American Eco Logical, only FULL of goodness and value for money.    BTW, [...] I see  a thread mentioning the EU forced them to kill their amazing sunscreen products [likely as part of their fight against natural producers in order to help the big drug companies reduce competition].</li>
            <li> This product is as described, but the smell could be improved. Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have much of a heavy feeling to it. Good if you are looking for a natural alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of different sunscreens.  i aim to avoid toxic ingredients and want something that works, stays on, doesn&#x27;t sting, isn&#x27;t greasy, etc.  This sunscreen fits the bill!  I&#x27;ve looked at the EWG guidelines and most that they recommend are $$$.  This one rates well on their page and is far less expensive than most of the other brands they mention while also meeting my other criteria. I&#x27;m a fan and will be a happy customer for many years to come!  [...]</li>
            <li> The sunscreen works fairly well. I had to use it on my shoulders one day, and they were a little toasty by the time I got inside, but my face has always been fine. It&#x27;s also not very water resistant, so reapply frequently. I won&#x27;t use it daily as I&#x27;d rather have something with moisturizer in it, but it&#x27;s good for the pool. I haven&#x27;t notice any pale cast, and it&#x27;s *very* easy to rub in compared to others I&#x27;ve tried. I could put makeup over it easily.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works great (feels good going on, doesn&#x27;t leave much white residue), but the smell is terrible. I want to look past that, but I just can&#x27;t. It has been sitting in my makeup bag, unused, for about 6 months now. I think that&#x27;s a pretty big flaw. I&#x27;d rather have them add a safe ingredient with a nice smell that would cover up this chemical-type smell.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural way to block the suns harmful ways this is good. I used to use the main bran dsunscreens but they are loaded with junk and garbage you cannot pronounce. This stuff is a very positive development in the sun block arena.</li>
            <li> I have tried and reviewed many sunscreens and can honestly say that this is definitely my favorite.  It works well with my skin, does not leave a white cast and is not greasy at all.  It is rated very highly on the Environmental Working Group website and is one of the few sunscreens that I feel confidant wearing as my daily protection on my face, neck and chest. I contacted the company about the small amount of product that is in this large tube and they are working on their next batch and the tubes will be smaller but contain more product.  Superb!</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried purchasing this product, as it had mixed reviews. But I really like it! They must have fixed the packaging because mine didn&#x27;t seem half empty like others mentioned. I was impressed that this sunscreen didn&#x27;t leave a white cast on my face. I&#x27;m biracial with tan skin and this rubbed in clear! It&#x27;s very lightweight and not greasy. I haven&#x27;t worn under my make-up because my make-up has SPF already. But I&#x27;m sure it would work great. It does have a pretty gross smell. However, after a few minutes you don&#x27;t smell it. It&#x27;s not bad enough to make me gag or anything. If they added fragrance it wouldn&#x27;t be as natural I guess... Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I am about Kelly Rowlands complexion, and though i used this sparingly, it left a horrible cast on me. As the claim to no cast (non-whitening) is one of the main reasons I purchased this, I am quite disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It also made me oily and I suspect, though I only used this for a couple of days, it may have clogged my pores as I got a couple of spots.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product was a major failure for me. I ordered this with really high hopes of finally getting a sunscreen that was going to be all natural and work for me.  A good smooth application that I can use prior to my make up application but no such luck. Wasted my money.  The bottle arrived a bit dirty, with the cap not fully closing no matter how I pushed down to close it, it wouldn&#x27;t snap shut. The sunscreen texture somehow seem to be separated or old? Is it suppose to be like this? I have no idea.  The expiration date showed it had 7 months til expiration.  It leaves a white cast on your face, it is not smooth and very hard to spread it evenly.  I looked like I had white residue plastered on my face afterwards.</li>
            <li> Most items good or ok. eco was effective but white on the skin. Burn out clear and disappears. Books all what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I am sensitized to most sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;I can use this one without a problem&lt;br /&gt;It does create a slight white cast but not very noticable.&lt;br /&gt;1.8 oz by weight is not very much so ordering my second tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of sunscreens.  Most of the Environment Working Group&#x27;s recommended sunscreens leave a white film on the skin.  This was my big issue so I was pretty psyched to have found this product.  It does not make your skin look like a Geisha, if you blend it in properly.  It goes on white but you have to blend it in, which is easy to do unlike blue lizard or badger. It does have an unpleasant odor when you first apply but it dissipates.</li>
