            <li>I have been using this for years, it is good for every skin problem plus I am now using it as a lip balm and diaper rash cream.</li>
            <li>To make it easier to use, I let it cool a bit(refrigerator works best to avoid graininess) and whip it up with some avocado oil and jojoba oil.</li>

            <li>but if they&#x27;ve shorted me two out of two times, there is no telling how many times they&#x27;ve cheated others who didn&#x27;t think to weigh it when they received it.</li>

            <li>Smooth and easy to work with</li>
            <li>I am in Costa Rica so your part to Miami was fine.</li>
            <li>I used a ladle to stir and remove it and found a BLACK FLY!   </li>
            <li>Hoping the rest of my batch is fine.  </li>
            <li>The folks at Smell Good are also very professional.</li>
            <li>It whips up so light and fluffly and mixes great with aloe vera gel, carrier oils, and any essential oils you can think of.  </li>
            <li>While I was happy with the product, I ordered 10 lbs, but only received 8.66 lbs.  </li>

            <li>Since I started using it my skin is silky smooth</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it in my beauty products.  </li>
            <li>and I actually enjoy the earthy smell it has.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; my child will let me apply to his skin, GREAT product.</li>
            <li>Perfectly smooth, not grainy.</li>
            <li>This came as yellowish not white shea; still very nice.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quite clean, free of debris, and without mold</li>
            <li>I will order more for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so very much</li>
            <li>Super cheap price.</li>
            <li>I purchase this butter and when it came it did have to be clean.</li>
            <li>After I clean the Shea butter by straining it through some cheese cloth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth in texture, very moisturizing, and truly top quality.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get any more pure than this.</li>
            <li>There is no way of really knowing if this is indeed \\&quot;TOP</li>
            <li>This is true shea butter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick but rubbing between your palms melts it and it feels so wonderful on the skin.</li>
            <li>Within 1 business day, Smell Good resolved the matter by contacting my local post office and obtaining the information I needed to pick up my package.</li>
            <li>Smell Good replied with the same information and eased my mind.</li>
            <li>It was pretty easy to filter</li>
            <li>in love and will definitely be ordering more</li>
            <li>What more can I say other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>yes a bold statement</li>
            <li>It also arrived super quick...and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and very easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised that is is very easy to work with.</li>
            <li>It is truly pure, raw, and perfect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered shea butter from this company a few times now and it is beautiful to work with provided you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>scent is not as strong as most of the shea butter I&#x27;ve encountered, and there is virtually no debris in the butter, so it&#x27;s quite possible that some customers will not need to strain the melted butter.  </li>
            <li>shea butter however feels amazing, I used it straight out of the bag, no foul odor, was very soft and creamy feeling and soaked</li>
            <li>Love love love so much for little money</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, thanks for the quality unadulterated product.</li>
            <li>Fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pleasant nutty scent.&lt;br /&gt;Creamy and fresh.</li>
            <li>I started making my own oils/lotions/shampoos as a result and started ordering from a different company.  </li>
            <li>This product has been great for my young one with severe eczema and multiple allergies.</li>
            <li>I habitually make my own skin/hair care  products and have had to add extra oils to my routine without this product.</li>
            <li>I just made a fresh batch of body butter for my husband, son and I</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this product.it really does help to soften my skin and really helps the bottom of my feet</li>
            <li>If only he were honest in his advertising.</li>
            <li>came as described ,fresh  and seem to keep well</li>
            <li>but the fact that it comes 3x faster is worth it to me</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It is worth the cost compared to buying from sellers who are out mainly for HUGE profit.</li>
            <li>and I did find a couple of ants in it, but other than that it was all good.</li>
            <li>Weight right was right on 9.994lbs.</li>
            <li>( I still grabbed some right out of the box to moisturize my hands and heels)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to do much cleaning with this, it came really clean.</li>
            <li>Beautiful nutty smell, Hard butter that melted with body heat.</li>
            <li>also used it to make a whipped body butter, and it is the best whipped body butter I have made yet, the shea butters I have used in the past were garbage compared to this shea butter, and I spent 3 times more on those other brands, this company, this product and this price are beyond amazing.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is fresh, soft, smooth, and was not grainy at all.</li>
            <li>This shea butter was super high quality!</li>
            <li>The Shea Butter is soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Very very reasonable price too.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much, Smellgood.  </li>
            <li>this was exactly what I needed and it was priced very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Weighing in at very close to 10 pounds, the brick of [[ASIN:B008LEQENE Raw Unrefined Ivory Shea Butter TOP GRADE Ghana]] which I received (Prime Shipping option) is indeed a good value and the consistency is quite soft and malleable.  </li>
            <li>I returned it and was so much happier wjth this one!</li>
            <li>Will be back to buy more.</li>
            <li>this was the first time ordering 10lbs.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend them!!</li>
            <li>I am absolutely LIVID!</li>
            <li>I use this with my african soap, my skin is so soft , healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>It really does heal cuts and scrapes!</li>
            <li>This is my first time to buy Shea butter</li>
            <li>so far all of the things I have made from lip balm, hand creme to soap have been fabulous.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more from this seller.</li>
            <li>Ok, enough of my ranting, try it for yourself and you&#x27;ll see!!</li>
            <li>you get exactly what you ask for.</li>
            <li>Most definitely will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what the vendor says it was.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of this product from the vendor, and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with both the consistency and low odor.  </li>
            <li>Reading the reviews, my first instincts was to inspect the product.</li>
            <li>Well, we were not sorry one bit.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what was described.</li>
            <li>I for the first time bought shea in bulk.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping!</li>
            <li>When it came the first thing I did was weigh the package and it came in at 10.8 lbs with packaging.</li>
            <li>but as I am currently pregnant I will be experimenting with whipping oils into my Shea butter mainly coconut, castor, glycerin and aloe vera gel to see.</li>
            <li>I also like that it comes in a block that has been cut into smaller pieces so its a bit more manageable to work with.</li>
            <li>Arrives much quicker than stated!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using the Ivory Shea butter</li>
            <li>That I missed it all this time is beyond me - probably because the smaller batches at $10/lb are what you see more.</li>
            <li>but it is equally important to do business with a professional company.</li>
            <li>but it is equally important to do business with a professional company.</li>
            <li>my shoes and purses and favorite coat will be next.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the 10 lbs package quite some time ago, filtered it exactly according to instructions, and used it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave this 5 stars because this is the first time I have gotten shea butter and</li>
            <li>I just take a bit, rub it between my fingers a few seconds, and then apply it to whatever I want to make beautiful and soft...</li>
            <li>butter\\&quot; (which is really kpangnan butter) and the price was right.</li>
            <li>right in leaving my skin feeling VERY</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the process of making my own brand of lotion and this with 3 other butter do</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and what a LARGE amount for this price!</li>
            <li>When I used it to make the body butter, wow, it was very creamy and smooth to touch.  </li>
            <li>but it was so light, my essential oils blended right in.  </li>
            <li>I filtered for the first time and my shea butter turned out very grainy.</li>
            <li>The quality of this was not as good as usual.</li>
            <li>It was clean soft, plentyful, and ready to use.</li>
            <li>They ship quickly and professionally.  </li>
            <li>My order shipped very quickly after purchase and I am currently ordering another batch.</li>
            <li>far I like it very much and will come back to this seller when I want more.</li>
            <li>It arrived in 2 large 5lb Blocks.</li>
            <li>After doing weeks and weeks of research on how to purchase Shea butter, what to look for and why not to buy if it looks a certain way</li>
            <li>I had a few coworkers smell it and the best description I got was the smell of wood floors that have just been waxed and I think that is pretty dead on.  </li>
            <li>My stretch marks have become significantly lighter and you can barely see them.  </li>
            <li>being this is raw no other preservatives, works great.</li>
            <li>The white unrefined was fine</li>
            <li>We were a little reluctant to buy so much at once, but it was such a great deal.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t really noticeable)</li>
            <li>They are fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too...</li>
            <li>Thanks to all the reviews I knew what to expect.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use as much with Shea Butter from smellgood.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have much to filter out.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted 20 to 30lbs just to have my inventory together and</li>
            <li>I have not use much of it</li>
            <li>It whips really well for my body butters and hair creams.</li>
            <li>She mixes castor oil with this in our kitchen aid commercial grade mixer, and whips it to an airy, smooth texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her</li>
            <li>It is SOO much</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This Shea butter is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for having this product to ship.  </li>
            <li>fast.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I should have thrown it away but used it anyway, much to my regret.</li>
            <li>I have really nothing to compare it to, mine came in chunks and in just a plastic bag.  </li>
            <li>you can really smell the shea butter.</li>
            <li>feels very silky.</li>
            <li>i make aromatherapy body butters and hair creams with this and they are selling fast.</li>
            <li>I had been buying the $5 yellow butter from my local hair store, but I wanted to start making my own hair and body products.</li>
            <li>I immediately contacted Smell Good and complained.</li>
            <li>I use it to make body butter, but I actually think it&#x27;s more phenomenal just used raw, as is.</li>
            <li>I found it to be easier to work with and better quality than other wholesalers products I have bought online.</li>
            <li>This product was better than expected!</li>
            <li>This Raw Organic Unrefined Shea Butter is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product around 2013 and ran out a few months ago after daily use and much sharing (regrettably for free :)).</li>
            <li>It is the white shea butter which I prefer, and was a full 10 lbs</li>
            <li>It comes packaged in a plastic bag, but if it keeps the cost down, I will surely deal with the packaging, as I&#x27;m going to just take it out &amp; use anyway.</li>
            <li>I will order more times in the future, I am talking about this same item.  </li>
            <li>Warm it up slow and gentle then run it through a strainer/cheese cloth.  </li>
            <li>The sheabutter was ivory pale in color, very smooth, crumbled easily but not too loose, no mold or plant leaves/debris, none of this at all.</li>
            <li>It was very soft and melted in my hands after rubbing it gently.</li>
            <li>Its high quality, low priced, &amp; ships quickly.</li>
            <li>I found that in warmer climates or during periods of high temperatures the product may become grainy.</li>
            <li>I wish I could show a picture if the contents of the box, but it was mostly one large block of shea butter, with some smaller pieces loose in the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Raw unrefined ivory shea butter top grade Ghana... works very well for the purposes intended.</li>
            <li>and it was so SOFT!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a little more</li>
            <li>I noticed weird particle which are uncommon.  </li>
            <li>The color is ivory with a grey tint, rather than leaning more towards the yellow color which I tend to see in retail stores.  </li>
            <li>You may find some particles in the butter, but that&#x27;s normal -</li>
            <li>There may be a smoky aroma to shea butter, but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>: Line your sieve/bowl with cheesecloth as paper towels are more absorbent which means wasted product.</li>
            <li>Not hardly any debrie in it at all.  </li>
            <li>Just removed and opened  my new  unrefined pack from the fridge  and melted just 9 oz  which I needed for soaping.  </li>
            <li>This is top grade bulk raw unrefined Shea butter.  </li>
            <li>have used soooo many products nothing can come close to raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>It is indeed 100 % Top Grade Raw Unrefined Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>right hopefully i get the clean ivory shea i usually get .i</li>
            <li>MORE, SAVE MORE: Since I was purchasing 3 items - white and yellow butters and black soap, I purchased directly from their site where the shipping cost was not fixed.</li>
            <li>My regret was not placing a larger order the first time.</li>
            <li>It gradually embedded white waxy stains in most of my dark clothes.</li>
            <li>what I got came quickly and was everything I expected.  </li>
            <li>This butter has a pleasant nutty smell, it&#x27;s soft - not hard to break down, in fact I can take a small piece and rub it in my hands and it dissolves.  </li>
            <li>Ten pounds is way more than i thought i would need so this will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li>I turned it over, cut open the 10 lbs into 5 separate large pieces.</li>
            <li>I love this product,my whole family uses it.and mothers please stop using johson products filled with petrol and artificial fragrance.i have been using raw shea since I was pregnant and on my new born and up to now.</li>
            <li>Luckily there are other people in the world who are looking to make money</li>
            <li>Such a nice quality, not too hard, not too soft.  </li>
            <li>The problem was to clear customs in CR, but it happened.</li>
            <li>the pot I melt it in was clear of water.</li>
            <li>Mine came in two clear plastic bags the product was also cubed that were sealed with tape and a company logo sticker on each.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be clear, the debris are just parts of the Shea nut that wasn&#x27;t removed.</li>
            <li>far you have done me</li>
            <li>thank you, so far from a 5time buyer also</li>
            <li>Also has cleared up my child&#x27;s eczema completely.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and even applying Eucerin starts a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this seller to the natural hair groups I&#x27;m in on FB.</li>
            <li>but they said it probably Melted Wow in route.</li>
            <li>jaw dropped open when she saw how much I&#x27;d purchased for her...</li>
            <li>instead it got soft and waxy-sticky.</li>
            <li>Since I had 10lbs of the stuff, I did not care too much, but I used a cheesecloth the second time around.</li>
            <li>The natural smell of Shea butter can be a bit offensive for some, though the aroma vanishes once it has been applied to your skin within minutes.</li>
            <li>To my amazement, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the product when I received it.</li>
            <li>oh so soft.</li>
            <li>This looks and smells like a natural product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as quality</li>
            <li>My only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t take my fragerance oil very well.</li>
            <li>But oh my goodness my skin feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>And it leaves my daughters hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Your hair isn’t weighed down; but instead, full of body and life.</li>
            <li>Love the natural fragrant smell when it mixed in with other essential oil.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m so pleased with them I also placed an order for 10 lbs of black soap too!!!  </li>
            <li>My next order will be much larger than my first.</li>
            <li>This was my first order with Amazon and will definitely be shopping with you in the future.</li>
            <li>My products have a nice, even, creamy texture that I just couldn&#x27;t obtain using other brands of Raw Shea.  </li>
            <li>Slices like a rich butter has a very slight smell of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected, have just finished melting and stringing through cheese cloth.  </li>
            <li>The brick was one large piece with a hole in it and a tiny additional piece, likely added to bring it close to 10 pounds.  </li>
            <li>They say it is unfiltered, but for 2 lbs worth, i got less than 1/8 tsp of debris/bark etc.</li>
            <li>has lasted me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Besides the little things you find in it (easily strained out)</li>
            <li>I normally purchase Shea butter from a different site at $7/lb for 10lbs - much cheaper than I had seen at other places - until I found this batch on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It looks clean with the occasional spec of something dark, presumably shell or bark, just what you might expect from an unrefined product, but nothing gritty in - just like butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is contained in a heavyweight clear plastic bag which had been sealed, but it was definitely not airtight when shipped from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed the scar on my oldest daughter&#x27;s leg is barely visible and her acne scars are all gone.  </li>
            <li>I use it to mix with essential oils as a hair product since i am natural.</li>
            <li>My order came much quicker than expected and it was exacly what I viewed in the image.  </li>
            <li>The package arrived during the allotted time listed and actually came a day early.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this purchase for daily use on skin and natural hair.</li>
            <li>Apparently, he had gotten a shipping label, but had not yet mailed it.</li>
            <li>You can also try using all natural oils such as Peppermint, Lemon, Etc.</li>
            <li>I also feel this product was much newer than what I purchased from my other source.</li>
            <li>You may find some fibers or bark in it because it&#x27;s fresh and raw but no worry, just melt and strain it through cheese cloth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty inexpensive for the amount, last FOREVER, and is the smoothest creamiest raw Shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>Another time I noticed a gritty texture and thought Smell Good had sent me a bad batch of Shea.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for years, it is good for every skin problem plus I am now using it as a lip balm and diaper rash cream.</li>
            <li> To make it easier to use, I let it cool a bit(refrigerator works best to avoid graininess) and whip it up with some avocado oil and jojoba oil.</li>

            <li> I really, really, really love this product.</li>
            <li> but if they&#x27;ve shorted me two out of two times, there is no telling how many times they&#x27;ve cheated others who didn&#x27;t think to weigh it when they received it.</li>
            <li> I will be sure to order again when its finished.</li>
            <li> I love this sheabutter.</li>

            <li> Good quality, pure.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is fine and smooth and wonderful to use, but it is not the creamy white shown in the photo.</li>
            <li> Love it and enjoy sharing it with friends and family.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order after reading some of the reviews - so far as this is my first order with Smellgood, I am very happy that I gave them a try and will be putting in another order soon!</li>
            <li> Even better than that, when I opened the box it was a beautiful off white color</li>
            <li> I did absolutely no processing whatsoever to this butter, because it is perfect just the way it is.  </li>
            <li> I loved it, high quality!</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is a nice ivory shade , has a fresh shea scent and the texture is creamy.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good product</li>
            <li> I am going to get a bathtub full of this and bask in it all day!</li>
            <li> Lush, moisturizing, smells wonderful, high quality!</li>
            <li> no problems with getting what I ordered and VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> Very clean and rich Shea Butter with a beautiful white color.</li>
            <li> Made several batches of soap and turned out beautifully.</li>
            <li> Hands down best amount, quality and performance of any skin product.</li>
            <li> Smooth and easy to work with</li>
            <li> I am in Costa Rica so your part to Miami was fine.</li>
            <li> I used a ladle to stir and remove it and found a BLACK FLY!   </li>
            <li> Hoping the rest of my batch is fine.  </li>
            <li> The folks at Smell Good are also very professional.</li>
            <li> It whips up so light and fluffly and mixes great with aloe vera gel, carrier oils, and any essential oils you can think of.  </li>
            <li> While I was happy with the product, I ordered 10 lbs, but only received 8.66 lbs.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it my skin is silky smooth</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it in my beauty products.  </li>
            <li> and I actually enjoy the earthy smell it has.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; my child will let me apply to his skin, GREAT product.</li>
            <li> Perfectly smooth, not grainy.</li>
            <li> This came as yellowish not white shea; still very nice.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quite clean, free of debris, and without mold</li>
            <li> I will order more for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so very much</li>
            <li> Super cheap price.</li>
            <li> I purchase this butter and when it came it did have to be clean.</li>
            <li> After I clean the Shea butter by straining it through some cheese cloth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth in texture, very moisturizing, and truly top quality.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get any more pure than this.</li>
            <li> There is no way of really knowing if this is indeed \\&quot;TOP</li>
            <li> This is true shea butter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but rubbing between your palms melts it and it feels so wonderful on the skin.</li>
            <li> Within 1 business day, Smell Good resolved the matter by contacting my local post office and obtaining the information I needed to pick up my package.</li>
            <li> Smell Good replied with the same information and eased my mind.</li>
            <li> It was pretty easy to filter</li>
            <li> in love and will definitely be ordering more</li>
            <li> What more can I say other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> yes a bold statement</li>
            <li> It also arrived super quick...and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and very easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised that is is very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> It is truly pure, raw, and perfect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered shea butter from this company a few times now and it is beautiful to work with provided you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> scent is not as strong as most of the shea butter I&#x27;ve encountered, and there is virtually no debris in the butter, so it&#x27;s quite possible that some customers will not need to strain the melted butter.  </li>
            <li> shea butter however feels amazing, I used it straight out of the bag, no foul odor, was very soft and creamy feeling and soaked</li>
            <li> Love love love so much for little money</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, thanks for the quality unadulterated product.</li>
            <li> Fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pleasant nutty scent.&lt;br /&gt;Creamy and fresh.</li>
            <li> I started making my own oils/lotions/shampoos as a result and started ordering from a different company.  </li>
            <li> This product has been great for my young one with severe eczema and multiple allergies.</li>
            <li> I habitually make my own skin/hair care  products and have had to add extra oils to my routine without this product.</li>
            <li> I just made a fresh batch of body butter for my husband, son and I</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this product.it really does help to soften my skin and really helps the bottom of my feet</li>
            <li> If only he were honest in his advertising.</li>
            <li> came as described ,fresh  and seem to keep well</li>
            <li> but the fact that it comes 3x faster is worth it to me</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It is worth the cost compared to buying from sellers who are out mainly for HUGE profit.</li>
            <li> and I did find a couple of ants in it, but other than that it was all good.</li>
            <li> Weight right was right on 9.994lbs.</li>
            <li> ( I still grabbed some right out of the box to moisturize my hands and heels)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to do much cleaning with this, it came really clean.</li>
            <li> Beautiful nutty smell, Hard butter that melted with body heat.</li>
            <li> also used it to make a whipped body butter, and it is the best whipped body butter I have made yet, the shea butters I have used in the past were garbage compared to this shea butter, and I spent 3 times more on those other brands, this company, this product and this price are beyond amazing.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is fresh, soft, smooth, and was not grainy at all.</li>
            <li> This shea butter was super high quality!</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Very very reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much, Smellgood.  </li>
            <li> this was exactly what I needed and it was priced very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Weighing in at very close to 10 pounds, the brick of [[ASIN:B008LEQENE Raw Unrefined Ivory Shea Butter TOP GRADE Ghana]] which I received (Prime Shipping option) is indeed a good value and the consistency is quite soft and malleable.  </li>
            <li> I returned it and was so much happier wjth this one!</li>
            <li> Will be back to buy more.</li>
            <li> this was the first time ordering 10lbs.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend them!!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely LIVID!</li>
            <li> I use this with my african soap, my skin is so soft , healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> It really does heal cuts and scrapes!</li>
            <li> This is my first time to buy Shea butter</li>
            <li> so far all of the things I have made from lip balm, hand creme to soap have been fabulous.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Ok, enough of my ranting, try it for yourself and you&#x27;ll see!!</li>
            <li> you get exactly what you ask for.</li>
            <li> Most definitely will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what the vendor says it was.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product from the vendor, and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with both the consistency and low odor.  </li>
            <li> Reading the reviews, my first instincts was to inspect the product.</li>
            <li> Well, we were not sorry one bit.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> I for the first time bought shea in bulk.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping!</li>
            <li> When it came the first thing I did was weigh the package and it came in at 10.8 lbs with packaging.</li>
            <li> but as I am currently pregnant I will be experimenting with whipping oils into my Shea butter mainly coconut, castor, glycerin and aloe vera gel to see.</li>
            <li> I also like that it comes in a block that has been cut into smaller pieces so its a bit more manageable to work with.</li>
            <li> Arrives much quicker than stated!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the Ivory Shea butter</li>
            <li> That I missed it all this time is beyond me - probably because the smaller batches at $10/lb are what you see more.</li>
            <li> but it is equally important to do business with a professional company.</li>
            <li> but it is equally important to do business with a professional company.</li>
            <li> my shoes and purses and favorite coat will be next.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the 10 lbs package quite some time ago, filtered it exactly according to instructions, and used it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because this is the first time I have gotten shea butter and</li>
            <li> I just take a bit, rub it between my fingers a few seconds, and then apply it to whatever I want to make beautiful and soft...</li>
            <li> butter\\&quot; (which is really kpangnan butter) and the price was right.</li>
            <li> right in leaving my skin feeling VERY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of making my own brand of lotion and this with 3 other butter do</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and what a LARGE amount for this price!</li>
            <li> When I used it to make the body butter, wow, it was very creamy and smooth to touch.  </li>
            <li> but it was so light, my essential oils blended right in.  </li>
            <li> I filtered for the first time and my shea butter turned out very grainy.</li>
            <li> The quality of this was not as good as usual.</li>
            <li> It was clean soft, plentyful, and ready to use.</li>
            <li> They ship quickly and professionally.  </li>
            <li> My order shipped very quickly after purchase and I am currently ordering another batch.</li>
            <li> far I like it very much and will come back to this seller when I want more.</li>
            <li> It arrived in 2 large 5lb Blocks.</li>
            <li> After doing weeks and weeks of research on how to purchase Shea butter, what to look for and why not to buy if it looks a certain way</li>
            <li> I had a few coworkers smell it and the best description I got was the smell of wood floors that have just been waxed and I think that is pretty dead on.  </li>
            <li> My stretch marks have become significantly lighter and you can barely see them.  </li>
            <li> being this is raw no other preservatives, works great.</li>
            <li> The white unrefined was fine</li>
            <li> We were a little reluctant to buy so much at once, but it was such a great deal.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t really noticeable)</li>
            <li> They are fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too...</li>
            <li> Thanks to all the reviews I knew what to expect.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use as much with Shea Butter from smellgood.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have much to filter out.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted 20 to 30lbs just to have my inventory together and</li>
            <li> I have not use much of it</li>
            <li> It whips really well for my body butters and hair creams.</li>
            <li> She mixes castor oil with this in our kitchen aid commercial grade mixer, and whips it to an airy, smooth texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her</li>
            <li> It is SOO much</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for having this product to ship.  </li>
            <li> fast.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I should have thrown it away but used it anyway, much to my regret.</li>
            <li> I have really nothing to compare it to, mine came in chunks and in just a plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> you can really smell the shea butter.</li>
            <li> feels very silky.</li>
            <li> i make aromatherapy body butters and hair creams with this and they are selling fast.</li>
            <li> I had been buying the $5 yellow butter from my local hair store, but I wanted to start making my own hair and body products.</li>
            <li> I immediately contacted Smell Good and complained.</li>
            <li> I use it to make body butter, but I actually think it&#x27;s more phenomenal just used raw, as is.</li>
            <li> I found it to be easier to work with and better quality than other wholesalers products I have bought online.</li>
            <li> This product was better than expected!</li>
            <li> This Raw Organic Unrefined Shea Butter is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product around 2013 and ran out a few months ago after daily use and much sharing (regrettably for free :)).</li>
            <li> It is the white shea butter which I prefer, and was a full 10 lbs</li>
            <li> It comes packaged in a plastic bag, but if it keeps the cost down, I will surely deal with the packaging, as I&#x27;m going to just take it out &amp; use anyway.</li>
            <li> I will order more times in the future, I am talking about this same item.  </li>
            <li> Warm it up slow and gentle then run it through a strainer/cheese cloth.  </li>
            <li> The sheabutter was ivory pale in color, very smooth, crumbled easily but not too loose, no mold or plant leaves/debris, none of this at all.</li>
            <li> It was very soft and melted in my hands after rubbing it gently.</li>
            <li> Its high quality, low priced, &amp; ships quickly.</li>
            <li> I found that in warmer climates or during periods of high temperatures the product may become grainy.</li>
            <li> I wish I could show a picture if the contents of the box, but it was mostly one large block of shea butter, with some smaller pieces loose in the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Raw unrefined ivory shea butter top grade Ghana... works very well for the purposes intended.</li>
            <li> and it was so SOFT!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a little more</li>
            <li> I noticed weird particle which are uncommon.  </li>
            <li> The color is ivory with a grey tint, rather than leaning more towards the yellow color which I tend to see in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> You may find some particles in the butter, but that&#x27;s normal -</li>
            <li> There may be a smoky aroma to shea butter, but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> : Line your sieve/bowl with cheesecloth as paper towels are more absorbent which means wasted product.</li>
            <li> Not hardly any debrie in it at all.  </li>
            <li> Just removed and opened  my new  unrefined pack from the fridge  and melted just 9 oz  which I needed for soaping.  </li>
            <li> This is top grade bulk raw unrefined Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> have used soooo many products nothing can come close to raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> It is indeed 100 % Top Grade Raw Unrefined Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> right hopefully i get the clean ivory shea i usually get .i</li>
            <li> MORE, SAVE MORE: Since I was purchasing 3 items - white and yellow butters and black soap, I purchased directly from their site where the shipping cost was not fixed.</li>
            <li> My regret was not placing a larger order the first time.</li>
            <li> It gradually embedded white waxy stains in most of my dark clothes.</li>
            <li> what I got came quickly and was everything I expected.  </li>
            <li> This butter has a pleasant nutty smell, it&#x27;s soft - not hard to break down, in fact I can take a small piece and rub it in my hands and it dissolves.  </li>
            <li> Ten pounds is way more than i thought i would need so this will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I turned it over, cut open the 10 lbs into 5 separate large pieces.</li>
            <li> I love this product,my whole family uses it.and mothers please stop using johson products filled with petrol and artificial fragrance.i have been using raw shea since I was pregnant and on my new born and up to now.</li>
            <li> Luckily there are other people in the world who are looking to make money</li>
            <li> Such a nice quality, not too hard, not too soft.  </li>
            <li> The problem was to clear customs in CR, but it happened.</li>
            <li> the pot I melt it in was clear of water.</li>
            <li> Mine came in two clear plastic bags the product was also cubed that were sealed with tape and a company logo sticker on each.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be clear, the debris are just parts of the Shea nut that wasn&#x27;t removed.</li>
            <li> far you have done me</li>
            <li> thank you, so far from a 5time buyer also</li>
            <li> Also has cleared up my child&#x27;s eczema completely.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and even applying Eucerin starts a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this seller to the natural hair groups I&#x27;m in on FB.</li>
            <li> but they said it probably Melted Wow in route.</li>
            <li> jaw dropped open when she saw how much I&#x27;d purchased for her...</li>
            <li> instead it got soft and waxy-sticky.</li>
            <li> Since I had 10lbs of the stuff, I did not care too much, but I used a cheesecloth the second time around.</li>
            <li> The natural smell of Shea butter can be a bit offensive for some, though the aroma vanishes once it has been applied to your skin within minutes.</li>
            <li> To my amazement, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the product when I received it.</li>
            <li> oh so soft.</li>
            <li> This looks and smells like a natural product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as quality</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t take my fragerance oil very well.</li>
            <li> But oh my goodness my skin feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> And it leaves my daughters hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Your hair isn’t weighed down; but instead, full of body and life.</li>
            <li> Love the natural fragrant smell when it mixed in with other essential oil.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m so pleased with them I also placed an order for 10 lbs of black soap too!!!  </li>
            <li> My next order will be much larger than my first.</li>
            <li> This was my first order with Amazon and will definitely be shopping with you in the future.</li>
            <li> My products have a nice, even, creamy texture that I just couldn&#x27;t obtain using other brands of Raw Shea.  </li>
            <li> Slices like a rich butter has a very slight smell of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, have just finished melting and stringing through cheese cloth.  </li>
            <li> The brick was one large piece with a hole in it and a tiny additional piece, likely added to bring it close to 10 pounds.  </li>
            <li> They say it is unfiltered, but for 2 lbs worth, i got less than 1/8 tsp of debris/bark etc.</li>
            <li> has lasted me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Besides the little things you find in it (easily strained out)</li>
            <li> I normally purchase Shea butter from a different site at $7/lb for 10lbs - much cheaper than I had seen at other places - until I found this batch on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It looks clean with the occasional spec of something dark, presumably shell or bark, just what you might expect from an unrefined product, but nothing gritty in - just like butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is contained in a heavyweight clear plastic bag which had been sealed, but it was definitely not airtight when shipped from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed the scar on my oldest daughter&#x27;s leg is barely visible and her acne scars are all gone.  </li>
            <li> I use it to mix with essential oils as a hair product since i am natural.</li>
            <li> My order came much quicker than expected and it was exacly what I viewed in the image.  </li>
            <li> The package arrived during the allotted time listed and actually came a day early.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this purchase for daily use on skin and natural hair.</li>
            <li> Apparently, he had gotten a shipping label, but had not yet mailed it.</li>
            <li> You can also try using all natural oils such as Peppermint, Lemon, Etc.</li>
            <li> I also feel this product was much newer than what I purchased from my other source.</li>
            <li> You may find some fibers or bark in it because it&#x27;s fresh and raw but no worry, just melt and strain it through cheese cloth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty inexpensive for the amount, last FOREVER, and is the smoothest creamiest raw Shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Another time I noticed a gritty texture and thought Smell Good had sent me a bad batch of Shea.</li>
            <li> Lots of things found in the butter once melted down which can be normal but can also product a issue.</li>
            <li> My wife asked for *some* raw shea butter, so after looking around for a couple days, I settled on this large quantity.  </li>
            <li> It is not a strong oder by any means, you really need to get your face up to it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s packaged inside a large sealed bag - and you can see small pieces of what appear to be tree bark and shells off the pods the Shea Butter is extracted from.  </li>
            <li> So I pretty much waisted $32 of my small shops limited funds :/...</li>
            <li> first, from what I can tell I think this Shea butter has been cut with something like beeswax or maybe even petroleum (two common things some distributors do to stretch their stock</li>
            <li> It came in a sealed plastic bag in a medium flat rate box, no leaking.</li>
            <li> I bought 10 lbs, which will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> You needed to cut pieces off with a large, very sharp knife, and then it just made a mess.  </li>
            <li> Only tried one small batch of my 10 pounds so far.</li>
            <li> You may notice minor particles - these are the shell of the shea nut.</li>
            <li> smell was very unpleasant, even after finely filtering it, and I&#x27;ve used pure shea butter for years, so I know and like the standard earthy shea smell.</li>
            <li> I never have to wait to long!</li>
            <li> It blends well with other essential oils I use.</li>
            <li> Other brands required me to use mass amounts of essential oils to try to obtain the texture I get with this Shea</li>
            <li> With this Shea, I use very minimal amounts of essential oils to obtain the creamy texture I desire for my products.</li>
            <li> I use this every single day.</li>
            <li> and they sent me the standard yellow Shea Butter that stinks to high heaven!!!</li>
            <li> Very little straining needed after melting to clear out any undissolved particles.</li>
            <li> She makes her own skin products as her skin reacts badly to alcohol and other preservatives.  </li>
            <li> Most shea leaves an unpleasant odor in the finished product, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I have been melting it down and whipping it with other oils (coconut usually) and some aloe straight from the plant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen what looks to be stems, actual fruit flies/gnats, along with brown and black particles throughout.</li>
            <li> My only feedback is that it slightly grainy compared to the refined stuff I am used to, that may just be the nature of the product though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t add any oils typically the entire time I used this</li>
            <li> A little effort on my part has saved me a GIANT amount of money.  </li>
            <li> You can add a little essential oil to it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal as it has hastened the healing time of a few cuts I clumsily caused on myself.</li>
            <li> second, I read that is is common to find parts of the outer or inner shell in the butter</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected from it&#x27;s unrefined state.</li>
            <li> Product  is what I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> Will require minimal refining if at all.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected since it&#x27;s unrefined.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m experimenting with minimally warming it and whipping it, adding coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product for roughly 2 years...</li>
            <li> I have been doing a lot of reading online about roughly determining the quality of shea butter based on a number of qualities/tell-tale signs...</li>
            <li> The plastic bag is sealed, and I am not going to open it until I receive missing 2lb.</li>
            <li> My shea butter was packaged and boxed up about what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> and it never really hit the mark.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t mind having to melt it down to get the shell pieces out of it,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not an expert but based on what I see and have read this is not pure Shea butter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying again, and I&#x27;d like to know what other products they sell.</li>
            <li> Not sure if insects are attracted to the smell of unrefined she in the heat of the summer,  but from now on I will double strain my butters.</li>
            <li> I received my butter faster than I expected!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be looking for other sources for my needs.</li>
            <li> the other stuff melted and was oily like it should be, this stuff was waxy and didn&#x27;t melt into an oil like it should have with my body temperature...</li>
            <li> I have look online &amp; at other sellers &amp; purchased elsewhere, but I will now continue to purchase from this vender.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> that my other batch.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> - there was a little of that earthy smell that is characteristic of Shea Butter</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this vendors raw shea butters!</li>
            <li> I ordered black soap the other day</li>
            <li> I can not live without raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> Ten pounds is a lot of Shea butter, and it lasts at room temperature for at least 1.5 years.  </li>
            <li> To tone down the smell, I added some of my boyajian orange oil -</li>
            <li> I have to strain it once I melt it down.</li>
            <li> I ordered some from other people on here and it had little beads abd stuff in ut and the weight was a pound off on 5.</li>
            <li> I held a little of this in one hand and a little of the other stuff in my other hand...</li>
            <li> I mean, I guess it serves it&#x27;s purpose, but I think the next time, I&#x27;ll just buy the body butter already made, instead of making it myself.  </li>
            <li> It was extremely greasy and messy.  </li>
            <li> Because of that I&#x27;m actually saving money - everyone knows how expensive essential oils are</li>
            <li> Nothing was wrong with my yellow butter, it just wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the review who got less than 10lbs, and I weighed mine.</li>
            <li> slightly over 10lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also needed black soap that I planned to mix it with shea butter because black soap is a little too drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do have to strain it a little to remove debris</li>
            <li> I pass a little of it out to my clients who have skin ptoblems.</li>
            <li> Weighed a little over 10 pounds.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous ordering this after reading some of the reviews in regards to the product quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands in the past and this one is Number 1 on my list.</li>
            <li> I use it from my hair down to my toes!  </li>
            <li> They contacted me about it and said they were shocked because they were never short, much less short by a lb and offered to send me the other lb.</li>
            <li> Has a grainy texture with a few bits of shell (within a 10lb block</li>
            <li> Just a few particles in butter</li>
            <li> this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time.</li>
            <li> so they do err on the heavy side which is always nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was filthy,arrived in black garbage bags inside the boxes and muddy all throughout!</li>
            <li> but when I filtered it through a cheese cloth I found what looks like dirt and some small black chunks (coals?)</li>
            <li> We have been sharing with friends &amp; family; it is just what an active Texas guy needs to feel well cared for after a hard day&#x27;s work; hands and feet need it all year round; just wear socks to bed.</li>
            <li> Yes it has an odor about it, but not a strong one.</li>
            <li> This was a massive quantity and it came in a big lump, which was very difficult to break apart.  </li>
            <li> and it is not too hard to melt down and filter.</li>
            <li> But there were a few rat/mouse droppings in the packaging, not sure about ordering again.</li>
            <li> Truly raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Raw shea butter has to be tempered and filtered if you&#x27;re going to use it in things like soaps and lotions.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I took a leap of faith and ordered 10 lbs of the raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I ordered shea butter in the past and never filtered it.</li>
            <li> It does what I need it to for soaps, but like the cleaner quality I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> Usually you won&#x27;t though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to find a small cosmetic jar</li>
            <li> I contacted them once because my package took longer than usual to arrive.</li>
            <li> then I usually have to.</li>
            <li> I thought to myself, &amp;#34;how hard can it be to make this myself&amp;#34;??  </li>
            <li> The product was gritty, awkward smelling, and never smoothened out.</li>
            <li> This made my tired skin glowing in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I recently applied this butter to a very badly infected cat-scratch before retiring one night, and awoke next morning with no infection.  </li>
            <li> they MEAN it&#x27;s unrefined.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bought raw shea butter from others, and had an occasional small stick and some grit, but this was ridiculously filthy.</li>
            <li> Dollar per pound, I&#x27;ve not found anything less expensive without sacrificing quality and purity.  </li>
            <li> , I have ordered shea butter in the past from another company and it smelled awful, felt sticky instead of creamy and was very oily on the skin and didn&#x27;t absorb</li>
            <li> it was pretty hysterical to see her reaction, but</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy shea butter online again, because my first experience was horrible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust or like to do business with someone who makes false advertising claims so</li>
            <li> Buy your Shea Butter here you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> I tried melting &amp; straining it, but a smack to my skeptical self, there was no sediment what so ever.</li>
            <li> I cut through the plastic to inspect further and I&#x27;m disgusted with the all the filth that&#x27;s melted/mashed into the shea butter.</li>
            <li> I admit that I was skeptical about ordering this.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was skeptical when I saw the Shea Butter claims from smellgood.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the other company&#x27;s level of service - often</li>
            <li> Product was cut with some other type of oil and was sticky and had an awful chemical smell.</li>
            <li> and Im extremely disappointed because I can&#x27;t use it in any of my all-natural products.</li>
            <li> This is my base for my lotions and body butters that I make.</li>
            <li> not the crap you see all over the place.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just NASTY!  </li>
            <li> I then ordered the 10 lb, and it was awful.</li>
            <li> Oh and the smell of the shea butter itself is utterly disgusting.  </li>

            <li> Great product. Truly raw Shea butter. Whips and melts well. Will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> While I was happy with the product, I ordered 10 lbs, but only received 8.66 lbs.  If you can over look being cheated, then place your order.</li>
            <li> I will order more times in the future, I am talking about this same item.  The best quality and value</li>
            <li> Perfect for my soaps and lotions</li>
            <li> Great product but, I ordered the ivory butter but I received the yellow. I ordered shea butter in the past and never filtered it. I filtered for the first time and my shea butter turned out very grainy.</li>
            <li> Need I say more? if you&#x27;re looking for shea butter look no further. This is the Best unrefined Shea Butter! Right out of the bag GREAT! I&#x27;ll be buying again, and I&#x27;d like to know what other products they sell. Buy your Shea Butter here you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> Lots of things found in the butter once melted down which can be normal but can also product a issue.</li>
            <li> Very good quality Shea butter. Love the feel and texture. Very very reasonable price too. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love the Shea Butter and have made many lotions and creams with it!  Just love the product!</li>
            <li> smell good ive ordered from you a lot .so far you have done me right hopefully i get the clean ivory shea i usually get .i hope it weighs out too . thank you, so far from a 5time buyer also your cocoa butter was tops #1 we love it. hope to see the same grat product arrive.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! Great quality and I highly recommend it for your skin!</li>
            <li> This is my base for my lotions and body butters that I make. Because it&#x27;s unrefined you do have to strain out the bits of shell from the shea nut after you melt it.</li>
            <li> It does not get any better than this.  This smells great and beautiful texture.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> Quality product that works beautifully for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This shea butter is fresh, soft, smooth, and was not grainy at all. You do have to strain it a little to remove debris and I did find a couple of ants in it, but other than that it was all good. It was shipped and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Has a grainy texture with a few bits of shell (within a 10lb block it isn&#x27;t really noticeable) but that is to be expected from it&#x27;s unrefined state. This stuff is the real deal as it has hastened the healing time of a few cuts I clumsily caused on myself. Also has cleared up my child&#x27;s eczema completely. I won&#x27;t ever use a corporate label lotion again. You can&#x27;t get any more pure than this.</li>
            <li> Weighing in at very close to 10 pounds, the brick of [[ASIN:B008LEQENE Raw Unrefined Ivory Shea Butter TOP GRADE Ghana]] which I received (Prime Shipping option) is indeed a good value and the consistency is quite soft and malleable.  It is contained in a heavyweight clear plastic bag which had been sealed, but it was definitely not airtight when shipped from Amazon.  The brick was one large piece with a hole in it and a tiny additional piece, likely added to bring it close to 10 pounds.  There is no production date or best by date on the plastic bag, just the Amazon stock label which does not identify the product as originating from Smellgood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not as strong as most of the shea butter I&#x27;ve encountered, and there is virtually no debris in the butter, so it&#x27;s quite possible that some customers will not need to strain the melted butter.  The color is ivory with a grey tint, rather than leaning more towards the yellow color which I tend to see in retail stores.  I&#x27;ve prepared a batch of whipped body butter using this shea butter as the majority of butters and the end result was very, very nice, so I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wrapped and packaged the remainder of the unused brick to keep it fresher.  There is no way of really knowing if this is indeed \\&quot;TOP GRADE\\&quot; as advertised and labeled, but I&#x27;m very happy to use this because of the affordability, cleanliness, and lack of indication that it&#x27;s old or rancid.  It is not gritty.  I would purchase this again and that says a lot.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Love the natural fragrant smell when it mixed in with other essential oil.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!! I will buy this again again. This Shea butter was wonderful. Very silky and great smell.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this company. They are fast and efficient. I received my order sooner than the estimated delivery time. Product  is what I expected it to be.  And works well for what I wanted it for. Just an FYI I&#x27;m using this product to make lotion for the community and Shut-in as well as women shelters.  The women&#x27;s ministry department at our church is doing this.  Love to serve others.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Best quality. Fresh. Was only off by 2 oz on the weight of 10 pounds. Super cheap price. I use this every single day. I loove it. I will order more when I run out. I ordered some from other people on here and it had little beads abd stuff in ut and the weight was a pound off on 5. I returned it and was so much happier wjth this one!</li>
            <li> Came sealed in double plastic, Weight right was right on 9.994lbs. Very smooth and creamy. Will require minimal refining if at all. Best price anywhere. Shipping was very fast. SmellGood has my return business</li>
            <li> I used the product for my body and hair.  I loved it, high quality! Very easy to rub in and not grainy what so ever. Just a few particles in butter but that&#x27;s to be expected since it&#x27;s unrefined.</li>
            <li> Hi Guys,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this product and you will trash every cream you have. I have sensitive skin, and even applying Eucerin starts a burning sensation. I tried Shea butter, was skeptical about the quality, before I ordered, but I am so so glad i tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is amazing. I tried melting &amp; straining it, but a smack to my skeptical self, there was no sediment what so ever. try another chuck and again, no sediment. Thereafter, the butter had won me, and I started whipping. The whipped butter is awesome, I do add some coconut oil, some jajoba oil and some almond oil to it, and the results are reliable. Butter that your skin would gulp and reply with radiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, thanks for the quality unadulterated product. Love it and enjoy sharing it with friends and family. Will be back to buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered shea butter from this company a few times now and it is beautiful to work with provided you know what you&#x27;re doing. Raw shea butter has to be tempered and filtered if you&#x27;re going to use it in things like soaps and lotions. I&#x27;ve done that with all of my orders and the results are out of this world! Fast shipping too... I never have to wait to long!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this vendors raw shea butters! I&#x27;ve ordered several times from smellgood  this was the first time ordering 10lbs. It came in a sealed plastic bag in a medium flat rate box, no leaking. The Shea Butter is a nice ivory shade , has a fresh shea scent and the texture is creamy. The pricing is great and the vendor was fast at answering any questions I had when contacting them !! I HIGHLY recommend them!! I won&#x27;t order my shea butters from anyone else :) !!!</li>
            <li> Great product, received on time, great price.  Thank you.  Will definitely be ordering again</li>
            <li> The quality of this was not as good as usual. It does what I need it to for soaps, but like the cleaner quality I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> most pleased will do again when needed</li>
            <li> I am absolutely LIVID! I just opened up the shipping box and I immediately see all kinds of particles throughout the shea butter through the plastic wrapping. I cut through the plastic to inspect further and I&#x27;m disgusted with the all the filth that&#x27;s melted/mashed into the shea butter. I&#x27;ve seen what looks to be stems, actual fruit flies/gnats, along with brown and black particles throughout. I can&#x27;t believe that someone would even attempt to sell something in this manner!</li>
            <li> This product was filthy,arrived in black garbage bags inside the boxes and muddy all throughout! I have bought raw shea butter from others, and had an occasional small stick and some grit, but this was ridiculously filthy. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!</li>
            <li> I loved it....price was great....product was great...way more than I expected!!&lt;br /&gt;I kn now where I will keep buying!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank u so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maryann</li>
            <li> I love this Shea Butter!&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant nutty scent.&lt;br /&gt;Creamy and fresh. Melts on contact.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love and will definitely be ordering more soon!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Smooth and easy to work with</li>
            <li> Lush, moisturizing, smells wonderful, high quality! What more can I say other than that I love it! This is really very nice Shea butter. It makes the best lotions and bath bombs! You may find some fibers or bark in it because it&#x27;s fresh and raw but no worry, just melt and strain it through cheese cloth.</li>
            <li> This is great for the skin. I use this with my african soap, my skin is so soft , healthy and smooth. I pass a little of it out to my clients who have skin ptoblems. Now they are hooked on it.</li>
            <li> I love it! Thanks to all the reviews I knew what to expect. I&#x27;m experimenting with minimally warming it and whipping it, adding coconut oil. Only tried one small batch of my 10 pounds so far. It really does heal cuts and scrapes! Delivered very quickly compared to the estimated date!</li>
            <li> Just received my order of 10# Ivory unrefined Shea butter and I am very pleased with the quality of this product! I was hesitant to order after reading some of the reviews - so far as this is my first order with Smellgood, I am very happy that I gave them a try and will be putting in another order soon! Doing the happy dance :) - Patti @ Cabin Fever Soaps &amp; Essentials LLC</li>
            <li> This is my first time to buy Shea butter so I don&#x27;t know what this is supposed to smell like but I had to add a lot of cocoa butter and essential oils to this to cover up the smell.  The price was great and it does make your skin feel great.</li>
            <li> it is a lot good pure sheabutter :)</li>
            <li> I whip shea butter for my skin and hair. My supplier for 4 years has stopped selling in bulk so I was ecstatic to find this supplier. The product arrived quite clean, free of debris, and without mold (like I had from a supplier on another site). I haven&#x27;t whipped it up yet but I don&#x27;t foresee any problems. I&#x27;ve recommended this seller to the natural hair groups I&#x27;m in on FB.</li>
            <li> Top of the line product</li>
            <li> Raw unrefined ivory shea butter top grade Ghana... works very well for the purposes intended. This vendor sold a great product.</li>
            <li> I admit that I was skeptical about ordering this. I am pleasantly surprised that is is very easy to work with. It is worth the cost compared to buying from sellers who are out mainly for HUGE profit. This particular shea butter is of great quality. I found it to be easier to work with and better quality than other wholesalers products I have bought online. I definitely will be buying again when I need the shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have zero complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> so far all of the things I have made from lip balm, hand creme to soap have been fabulous.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. Will purchase again. I makes wonderful whipped body cream. Scented or unscented!!! It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am in Costa Rica so your part to Miami was fine. The problem was to clear customs in CR, but it happened.</li>
            <li> Just removed and opened  my new  unrefined pack from the fridge  and melted just 9 oz  which I needed for soaping.  I noticed weird particle which are uncommon.  I used a ladle to stir and remove it and found a BLACK FLY!   fully formed with all this  debris in my butter.  Not sure if insects are attracted to the smell of unrefined she in the heat of the summer,  but from now on I will double strain my butters. The white unrefined was fine I had zero issues.  Hoping the rest of my batch is fine.  I ordered the  duo 5 pounds each.  That&#x27;s just NASTY!  I&#x27;m waiting to exhale!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quality..... no problems with getting what I ordered and VERY quickly. The price was the best I found.</li>
            <li> I order this all the time</li>
            <li> Love it!  This is top grade bulk raw unrefined Shea butter.  It&#x27;s super soft and very easy to work with.  You may find some particles in the butter, but that&#x27;s normal - it is unrefined and found in the elements :-).  Shea butter has so many uses, but I use this unfiltered and mix with oils for an awesome hair butter.  I will definitely order more from this seller.</li>
            <li> ....but it is a very nice product. It is not actually Ivory. The Shea Butter is fine and smooth and wonderful to use, but it is not the creamy white shown in the photo. I ordered 10# and it was almost 10#, so I&#x27;m happy with the order.</li>
            <li> It was very good I didn&#x27;t have to do anything to it.  I made different produce&lt;br /&gt;loved it</li>
            <li> I ordered this Shea Butter 6 months ago because I am allergic to EVERYTHING!!  I started making my own oils/lotions/shampoos as a result and started ordering from a different company.  I was very disappointed with the other company&#x27;s level of service - often times it took two weeks to get my order!  Also, the last order I placed was supposed to be Ivory Shea Butter and they sent me the standard yellow Shea Butter that stinks to high heaven!!! Needless to say I was skeptical when I saw the Shea Butter claims from smellgood.  I placed my order and it arrived in about 4 days.  Even better than that, when I opened the box it was a beautiful off white color and it was so SOFT!!  It had almost no smell - there was a little of that earthy smell that is characteristic of Shea Butter but it was so light, my essential oils blended right in.  Because of that I&#x27;m actually saving money - everyone knows how expensive essential oils are and I don&#x27;t have to use as much with Shea Butter from smellgood.  Since I started using it my skin is silky smooth (I&#x27;ve had no allergic reactions whatsoever!!) My stretch marks have become significantly lighter and you can barely see them.  I also use it for my daughters and I&#x27;ve noticed the scar on my oldest daughter&#x27;s leg is barely visible and her acne scars are all gone.  We all have healthy, glowing skin - even my husband!!!  It whips up so light and fluffly and mixes great with aloe vera gel, carrier oils, and any essential oils you can think of.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!! If you have problem skin and are looking for a good company with a great product to order from, smellgood is the place to go.  I&#x27;m almost out of Shea Butter and I just placed another 10 lb order - I&#x27;m so pleased with them I also placed an order for 10 lbs of black soap too!!!  Ok, enough of my ranting, try it for yourself and you&#x27;ll see!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of making my own brand of lotion and this with 3 other butter do&lt;br /&gt;Wonder for your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love ans it also good for your hair.</li>
            <li> I received my butter faster than I expected! I ordered both the white and the yellow shea. I love them both!. Didn&#x27;t have much to filter out. Smells great! Works amazing in soaps, creams &amp; body butters!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 5 lb batch and it was awesome. Beautiful nutty smell, Hard butter that melted with body heat. I then ordered the 10 lb, and it was awful. Product was cut with some other type of oil and was sticky and had an awful chemical smell. Bait n switch I tell you! Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this butter!  Such a nice quality, not too hard, not too soft.  Luxurious!  The pricepoint cannot be beat! Will purchase again and again from here!</li>
            <li> Best product from best seller</li>
            <li> Very clean and rich Shea Butter with a beautiful white color. Made several batches of soap and turned out beautifully. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> As always this is the best shea butter I have ever used for my whipped recipe. This is my stable company for shea butter.</li>
            <li> If customer service isn&#x27;t your concern this is a good product. I require good customer service for business reasons so I&#x27;ll be looking for other sources for my needs. Answering questions and providing the best prices to enable you to buy more than 10lbs at a time i guess is beneath them. I ordered black soap the other day and I really wanted 20 to 30lbs just to have my inventory together and maybe more after but I can&#x27;t get the answers that I need to crank up my business plans. Luckily there are other people in the world who are looking to make money so it&#x27;s not a big issue.</li>
            <li> I loved her&lt;br /&gt;And I loved the masterly packaging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product for roughly 2 years...I fell in love with it immediately!  I&#x27;ve shared it with friends/family, all those that have tried it have nothing but good things to say!  I&#x27;ve now get requests for my body butter mixture it&#x27;s so good!  I use it from my hair down to my toes!  Best product ever!  I&#x27;ll never use another store bought lotion product ever again!</li>
            <li> you get exactly what you ask for. Nice and Neat, Simple Packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned my friends onto it and now im running low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s friends swear that it removes their crows feet and stretch marks</li>
            <li> I purchase this butter and when it came it did have to be clean. I was ok with that the price of it I thought that would be the case. What I was not expecting was the mole. After I clean the Shea butter by straining it through some cheese cloth. I stored it in a plastic container and a month later it had mole in it. I did not add any water to it and the pot I melt it in was clear of water. I know if water get in it, it could mole I don&#x27;t know why this stuff mole. I have not use much of it this was a waste of money. I will get the refined Shea Butter next time.</li>
            <li> The package had a couple rocks in it And it wouldn&#x27;t Ivory white but they said it probably Melted Wow in route.</li>
            <li> Great product, can&#x27;t really complain. But there were a few rat/mouse droppings in the packaging, not sure about ordering again.</li>
            <li> Most definitely will be purchasing again. It arrived in 2 large 5lb Blocks. It seems to be food grade as well. Slices like a rich butter has a very slight smell of cocoa butter. I only hope my future orders from this company well mirror this one...IF NOT I Will DEFINITELY LET YOU GUYS KNOW!!!</li>
            <li> This shea butter was super high quality! I love the price. Mine came in two clear plastic bags the product was also cubed that were sealed with tape and a company logo sticker on each. I didn&#x27;t even have to do much cleaning with this, it came really clean. It whips really well for my body butters and hair creams.</li>
            <li> My wife asked for *some* raw shea butter, so after looking around for a couple days, I settled on this large quantity.  She makes her own skin products as her skin reacts badly to alcohol and other preservatives.  She raves at it&#x27;s smoothness and purity, even in it&#x27;s unrefined state.  She mixes castor oil with this in our kitchen aid commercial grade mixer, and whips it to an airy, smooth texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her jaw dropped open when she saw how much I&#x27;d purchased for her... it was pretty hysterical to see her reaction, but I digress.  Dollar per pound, I&#x27;ve not found anything less expensive without sacrificing quality and purity.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased from this importer.  They ship quickly and professionally.  Well packed.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t mind having to melt it down to get the shell pieces out of it,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a great purchase. It is SOO much butter!!&lt;br /&gt;I has lasted me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Besides the little things you find in it (easily strained out) this stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be clear, the debris are just parts of the Shea nut that wasn&#x27;t removed.</li>
            <li> This came as yellowish not white shea; still very nice.</li>
            <li> Came in mail with great timing. It was exactly what the vendor says it was. Great she a buyter. Happy to have home made lotions!</li>
            <li> Love love love so much for little money I&#x27;ll always purchase here can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> I really, really, really love this product. Ten pounds is way more than i thought i would need so this will last me a very long time. I use it to mix with essential oils as a hair product since i am natural. No complaints. This is true shea butter.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product from the vendor, and I love the smell.  I enjoy using it in my beauty products.  The price is also great for the amount of shea butter you receive.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this Shea butter was really great... then I pulled out the end of the last batch I ordered from another distributor. I held a little of this in one hand and a little of the other stuff in my other hand... the other stuff melted and was oily like it should be, this stuff was waxy and didn&#x27;t melt into an oil like it should have with my body temperature... instead it got soft and waxy-sticky. I have been doing a lot of reading online about roughly determining the quality of shea butter based on a number of qualities/tell-tale signs... first, from what I can tell I think this Shea butter has been cut with something like beeswax or maybe even petroleum (two common things some distributors do to stretch their stock but won&#x27;t tell you), second, I read that is is common to find parts of the outer or inner shell in the butter but when I filtered it through a cheese cloth I found what looks like dirt and some small black chunks (coals?) in mine I read that this is a sign that the butter could be contaminated with harmful bacteria and/or mold. I am not an expert but based on what I see and have read this is not pure Shea butter and Im extremely disappointed because I can&#x27;t use it in any of my all-natural products. So I pretty much waisted $32 of my small shops limited funds :/...</li>
            <li> I got this for it&#x27;s amazing price.. It mixes well into my lotions, soaps and so forth. My only feedback is that it slightly grainy compared to the refined stuff I am used to, that may just be the nature of the product though. It was pretty easy to filter and I actually enjoy the earthy smell it has.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:5e0f73732509e750fd407d90756806bb]]Great product but it wasn&#x27;t 10 lbs. instead I received 9 lbs 3 oz. They contacted me about it and said they were shocked because they were never short, much less short by a lb and offered to send me the other lb. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered this a second time. This time I weighed it and it was 9 lbs 15 oz. It&#x27;s a nice product but if they&#x27;ve shorted me two out of two times, there is no telling how many times they&#x27;ve cheated others who didn&#x27;t think to weigh it when they received it. I have a video of me weighing it in the sealed bag that I&#x27;m attaching to this review.</li>
            <li> excellent quality, wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hit like it is every time!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My order came much quicker than expected and it was exacly what I viewed in the image.  I was pleased with both the consistency and low odor.  I will be sure to order again when its finished.</li>
            <li> I decided to rate this product at 5-Stars. The shipment came in a plastic bag, wrapped in second plastic bag then in a brown shipping box. Reading the reviews, my first instincts was to inspect the product. I turned it over, cut open the 10 lbs into 5 separate large pieces. The sheabutter was ivory pale in color, very smooth, crumbled easily but not too loose, no mold or plant leaves/debris, none of this at all. It was very soft and melted in my hands after rubbing it gently. The package arrived during the allotted time listed and actually came a day early. This company produces really good quality sheabutter or which ever manufacturer/vendor/supplier they go through. I used it in my hair and on my skin every day. After using it on my scalp, hair, and skin daily, my skin/hair felt hydrated through out the day. I love this sheabutter. It is a quality product. I will now only go through this supplier for sheabutter. Excellent Job!!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Is just as described. Weighed a little over 10 pounds.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This product has been great for my young one with severe eczema and multiple allergies. I have been melting it down and whipping it with other oils (coconut usually) and some aloe straight from the plant. It&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; my child will let me apply to his skin, GREAT product.</li>
            <li> Very nice butter it exceeded my expectations for this price.  I will purchase again for this supplier.</li>
            <li> My sister and I use shea to make soap. We were a little reluctant to buy so much at once, but it was such a great deal. Well, we were not sorry one bit. It is exactly what was described. Yes it has an odor about it, but not a strong one.( I still grabbed some right out of the box to moisturize my hands and heels) I cannot wait for this batch of soap to cure so we can try it out.</li>
            <li> I for the first time bought shea in bulk.  The quality is excellent and I got the package really fast.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> great product. fast shipping!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I took a leap of faith and ordered 10 lbs of the raw shea butter.  When it came the first thing I did was weigh the package and it came in at 10.8 lbs with packaging. I took a picture of the box and the contents and it isn&#x27;t as white and solid in color as their photos show, but that isn&#x27;t a concern of mine.  I wish I could show a picture if the contents of the box, but it was mostly one large block of shea butter, with some smaller pieces loose in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to make some lotion bars!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy shea butter online again, because my first experience was horrible. The product was gritty, awkward smelling, and never smoothened out. I tried making a butter with it, but the batches were always lumpy and sandy like. But THIS shea butter was AMAZING!!! It&#x27;s smooth in texture, very moisturizing, and truly top quality. I bought 10 lbs, which will last a very long time. But when I run out I&#x27;ll definitely make another purchase from this seller. 2 thumbs up for you guys!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product around 2013 and ran out a few months ago after daily use and much sharing (regrettably for free :)). To me it&#x27;s about how the skin does after the product use is finished, and I have not found any butter comparable to this product. Hands down best amount, quality and performance of any skin product. I habitually make my own skin/hair care  products and have had to add extra oils to my routine without this product. I didn&#x27;t add any oils typically the entire time I used this but as I am currently pregnant I will be experimenting with whipping oils into my Shea butter mainly coconut, castor, glycerin and aloe vera gel to see. It&#x27;s pretty inexpensive for the amount, last FOREVER, and is the smoothest creamiest raw Shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased. My order shipped very quickly after purchase and I am currently ordering another batch. It says it lasts a year but I had my bulk over a year with NO problems or skin issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous ordering this after reading some of the reviews in regards to the product quality.  The price however couldn&#x27;t be beat and I took a change.  Am I glad I did!  Yes, this is an unrefined Shea Butter, and when they say it&#x27;s unrefined - they MEAN it&#x27;s unrefined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s packaged inside a large sealed bag - and you can see small pieces of what appear to be tree bark and shells off the pods the Shea Butter is extracted from.  For me, this is no big deal.  Warm it up slow and gentle then run it through a strainer/cheese cloth.  A little effort on my part has saved me a GIANT amount of money.  I will be ordering this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is the real thing. Awesome. I would but it again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It is the white shea butter which I prefer, and was a full 10 lbs (I weighed it).  I also like that it comes in a block that has been cut into smaller pieces so its a bit more manageable to work with.</li>
            <li> I like this Shea Butter from Smell good,  I use it to mix my own skin and hair care products.</li>
            <li> After doing weeks and weeks of research on how to purchase Shea butter, what to look for and why not to buy if it looks a certain way this was exactly what I needed and it was priced very reasonable.</li>
            <li> We use this combined with essential oils for my 5yo&#x27;s eczema.  It does a great job healing his skin, and unlike some cheaper butters I&#x27;ve tried does not stain his skin or clothing!</li>
            <li> Perfectly smooth, not grainy. Whips up easily! I&#x27;d recommend this purchase for daily use on skin and natural hair. Excellent purchase. Arrives much quicker than stated!</li>
            <li> This made my tired skin glowing in just a few minutes. Excellent customer service too.</li>
            <li> We have been sharing with friends &amp; family; it is just what an active Texas guy needs to feel well cared for after a hard day&#x27;s work; hands and feet need it all year round; just wear socks to bed.</li>
            <li> I received my order today.&lt;br /&gt; My 10lb Shea butter weighed 8.0 lb only. I am going to contact smellgood for the rest. The plastic bag is sealed, and I am not going to open it until I receive missing 2lb. I can&#x27;t tell about the quality yet.</li>
            <li> This Raw Organic Unrefined Shea Butter is simply amazing. I just made a fresh batch of body butter for my husband, son and I and it is great. I will make a batch for my hair as soon as the vitamin E oil that I ordered almost 2 weeks ago arrives!!! Yay!! I will order this Shea butter again :-)</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter was unrefined like I was hoping for.  There is some debris that comes with it but that is what is part of being unrefined and it is not too hard to melt down and filter.</li>
            <li> Customers love the cream I make with this and coconut butter, argan oil, and grapeseed oil!  You can add a little essential oil to it. I am going to get a bathtub full of this and bask in it all day! LOL</li>
            <li> This butter has a pleasant nutty smell, it&#x27;s soft - not hard to break down, in fact I can take a small piece and rub it in my hands and it dissolves.  I use it on my face and I make hair products with it.  I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I love the nutty smell and the fact that I got alot for the cost.  I didn&#x27;t experience the grainy consistency like some posted.  I will purchase again...</li>
            <li> I can not live without raw shea butter. I love this product,my whole family uses it.and mothers please stop using johson products filled with petrol and artificial fragrance.i have been using raw shea since I was pregnant and on my new born and up to now. it is truly a miracle butter yes a bold statement nonetheless it is the truth .I have used soooo many products nothing can come close to raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> Just what i was looking for to make my soaps! I will order more for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so very much</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this product.it really does help to soften my skin and really helps the bottom of my feet</li>
            <li> This product is great! Its high quality, low priced, &amp; ships quickly. Shea butter can be costly, that&#x27;s why I buy in bulk and because I use it to make skin &amp; haircare products that I sell, I need a low cost vender so that I can keep my prices low. I have look online &amp; at other sellers &amp; purchased elsewhere, but I will now continue to purchase from this vender. The price cannot be beat! It is unfiltered &amp; unrefined, so you may occassionally find pieces of bark or gorde in it. Usually you won&#x27;t though. It comes packaged in a plastic bag, but if it keeps the cost down, I will surely deal with the packaging, as I&#x27;m going to just take it out &amp; use anyway.</li>
            <li> I have been making soap for over twenty years. This is by far the best shea butter I have used. Most shea leaves an unpleasant odor in the finished product, but not this one. The soap is wonderful with lots of creamy lather suitable for showering, washing hair, and as a facial soap.</li>
            <li> I just received my butter in the mail and I must say I LOVE IT ALREADY!! This is my first time using the Ivory Shea butter and I very pleased. I had been buying the $5 yellow butter from my local hair store, but I wanted to start making my own hair and body products. I seen lots of folks using the ivory butter, so I wanted to try. Nothing was wrong with my yellow butter, it just wasn&#x27;t enough. I am pleased with the product and will purchase again when this runs out! Thanks Amazon for having this product to ship.  Update May 2015, This Shea Butter is AWESOME. It is great to work with nice, smooth and great for my family&#x27;s skin! A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Excellent,  arrived well packaged in a reasonable amount of time.  Quality was very good</li>
            <li> CHEAPEST SOURCE FOR SHEA BUTTER. I normally purchase Shea butter from a different site at $7/lb for 10lbs - much cheaper than I had seen at other places - until I found this batch on Amazon. That I missed it all this time is beyond me - probably because the smaller batches at $10/lb are what you see more. Also, the $10 shipping fee was not ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try BOTH ivory shea butter and \\&quot;yellow shea butter\\&quot; (which is really kpangnan butter) and the price was right. Even with shipping, it will be $3/lb - CAN&#x27;T BEAT THAT! I also needed black soap that I planned to mix it with shea butter because black soap is a little too drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;This product is AMAZING! The scent may be overpowering, but this is truly shea butter not the crap you see all over the place. I also feel this product was much newer than what I purchased from my other source. There may be a smoky aroma to shea butter, but that&#x27;s normal. Look at how they make the product and you will see that the smoky aroma is expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USING IT:&lt;br /&gt;The product is a lot creamier and more buttery that my other batch. It&#x27;s thick but rubbing between your palms melts it and it feels so wonderful on the skin. I wash my hands a lot and reach for my jar of homemade shea creme. I&#x27;m going to find a small cosmetic jar so I can it with me while away from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before use: I used the double boiler method to melt it. You may notice minor particles - these are the shell of the shea nut. Once it&#x27;s melted, I lined a sieve with paper towel(I was out of cheesecloth) and let the oil filter through.&lt;br /&gt;THAT&#x27;S IT. Perfect and particle-free. To make it easier to use, I let it cool a bit(refrigerator works best to avoid graininess) and whip it up with some avocado oil and jojoba oil. To tone down the smell, I added some of my boyajian orange oil - it&#x27;s food grade and should be used for cooking, but it&#x27;s what I had on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT: BUY BUY BUY. I was concerned about the review who got less than 10lbs, and I weighed mine. Both were slightly over 10lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY MORE, SAVE MORE: Since I was purchasing 3 items - white and yellow butters and black soap, I purchased directly from their site where the shipping cost was not fixed. Total cost was $72.54. If I had purchased from here, it would have cost $82.47. If you&#x27;re only buying one item, buy from Amazon - you save that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Line your sieve/bowl with cheesecloth as paper towels are more absorbent which means wasted product. Since I had 10lbs of the stuff, I did not care too much, but I used a cheesecloth the second time around.</li>
            <li> This seller does NOT do same day shipping. Be careful! Not until I paid for my order did I found out it that it would take up to 3+ weeks for my order to arrive! I don&#x27;t trust or like to do business with someone who makes false advertising claims so, I requested a cancellation, which he wouldn&#x27;t grant. (Amazon doesn&#x27;t get involved until 3 days after an order is placed.) Again, I requested a cancellation after the 3 day period. He promptly notified me of a tracking number. I checked it throughout that day and the next, but there was no information on its status--because he hadn&#x27;t shipped it yet. Apparently, he had gotten a shipping label, but had not yet mailed it. No telling when he would mail it. Again, I requested a cancellation and said that I would file a claim with Amazon if he didn&#x27;t honor my request. Shortly after, I was notified that it had been cancelled--5 days after I had placed the order. What a waste of time. If only he were honest in his advertising.</li>
            <li> after my girls used in home, they felt so nice. being this is raw no other preservatives, works great. i recommend</li>
            <li> My shea butter was packaged and boxed up about what I expected it to be. It was clean soft, plentyful, and ready to use. I will be ordering more!!</li>
            <li> Love it, use it a lot. It does contain sediment because it is not refined and some people seem to take issue with that.</li>
            <li> Great quality, awesome customer service, will order again !</li>
            <li> came as described ,fresh  and seem to keep well Thank you Sarah</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely Amazing!!! It is indeed 100 % Top Grade Raw Unrefined Shea Butter. I&#x27;ve used other brands in the past and this one is Number 1 on my list. I started purchasing this Shea Butter 2 years ago.  I needed an all-natural Shea Butter to use for my Hair and Skin product line. I was very pleased with the fast shipping of my order and even more pleased with the quality of the product. The Shea Butter is soft and easy to work with. It blends well with other essential oils I use. My products have a nice, even, creamy texture that I just couldn&#x27;t obtain using other brands of Raw Shea.  Other brands required me to use mass amounts of essential oils to try to obtain the texture I get with this Shea and it never really hit the mark. With this Shea, I use very minimal amounts of essential oils to obtain the creamy texture I desire for my products. This Shea is very easy to apply to your hair and skin. Your hair isn’t weighed down; but instead, full of body and life. The natural smell of Shea butter can be a bit offensive for some, though the aroma vanishes once it has been applied to your skin within minutes. You can also try using all natural oils such as Peppermint, Lemon, Etc. to hold it at bay. The folks at Smell Good are also very professional. I contacted them once because my package took longer than usual to arrive. Within 1 business day, Smell Good resolved the matter by contacting my local post office and obtaining the information I needed to pick up my package. Another time I noticed a gritty texture and thought Smell Good had sent me a bad batch of Shea. I was upset because I had to refund one of my customers because they claimed they found salt in the product. I immediately contacted Smell Good and complained. While I awaited a response, I researched and found hundreds of blogs on this issue. I found that in warmer climates or during periods of high temperatures the product may become grainy. Smell Good replied with the same information and eased my mind. In my profession it is very important to have a quality product but it is equally important to do business with a professional company. I appreciate Smell Good for providing both.ed my mind. In my profession it is very important to have a quality product but it is equally important to do business with a professional company.

            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this one it comes with bugs in it I have to strain it once I melt it down. an the texture is sticky.</li>
            <li> I was buying a &amp;#34;homemade&amp;#34; shea butter moiisturizer from an out-of-state acquaintance.  It came in a 4 oz. container at $8 a pop.  I thought to myself, &amp;#34;how hard can it be to make this myself&amp;#34;??  An engine search later, I found recipes and this great seller on Amazon!  My order arrived quickly, and I immediately started making my own moisturizer.  My skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> OMG!!!!!  This is the BEST Shea Butter I have ever experienced.  It is truly pure, raw, and perfect.  I did absolutely no processing whatsoever to this butter, because it is perfect just the way it is.  It is smooth, nice smelling, and shell free.  I just take a bit, rub it between my fingers a few seconds, and then apply it to whatever I want to make beautiful and soft...AAAHHHH!!!  Happy skin!  I recently applied this butter to a very badly infected cat-scratch before retiring one night, and awoke next morning with no infection.  This stuff is wonderful!  Next, I&#x27;m going to try it on my scalp and hair.  I&#x27;ve heard that it is miraculous on leather---my shoes and purses and favorite coat will be next.  Ten pounds is a lot of Shea butter, and it lasts at room temperature for at least 1.5 years.  And, oh yes, SMELLGOOD packs this beautiful butter well and sends it pronto....fast.  Thank you so very much, Smellgood.  Sylvia in Tennessee</li>
            <li> I must admit, when I first saw the price for the quantity of this product, I was not sure of the quality. To my amazement, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the product when I received it. My regret was not placing a larger order the first time. I love Shea butter and what it does for the skin. My next order will be much larger than my first. When I used it to make the body butter, wow, it was very creamy and smooth to touch.  I love this product and price. Good job Amazon for partnering with a reputable supplier. This was my first order with Amazon and will definitely be shopping with you in the future.</li>
            <li> Always great! I buy for my business.  Not hardly any debrie in it at all.  2nd time bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered it twice and have been very pleased with it both times.  This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen for it, too,  Recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the s***! Minimizes wrinkles and makes skin oh so soft. I gave some to a friend recently who had experienced burns, and his healing is amazing. I use it to make body butter, but I actually think it&#x27;s more phenomenal just used raw, as is. God&#x27;s gift.</li>
            <li> Does what I need it to do! Now that they have prime shipping I&#x27;m overjoyed! I have to buy this often. The price w/ shipping didn&#x27;t change. It&#x27;s actually a little more but the fact that it comes 3x faster is worth it to me bacause when I need it, I need it!</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, it is good for every skin problem plus I am now using it as a lip balm and diaper rash cream.</li>
            <li> Very nice shea butter.  I too have the cornmeal like grainy feeling, but once it is warmed in my hands and I rub it on my skin they disappear and it is very smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> This was a massive quantity and it came in a big lump, which was very difficult to break apart.  You needed to cut pieces off with a large, very sharp knife, and then it just made a mess.  It was extremely greasy and messy.  I mean, I guess it serves it&#x27;s purpose, but I think the next time, I&#x27;ll just buy the body butter already made, instead of making it myself.  Oh and the smell of the shea butter itself is utterly disgusting.  You definitely need to add a scent or essential oil to it.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality shea butter, packaging was easy to work with, weighed the product upon arrival and received the proper amount.&lt;br /&gt;the shea butter itself feels/looks/smells great, I have ordered shea butter in the past from another company and it smelled awful, felt sticky instead of creamy and was very oily on the skin and didn&#x27;t absorb properly.&lt;br /&gt;this shea butter however feels amazing, I used it straight out of the bag, no foul odor, was very soft and creamy feeling and soaked right in leaving my skin feeling VERY soft.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it to make a whipped body butter, and it is the best whipped body butter I have made yet, the shea butters I have used in the past were garbage compared to this shea butter, and I spent 3 times more on those other brands, this company, this product and this price are beyond amazing.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 10 lbs package quite some time ago, filtered it exactly according to instructions, and used it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smell was very unpleasant, even after finely filtering it, and I&#x27;ve used pure shea butter for years, so I know and like the standard earthy shea smell. This was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have thrown it away but used it anyway, much to my regret. It gradually embedded white waxy stains in most of my dark clothes. Still today, months after I stopped using it, those white stains remain stubborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using quality shea butter for years and have never, ever encountered anything like this. Whatever this is, it&#x27;s not like any shea butter I&#x27;ve had. Buyer beware</li>
            <li> This shea butter is fantastic! The price is amazing. We make our own body scrubs, cleansers, and lotions, and this product is a perfect natural addition to those creations for a much lower price than what is found elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is great</li>
            <li> Great Shea butter. Great price and quality.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because this is the first time I have gotten shea butter and what I got came quickly and was everything I expected.  This looks and smells like a natural product.  The smell does not bother me at all but I like earthy smells.  I had a few coworkers smell it and the best description I got was the smell of wood floors that have just been waxed and I think that is pretty dead on.  It is not a strong oder by any means, you really need to get your face up to it.  It looks clean with the occasional spec of something dark, presumably shell or bark, just what you might expect from an unrefined product, but nothing gritty in - just like butter.&lt;br /&gt;As far as quality I have really nothing to compare it to, mine came in chunks and in just a plastic bag.  I weighed the box as soon as it came before I even opened it and 10 1/2 pound so they do err on the heavy side which is always nice.&lt;br /&gt;So far I like it very much and will come back to this seller when I want more.</li>
            <li> I must say I&#x27;m not a fan of unrefined shea because of the smell, but this shea butter is perfect. It rubbed in effortless onto  my hand without a grainy feeling. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and what a LARGE amount for this price! I will be ordering here again!!! Thanks!!!&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> It was delievered when it said it would. The quality is wonderful. My only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t take my fragerance oil very well. So I have to add more then I usually have to. And&lt;br /&gt;After it is rubbed on skin you can really smell the shea butter. But oh my goodness my skin feels so soft afterwards. And it leaves my daughters hair soft and shiny. But I will be ordering from thrm again. Has anyone ordered their cocoa butter?</li>
            <li> I loved it!  Smells great,  feels very silky.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 lbs of this unrefined, unfiltered shea butter, BEAUTIFUL!!! Exactly what I expected, have just finished melting and stringing through cheese cloth.  They say it is unfiltered, but for 2 lbs worth, i got less than 1/8 tsp of debris/bark etc. beautiful on skin and exactly what I wanted/expected!  Will be buying more!  THANK YOU!!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality. Very little straining needed after melting to clear out any undissolved particles. I make my own foot creams and body butters and this stuff is a must. Can&#x27;t wait to try to make lip balm (chapstick) with this and beeswax. There is a tiny odor, but I don&#x27;t mind it, and as soon as I add my fragrance, it&#x27;s all but gone.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good product</li>
            <li> Good quality, pure. There was not necessity to refine it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter over a year ago to make my whipped oils for my hair and skin. Awesome product that last forever. Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> expect a larger order from me soon! i am spreading the word. great quality great service. i make aromatherapy body butters and hair creams with this and they are selling fast. they hold well do to the quality of this butter</li>
            <li> This product was better than expected! It also arrived super quick...and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
