            <li>Depending upon the good quality of products Amazon has been giving to me in the past, I hope that NOW Foods Cinnamon Bark oil will be a wonderful addition to my stock of spices for diverse use.</li>

            <li>I am new to oils and find the NOW brand very helpful and within my budget.</li>
            <li>Please investigate on your own before you buy the more expensive ones!</li>

            <li> This oil is not commonly available as is the cassia cinnamon, but I wanted this particular oil for several purposes.</li>
            <li> This combined with some other natural oils....  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> Steam Distilled from plant&#x27;s dried inner bark.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other ingredients to make thieves oil.</li>

            <li> My husband uses this for his type 2 diabetic condition which has now been decreased to a normal status -- lower than mine.</li>
            <li> down side: the scent of cinnamon makes me hungry and energized.</li>
            <li> How is that a down side?</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see what to use this for other than diffuser.</li>
            <li> Absolute worst!  </li>
            <li> I made cough and cold medicine, and pain medicine.</li>
            <li> It seems like the company has a bad batch, on this one, and needs to do some quality control.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received has a rancid smell and smelled terrible in my diffuser.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just received this and it smells Great! I am anxious to see what to use this for other than diffuser. I would like this is a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I love Now essential oils, so I know its good. I have a lot of faith in this brand.</li>
            <li> Nice and spicy. I use this as a natural room freshener, and counter-top and floor cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My house smells like Christmas (which even a Buddhist like me can enjoy)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Only down side: the scent of cinnamon makes me hungry and energized. How is that a down side? Can&#x27;t use it in my bedroom..)</li>
            <li> We bought this at a great price. We are aroma nuts!  It was packaged well and arrived on time!</li>
            <li> Found other cinnamon bark oils that had a much more pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice essential oil.  Good price and a reputable company to purchase essential oils from.</li>
            <li> Great Product at a great price</li>
            <li> This smells great.  I used it in my lotion.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
            <li> Smell is amazing. I purchased this as opposed to Cassia for its essential oil therapeutic properties. It works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I used this as part of a combination spray to get rid of&lt;br /&gt;cigarette smoke in an apt. I love the cinnamon smell,&lt;br /&gt;which truly freshens the air!</li>
            <li> Great flavor...will order again!</li>
            <li> Now products is greatly trusted.  I know that I am getting a great product when Now is printed on the label.  The Cinnamon Bark I used to make feminine products with, and I made cough and cold medicine, and pain medicine.</li>
            <li> Real cinnamon is the best with all the natural healing benefits, 1 drop in my green tea is great! Definitely recommended. Don&#x27;t use powdered cassia cinnamon. It is purely aromatic.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and came very fresh with excellent dates on packages.</li>
            <li> fragrant and invigorating.</li>
            <li> A great product. It is great for making lots of Cinnamon toothpicks, Cinnamon Schnapps, and a very tasty Apple Butter!</li>
            <li> I use this oil a lot &amp; appreciate the size &amp; quality offered.  The scent is wonderful.  Love it</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I mix it with other ingredients to make thieves oil. Awesome immune booster. Very pleased with my product and service. Packaged well and came in on time. Love it :)</li>
            <li> Absolute worst!  It smells rancid.  And taste like mildew.  And I can&#x27;t get my money back.</li>
            <li> I love NOW EOs, they are just as good and pure as the other brands. They smell fantastic and I am loving blending them on my own. They are much cheaper and just as good. Please investigate on your own before you buy the more expensive ones! &amp;#34;Therapeutic Grade&amp;#34; is a term made up by some companies in the industry. There is no EO standard to measure this by, at this time. Visit the NOW Foods website to read about their EO process.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the product seems to be of excellent quality, without any unpleasant after-note. Depending upon the good quality of products Amazon has been giving to me in the past, I hope that NOW Foods Cinnamon Bark oil will be a wonderful addition to my stock of spices for diverse use.</li>
            <li> I add it to my water with grapefruit and tangerine essential oils and a little bit of stevia for a refreshing beverage.  It is a lot cheaper than sports drinks and curbs the appetite.</li>
            <li> this was an alternative idea to treating &amp; preventing Ebola, should the need arise, lol. This combined with some other natural oils....  it is very potent &amp; very strong. But after incredible research, this one that was highly recommended.</li>
            <li> great, item delivered on time</li>
            <li> Wonderful cinnamon scent, will buy again. I use it in a diffuser. It&#x27;s smells just like cinnamon, and lingers&lt;br /&gt;well in the air for hours. Just 4-5 drops in a diffuser and fills a room with scent.</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own thieves /onguard recipe.Works like a charm! I put one drop in the bathroom sink,toilet and tub &amp; no matter what it stays smelling so good in there!</li>
            <li> The bottle I received has a rancid smell and smelled terrible in my diffuser. I saw someone else make a similar complaint in their review, but I hoped I would get lucky. I have enjoyed the other NOW essential oils I&#x27;ve ordered. It seems like the company has a bad batch, on this one, and needs to do some quality control. I requested and received a refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is excellent for the price. I use it in my Thieves blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the label:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: 100% pure cinnamon bark oil.&lt;br /&gt;Aroma: Warm, spicy.&lt;br /&gt;Benefits: Warmning, comforting, energizing.&lt;br /&gt;Mixes Well With: clove oil, nutmeg oil, vanilla concentrate oil, cinnamon cassia oil&lt;br /&gt;Extraction method: Steam Distilled from plant&#x27;s dried inner bark.</li>
            <li> This oil is not commonly available as is the cassia cinnamon, but I wanted this particular oil for several purposes. I trust the NOW label and the price + shipping was good and I received it quickly.</li>
            <li> I am new to oils and find the NOW brand very helpful and within my budget.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s taking this for his diabetes, so far it&#x27;s helping lower his blood sugar.  He&#x27;s stopped one of his insulin&#x27;s and hoping to stop the other one.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;A bit spendy, but you get what you pay for. A little bit goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for his type 2 diabetic condition which has now been decreased to a normal status -- lower than mine.</li>
