            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I feel like it isn&#x27;t anything better than what I could buy in stores.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells as well.</li>
            <li>Believe me,I have bought and used the more high-end shampoos of this type</li>
            <li>I get a better deal ordering it from Amazon than in the supermarket</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that damages easily.</li>
            <li>THIS IS VERY GOOD, AND DID FIND IT IN THE LOCAL</li>
            <li>Great for calming the frizz of naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>But most important...</li>
            <li>so was pleasantly surprised to find it at a great price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and it does a great job of leaving my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I spend WAY less time on my hair now and it looks WAY better and stays beautiful ALL day, no matter the weather!!</li>
            <li>It smells good, lathers well, and makes my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>John Frieda smooth start shampoo &amp; conditioner saves my hair.  </li>
            <li>Smooth</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff...wish it came in bigger bottles</li>
            <li>hair feels so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>The reviews made it sound like it&#x27;s going to work some sort of miracle</li>
            <li>My hair can now tolerate mild humidity without becoming frizzed.</li>
            <li>and now I just shampoo like normal, use the serum when its wet, style it, then rub some of the smoothing creme on and spray with frizz ease hairspray to lock in the AWESOME :)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying out!</li>
            <li>It was great in taking care of my dry hair, but after repeated use I noticed I my hair felt greasy.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean, no residue.</li>
            <li>My hair can be unruly and look like I stuck my finger in a light socket so anything that helps is worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>Good for use between regular shampoos.</li>
            <li>Manages the Frizz and gives you a nice soft shine.  </li>
            <li>A favorite with my daughter who has very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell actually lasts too, which never seems to happen with my hair and good smelling shampoos.</li>
            <li>rinses clean and feels fresh</li>
            <li>Super stuff.</li>
            <li>I buy them via Amazon.com because they go quick in my neighborhood stores</li>
            <li>It is smooth, soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>I used this, along with the Flawlessly Straight Conditioner and the Beyond Smooth Immunity Primer before blowdrying and my hair was frizzier than if I had washed with dollar store shampoo, forgot conditioner and air dryed that morning.</li>
            <li>Like the other customer review, Id give it more stars if I could :)</li>
            <li>I have very long thick hair, so I need a nice shampoo and conditioner to keep my hair looking nice and healthy.</li>
            <li>My ends are kind of dry</li>
            <li>Finally found something for my fine and damaged hair that I&#x27;ll stick with!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands</li>
            <li>This is the first time I buy  John frieda shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>its lightly scented and my hair feels healthy and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky and shiny, and it also helps with the frizz (although, to completely remove the frizz I also use John Frieda Frizz Ease conditioner and Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum).</li>
            <li>Works great on wet hair, dry hair etc.  </li>
            <li>I use the whole line though.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE JOHN FRIEDA PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I have hair that wants to dread about 5 seconds after I brush it out.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>this shampoo works very well.</li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>I expected more.  </li>
            <li>really works for taming frizzies</li>
            <li>and it makes it much smoother and polished when I style.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Ease Flawlessly Straight Shampoo for  five years</li>
            <li>Frizz Ease Dream Flawlessly Straight Shampoo silkens, smooths, and softens my hair and prevents breakage.</li>
            <li>They are both very affordable.</li>
            <li>I have a full head of fine hair with little wisps around my face that like to come out and play whenever humidity is over 40%</li>
            <li>I always end up with my hair in a giant clump of frizz after washing with this, takes me longer to untangle with my conditioner than with my normal shampoo, mostly only got it for color safe, not even worth it.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, mostly straight and very frizzy, occasionally slightly wavy and very frizzy hair that normally fights me when I try to style it.  </li>
            <li>My friends love it as well, and we are women who have varying hair types from A to Z, from tightly curled to really straight.</li>
            <li>It looks great after styling with less time spent on it than before!</li>
            <li>I had a head full of frizzies after my daily swimming and sunning, in the high humidity where I live</li>
            <li>This shampoo is so lush and gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have fought the battle with frizz all my life and felt it was just something I was going to have to live with.  </li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t believe it was the same hair the first time I used this.  </li>
            <li>Unless it is extremely humid, my hair will be in place for a full day.</li>
            <li>, I now need no leave in products, and when I blow dry style it, my hair comes out straight where I want it straight and waves where I want it to wave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very wavy and dry since the swimming and humidity really beats it to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>still need to use additional products after shampoo and conditioner to keep my hair under control, but this helps considerably.  </li>
            <li>and it really does help with the frizz in the winter especially.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/curly hair and have been using Frizz Ease products in combination well over four years.  </li>
            <li>I follow the directions, and I get really soft hair in the shower -</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair shining, soft and no frizz.</li>
            <li>I switched back to Nexxus shampoo and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair; about 3 inches past my shoulders and its very fine.</li>
            <li>I have thin, damaged hair and this stuff works great as an everyday shampoo.  </li>
            <li>but this dried out my hair more and made it harder to use a straightener.</li>
            <li>My daughter - who has long, fine, thick hair - claims that that this shampoo (and it&#x27;s companion conditioner) are the only ones that will make her hair manageable.</li>

            <li> My daughter - who has long, fine, thick hair - claims that that this shampoo (and it&#x27;s companion conditioner) are the only ones that will make her hair manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is overprocessed daily - blow drying and flat ironed.  </li>
            <li> Just like the conditioner it goes with, it also keeps my insanely curly and frizzy hair nice and smooth sometimes even if I let my hair air dry with no product in it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair extra frizzy and extra dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously used countless leave-in products and spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to get my hair to stay straight where I wanted it straight and wave where I wanted it to wave, only to have a so-so outcome.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford a hair cut every 4 weeks, so I have been trying tons of different &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; shampoos (pantene, aussie, garnier, dove), but they all make my hair feel like tangled dry hay after I rinse.</li>
            <li> I feel as though it&#x27;s actually contributing moisture, not stripping my hair dry.</li>
            <li> but once it is dry, it feels and looks the same as it did with lower-quality shampoo.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have to say the Frizz Ease line of products have been a dream for me!! I have only been using it for about a week now, but I get complimented all the time and I feel great after doing my hair!! It looks great after styling with less time spent on it than before! I used to spend a long time trying to tame my hair and now I just shampoo like normal, use the serum when its wet, style it, then rub some of the smoothing creme on and spray with frizz ease hairspray to lock in the AWESOME :) I spend WAY less time on my hair now and it looks WAY better and stays beautiful ALL day, no matter the weather!! I use the whole line though. I think its amazing and will continue to use it and recommend it! Like the other customer review, Id give it more stars if I could :)</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I can use without getting dandruff. It leaves my hair silky and shiny, and it also helps with the frizz (although, to completely remove the frizz I also use John Frieda Frizz Ease conditioner and Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum).</li>
            <li> I used this, along with the Flawlessly Straight Conditioner and the Beyond Smooth Immunity Primer before blowdrying and my hair was frizzier than if I had washed with dollar store shampoo, forgot conditioner and air dryed that morning. There was nothing flawless, smooth, or frizz-free about my hair after using these three products in the morning. I have a full head of fine hair with little wisps around my face that like to come out and play whenever humidity is over 40% and I&#x27;ve struggled to find hair products that work. This one did not.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on sale at a store while I was camping and turns out I love it!  I will be buying more.  I have thin, damaged hair and this stuff works great as an everyday shampoo.  This along with the conditioner helped to repair my hair and do not leave any heavy residue on my thin hair.  Super stuff.</li>
            <li> i love the shampoo. its lightly scented and my hair feels healthy and less frizzy. rinses clean and feels fresh</li>
            <li> awesome shampoo. will defiantly buy again. It is almost a dollar less than buying it at target or even Walmart.</li>
            <li> Shampoo of excellent quality. Costs 3 times more expensive in Brazil ! I really liked it.</li>
            <li> My hair is overprocessed daily - blow drying and flat ironed.  John Frieda smooth start shampoo &amp; conditioner saves my hair.  I use daily.</li>
            <li> My daughter - who has long, fine, thick hair - claims that that this shampoo (and it&#x27;s companion conditioner) are the only ones that will make her hair manageable.</li>
            <li> Only product I&#x27;ve used that keeps the frizz out of my thick curly hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still need to use additional products after shampoo and conditioner to keep my hair under control, but this helps considerably.  My hair can be unruly and look like I stuck my finger in a light socket so anything that helps is worth it to me.  This is just one thing that I have to use.  Depending on how frizzy, and thick your hair is, you may still need other products to control your hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo which all of us use at home. We love it.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE JOHN FRIEDA PRODUCTS.  THIS IS VERY GOOD, AND DID FIND IT IN THE LOCAL STORES.&lt;br /&gt;WORKS WELL WITH MY HAIR</li>
            <li> love this and it really does help with the frizz in the winter especially. pantene did away with their anti frizz so I started using this brand. I am happy with the results. Smooth; hydrating; I don&#x27;t prefer one over the other, I just like the auto ship and savings and I see frizz results from both so I buy either one.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that damages easily. Since I&#x27;m trying to grow it out, I have had a serious issue with split ends. I can&#x27;t afford a hair cut every 4 weeks, so I have been trying tons of different &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; shampoos (pantene, aussie, garnier, dove), but they all make my hair feel like tangled dry hay after I rinse. This shampoo is so lush and gentle on my hair. I feel as though it&#x27;s actually contributing moisture, not stripping my hair dry. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Daughter likes it for her hair that has some kinkiness to it in spots.</li>
            <li> It smells good, lathers well, and makes my hair smooth and soft. Works great with the conditioner and hair serum. Finally found something for my fine and damaged hair that I&#x27;ll stick with!</li>
            <li> They replaced my shampoo. I have received some kind of conditioner instead</li>
            <li> Great for calming the frizz of naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and naturally curly.  I have fought the battle with frizz all my life and felt it was just something I was going to have to live with.  I have been using this shampoo and conditioner together for almost a year.  This product is fantastic.  My hair has never looked this nice.  It is smooth, soft and easy to manage.  But most important...No frizz!!  It is an awesome product and I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> It was great in taking care of my dry hair, but after repeated use I noticed I my hair felt greasy. Good for use between regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> I always end up with my hair in a giant clump of frizz after washing with this, takes me longer to untangle with my conditioner than with my normal shampoo, mostly only got it for color safe, not even worth it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, mostly straight and very frizzy, occasionally slightly wavy and very frizzy hair that normally fights me when I try to style it.  I&#x27;d previously used countless leave-in products and spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to get my hair to stay straight where I wanted it straight and wave where I wanted it to wave, only to have a so-so outcome. With the John Frieda Frizz Ease shampoo and conditioner, I now need no leave in products, and when I blow dry style it, my hair comes out straight where I want it straight and waves where I want it to wave. I am extraordinarily pleased with these products - love, love, love them !!!</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair and this works! Rinses clean, no residue. I really like this stuff and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair, so I need a nice shampoo and conditioner to keep my hair looking nice and healthy. This shampoo (and the conditioner) leaves my hair shiny and feels the softest it&#x27;s ever been. Plus, my hair hasn&#x27;t been frizzy!</li>
            <li> Works great on wet hair, dry hair etc.  Manages the Frizz and gives you a nice soft shine.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> shipped on time, great product!</li>
            <li> I have hair that wants to dread about 5 seconds after I brush it out.  This product is lightweight, not greasy, so I can use it every day.  Great stuff...wish it came in bigger bottles so I did not have to restock so often.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, very-curly, red hair going white.  The natural color was hard enough to control but when the white started coming in, it was worse.  I love this product!  Between it and it&#x27;s companion shampoo my frizzy curly hair is so much more managable.  I take it to my hair salon and have them use MY products, because it works better than their expensive salon stuff.  My hair can now tolerate mild humidity without becoming frizzed.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair and have been using Frizz Ease products in combination well over four years.  I use the matching conditioner along with the shampoo, and work a small amount of Frizz Ease serum into my hair before stylng it.  Unless it is extremely humid, my hair will be in place for a full day.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. It was exactly what I was expecting. Thanks.</li>
            <li> A favorite with my daughter who has very curly hair.  Keeps her hair under control without a lot of buildup and helps fight the frizziness from the humidity in our area.  This has been getting hard to find for us so was pleasantly surprised to find it at a great price on Amazon.  I would recommend to anyone who has curly, wavy or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now. I follow the directions, and I get really soft hair in the shower - but once it is dry, it feels and looks the same as it did with lower-quality shampoo. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I feel like it isn&#x27;t anything better than what I could buy in stores.</li>
            <li> I have long hair; about 3 inches past my shoulders and its very fine. You cant tell unless you touch it. So any heat styling can definitely cause it to look abused. I try not to blow out my hair every day so that it doesnt get too damaged. I use this shampoo with the matching conditioner when I&#x27;m going to blow out my hair. I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and I keep coming back to this one. It does cut down on my frizz but not 100%. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever find a product that gives me 100%. As soon as my hair even detects any moisture, BAM! it starts to frizz and curl! I have natural curls/waves which isn&#x27;t such a bad thing because I can have the option of wearing it straight or curly. I would totally recommend this product to anyone to try at least once!</li>
            <li> I used to have silky hair that never frizzed.  I awakened one day with hair that made Gilda Radner&#x27;s look like satin.  It was a nightmare!  Then I ran across this shampoo.  Immediately my hair returned to its previous state.  All I do is shampoo it, blow it dry upside down, and when it&#x27;s dry, I roll the bottom with Jet Set rollers (I have a shoulder-length bob).  Immediate relief!  I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Wife prefers this to even more expensive brands. Love the way it smells as well.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.  Use it all the time.  I have curly coarse hair that tends to frizz.  I also use the conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I buy  John frieda shampoo and conditioner. My hair dresser recommended it and I am so grateful for this!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels so silky and smooth. I have thin hair but used to spend some time styling it after washing it. Now it only takes 10 minutes of my time. I towel dry it, then put some of their sheer solution (FRIZZ-EASE®&lt;br /&gt;SHEER SOLUTION(tm) LIGHTWEIGHT FRIZZ CONTROL) and blow dry the hair around my face and a little on the back. That&#x27;s it! The work is done! And my hair looks beautiful and shiny, smelling delicious and so soft. The frizz is gone and almost no work needed!!!&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is awesome. You can feel that it is already working as soon as you put it on. You can feel it is untangling your hair from the second you put it on! I def recommend this product and John Frieda&#x27;s FRIZZ-EASE®&lt;br /&gt;SHEER SOLUTION(tm) LIGHTWEIGHT FRIZZ CONTROL.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing! Just like the conditioner it goes with, it also keeps my insanely curly and frizzy hair nice and smooth sometimes even if I let my hair air dry with no product in it. The smell actually lasts too, which never seems to happen with my hair and good smelling shampoos. Definitely worth trying out!</li>
            <li> I had a head full of frizzies after my daily swimming and sunning, in the high humidity where I live but since I have started using this, my hair has zero frizz.  I never thought it would happen.  I had resigned myself to having frizzy hair the rest of my life.  It&#x27;s very wavy and dry since the swimming and humidity really beats it to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe it was the same hair the first time I used this.  Where did all the frizz go?  Now I have the problem of what to do with all my other shampoos, since this will be the only one I use from now on.  I think the price here is great, two ten ounce bottles for around ten dollars.</li>
            <li> this shampoo works very well. It leaves your hair shining, soft and no frizz. It smells great and the conditioners works very well also!</li>
            <li> Great product.  It really works</li>
            <li> Ordered this product x2 size but got &amp;#34;flawlessly straight&amp;#34; frieda shampoo for both products! Not cool!</li>
            <li> I expected more.  The reviews made it sound like it&#x27;s going to work some sort of miracle but that&#x27;s not the case with me. I am Indian and I have very thick long hair, that can be a bit frizzy. I was hoping this will fix that problem but this dried out my hair more and made it harder to use a straightener. I switched back to Nexxus shampoo and it works really well.  This shampoo made my hair extra frizzy and extra dry.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get some of this for a while. I will never go back to not using it because my hair is so manageable now.</li>
            <li> really works for taming frizzies</li>
            <li> it helps with my hair, even though it&#x27;s not super frizzy. My ends are kind of dry and it makes it much smoother and polished when I style.</li>
            <li> very good product, delicious aroma, ideal for hair care, I love that leaving it soft, silky and shiny, very good this line. thanks</li>
            <li> This is the best product for any type of hair.  Believe me,I have bought and used the more high-end shampoos of this type and they are not nearly as good. I have been using John Frieda Frizz Ease Flawlessly Straight Shampoo for  five years and this is the best product for any man or woman  who wants gorgeous and manageable hair. John Frieda Frizz Ease Dream Flawlessly Straight Shampoo silkens, smooths, and softens my hair and prevents breakage. And it gives my hair a lot of body. Also I would recommend the conditioner that goes with it. They are both very affordable. I buy them via Amazon.com because they go quick in my neighborhood stores and I  seem to get to the store just when the last one is sold. My friends love it as well, and we are women who have varying hair types from A to Z, from tightly curled to really straight. It works!!! I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a great price.  I get a better deal ordering it from Amazon than in the supermarket and it does a great job of leaving my hair soft and silky.  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my son who has frizzy hair. I think it helped, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t completely eliminate frizz.</li>
