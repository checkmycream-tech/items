            <li> Because of some medical issues I&#x27;m not supposed to chew gum.  So this stuff works perfectly.  It&#x27;s really strong, no one needs more than 3 sprays (and even that can be painful if your tolerance is low) to kill any bad breath.  One of these fits easily in my pocket.  And there&#x27;s no mess like there can be with the strips.</li>

            <li> My dad loves these.. He&#x27;s a smoker and he always carries pocket mist with him because he has to talk to clients everyday. I&#x27;ve been trying to find cheaper alternatives to this but he says nothing compares to the listerine pocket mist.</li>
