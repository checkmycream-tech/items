    <ol>
            <li>This product works great!</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift and it has been wonderful!</li>
            <li>As a beginner at this, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>So do not buy this machine--other brands work better!!!</li>
            <li>A very good unit.</li>
            <li>What a great company to work with and the warmer is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>GREAT WARMER.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work great for my fiance, would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>It cleans up very easy and looks very nice!</li>
            <li>Once its warm though, it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use!</li>
            <li>This feels so good.</li>
            <li>And, I&#x27;m Very Glad that I purchased this one.</li>
            <li>II am pleased!.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>It keeps warm at all time, I never turn it off.</li>
            <li>I am suffering from CRPS and the paraffin bath has helped to warm my hand before exercises.</li>
            <li>Was able to figure it out on my own, works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that it didn&#x27;t come with wax because I wanted to buy my own.</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast arrived in excellent condition I will certainly purchase from this seller again and again!  </li>
            <li>Still trying to adjust the temp but love the results</li>
            <li>Glad we did.  </li>
            <li>We are pleased with this unit.  </li>
            <li>(one time it successfully got hot</li>
            <li>To fill the tank to an appropriate level with melted wax will take about 6 lbs of wax.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to have this at home!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and its nice to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li>Very easy to work with and quick shipment.</li>
            <li>I wish I knew a little more about the tempature gages and was told the best temp.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I got this unit because it was lightweight and seemed easy to operate.</li>
            <li>This unit takes a while to warm up, 1 to 2 hours depending on how hot you set the temperature.</li>
            <li>My wife says the temperature control works fine.</li>
            <li>it works fine.</li>
            <li>some wax on wrist to feel the temperature of wax fit or not before using.</li>
            <li>understand now why this item is no longer available.</li>
            <li>It will fit hands or feet with no problem</li>
            <li>Makes entire hands and wrists feel great.</li>
            <li>A real SPA like treatment -- always waiting for me in my own home!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now her hands are soft, supple and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a plastic plate that rests in the bottom of the tank to prevent you from touching the hot bottom.</li>
            <li>I will need to buy more wax though as the tub is larger than I thought, which is even better!</li>
            <li>Clean design.</li>
            <li>It takes 1-2 hours to heat up, then about 1/2 hour to cool to use temp (52C for me),</li>
            <li>I found that it is easier to wait and have the wax melt at operating temperature rather than to have to wait for it to cool after setting it at the recommended melt temp.  </li>
            <li>so when I finally got the 9 pins out of my hand and everything was healed up I thought it would be a good idea to use it for my hand therapy.</li>
            <li>It melts the parafin reasonably quickly and controls the temperature well.  </li>
            <li>This digital paraffin wax works perfectly, but it takes about two to three hours to melt three pounds of wax at starting.</li>
            <li>pleased with this item, and very professional looking too!</li>
            <li>PERFECT SIZE AND DEEP ENOUGH TO DIP THE WHOLE HAND AND WRIST.</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; big, but no wax comes with it.  </li>
            <li>It has a very large tub  </li>
            <li>My size 11 (male) feet fit fine.  </li>
            <li>I know exactly the temperature of the wax and</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s too hot to use, so after the wax has melted, you re-set the temp to about 48 to 50 degrees</li>
            <li>This takes about another hour, or you can leave the lid askew and it will happen more quickly.</li>
            <li>This one is very convinient to use and portable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very rapid planned obsolescence....</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>But, I really like it.</li>
            <li>- I would recommend this to anyone who has Raynauds, cracked hands or feet, or just wants them softer.</li>
            <li>The outside of the unit remains cool when the unit is on.</li>
            <li>It takes about an hour, or little more to heat up.</li>
            <li>After contacting the company, they immediately sent out a new one.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a light that sometimes goes on when you push it, but since the instructions are well, Chinglish, I guess,  I can only imagine what they are actually saying.</li>
            <li>This means that if you leave the unit at the higher temp for a prolonged period (several hours, like I did), the wax may discolor.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;circumrotate the adjustment contradictorily until you hear a slight sound to turn off the warmer, then plug out&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a large professional unit that lasted several years.  </li>
            <li>I read reviews on different paraffin warmers and settled on this one because it sounded decent for a professional&#x27;s requirements (ie.</li>
            <li>No real instructions with it, but it&#x27;s pretty self-explanatory.  </li>
            <li>It does the job, though I might have bought another professional unit if I knew about not being able to keep it on and the poor cord placement ahead of time.</li>
            <li>It barely heats and I am returning it.</li>

            <li> It barely heats and I am returning it.</li>
            <li> The cord is in the middle back of the unit, so it&#x27;s actually not taking up less counter space since it needs to sit farther out to not kink the cord.  </li>
            <li> The instructions that came with the unit were poor, so I had to check back on the Amazon site for how much wax to fill it with.  </li>
            <li> Well, there IS no circumrotatable adjustment, only the up and down arrows.  </li>
            <li> And be careful with this third-party distributor.</li>
            <li> and it only takes a few minutes to reach that temp</li>
            <li> The most annoying part is that I can&#x27;t keep it on a low setting, but need to turn it off after each use.  </li>
            <li> not the same style I ordered in the past.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to having some control since the temperature setting is digital, but it&#x27;s still hard to know when it heating, or when it&#x27;s just maintaining the temp.</li>
            <li> So when I replaced it, I was looking for something that took less counter space and capacity, with the heating elements shielded.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a lot for less than 5 minutes use per day.  </li>
            <li> The warmer has been on for over an hour and a half and hasn&#x27;t begun to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> She says it relieves the pain a little and helps her mobility in the morning.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with having to pay the price for the unit and wax and only got to use it 4 times.</li>
            <li> Helps limber fingers stiff from arthritis.</li>
            <li> It worked well for a few months (only using it a few times in that period), but then recently fails to heat up to melting temperature.</li>
            <li> The one complaint I have is, if there is interruption with electricity the units heating element shuts down and does not reset itself.</li>
            <li> Remember that hot wax can be very dangerous if spilled, so use extreme caution with melted wax!</li>
            <li> Oh, and don&#x27;t forget to break the paraffin into little chunks so it will melt faster!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend at least two pounds, up to the capacity of six.</li>
            <li> This was a little on the expensive side, but we bought it anyway because of the features.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed in customer service and limited warranty--it quit working just after the 90 day warranty period and they will not exchange it or refund.</li>
            <li> will keep trying to see if it normalizes, but I would be wary of this product.</li>
            <li> could go on with these useless instructions</li>
            <li> Bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> She was afraid I&#x27;d burn my hands and/or feet.</li>
            <li> From a cold state, the wax heats up in about 2 hours to 65 degrees C.</li>
            <li> However, things got lost in translation and the instructions were almost impossible to follow.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it is big enough for feet, too.  works well for my husband&#x27;s arthritic hands</li>
            <li> This one is very convinient to use and portable.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it work because it doesn&#x27;t over heat&lt;br /&gt;the wax.</li>
            <li> Still trying to adjust the temp but love the results</li>
            <li> This product works great! It heats up quickly and its nice to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> After reviewing several, this is the one we picked.  Glad we did.  Only takes 2-3 hours to melt 6 lbs of wax to liquid.  My size 11 (male) feet fit fine.  My wife says the temperature control works fine. Just get used to Centigrade temperatures.  We like it at 40-45.  We are pleased with this unit.  Just remember the wax is not included, so you&#x27;ll have to buy that, too.  I&#x27;d recommend at least two pounds, up to the capacity of six.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and it has been wonderful! No complaints by me or my fiancé on the product.</li>
            <li> GREAT WARMER.  PERFECT SIZE AND DEEP ENOUGH TO DIP THE WHOLE HAND AND WRIST.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on different paraffin warmers and settled on this one because it sounded decent for a professional&#x27;s requirements (ie. it doesn&#x27;t take all day to melt the wax). It worked well for a few months (only using it a few times in that period), but then recently fails to heat up to melting temperature. I keep trying to reset it (after all there are only 3 buttons on the thing!), but it just switches off when it reaches around 30 degrees (one time it successfully got hot enough).&lt;br /&gt;I will keep trying to see if it normalizes, but I would be wary of this product. Very rapid planned obsolescence....</li>
            <li> It works so well. My wife uses it on her hands with her artheitis after swim class. she loves it.</li>
            <li> So disappointed in customer service and limited warranty--it quit working just after the 90 day warranty period and they will not exchange it or refund. So do not buy this machine--other brands work better!!! And be careful with this third-party distributor.</li>
            <li> The spa is using it to heat up our 76 degree coconut oil!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great for water therapies and massage modalities!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this item, and very professional looking too!</li>
            <li> No real instructions with it, but it&#x27;s pretty self-explanatory.  One thing that is not given is an optimal heat temp for the wax.  We&#x27;ve discovered this uinit works in Celcius, so that would equate to 60 degrees on the machine.  Nice &amp; big, but no wax comes with it.  Bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I like that the temperature can be adjusted and it is big enough for a man&#x27;s foot as well as a woman&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This was a little on the expensive side, but we bought it anyway because of the features.  When it arrived it didn&#x27;t work. After contacting the company, they immediately sent out a new one.  What a great company to work with and the warmer is wonderful.  I know exactly the temperature of the wax and the bowl is big enough for my feet!  Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> II am pleased!. It was just like it was shown aand it works fine.I wish I knew a little more about the tempature gages and was told the best temp. to use it on.</li>
            <li> Helps limber fingers stiff from arthritis.</li>
            <li> As a beginner at this, I&#x27;m very happy. However, things got lost in translation and the instructions were almost impossible to follow. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stats. Was able to figure it out on my own, works well.</li>
            <li> not the same style I ordered in the past.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Clean design. I keep it at 50 degrees and heat it to 64 when I want to use it and it only takes a few minutes to reach that temp</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;circumrotate the adjustment contradictorily until you hear a slight sound to turn off the warmer, then plug out&amp;#34;.  Well, there IS no circumrotatable adjustment, only the up and down arrows.  There&#x27;s a light that sometimes goes on when you push it, but since the instructions are well, Chinglish, I guess,  I can only imagine what they are actually saying. I was looking forward to having some control since the temperature setting is digital, but it&#x27;s still hard to know when it heating, or when it&#x27;s just maintaining the temp.</li>
            <li> Wish it had an instruction book for setting the temp and time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a large professional unit that lasted several years.  So when I replaced it, I was looking for something that took less counter space and capacity, with the heating elements shielded.  The instructions that came with the unit were poor, so I had to check back on the Amazon site for how much wax to fill it with.  The most annoying part is that I can&#x27;t keep it on a low setting, but need to turn it off after each use.  It takes 1-2 hours to heat up, then about 1/2 hour to cool to use temp (52C for me), so that&#x27;s a lot for less than 5 minutes use per day.  The cord is in the middle back of the unit, so it&#x27;s actually not taking up less counter space since it needs to sit farther out to not kink the cord.  It does the job, though I might have bought another professional unit if I knew about not being able to keep it on and the poor cord placement ahead of time.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work great for my fiance, would recommend this to others. Very easy to work with and quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for wife. Directions with unit not written by someone understanding the English language. &amp;#34;Rubdown and scrap horniness on hands thoroughly.&amp;#34; Do not use on skin with &amp;#34;whelk&amp;#34;.Huh? &amp;#34;Please turn on again when the warmer is not work&amp;#34;. ...the effect in winter is &amp;#34;salience&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Brush some wax on wrist to feel the temperature of wax fit or not before using. Turn off the warmer and plug out after using.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on with these useless instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All temperatures are in celsius-- 50-60 C but highest setting is &amp;#34;25&amp;#34;. One can only assume that the 25 is the highest setting of C65. The warmer has been on for over an hour and a half and hasn&#x27;t begun to melt the wax. According to the carton a mitten is included... NOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand now why this item is no longer available.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  Can stay on all day  It has a very large tub  It will fit hands or feet with no problem</li>
            <li> My wife has some hand pain and uses this Parafin heater several times a week to alleviate the pain.  It melts the parafin reasonably quickly and controls the temperature well.  It has helped reduce my wife&#x27;s hand pain.</li>
            <li> Just started arthritis in my fingers. This feels so good. Makes entire hands and wrists feel great. A real SPA like treatment -- always waiting for me in my own home!&lt;br /&gt;If we don&#x27;t pamper ourselves ... who will?  lol</li>
            <li> stopped working  within  a month</li>
            <li> It takes about an hour, or little more to heat up. But, I really like it. I had purchased a warmer that didn&#x27;t have a temp adjustment. My daughter, who&#x27;s a nurse, advised me to send it back and get one with a temp adjustment. She was afraid I&#x27;d burn my hands and/or feet. And, I&#x27;m Very Glad that I purchased this one. I use it for both my hands and my feet. If my doctor hadn&#x27;t suggested it for helping my Raynauds, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have even thought about one. - I would recommend this to anyone who has Raynauds, cracked hands or feet, or just wants them softer.</li>
            <li> I like the warmer. The one complaint I have is, if there is interruption with electricity the units heating element shuts down and does not reset itself. this happened to me once after I left work and the next morning I had a manicure scheduled and the wax was not melted.</li>
            <li> Needs wax to operate and it is NOT included.  Checked with store and it costs about $60 for the wax.</li>
            <li> There was no instruction booklet in it and it is still sitting in my floor until I figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li> This digital paraffin wax works perfectly, but it takes about two to three hours to melt three pounds of wax at starting. It keeps warm at all time, I never turn it off.</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast arrived in excellent condition I will certainly purchase from this seller again and again!  Simple to use thankfully because the directions are barely in English.  I found that it is easier to wait and have the wax melt at operating temperature rather than to have to wait for it to cool after setting it at the recommended melt temp.  It cleans up very easy and looks very nice!</li>
            <li> I bought this unit per my doctor and physical therapist for my hand. I&#x27;ve had 3 surgeries on my hand in the last year so when I finally got the 9 pins out of my hand and everything was healed up I thought it would be a good idea to use it for my hand therapy. Well I brought it out and plugged it in and guess what yep it doesn&#x27;t work. I used it 4 times and that was it.  Not happy at all with having to pay the price for the unit and wax and only got to use it 4 times.</li>
            <li> I needed a paraffin bath to help relieve my hand pain. I am suffering from CRPS and the paraffin bath has helped to warm my hand before exercises. I got this unit because it was lightweight and seemed easy to operate. I have not been disappointed. From a cold state, the wax heats up in about 2 hours to 65 degrees C. That&#x27;s too hot to use, so after the wax has melted, you re-set the temp to about 48 to 50 degrees C. This takes about another hour, or you can leave the lid askew and it will happen more quickly. Remember that hot wax can be very dangerous if spilled, so use extreme caution with melted wax! The unit maintains the temperature until you reset it or turn it off. This means that if you leave the unit at the higher temp for a prolonged period (several hours, like I did), the wax may discolor. That&#x27;s the only fault I have with this unit, no way to set a shut-off time. But it was my fault the wax was left too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a plastic plate that rests in the bottom of the tank to prevent you from touching the hot bottom. The outside of the unit remains cool when the unit is on. I&#x27;m glad that it didn&#x27;t come with wax because I wanted to buy my own. To fill the tank to an appropriate level with melted wax will take about 6 lbs of wax. You will also need to purchase bags for wrapping your waxed hand. I then wrap my bagged hand in a towel. Whether you put your used wax back into the unit is a personal sanitation choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the unit every day, sometimes twice a day, for a month with no problems.</li>
            <li> This unit takes a while to warm up, 1 to 2 hours depending on how hot you set the temperature. Once its warm though, it works beautifully. My daughter had cracked, bleeding hands until she started using this product. Now her hands are soft, supple and gorgeous. We use 5 lbs. of unscented paraffin in it. It&#x27;s definitely big enough for a foot. A very good unit. I recommend this product. Oh, and don&#x27;t forget to break the paraffin into little chunks so it will melt faster! (It&#x27;s in the directions but who reads those!) My sister-in-law uses one of these for Rheumatoid Arthritis in her hands. She says it relieves the pain a little and helps her mobility in the morning.</li>
            <li> It barely heats and I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have this at home! I love it!  I will need to buy more wax though as the tub is larger than I thought, which is even better! Very easy to use!</li>
