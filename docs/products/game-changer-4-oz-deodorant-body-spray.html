            <li>One quick spray on the neck and it smelled great.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite sprays that I&#x27;ve ever used and not a lot of people know about</li>
            <li>This is an excellent, second to none, product.</li>
            <li>im glad i did</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love curve</li>
            <li>this stuff is potent and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>For a cheap body spray this smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I like it better than I like his designer cologne.</li>
            <li>&quot; Wow, you smell good!  </li>
            <li>she doesnt like womens scents this was very clean smelling not to strong or over welming</li>
            <li>this spray that on your neck in your good the whole day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It starts out strong of course, but within 15 minutes it mellowed out to where I couldn&#x27;t smell it (which is a rule everyone should follow).</li>
            <li>The scent is sweet and sexy.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is soft and clean, good because many colognes trigger headaches for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, smells good, and never gets old.</li>
            <li>I really really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product,smells very nice,crisp,clean and is very worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Even when I stole some to spray on my self one day some of my girl friends were like wow that smells nice.     </li>
            <li>Pay less and get great smell....</li>
            <li>, so i bought 6 cans an i know for a fact i will be coming back to buy six more before i run out!</li>
            <li>While it has a nice scent, reminiscent of Curve, there is a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body spray (what this review is being written for)</li>
            <li>and i personally like it better than the original curve and curve crush plus its allot cheaper.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it smells really similar to curve; however, it doesn&#x27;t last that long and its not as strong as the original</li>
            <li>I was looking for more of a deodorant, but it is definitely geared towards \\&quot;body fragrance\\&quot;, which immediately drew me to the dreaded conclusion of AXE!</li>
            <li>Its going to take some time to do that, wearing it each day and making sure to put on about the same amount, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me tell you that this smells almost exactly like the real thing for a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>good strong stuff a little goes a very long way</li>
            <li>/&gt;The very first time I wore this young lady asked\\</li>
            <li>I still find that the smaller bottles (.5) still contain a very nice strong scent but anything larger seems to be diffused down.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more of it in the future.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this for men who want the ladies to notice.&lt;br /&gt;Gunner  September, 2013</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other Curve scents but this product does indeed smell like a Curve product, just not the original.</li>
            <li>discovered this body spray locally and picked it up on a whim since I was weary of purchasing another bottle of Curve and the first day that I wore it, I once again started getting the compliments that I once had got wearing Curve a couple of years ago</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s does not small at all as before.</li>
            <li>Steer clear of their spray cologne version though.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best-smelling scent of their collection.</li>
            <li>Of course this is something for everyday use; for those special occasions, keep that arm-and-a-leg cologne close.</li>
            <li>It begins very bitter, then sours, and finally settles on a musky clean scent, kind of like some of those expensive colognes I&#x27;ve been paying for...</li>
            <li>Used to be available at Walmart, but seems to be off the shelf lately.</li>
            <li>On price I give this product 5 stars but on scent I&#x27;d rate this product at 4.5 stars, because it&#x27;s VERY similar to the Liz Claiborne product, but doesn&#x27;t quite match it, at least the original Curve</li>

            <li> am calculating the cost difference/savings of purchasing the smaller bottles of the original Curve compared to the aerosol version of Game Changer.</li>
            <li> This used to be such a good product but have been disappointed with my last order.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Throughout the day though, I&#x27;ve been getting compliments left and right; they ask what it is and where to get it, but I haven&#x27;t revealed my secret yet.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I sprayed this on one wrist and original Curve on the other and was told that Curve has a slightly cleaner scent where as the Game Changer smelled like a sportier version.</li>
            <li> I hear these Designer Imposters canned versions smell a little different than the bottled versions</li>
            <li> I bought this and a few others by this brand because I was tired of spending some much on a tiny bottle of the real thing.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I do not know if anyone else has noticed (and I hope its not just all in my head), that over the past few years Curve&#x27;s scent strength has went down, at least in certain size bottles.</li>
            <li> The girls all comment on it as well, and you&#x27;ll notice them getting a little closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I swear I hug him a little bit longer when he wears this.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend Game Changer for fans of Curve.</li>
            <li> is DEAD ON, Curve.</li>
            <li> And it just waste of money</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was a little disappointed when it first arrived.</li>
            <li> A pretty quality product, but I&#x27;m disappointed in the price</li>
            <li> This little bottle is my little secret with the girls</li>
            <li> Smile very bad</li>
            <li> From how I&#x27;ve heard Curve Crush described, Game Changer is probably closer to that.</li>
            <li> Game Changer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, fellas, drop the overrated axe and the expensive colognes, get something that won&#x27;t suffocate the poor girl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATTENTION: I was disappointed in the scent likeness of the Game Changer cologne.</li>
            <li> But the price makes me sick.</li>
            <li> , I can assure you that you will not be disappointed in this body spray.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my husband loves these body sprays instead of cologne. We can no longer find this sent in the store so I luv that i can get it online. It is my favorite, so I order a lot...</li>
            <li> On price I give this product 5 stars but on scent I&#x27;d rate this product at 4.5 stars, because it&#x27;s VERY similar to the Liz Claiborne product, but doesn&#x27;t quite match it, at least the original Curve anyway. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other Curve scents but this product does indeed smell like a Curve product, just not the original. I sprayed this on one wrist and original Curve on the other and was told that Curve has a slightly cleaner scent where as the Game Changer smelled like a sportier version. From how I&#x27;ve heard Curve Crush described, Game Changer is probably closer to that. I hear these Designer Imposters canned versions smell a little different than the bottled versions so I&#x27;ll have to look in to that to see if the bottled one is closer to the regular Curve. I definitely recommend Game Changer for fans of Curve.</li>
            <li> I really really enjoy this product. It&#x27;s one of my favorite sprays that I&#x27;ve ever used and not a lot of people know about so it keeps your scent a mystery which is a big turn on for the ladies😉</li>
            <li> I get compliments every time I wear this. The fragrance is soft and clean, good because many colognes trigger headaches for me. Used to be available at Walmart, but seems to be off the shelf lately. Very satisfied with this product, will purchase it here.</li>
            <li> I have to give this product an A+, people have given me great compliments on the scent it gives. People swear it smells like Curve, so if you want Curve without the curve price, here it is.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent, second to none, product. But the price makes me sick. I ordered this before I found it elsewhere (actually it was walmart&#x27;s website) for 2.99. Used to buy this at CVS until they pulled and replaced it with bubble gum flavored body spray, which no one buys.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this product for about three years and i personally like it better than the original curve and curve crush plus its allot cheaper. Every place i used to get it from i would buy about every can they had on display but then it seemed like they never restocked it so i went awhile without any. Until my brother said look on amazon an im glad i did, so i bought 6 cans an i know for a fact i will be coming back to buy six more before i run out!</li>
            <li> It smells great and it smells really similar to curve; however, it doesn&#x27;t last that long and its not as strong as the original one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love curve and you&#x27;re on a budget or you&#x27;re just looking forward to try this scent go for it! I recommend you trying this one. The scent is sweet and sexy.</li>
            <li> Game Changer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I wore this young lady asked\\&quot; Wow, you smell good!  What ARE YOU WEARING?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for men who want the ladies to notice.&lt;br /&gt;Gunner  September, 2013</li>
            <li> smells just like curve but lasts longer on your clothes and skin. Bought this for my gf she doesnt like womens scents this was very clean smelling not to strong or over welming</li>
            <li> I recommend for every men, everyone I have met they like it , and asked for name , and where did I buy it ,</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was a little disappointed when it first arrived. I was looking for more of a deodorant, but it is definitely geared towards \\&quot;body fragrance\\&quot;, which immediately drew me to the dreaded conclusion of AXE! However, I bought it so I used it. One quick spray on the neck and it smelled great. It begins very bitter, then sours, and finally settles on a musky clean scent, kind of like some of those expensive colognes I&#x27;ve been paying for...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts out strong of course, but within 15 minutes it mellowed out to where I couldn&#x27;t smell it (which is a rule everyone should follow). Throughout the day though, I&#x27;ve been getting compliments left and right; they ask what it is and where to get it, but I haven&#x27;t revealed my secret yet. The girls all comment on it as well, and you&#x27;ll notice them getting a little closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, fellas, drop the overrated axe and the expensive colognes, get something that won&#x27;t suffocate the poor girl. Of course this is something for everyday use; for those special occasions, keep that arm-and-a-leg cologne close.</li>
            <li> I do not know if anyone else has noticed (and I hope its not just all in my head), that over the past few years Curve&#x27;s scent strength has went down, at least in certain size bottles. I still find that the smaller bottles (.5) still contain a very nice strong scent but anything larger seems to be diffused down. I have tried investigating to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered this body spray locally and picked it up on a whim since I was weary of purchasing another bottle of Curve and the first day that I wore it, I once again started getting the compliments that I once had got wearing Curve a couple of years ago (anecdotal evidence but synchronistic). So I kept using it and the compliments kept coming. I ran out of the body spray and put an order in for the spray cologne...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATTENTION: I was disappointed in the scent likeness of the Game Changer cologne. While it has a nice scent, reminiscent of Curve, there is a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body spray (what this review is being written for) is DEAD ON, Curve. So do yourself a favor and bypass the cologne spray by the same name and stick with this body spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am calculating the cost difference/savings of purchasing the smaller bottles of the original Curve compared to the aerosol version of Game Changer. Its going to take some time to do that, wearing it each day and making sure to put on about the same amount, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, from a discriminating, longtime wearer of Curve, I can assure you that you will not be disappointed in this body spray. They nailed the scent here. Steer clear of their spray cologne version though.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for husband or boyfriend. The scent is wonderful. I will continue a supply when my husband runs low.</li>
            <li> This little bottle is my little secret with the girls lol. They eat this s*** up. It&#x27;s cheap, smells good, and never gets old.</li>
            <li> I bought this and a few others by this brand because I was tired of spending some much on a tiny bottle of the real thing.  Let me tell you that this smells almost exactly like the real thing for a lot cheaper. A little goes a long way this stuff is potent and lasts all day. I don&#x27;t think you will be upset that you bought it!!!!</li>
            <li> For a cheap body spray this smells amazing. The smell lasts for a long time. I would definitely recommend this body spray.</li>
            <li> Love this product,smells very nice,crisp,clean and is very worth the purchase.I will definitely purchase more of it in the future.</li>
            <li> CHEAPEST BUT THE GREATEST IVE EVER HAD#</li>
            <li> Very happy with my product and the speedy service.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best-smelling scent of their collection. I will definitely keep buying this.</li>
            <li> Smile very bad I had to through them away And it just waste of money I do not recommend it to any one</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body spray for my boyfriend to use after we work out. I picked this stuff up at Walmart AND LET ME TELL YOU this stuff smells great. I swear I hug him a little bit longer when he wears this. I like it better than I like his designer cologne. Even when I stole some to spray on my self one day some of my girl friends were like wow that smells nice.     Get it guys!</li>
            <li> Nice deo,,, cheap price and smells great..... I recommend this product.... received some good comments on this. Pay less and get great smell....</li>
            <li> It smells alright. The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> good strong stuff a little goes a very long way this spray that on your neck in your good the whole day.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of Curve, this is a close replacement. A pretty quality product, but I&#x27;m disappointed in the price - Walmart has it online and in stores for about 1/4 of the price here ($2.98).</li>
            <li> The nozzle broke the second time my husband used it.</li>
            <li> This used to be such a good product but have been disappointed with my last order. Not only they increase the price and it&#x27;s does not small at all as before. I will not buy it anymore</li>
