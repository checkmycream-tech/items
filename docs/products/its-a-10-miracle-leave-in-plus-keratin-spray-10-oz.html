            <li>I am confident this &amp;#34;little blue bottle&amp;#34; will soon become my best secret to achieving healthy, long, and shinning hair.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the better vendors.</li>
            <li>so I advise to be conservative at first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 days and my hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Love it... have recomended it to all my family and friend and now I buy it here in USA and take back to UK and POrtugal for every one else who is now using it..</li>
            <li>That is, I can&#x27;t reproduce the look I have when I first leave the salon</li>
            <li>stylist recommended this the first time I got a Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>My hair was full, soft and seemed thicker.</li>
            <li>My hair gets super soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair and this product is great to use in lieu of conditioner which usually weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li>so I alternate using this &amp; my light moroccanoil.</li>
            <li>Help keep hair managed and under control very well.</li>
            <li>the price is so much cheaper at amazon</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair very manageable.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li>However, if I use too much or get too close to the roots, I don&#x27;t like the look</li>
            <li>My hands are a pretty normal size, so</li>
            <li>(and I don&#x27;t visit the salon very often).&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product from Amazon in the past year, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Worth the extra that it cost.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>This product leave my hair very soft and manage with a shine.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, after using this product, with using no straightening irons or damaging heat styling tools, my hair had more breakage and dryness than it did originally.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft and manageable and shiny too!  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft!</li>
            <li>It may be a bit heavy for fine hair-</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It was reducing my natural curls and I was experiencing scalp irritation/itchiness at times.</li>
            <li>Leave&#x27;s my hair feeling soft, and detangled.</li>
            <li>I never would have thought a leave-in conditioner would also act as a styling product for my natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>I bleach my hair and this product has made my hair silky and soft again.  </li>
            <li>, both of my girls are African-American princesses with natural hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft with this product.</li>
            <li>this early salt immersion, the effects of the keratin treatment lasted for about three months.</li>
            <li>I continued to spray my freshly washed wet hair with it every time, sometimes drying and styling, sometimes just letting it air dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, but not extremely so</li>
            <li>, My hair is in between fine and thick because I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I have found by spraying it directly to the hair it can apply too much and often weight it down.</li>
            <li>I paid $30 for this thinking that the price is due to the fact that it really works, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now this next information makes it something in general that I just wouldn&#x27;t want to put it anywhere....</li>
            <li>Spray it on &amp; can comb my long, thick, fine hair with no tangles or pulling.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and this adds the body and shine I so need after years of chemo with Cancer</li>

            <li> , My hair is in between fine and thick because I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I have found by spraying it directly to the hair it can apply too much and often weight it down.</li>
            <li> I paid $30 for this thinking that the price is due to the fact that it really works, but</li>

            <li> I have long hair that I straighten often</li>

            <li> I thought that this will be the answer to my dry, damaged and brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I recomend this product to all the ladies with dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product is not greasy at all and definitely doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  </li>

            <li> Was a little disappointed with the fragrance, the regular one(purple lid) smells much better</li>
            <li> the bottle is super slippery and shaped in such a way that it&#x27;s impossible to hold on to.  </li>
            <li> Other people have written about other products, but none compare pricewise.  </li>
            <li> If you have fine and fickle hair and are afraid to use conditioner, fear no more!  </li>
            <li> I use it on my granddaughter whose hair is extremely long thick and curly.</li>
            <li> I have wasted my money on a lot of hair products thinking that it would solve my hair issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I never use conditioner because it weights down my hair, makes it look greasy and near impossible to style</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s A 10 for the past 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have hair way past my shoulders and this size</li>
            <li> No more frizz, dryness, dullness.&lt;br</li>

            <li> My hair was dull and dry, frizzy and just went a bit crazy</li>
            <li> no... I just wasted my money :(</li>
            <li> Expensive, but has saved my permed + colored hair!  </li>
            <li> I was having issues! :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with this version of the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I have ever used, it&#x27;s so good I ac tually got my HAIRDRESSER  to start using it and her comments was the same, it&#x27;s the best!!</li>
            <li> I have long hair that I straighten often and I have a partial hair perm done once a year, My hair is in between fine and thick because I have a lot of it. This keeps my hair healthy and strong. For those who dye their hair or style their hair and use a lot of product that can be damaging, the added Keratin with help repair your hair. You apply this product better if you spray it in your hands and rub it into the hair. I have found by spraying it directly to the hair it can apply too much and often weight it down. Apply it while wet so as you expose your hair to any heat your hair is protected. This is by far the best price I have seen for this product at the 10 oz. I have thrown everything else out and now only use this now. If they ever stop making it I’m screwed.</li>
            <li> Is very good, perfect</li>
            <li> Tried a lot of conditioners.  This is by far the very best.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny.  Have recommended this to as many people as I can.</li>
            <li> I have this product that I purchased at a local salon that I loved. Then I bought the larger size here on amazon. It doesn&#x27;t smell the same and its has made my hair brittle. The original bottle, bought locally, was fantastic. My hair was full, soft and seemed thicker. Now its dry, brittle and looks damaged. I&#x27;m very unhappy with this version of the product. In case you are questioning me, I still had some left in the smaller bottle. I was planning to save it for when I travel...so I have had both products to compare side by side.</li>
            <li> I love all It&#x27;s a 10 products. My hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own and will frizz the moment I walk outside. It&#x27;s a 10 is the only product that I found that can actually tame it. I would recommend every it&#x27;s a 10 product. I love the fact that it has keratin in it as well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using this product, with using no straightening irons or damaging heat styling tools, my hair had more breakage and dryness than it did originally. It was reducing my natural curls and I was experiencing scalp irritation/itchiness at times. Not so happy about this, I decided to check out the ingredients and here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Methylisothiazolinone is a widely-used preservative; has been associated with allergic reactions. Lab studies on the brain cells of mammals also suggest that methylisothiazolinone may be neurotoxic - and I&#x27;m putting it on my head?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Methylchloroisothiazolinone is a Human skin toxicant and is also linked to cancer. Ummmm, A human skin toxicant in a product that is again - going on my head????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this next information makes it something in general that I just wouldn&#x27;t want to put it anywhere....on any part of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Methylparaben AND Butylparaben: Any parabens are oestrogen mimics, and excess oestrogen is a trigger for oestrogen-dependent cancers of the breast, ovary, uterus and testicles, and may even affect fetal development. Scientists analysing breast-cancer tissues have found accumulated parabens in every sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically - NO THANKS and no wonder I was having issues! :(</li>
            <li> My hair stylist always uses this on my hair so I had to buy some. Leaves my hair smelling great and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I thought that this will be the answer to my dry, damaged and brittle hair. But no, it isn&#x27;t. It actually doesn&#x27;t do anything to my hair. My hair is still frizzy. I paid $30 for this thinking that the price is due to the fact that it really works, but no... I just wasted my money :( I have wasted my money on a lot of hair products thinking that it would solve my hair issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have just bought a different hair serum...</li>
            <li> Great product! I will be a repeat customer.  Leaves hair feeling soft and manageable and shiny too!  I have a lot of fine hair and this product is great to use in lieu of conditioner which usually weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li> This product leave my hair very soft and manage with a shine. I recomend this product to all the ladies with dry hair.</li>
            <li> i have had this product for many many months and it is still going strong ! i love the big bottle and love this product. fast shipping &amp; great customer service! BUY IT</li>
            <li> I use this product right after I wash my hair and it makes my hair very soft. I also have the treatment from this same brand and I love it!</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed with the fragrance, the regular one(purple lid) smells much better but overall, it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, and feels good in your hair. It may be a bit heavy for fine hair- so I alternate using this &amp; my light moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> Great leave-In conditioner!</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the better vendors. A+ shopping experience; top quality product; super fast service. I would recommend them without reservation.</li>
            <li> Help keep hair managed and under control very well.</li>
            <li> Best product in the world for hair that is coarse or for young children with longer hair. I use it on my granddaughter whose hair is extremely long thick and curly. Works as a set angler and keeps her hair healthy and strong! I also use it for myself!</li>
            <li> I luv It&#x27;s a 10 products.  Expensive, but has saved my permed + colored hair!  Other people have written about other products, but none compare pricewise.  If it&#x27;s 3x the price, it BETTER be better.  If u can find anything else that works as well for this price, I&#x27;d like to know!</li>
            <li> Leave&#x27;s my hair feeling soft, and detangled. Plus&lt;br /&gt;it smells great.....the price is so much cheaper at amazon..give it a try.</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever! Gets rid of all knots in hair, leaves hair silky smooth and hair smelling so good.</li>
            <li> I never would have thought a leave-in conditioner would also act as a styling product for my natural curly hair. I&#x27;ve always used a mousse or gel to style my curls, but this product does it all. . . and smells great!</li>
            <li> High,y recommend this product.  I bleach my hair and this product has made my hair silky and soft again.  Use in the morning and occasionally at night to just brush it through my hair.  Great smell too.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to stop my hair (Indian hair extensions) from matting.  It worked great so I decided to use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair, both of my girls are African-American princesses with natural hair.  It did wonders for my oldest child, the hair was soft to the touch and very easy to manage.  The youngest, not so lucky.  Every product is not for everyone, but I will keep this on hand for it works for my oldest daughter and I will continue to look for that one great product for my youngest daughter.</li>
            <li> I love how this product detangles my hair and protects it.  I will definitely be buying more!  Smells good too!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and well worth the money.  It makes your hair shiny and easy to manage.  You can add water to diute the product and it still works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It smells good, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and is great as a detangler. I will buy again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this product from both the drugstore and this seller on amazon - I would DEFINITELY buy from Amazon. It is WAY cheaper than in the store, and I had no issues with quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It helps with dry, fly away hair. It leaves your hair very manageable. You don&#x27;t have to use much.The shampoo is wonderful, too! Both last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using It&#x27;s A 10 for the past 6 months. I really think its a wonderful products that has left my hair feeling and looking very healthy. Would also recommend the seller because I received the product very quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li> I love everything I&#x27;ve tried by it&#x27;s a 10! This one is no different, it&#x27;s very light and that&#x27;s all I use on my hair before blow drying and flat ironing it, it leaves it very smooth! I just put some extra oil on the ends and that&#x27;s it! (Btw, my hair is thick, heavy and wavy!)</li>
            <li> Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Used this product for a couple of years &amp; don&#x27;t plan to stop! Spray it on &amp; can comb my long, thick, fine hair with no tangles or pulling.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month now on my transitioning relaxed hair. It&#x27;s amazing in how soft it leaves my hair feeling immediately after its application. Myself and beautician have noticed greater strength and shine to my hair. I am confident this &amp;#34;little blue bottle&amp;#34; will soon become my best secret to achieving healthy, long, and shinning hair. This is definitely one of the best hair products that I have used in my life thus far.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> This is a must have for anyone who heat styles or dyes their hair. I have given this away as gifts because I love it so much. It also helps to replace multiple hair products ( leave in conditioner, thermal heat protector, strenthening sprays etc.) This product smells great and delivers great results. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I love the product; however, a lot of it was lost in shipping.  There was no cap on the pump so there was a ton of product oozing from it when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> I love thise product, i use it almost every day it helps keep my hair shiny and healthy, good stuff! try it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, great detangler and smells fantastic.  I just spray a bit at a time and work it in to my hair then let it sit a minute before combing through.  However, if I use too much or get too close to the roots, I don&#x27;t like the look so I advise to be conservative at first.  I have hair way past my shoulders and this size lasted me about a year.&lt;br /&gt;I knocked a star off because of the bottle.  If my hands are the least bit wet or I get any product on them the bottle is super slippery and shaped in such a way that it&#x27;s impossible to hold on to.  My hands are a pretty normal size, so I don&#x27;t think this is a case of genetics.  I want to grip the bottle and spray it with one hand, while I work it in with the other hand, but unless the hand on the bottle is totally dry I can&#x27;t do it.  Ok, yes I could keep grabbing a dry towel, but they could also make the bottle narrower at the top so it is more ergonomic.  This size is definitely more economical, but I found the 4oz travel bottle much more user friendly so I just keep refilling it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have been ordering it for over a year.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy, or coated, just manageable.  Will continue to buy it.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product.  As they named it, it&#x27;s a 10!</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my hair.  Detangles with no effort and has aided in hair growth.  Worth the extra that it cost.</li>
            <li> amazing! I love this stuff so I bought the shampoo and the conditioner. I started getting compliments on the improvement of the health of my hair the next day. It was shiny but not greasy, held styles better and was lighter in weight. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I love love love this leave in conditioner with keratin. Will be purchasing again after I run out. My hair is so soft with this product.</li>
            <li> the best hair product out there i swear by it! My hair has never been so soft! A must have!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I just couldn&#x27;t help it this time.  My hair dresser recommended this product to me.  I never use conditioner because it weights down my hair, makes it look greasy and near impossible to style BUT this product doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 days and my hair has never looked better.  It looks fuller and holds a curl.  This product is not greasy at all and definitely doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  If you have fine and fickle hair and are afraid to use conditioner, fear no more!  Your search has ended with It&#x27;s a 10!</li>
            <li> Love it... have recomended it to all my family and friend and now I buy it here in USA and take back to UK and POrtugal for every one else who is now using it.. Great on long hair, makes it real easy to comb.</li>
            <li> I love all it&#x27;s a 10 products - never use anything better and believe me I tried. My hair gets super soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I love this product called &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 + Keratin Leave-In Conditioner&amp;#34;.  I started using it when I had shoulder-length hair and once I got it cut and stopped using it, I missed the smell of it and the texture it gave my hair.  So I ordered more and continue to use it every time I wash my hair (which is every morning). I will not let myself run out of my &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> I always buy the It&#x27;s A 10 original product.  I decided to try this one with Keritin, and I don&#x27;t love it like I love the other kind.  Especially the smell.  After this is gone, I&#x27;ll be going back to the regular It&#x27;s A 10 product because it really is the best.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled with this product...I will never be without it and now my older daughter loves it to!!!  I have fine, thin hair and this adds the body and shine I so need after years of chemo with Cancer this is a big help!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product from Amazon in the past year, and I love it!  I am very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> I love what it&#x27;s doing to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product is just so great. My hair was dull and dry, frizzy and just went a bit crazy no matter what I&#x27;d do with it, until I started using this specific product. I&#x27;m very very pleased. No more frizz, dryness, dullness.&lt;br /&gt;So great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, but not extremely so -- I have waves. It&#x27;s also very fine, and colored. And I have split ends, and it frizzes, especially when it&#x27;s humid. I&#x27;ve tried a wide range of products and usually they don&#x27;t do much. That is, I can&#x27;t reproduce the look I have when I first leave the salon (and I don&#x27;t visit the salon very often).&lt;br /&gt;My stylist recommended this the first time I got a Keratin treatment. I blanched at the price in the local beauty supply store, but bought it. I was about to spend ten days in the Caribbean and the salt water was going to destroy the expensive treatment I&#x27;d just had (I didn&#x27;t know that or I wouldn&#x27;t have done it then!).&lt;br /&gt;During the trip I saturated my hair with it before going swimming and rinsed with fresh water as soon as I got out. I was amazed at how nice my hair looked and felt after air drying.&lt;br /&gt;Despite this early salt immersion, the effects of the keratin treatment lasted for about three months. I continued to spray my freshly washed wet hair with it every time, sometimes drying and styling, sometimes just letting it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m too heavy handed, it does weigh down my hair, but as long as I exercise restraint, my hair looks and feels silky and smooth. Even after the keratin treatment wore off. And the frizzies are dramatically reduced. I&#x27;ll continue to use it despite the cost.</li>
