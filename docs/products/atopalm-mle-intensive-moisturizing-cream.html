            <li>It&#x27;s a great all around moisturizer that balances the skin and replenishes skin lipids.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Autopalm for over a month and love it!!  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>: I am deducting 1 star from my rating because a HUGE factor in my review reflecting 5 stars was the fact that it is a wonderful product at an EXTREAMLY affordable price (between $15-18).</li>
            <li>Loved it and it was cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Good service.</li>
            <li>it smells so good</li>
            <li>It spreads surprisingly well, considering that, though.  </li>
            <li>CeraVe is also good</li>
            <li>It has a cooling effect, is remarkably soothing and an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Nothing exceptional about this stuff.  </li>

            <li>This cream is fantastic!!   </li>
            <li>This stuff is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>and it feels amazing on the skin, so</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I hadn&#x27;t seen it with my own eyes.</li>
            <li>It soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy like eucerin or aquaphore.</li>
            <li>but this is so effective I had to write a review.</li>
            <li>I started out with one side Atopalm and one side the prescription, and after a week the Autopalm side was as good or better than the prescription side.  </li>
            <li>skin nicely and can be used as an under makeup moisturizer too.</li>
            <li>I also liked the under makeup moisturizer for during the day.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this excellent product.</li>
            <li>i live in the NE, this is the best.  </li>
            <li>It is, hands-down, the most effective moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>A very light or unnoticeable scent.</li>
            <li>It is a large tub for a great price.</li>
            <li>This immediately alleviated any discomfort.</li>
            <li>My skin noticeably looks better, brighter, and healthier.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE</li>
            <li>I found others on amazon that works better.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light fragrance and texture and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>so I personally am glad they changed it.  </li>
            <li>Love this cream.  </li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Non greasy, I swear it works overnight :)</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It really make my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for layering over absorbent serums in wintertime, especially in the evenings.  </li>
            <li>Will re order when I need more.</li>
            <li>I love this face lotion for winter and summer.  </li>
            <li>I love Autopalm</li>
            <li>all better.</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ve been using this ever since and we absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>that were better.</li>
            <li>and I can use this cream on top if it and my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated.</li>
            <li>It has no parabens which I love</li>
            <li>Since breast cancer runs in my family, I&#x27;m very familiar with the endocrine-disrupting properties of parabens</li>
            <li>The formula seems pretty good -</li>
            <li>I loved this cream the first time I used it-</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li>I think this would also be an excellent foot balm for dry,</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer for dry, irritated skin!  </li>
            <li>and it is a very good night cream for moisturizing and softening facial skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best for sensitive skin, but I really want it to work because I love the scent.</li>
            <li>The good news is that it is gentle.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive, very fair and prone to redness.</li>
            <li>It has a very clean, light scent.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered other ATOPALM products and find them all to be superb.  </li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer on the market for rosacia, really takes away the redness and offers a lot of moisture to the skin.</li>
            <li>Can apply makeup easily</li>
            <li>you have super dry skin, the thickness of this product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a neck moisturizer primarily, but also works well on areas of my face as well as the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li>I like its light creamy texture, and it feels smooth and cooling when applied.</li>
            <li>does, but they do not sell Atopalm anymore which is ashame as all my freinds over here would purchase the item if it were free delivery.</li>
            <li>But hey, what a fantastic cream  </li>
            <li>The makeup glides on effortlessly and the moisturizing cream gives me a smooth non-oily look.</li>
            <li>We all laugh at all its seemingly magical uses.</li>
            <li>It Has a very sticky kind of feel</li>
            <li>A good moisturizing cream for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, no smell, and provides very nice moisture.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best dry hand cream on the market, and</li>
            <li>The Intensive Formula is really rich</li>
            <li>If the formula has changed, I hope they return to the original one.  </li>
            <li>I usually add niacinamide to it to make my perfect face cream.</li>
            <li>Atopalm is THE BEST I&#x27;ve found for simply moisturizing completely without causing breakouts or leaving any oily feeling or film on my skin.</li>
            <li>This cream is great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My doctor daughter got me started using this amazing cream, so great for dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I immediately put burn gel on the burn and a special gel bandage.</li>
            <li>Works great on very dry spots or areas that are a bit irritated.  </li>
            <li>hard winter, great product for your skin!!</li>
            <li>This may be a great product, but it dulls the skin tone.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is perfect for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is great for someone who is extremely sensitive to pretty much everything.  </li>
            <li>It feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super software and supple.</li>
            <li>Luckily I received a trial size of Autopalm&#x27;s MLE Intensive Moisturizing Cream and started placing it on the scab.</li>
            <li>I was quick to purchase after trying it at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>This quickly dries into skin.  </li>
            <li>Had been mildly scented but now I think it smells like, maybe, eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn, even if my skin is already irritated.</li>
            <li>previously used Loreal which I was quite happy with.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic moisturizer, you can really feel how its absorbed by your skin, its not oily and stays fresh.</li>
            <li>The only creams I liked to use for my face was Philosophy, L&#x27;Occitaine, or Olay&#x27;s Regenerest.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cool and refreshing, does take a little longer to sink into skin, but overall, it&#x27;s a good cream for the money.  </li>
            <li>It soaks right in without feeling sticky, greasy, or oily so your skin looks like healthy, matte, clean skin not like you&#x27;ve just left the sauna.</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;m staying right here with this Atopalm.</li>
            <li>This is a great intensive moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered the trial size and fell in love with it instantly after my first use!</li>
            <li>The new Atopalm is a fine moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin but doesn&#x27;t clear up my rash as effectively as the old formula, so now I&#x27;m alternating between the prescription steroid and</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin even in the summer and have found this to be an extremely effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The 3oz jar of atopalm should last a good while (2 months maybe a little more) and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>The best cream if you have sensitive skin, acne, dry patch, dark circle under your eyes and fine lines.</li>
            <li>first bought this at ulta.  </li>
            <li>for now, i put this on first and a separate sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Atopalm is great not only for people with sensitive skin but for those with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on my skin since starting.</li>
            <li>Now that is $30, I will definitely use it more sparingly and I have cancelled my 2 month subscription.</li>
            <li>I first used this when I was given it as a sample from another online store.</li>
            <li>but it is very moisturizing!  </li>
            <li>This is my second favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This would work for the first day or 2, but then the lotion would sit on my skin instead of soak in</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even a third of the way through my first jar and just ordered another one to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>Seven days later the condition is gone and my skin looks even better than before.  </li>
            <li>i actually bought this cream for my daughter when she was having a baby acne around 3 months and it worked like a magic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream for several years now and love it.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and healthy again after about 3 weeks of my new routine.  </li>
            <li>There are better and less costly products available.</li>
            <li>It keep my face soft and I don&#x27;t feel very greasy or smell strong perfume.</li>
            <li>Very good as a basic everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This really didn&#x27;t help me very much.</li>
            <li>This ATOPALM cream is truly a miracle, lightweight yet very moisturizing, and it smells very fresh and natural.  </li>
            <li>It gets super dry and flakey in some places (around my nose and mouth mostly), gets oily in other places, and breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>This cream is very emollient, and at the same time every morning my skin look very good with no irritations which were common before.</li>
            <li>It is fast absorbing, gentle and scent-free.</li>
            <li>really works.  </li>
            <li>and it really helped.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a difference either.</li>
            <li>but it is very pricey.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m still looking for what I really want.  </li>
            <li>Who wants that?  </li>
            <li>My only dissapointment was the postage as \\&quot;free delivery\\&quot; over $25, does not include Europe whereas Amazon .co.uk  </li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s one that really works.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work out for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li>The Atopalm cream is non-greasy and very soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping though.</li>
            <li>This really stays in place, doesn&#x27;t run, etc.  </li>
            <li>So if you need something very moisturizing but not too heavy this will do nicely.</li>
            <li>To top it off, in the last two years I developed eczema around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Some seem to work ok over time for different reasons - some lesson fine lines, some lighten dark circles, some brighten, etc.</li>
            <li>It seems to work fine for my normal areas, though I doubt people looking for deep moisturizers are in need of something like that.</li>
            <li>This product is rich enough in moisture, without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive and dry skin and have tried many lotions.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and was reasonably priced, however I wish for the earlier version.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to discover that the Atopalm cleared up the rash just as well, if not better, than the steroid cream my dermatologist had given me.</li>
            <li>You can get a better products at any drug store for less money.  </li>
            <li>I found this as a free sample and in 7 days my dry skin was healed.</li>
            <li>I have lots of contact allergies and this cream is mild enough for me to use on my face.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find the fragrance particularly noticeable.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, and will continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend ATOPLAM to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying it.</li>
            <li>And while I prefer unscented lotions just due to my skin being sensitive, I&#x27;m so glad I gave this one a chance.</li>
            <li>I think once it gets warmed up a bit by your body temperature, it thins a little or becomes more workable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as thick, and it has a pronounced scent I don&#x27;t recall it having before.</li>
            <li>By the way, I&#x27;m a 67 year old man that has worked outside most of my life and should have skin like leather, believe me moisturizing (both prescription and Autopalm) makes a big difference.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use it all over but mostly for trouble spots.</li>
            <li>My skin is normal</li>
            <li>and once a week I use [[ASIN:B0017MO8AS St. Ives Timeless Skin Daily Microdermabrasion 4 oz (113 g)]] to keep my skin fresh and new.</li>
            <li>The dry, flakey patches on my face were gone within a day, it hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all, and a recent attempt by my lovely friend eczema to flare up on my eyelid got nipped in the bud at the outset and went away within a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to Atopalm.</li>
            <li>I like to try new products - but one of them is always Atopalm Intensive Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li>I got this product because I have Rosacea and very sensitive skin, every product i have tried before irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and prone to allergic flare-ups.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I burned a small section of my arm when it touched an incandescent light bulb (one reason why I&#x27;m switching to LEDs!).</li>
            <li>At first I thought this product would be just the same because of the \\&quot;intensive moisturizing\\&quot; label but</li>
            <li>The product was nothing special , have use other cremes  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time because it&#x27;s a very thick cream but works great if you have oily and/or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have VERY DRY and sensitive skin and about 1 yr ago developed mild adult acne.</li>
            <li>Great Cream,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other moisturizing creams in the past that left my skin feeling and looking greasy, but not with ATOPALM.</li>
            <li>Have had pink-hued dry skin and seborrheic dermatitis for several years, and have until now been plagued by unsatisfactory moisturizers that either were too rich and caused blemishes, or stung my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, doesn&#x27;t clog pores at all, not greasy, and also keeps skin from flaking and drying out during the day.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 46 years old.</li>
            <li>Proceed with caution if your skin is on the sensitive side, and use sparingly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 39 and have always had extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am 45 years old &amp; wish that I knew about this product a decade ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an interesting take on a moisturizer, using a lot of natural fatty acids as the major ingredients (it does contain a bit of silicone -- dimethicone -- but not a lot, it&#x27;s pretty far down in the ingredients</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t purchase products after receiving trial sizes but in this case within two days of using the trial size I bought a full size jar!</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Those who complain about the new formula, I had a container of the old formula and compared and the only difference was that it no longer had parabens.</li>
            <li>It quickly repairs all rough spots, and strangely enough it has also removed body &amp;#34;tags&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Usually fragrance is the culprit in skincare products that irritate my eyes but even fragrance free ones have made my eyes water.</li>
            <li>The PH is gentle and its moisturizing properties are terrific because it contains humectants, occlusives, and emollients--the big 3 moisturizer categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for dry, sensitive skin types and if you need to switch up your winter skin care regimen</li>
            <li>Better late than never!</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin and use a different product after cleaning my face, but I always follow up with Atopalm after the first layer soaks in.  </li>
            <li>This cream is very soothing; helps heal very dry spots even on your face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally need a heavier lotion except after a chemical peel or during winter and this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li>Within two days my scab was gone and you can barely notice my burn mark.</li>
            <li>My face is so soft and I look 10 years younger, I am told.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural red head</li>
            <li>Also, it apparently removed bumps</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Very nourishing moisturizer for extra dry areas of skin like knees and elbows, would definately recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day, has a very soft, clean smell and you only need a very small amount.    </li>
            <li>the price is reasonable exceptionally good people with bad rosacea and dry skin</li>
            <li>It has a subtle lemony smell and goes on smooth without that heavy/greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I like that this product does not contain parabens and artificial dyes, which makes it nice for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and quick results within a day or so.</li>
            <li>some very expensive and some over the counter that had good reviews.</li>
            <li>If you have dry, sensitive skin and are prone to eczema/dermatitis</li>
            <li>If you have irritated, dry, sensitive skin this would be the one to try.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this for my sensitive dry skin and I am never going back!</li>
            <li>I have dry and sensitive skin especially in a winter.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin in the winter time and this cream always keeps my skin soft and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li>I have recently developed very dry skin and have found Atopalm to be a jar of relief from flakey skin.</li>
            <li>so my skin is very dry and sensitive.</li>

            <li> so was happy to read that.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s great to use as a night cream).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great all around moisturizer that balances the skin and replenishes skin lipids.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Autopalm for over a month and love it!!  </li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> : I am deducting 1 star from my rating because a HUGE factor in my review reflecting 5 stars was the fact that it is a wonderful product at an EXTREAMLY affordable price (between $15-18).</li>
            <li> Loved it and it was cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good service.</li>
            <li> it smells so good</li>
            <li> It spreads surprisingly well, considering that, though.  </li>
            <li> CeraVe is also good</li>
            <li> It has a cooling effect, is remarkably soothing and an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nothing exceptional about this stuff.  </li>

            <li> This stuff is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> and it feels amazing on the skin, so</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I hadn&#x27;t seen it with my own eyes.</li>
            <li> It soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy like eucerin or aquaphore.</li>
            <li> but this is so effective I had to write a review.</li>
            <li> I started out with one side Atopalm and one side the prescription, and after a week the Autopalm side was as good or better than the prescription side.  </li>
            <li> skin nicely and can be used as an under makeup moisturizer too.</li>
            <li> I also liked the under makeup moisturizer for during the day.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this excellent product.</li>
            <li> i live in the NE, this is the best.  </li>
            <li> It is, hands-down, the most effective moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> A very light or unnoticeable scent.</li>
            <li> It is a large tub for a great price.</li>
            <li> This immediately alleviated any discomfort.</li>
            <li> My skin noticeably looks better, brighter, and healthier.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> IT LOVE</li>
            <li> I found others on amazon that works better.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light fragrance and texture and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> so I personally am glad they changed it.  </li>
            <li> Love this cream.  </li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Non greasy, I swear it works overnight :)</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It really make my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for layering over absorbent serums in wintertime, especially in the evenings.  </li>
            <li> Will re order when I need more.</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion for winter and summer.  </li>
            <li> I love Autopalm</li>
            <li> all better.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve been using this ever since and we absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> that were better.</li>
            <li> and I can use this cream on top if it and my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated.</li>
            <li> It has no parabens which I love</li>
            <li> Since breast cancer runs in my family, I&#x27;m very familiar with the endocrine-disrupting properties of parabens</li>
            <li> The formula seems pretty good -</li>
            <li> I loved this cream the first time I used it-</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li> I think this would also be an excellent foot balm for dry,</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer for dry, irritated skin!  </li>
            <li> and it is a very good night cream for moisturizing and softening facial skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best for sensitive skin, but I really want it to work because I love the scent.</li>
            <li> The good news is that it is gentle.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive, very fair and prone to redness.</li>
            <li> It has a very clean, light scent.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered other ATOPALM products and find them all to be superb.  </li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer on the market for rosacia, really takes away the redness and offers a lot of moisture to the skin.</li>
            <li> Can apply makeup easily</li>
            <li> you have super dry skin, the thickness of this product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a neck moisturizer primarily, but also works well on areas of my face as well as the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li> I like its light creamy texture, and it feels smooth and cooling when applied.</li>
            <li> does, but they do not sell Atopalm anymore which is ashame as all my freinds over here would purchase the item if it were free delivery.</li>
            <li> But hey, what a fantastic cream  </li>
            <li> The makeup glides on effortlessly and the moisturizing cream gives me a smooth non-oily look.</li>
            <li> We all laugh at all its seemingly magical uses.</li>
            <li> It Has a very sticky kind of feel</li>
            <li> A good moisturizing cream for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, no smell, and provides very nice moisture.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best dry hand cream on the market, and</li>
            <li> The Intensive Formula is really rich</li>
            <li> If the formula has changed, I hope they return to the original one.  </li>
            <li> I usually add niacinamide to it to make my perfect face cream.</li>
            <li> Atopalm is THE BEST I&#x27;ve found for simply moisturizing completely without causing breakouts or leaving any oily feeling or film on my skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My doctor daughter got me started using this amazing cream, so great for dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I immediately put burn gel on the burn and a special gel bandage.</li>
            <li> Works great on very dry spots or areas that are a bit irritated.  </li>
            <li> hard winter, great product for your skin!!</li>
            <li> This may be a great product, but it dulls the skin tone.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is perfect for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is great for someone who is extremely sensitive to pretty much everything.  </li>
            <li> It feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super software and supple.</li>
            <li> Luckily I received a trial size of Autopalm&#x27;s MLE Intensive Moisturizing Cream and started placing it on the scab.</li>
            <li> I was quick to purchase after trying it at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> This quickly dries into skin.  </li>
            <li> Had been mildly scented but now I think it smells like, maybe, eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn, even if my skin is already irritated.</li>
            <li> previously used Loreal which I was quite happy with.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic moisturizer, you can really feel how its absorbed by your skin, its not oily and stays fresh.</li>
            <li> The only creams I liked to use for my face was Philosophy, L&#x27;Occitaine, or Olay&#x27;s Regenerest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cool and refreshing, does take a little longer to sink into skin, but overall, it&#x27;s a good cream for the money.  </li>
            <li> It soaks right in without feeling sticky, greasy, or oily so your skin looks like healthy, matte, clean skin not like you&#x27;ve just left the sauna.</li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;m staying right here with this Atopalm.</li>
            <li> This is a great intensive moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered the trial size and fell in love with it instantly after my first use!</li>
            <li> The new Atopalm is a fine moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin but doesn&#x27;t clear up my rash as effectively as the old formula, so now I&#x27;m alternating between the prescription steroid and</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin even in the summer and have found this to be an extremely effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The 3oz jar of atopalm should last a good while (2 months maybe a little more) and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> The best cream if you have sensitive skin, acne, dry patch, dark circle under your eyes and fine lines.</li>
            <li> first bought this at ulta.  </li>
            <li> for now, i put this on first and a separate sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Atopalm is great not only for people with sensitive skin but for those with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments on my skin since starting.</li>
            <li> Now that is $30, I will definitely use it more sparingly and I have cancelled my 2 month subscription.</li>
            <li> I first used this when I was given it as a sample from another online store.</li>
            <li> but it is very moisturizing!  </li>
            <li> This is my second favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This would work for the first day or 2, but then the lotion would sit on my skin instead of soak in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even a third of the way through my first jar and just ordered another one to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Seven days later the condition is gone and my skin looks even better than before.  </li>
            <li> i actually bought this cream for my daughter when she was having a baby acne around 3 months and it worked like a magic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for several years now and love it.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and healthy again after about 3 weeks of my new routine.  </li>
            <li> There are better and less costly products available.</li>
            <li> It keep my face soft and I don&#x27;t feel very greasy or smell strong perfume.</li>
            <li> Very good as a basic everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t help me very much.</li>
            <li> This ATOPALM cream is truly a miracle, lightweight yet very moisturizing, and it smells very fresh and natural.  </li>
            <li> It gets super dry and flakey in some places (around my nose and mouth mostly), gets oily in other places, and breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> This cream is very emollient, and at the same time every morning my skin look very good with no irritations which were common before.</li>
            <li> It is fast absorbing, gentle and scent-free.</li>
            <li> really works.  </li>
            <li> and it really helped.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a difference either.</li>
            <li> but it is very pricey.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m still looking for what I really want.  </li>
            <li> Who wants that?  </li>
            <li> My only dissapointment was the postage as \\&quot;free delivery\\&quot; over $25, does not include Europe whereas Amazon .co.uk  </li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s one that really works.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work out for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li> The Atopalm cream is non-greasy and very soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping though.</li>
            <li> This really stays in place, doesn&#x27;t run, etc.  </li>
            <li> So if you need something very moisturizing but not too heavy this will do nicely.</li>
            <li> To top it off, in the last two years I developed eczema around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Some seem to work ok over time for different reasons - some lesson fine lines, some lighten dark circles, some brighten, etc.</li>
            <li> It seems to work fine for my normal areas, though I doubt people looking for deep moisturizers are in need of something like that.</li>
            <li> This product is rich enough in moisture, without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin and have tried many lotions.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and was reasonably priced, however I wish for the earlier version.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to discover that the Atopalm cleared up the rash just as well, if not better, than the steroid cream my dermatologist had given me.</li>
            <li> You can get a better products at any drug store for less money.  </li>
            <li> I found this as a free sample and in 7 days my dry skin was healed.</li>
            <li> I have lots of contact allergies and this cream is mild enough for me to use on my face.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find the fragrance particularly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, and will continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend ATOPLAM to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> And while I prefer unscented lotions just due to my skin being sensitive, I&#x27;m so glad I gave this one a chance.</li>
            <li> I think once it gets warmed up a bit by your body temperature, it thins a little or becomes more workable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as thick, and it has a pronounced scent I don&#x27;t recall it having before.</li>
            <li> By the way, I&#x27;m a 67 year old man that has worked outside most of my life and should have skin like leather, believe me moisturizing (both prescription and Autopalm) makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it all over but mostly for trouble spots.</li>
            <li> My skin is normal</li>
            <li> and once a week I use [[ASIN:B0017MO8AS St. Ives Timeless Skin Daily Microdermabrasion 4 oz (113 g)]] to keep my skin fresh and new.</li>
            <li> The dry, flakey patches on my face were gone within a day, it hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all, and a recent attempt by my lovely friend eczema to flare up on my eyelid got nipped in the bud at the outset and went away within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Atopalm.</li>
            <li> I like to try new products - but one of them is always Atopalm Intensive Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have Rosacea and very sensitive skin, every product i have tried before irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and prone to allergic flare-ups.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I burned a small section of my arm when it touched an incandescent light bulb (one reason why I&#x27;m switching to LEDs!).</li>
            <li> At first I thought this product would be just the same because of the \\&quot;intensive moisturizing\\&quot; label but</li>
            <li> The product was nothing special , have use other cremes  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time because it&#x27;s a very thick cream but works great if you have oily and/or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have VERY DRY and sensitive skin and about 1 yr ago developed mild adult acne.</li>
            <li> Great Cream,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other moisturizing creams in the past that left my skin feeling and looking greasy, but not with ATOPALM.</li>
            <li> Have had pink-hued dry skin and seborrheic dermatitis for several years, and have until now been plagued by unsatisfactory moisturizers that either were too rich and caused blemishes, or stung my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not heavy, doesn&#x27;t clog pores at all, not greasy, and also keeps skin from flaking and drying out during the day.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old.</li>
            <li> Proceed with caution if your skin is on the sensitive side, and use sparingly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 and have always had extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old &amp; wish that I knew about this product a decade ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an interesting take on a moisturizer, using a lot of natural fatty acids as the major ingredients (it does contain a bit of silicone -- dimethicone -- but not a lot, it&#x27;s pretty far down in the ingredients</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t purchase products after receiving trial sizes but in this case within two days of using the trial size I bought a full size jar!</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Those who complain about the new formula, I had a container of the old formula and compared and the only difference was that it no longer had parabens.</li>
            <li> It quickly repairs all rough spots, and strangely enough it has also removed body &amp;#34;tags&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Usually fragrance is the culprit in skincare products that irritate my eyes but even fragrance free ones have made my eyes water.</li>
            <li> The PH is gentle and its moisturizing properties are terrific because it contains humectants, occlusives, and emollients--the big 3 moisturizer categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for dry, sensitive skin types and if you need to switch up your winter skin care regimen</li>
            <li> Better late than never!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and use a different product after cleaning my face, but I always follow up with Atopalm after the first layer soaks in.  </li>
            <li> This cream is very soothing; helps heal very dry spots even on your face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally need a heavier lotion except after a chemical peel or during winter and this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Within two days my scab was gone and you can barely notice my burn mark.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft and I look 10 years younger, I am told.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural red head</li>
            <li> Also, it apparently removed bumps</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very nourishing moisturizer for extra dry areas of skin like knees and elbows, would definately recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day, has a very soft, clean smell and you only need a very small amount.    </li>
            <li> the price is reasonable exceptionally good people with bad rosacea and dry skin</li>
            <li> It has a subtle lemony smell and goes on smooth without that heavy/greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I like that this product does not contain parabens and artificial dyes, which makes it nice for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and quick results within a day or so.</li>
            <li> some very expensive and some over the counter that had good reviews.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, sensitive skin and are prone to eczema/dermatitis</li>
            <li> If you have irritated, dry, sensitive skin this would be the one to try.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my sensitive dry skin and I am never going back!</li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin especially in a winter.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter time and this cream always keeps my skin soft and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have recently developed very dry skin and have found Atopalm to be a jar of relief from flakey skin.</li>
            <li> so my skin is very dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> However after using Atopalm my skin was so soft that I will never use any other cream in future.</li>
            <li> I look forward to putting it on, especially after taking my makeup off after a long day.</li>
            <li> Having left the UK, I now live in Spain and my skin gets very dry, and feels so tight with the sun, so I decided to try this product after reading various reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I started using this again regularly when my face got really dry this winter</li>
            <li> My dry areas remain dry and I&#x27;m back on the search for something else.</li>
            <li> My face absorbs this cream and it holds the moisture for long periods of time.  </li>
            <li> My elbows get particularly rough during the winter (don&#x27;t know why, as I wear long sleeves) and Atopalm has helped soften them up for spring and short sleeve weather.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a good candidate base lotion for mixing in actives if you are into DIY skincare.  </li>
            <li> this clears up my dryness and my skin does not turn red like other products did.</li>
            <li> I have painfully dry skin</li>
            <li> My face was getting dry, cracked and flaky from my acne routine, change in weather, etc...</li>
            <li> After researching the product, I applied it to the dry, itchy, flaky skin that&#x27;s a chronic problem around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> Had dry spots on my face tried everything and this took them all away.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it would help with my always dry skin.  </li>
            <li> winter dry skin Gone, elbows, Knees, ankles, Heels....</li>
            <li> My skin tends to misbehave during the winter time and at times can be dry, flaky and rashy.</li>
            <li> Everytime you open the jar, air gets into the cream and diminishes the effectiveness of the active ingredients</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 and have very dry skin and am out in the sun a lot gardening and playing tennis.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something a little less expensive than Philosophy (although I still love it); L&#x27;Occitaine changed their formula for their thickest face cream so won&#x27;t use it again...</li>
            <li> My skin looks younger and smoother and even in the harsh CT weather with the dry indoor heat, it feels hydrated and supple.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that is also dry due to using a retinol product.</li>
            <li> I got a small sample of this cream in a gift set -- probably a teaspoon or so (the container with the actual ounces is long gone) -- and it did wonders for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I was a Mary Kay user/representative; however as I aged I started having problems with Roccea and had to go with a milder moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I would slather it on after showers, but within a few hours my skin wouldn&#x27;t look any different than before.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not really an &amp;#34;all over&amp;#34; moisturizer for me.  </li>
            <li> I use it on trouble spots to make it last longer.  </li>
            <li> The Atopalm was so thick, I only had to apply the tiniest dab, and the sample lasted me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Im looking foward to buying other Atopalm products.</li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old woman with slightly sensitive skin who has used every product under the sun from drugstore items to ultra expensive creams and serums to lift, firm, hydrate, erase, lighten and otherwise improve my skin since my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Last year I received a small sample of Atopalm with an order from another online retailer.</li>
            <li> I ran out, I rushed to order more, but I was disappointed to discover the cream has changed.</li>
            <li> Will not compete with other scented  lotions or perfumes if worn.</li>
            <li> I plan to try to other products of this line as well.</li>
            <li> I have a small cleaning business and my hands get very dry due to the harsh cleaning products I use.</li>
            <li> Over the last year I&#x27;ve also spent a fortune on various products that were disappointing</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, the dryness has gone away.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or heavy</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;intensive&amp;#34; part is completely missing this time around.</li>
            <li> Luckily it only flares up periodically, but it&#x27;s so frustrating when it does.</li>
            <li> I read online that they changed the formulation a few years ago?  </li>
            <li> For me, it does eventually absorb into the skin, although it takes a few hours to fully do</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years.  </li>
            <li> use retin a a few times a week</li>
            <li> I have the very frustrating combination of hyper sensitive AND oily skin.</li>
            <li> Again, I have very very sensitive skin (and feel a bit crazy about all the wonders I&#x27;m relating).</li>
            <li> an unbelievable job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it</li>
            <li> I did not love it.</li>
            <li> and I would have oily, dewy, or super shiny skin - all of which I hated.</li>
            <li> This cream is about as thick as plumber&#x27;s putty -- it&#x27;s probably one of the thickest I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick cream but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Anyway, after getting incredibly annoyed with moisturizers doing nothing except making me break out, I started doing research and stumbled across this product.</li>
            <li> Whenever I have a day where my complexion feels particularly &#x27;tired&#x27; or irritated, I turn to Atoplam.</li>
            <li> Acne washes dry my skin out terribly, make the acne worse, and often I&#x27;ve had to use heavy lotions and creams (like Goldbond, Cetaphil lotion, Aveeno) to moisturize my face.  </li>
            <li> Way too expensive for what it does.  </li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my troubled skin the moment I used it.</li>
            <li> but I do experience breakouts if I use the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll probably not replace until the winter when I am really desperate for relief.</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of very expensive moisturizers that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> first bought this at ulta.  found it cheaper on amazon.  really works.  i wish they had this with spf.  for now, i put this on first and a separate sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from another online retailer awhile back and I love it! The Intensive Formula is really rich so I use it at night like a repair cream, then in the morning I use the regular MLE Face Cream. Atopalm is great not only for people with sensitive skin but for those with sensitive eyes. Usually fragrance is the culprit in skincare products that irritate my eyes but even fragrance free ones have made my eyes water. Atopalm hasn&#x27;t made me shed a tear! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is really a great moisturizer.  It&#x27;s not at all greasy.  You can practically feel your skin sighing with relief when you put this on.</li>
            <li> I have painfully dry skin and sometime&#x27;s I&#x27;m not so proud of my face, but my spa recommended this lotion and it&#x27;s really great. Not heavy, doesn&#x27;t clog pores at all, not greasy, and also keeps skin from flaking and drying out during the day.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have Rosacea and very sensitive skin, every product i have tried before irritates my skin. This is a fantastic moisturizer, you can really feel how its absorbed by your skin, its not oily and stays fresh. Im looking foward to buying other Atopalm products.</li>
            <li> 2015: This moisturizer has changed my life. My face was getting dry, cracked and flaky from my acne routine, change in weather, etc... This immediately alleviated any discomfort. After a few weeks, the dryness has gone away. My skin noticeably looks better, brighter, and healthier. I have gotten many compliments on my skin since starting. The product is not greasy. When applied, gives a matte finish. It absorbs quickly and nicely into the skin. I wear it under my makeup with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, and will continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2017: I am deducting 1 star from my rating because a HUGE factor in my review reflecting 5 stars was the fact that it is a wonderful product at an EXTREAMLY affordable price (between $15-18). Now that is $30, I will definitely use it more sparingly and I have cancelled my 2 month subscription.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  I have very dry skin in the winter time and this cream always keeps my skin soft and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> i live in the NE, this is the best.  hard winter, great product for your skin!!</li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old woman with slightly sensitive skin who has used every product under the sun from drugstore items to ultra expensive creams and serums to lift, firm, hydrate, erase, lighten and otherwise improve my skin since my 30&#x27;s. Some seem to work ok over time for different reasons - some lesson fine lines, some lighten dark circles, some brighten, etc. Atopalm is THE BEST I&#x27;ve found for simply moisturizing completely without causing breakouts or leaving any oily feeling or film on my skin. I can even use it around my eyes...and yes, my eyelids...without any burning sensation or eye irritation at all! My skin looks younger and smoother and even in the harsh CT weather with the dry indoor heat, it feels hydrated and supple. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin so anytime I order a product and I can use I&#x27;m always Happy  :-)</li>
            <li> Last year I received a small sample of Atopalm with an order from another online retailer. After researching the product, I applied it to the dry, itchy, flaky skin that&#x27;s a chronic problem around my mouth and eyes. I was thrilled to discover that the Atopalm cleared up the rash just as well, if not better, than the steroid cream my dermatologist had given me. I was happy to stop putting steroids on my face. The Atopalm was so thick, I only had to apply the tiniest dab, and the sample lasted me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out, I rushed to order more, but I was disappointed to discover the cream has changed. It&#x27;s not nearly as thick, and it has a pronounced scent I don&#x27;t recall it having before. The new Atopalm is a fine moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin but doesn&#x27;t clear up my rash as effectively as the old formula, so now I&#x27;m alternating between the prescription steroid and Atopalm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll buy Atopalm again when I run out because it&#x27;s rather expensive and no longer seems to contain whatever magical ingredient had made it so healing before.</li>
            <li> Great Cream,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other moisturizing creams in the past that left my skin feeling and looking greasy, but not with ATOPALM. My face absorbs this cream and it holds the moisture for long periods of time.  I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with this product. I would highly recommend ATOPLAM to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer!  It is great for someone who is extremely sensitive to pretty much everything.  I can not use anything else.. this clears up my dryness and my skin does not turn red like other products did.</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t help me very much. I found others on amazon that works better.</li>
            <li> I was a Mary Kay user/representative; however as I aged I started having problems with Roccea and had to go with a milder moisturizer.  My dermatologist suggested the Atopalm and I have been using it for about 3 years now and love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old. Have had pink-hued dry skin and seborrheic dermatitis for several years, and have until now been plagued by unsatisfactory moisturizers that either were too rich and caused blemishes, or stung my sensitive skin. This ATOPALM cream is truly a miracle, lightweight yet very moisturizing, and it smells very fresh and natural.  I have ordered other ATOPALM products and find them all to be superb.  I never write these reviews, but this product has truly changed the condition of my skin!</li>
            <li> I started using this again regularly when my face got really dry this winter and it really helped. It has a nice light fragrance and texture and absorbs well.  Those who complain about the new formula, I had a container of the old formula and compared and the only difference was that it no longer had parabens. Parabens have been linked to causing cancer so I personally am glad they changed it.  I don&#x27;t really notice a difference either.</li>
            <li> I have lots of contact allergies and this cream is mild enough for me to use on my face.  It does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  I have used it on my hand and cuticles and on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Does an unbelievable job.</li>
            <li> I first used this when I was given it as a sample from another online store. Loved it and it was cheaper on Amazon. It lasts a long time because it&#x27;s a very thick cream but works great if you have oily and/or sensitive skin. would probably work well for combination skin also. Makes my skin super software and supple.</li>
            <li> I burned a small section of my arm when it touched an incandescent light bulb (one reason why I&#x27;m switching to LEDs!). I immediately put burn gel on the burn and a special gel bandage. The burnt area scabbed over in in a couple of days, but I was concerned that there would be a noticeable mark. Luckily I received a trial size of Autopalm&#x27;s MLE Intensive Moisturizing Cream and started placing it on the scab. Within two days my scab was gone and you can barely notice my burn mark. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I hadn&#x27;t seen it with my own eyes. I usually don&#x27;t purchase products after receiving trial sizes but in this case within two days of using the trial size I bought a full size jar!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my family doctor</li>
            <li> Nothing exceptional about this stuff.  Way too expensive for what it does.  You can get a better products at any drug store for less money.  Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I like the texture of this cream and it moisturizes well.  I had never heard of it until recently.  Good service.</li>
            <li> Very good , it came on time.</li>
            <li> A good moisturizing cream for sensitive skin.  Does not have a &amp;#34;perfumed&amp;#34; scent. I use it as a neck moisturizer primarily, but also works well on areas of my face as well as the rest of my body.  Will not compete with other scented  lotions or perfumes if worn.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  I bought it for my husband and son and both now use it daily.  It&#x27;s simple, no smell, and provides very nice moisture.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer for dry, irritated skin!  Don&#x27;t bother with anything else!  If I am red and flaky after using Retin-A, this will soothe and heal my skin and I am back on track!  It has a very clean, light scent.  It is not greasy or heavy but it is very moisturizing!  I always come back to it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My face is so soft and I look 10 years younger, I am told.  I highly recommend this cream.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> The formula seems pretty good - but I don&#x27;t understand why they have it in a jar instead of a tube. Everytime you open the jar, air gets into the cream and diminishes the effectiveness of the active ingredients</li>
            <li> I got a small sample of this cream in a gift set -- probably a teaspoon or so (the container with the actual ounces is long gone) -- and it did wonders for my combination skin. When I finally bought the full-size version, I was hopeful that it would be the same. Somehow, it&#x27;s not. The &amp;#34;intensive&amp;#34; part is completely missing this time around. My dry areas remain dry and I&#x27;m back on the search for something else. It seems to work fine for my normal areas, though I doubt people looking for deep moisturizers are in need of something like that.</li>
            <li> I have a small cleaning business and my hands get very dry due to the harsh cleaning products I use. This hand creme works very good but it is very pricey.</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite moisturizer. I don&#x27;t generally need a heavier lotion except after a chemical peel or during winter and this one fits the bill. It soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy like eucerin or aquaphore. So if you need something very moisturizing but not too heavy this will do nicely.</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic!!   I have VERY DRY and sensitive skin and about 1 yr ago developed mild adult acne. Until now (26yo african american female) I never had acne, breakouts, or blemishes.  Acne washes dry my skin out terribly, make the acne worse, and often I&#x27;ve had to use heavy lotions and creams (like Goldbond, Cetaphil lotion, Aveeno) to moisturize my face.  This would work for the first day or 2, but then the lotion would sit on my skin instead of soak in and I would have oily, dewy, or super shiny skin - all of which I hated. Over the last year I&#x27;ve also spent a fortune on various products that were disappointing so I was hesitant to purchase this.  At first I thought this product would be just the same because of the \\&quot;intensive moisturizing\\&quot; label but NOT SO!! I ordered the trial size and fell in love with it instantly after my first use! It soaks right in without feeling sticky, greasy, or oily so your skin looks like healthy, matte, clean skin not like you&#x27;ve just left the sauna. It lasts all day, has a very soft, clean smell and you only need a very small amount.    Additionally, I wash my face in the morning and at night with [[ASIN:B000NVF42A St. Ives Swiss Formula Makeup Remover &amp; Facial Cleanser All Skin Types 6 oz.]] and once a week I use [[ASIN:B0017MO8AS St. Ives Timeless Skin Daily Microdermabrasion 4 oz (113 g)]] to keep my skin fresh and new. I moisturize with Atopalm after each facial cleansing and it has done wonders. My skin is clear and healthy again after about 3 weeks of my new routine.  The 3oz jar of atopalm should last a good while (2 months maybe a little more) and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Great product and moisturizer!! A very light or unnoticeable scent. You wouldn&#x27;t use another moisturizer ever again! Non greasy, I swear it works overnight :)</li>
            <li> I loved this cream the first time I used it- it smells so good and it feels amazing on the skin, so I was quick to purchase after trying it at my dermatologist&#x27;s office. I even bought a jar for a friend. However, after repeated use for only a week, the cream burned and chapped my skin and caused break-outs. It&#x27;s not the best for sensitive skin, but I really want it to work because I love the scent. I am on the fence about recommending. Proceed with caution if your skin is on the sensitive side, and use sparingly.</li>
            <li> I have recently developed very dry skin and have found Atopalm to be a jar of relief from flakey skin. I like its light creamy texture, and it feels smooth and cooling when applied. I use it on my face under make-up, and it gives a dewy look to my skin. I&#x27;m going to start using it on my lower legs/shins, as they have become itchy over the summer. Hopefully, Atopalm will do the trick to ease dryness in that area too.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this cream. The best cream if you have sensitive skin, acne, dry patch, dark circle under your eyes and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 and have always had extremely sensitive skin. It gets super dry and flakey in some places (around my nose and mouth mostly), gets oily in other places, and breaks out easily. To top it off, in the last two years I developed eczema around my eyes. Luckily it only flares up periodically, but it&#x27;s so frustrating when it does. Anyway, after getting incredibly annoyed with moisturizers doing nothing except making me break out, I started doing research and stumbled across this product. Honestly, I was a bit hesitant to buy it after reading that the formula had changed in 2010 and people were unhappy with it, but decided to give it a shot anyway. Plus, from what I read it sounded like the change was just the removal of parabens and addition of a scent. Since breast cancer runs in my family, I&#x27;m very familiar with the endocrine-disrupting properties of parabens so was happy to read that. And while I prefer unscented lotions just due to my skin being sensitive, I&#x27;m so glad I gave this one a chance. It is, hands-down, the most effective moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. The dry, flakey patches on my face were gone within a day, it hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all, and a recent attempt by my lovely friend eczema to flare up on my eyelid got nipped in the bud at the outset and went away within a couple of days. I&#x27;m not even a third of the way through my first jar and just ordered another one to make sure I don&#x27;t run out. This stuff is phenomenal! I&#x27;m rarely impressed with cosmetic products of any sort but this is so effective I had to write a review. If you have dry, sensitive skin and are prone to eczema/dermatitis I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t what I expected.  I picked up a tiny jar of what seems like an ointment but it is labeled &amp;#34;cream.&amp;#34;  Same labeling in this larger jar  came as a cream so I&#x27;m still looking for what I really want.  This does work but not as well.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is perfect for dry, sensitive skin. It&#x27;s intensely moisturizing without being greasy or heavy. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the eye repair serum to treat a severe case of dermatitis on my face and around my eyes.  My skin was burning, red, swollen and scaly.  After only two days using both products I had noticeable relief.  Seven days later the condition is gone and my skin looks even better than before.  I&#x27;ve never used anything that worked this well.</li>
            <li> I like this cream!&lt;br /&gt;my daughter had problem to skin. but I used one week!&lt;br /&gt;now !!! her skin is better!&lt;br /&gt;I will always use this cream!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Recommended by my dermatologist and I can see why. It really make my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer on the market for rosacia, really takes away the redness and offers a lot of moisture to the skin.</li>
            <li> This may be a great product, but it dulls the skin tone. Who wants that?  The good news is that it is gentle.</li>
            <li> The best product I have found&lt;br /&gt;And the price is reasonable exceptionally good people with bad rosacea and dry skin</li>
            <li> Having left the UK, I now live in Spain and my skin gets very dry, and feels so tight with the sun, so I decided to try this product after reading various reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I previously used Loreal which I was quite happy with. However after using Atopalm my skin was so soft that I will never use any other cream in future. Even my friends have commented on the glow and softness of my skin. What a result? My only dissapointment was the postage as \\&quot;free delivery\\&quot; over $25, does not include Europe whereas Amazon .co.uk  does, but they do not sell Atopalm anymore which is ashame as all my freinds over here would purchase the item if it were free delivery. But hey, what a fantastic cream  and I think it&#x27;s one that really works.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for layering over absorbent serums in wintertime, especially in the evenings.  It&#x27;s also a good candidate base lotion for mixing in actives if you are into DIY skincare.  The PH is gentle and its moisturizing properties are terrific because it contains humectants, occlusives, and emollients--the big 3 moisturizer categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another product that I recommend for layer over serums to help moisturize and lock in existing moisture is Cellbone&#x27;s Moist&#x27;Seal.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best dry hand cream on the market, and I say that as a nurse who washes her hands a lot and has used a massive amount of hand cream in my life. It&#x27;s pricey, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite moisturizer for dry skin. I got a sample in a beauty box and now I have purchased this over 3 different times. It is a large tub for a great price. It is fast absorbing, gentle and scent-free. I highly recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful. Had dry spots on my face tried everything and this took them all away. Will re order when I need more.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my sensitive dry skin and I am never going back!</li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin especially in a winter. This cream is very emollient, and at the same time every morning my skin look very good with no irritations which were common before. This cream helps a lot!</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion for winter and summer.  I will not use another lotion ever.  It does not make me break out and my skin never feels irritated with it on.  I have sensitive and dry skin and have tried many lotions. My friend recommended this to me and I am so happy she did!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it would help with my always dry skin.  It didn&#x27;t really work out for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  I&#x27;m not sure what it is.&lt;br /&gt;2. I didn&#x27;t see a difference.  I would slather it on after showers, but within a few hours my skin wouldn&#x27;t look any different than before.  I read online that they changed the formulation a few years ago?  So that may be why.</li>
            <li> I had read on the internet that this product was used to treat a skin condition that I suffer from.  I had been using a prescription cream for over ten years and since the prescription was 10 times more expensive I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I started out with one side Atopalm and one side the prescription, and after a week the Autopalm side was as good or better than the prescription side.  I&#x27;ve been using Autopalm for over a month and love it!!  By the way, I&#x27;m a 67 year old man that has worked outside most of my life and should have skin like leather, believe me moisturizing (both prescription and Autopalm) makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> this is the best moisturizer for the face i have ever used. i&#x27;ve tried different brands and more expensive ones but always come back to atopalm.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that is also dry due to using a retinol product. The Atopalm cream is non-greasy and very soothing to my skin. This cream does not work well for me during the day under my makeup so I use it at night.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different creams...some very expensive and some over the counter that had good reviews. The only creams I liked to use for my face was Philosophy, L&#x27;Occitaine, or Olay&#x27;s Regenerest. I was looking for something a little less expensive than Philosophy (although I still love it); L&#x27;Occitaine changed their formula for their thickest face cream so won&#x27;t use it again...but this is definately a keeper for me and I hope they don&#x27;t change the formula any time soon. I&#x27;m a natural red head so my skin is very dry and sensitive. This doesn&#x27;t burn going on and feels like it leaves a layer of silk on my skin to protect it from drying throughout the day. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and haven&#x27;t had any breakouts. I plan to try to other products of this line as well.</li>
            <li> Works great on very dry spots or areas that are a bit irritated.  I have very sensitive skin and prone to allergic flare-ups.  This cream is very soothing; helps heal very dry spots even on your face.</li>
            <li> This quickly dries into skin.  Does not clog up pores or leave oily residue.  Perfect for face and neck. Dries into skin within 5 minutes. After applying to neck and face my skin has a matte look.  Can apply makeup easily { I use non oily mineral makeup.} The makeup glides on effortlessly and the moisturizing cream gives me a smooth non-oily look.</li>
            <li> This is the Miracle product! We all laugh at all its seemingly magical uses. It is not smelly nor is it oily. It quickly repairs all rough spots, and strangely enough it has also removed body &amp;#34;tags&amp;#34;. I sometimes use it all over but mostly for trouble spots. Also, it apparently removed bumps I had that my Dermatologist said there was nothing she could do about them! I have very sensitive skin and I put it on body areas that may rub against clothing and irritate my skin and this prevents it. Again, I have very very sensitive skin (and feel a bit crazy about all the wonders I&#x27;m relating). I love Autopalm</li>
            <li> I have skin lupus, this smells like lemons or something, it burns my face, I can&#x27;t use it! Fast shipping though.</li>
            <li> Atopalm Cream moisturizes my face really well without feeling too heavy. I look forward to putting it on, especially after taking my makeup off after a long day. It feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> winter dry skin Gone, elbows, Knees, ankles, Heels.... all better. I found this as a free sample and in 7 days my dry skin was healed.</li>
            <li> This cream is about as thick as plumber&#x27;s putty -- it&#x27;s probably one of the thickest I&#x27;ve tried.  It spreads surprisingly well, considering that, though.  I think once it gets warmed up a bit by your body temperature, it thins a little or becomes more workable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have super dry skin, the thickness of this product is wonderful.  This really stays in place, doesn&#x27;t run, etc.  So it&#x27;ll actually moisturize the area you apply it to.  For me, it does eventually absorb into the skin, although it takes a few hours to fully do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not really an &amp;#34;all over&amp;#34; moisturizer for me.  I use it on trouble spots to make it last longer.  My elbows get particularly rough during the winter (don&#x27;t know why, as I wear long sleeves) and Atopalm has helped soften them up for spring and short sleeve weather.  I think this would also be an excellent foot balm for dry, cracked heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; in the ingredients list but I don&#x27;t find the fragrance particularly noticeable.  I like that this product does not contain parabens and artificial dyes, which makes it nice for my sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s an interesting take on a moisturizer, using a lot of natural fatty acids as the major ingredients (it does contain a bit of silicone -- dimethicone -- but not a lot, it&#x27;s pretty far down in the ingredients list).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for super-dry (winter) skin!</li>
            <li> I did not love it. There are better and less costly products available. So, pass this one up . From now on, I am.</li>
            <li> I like it. It keep my face soft and I don&#x27;t feel very greasy or smell strong perfume. Very good as a basic everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I do like this cream - I use it after I put on Rentina cream.  It&#x27;s very cool and refreshing, does take a little longer to sink into skin, but overall, it&#x27;s a good cream for the money.  It Has a very sticky kind of feel when you first put it on, not sure if I like that feeling in a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> i actually bought this cream for my daughter when she was having a baby acne around 3 months and it worked like a magic.  we&#x27;ve been using this ever since and we absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Atopalm. Just decided to take a chance on another moisturizing cream. I was instantly impressed. CeraVe is also good but I think I&#x27;m staying right here with this Atopalm. It is so moisturizing without being goopy. I use it day and night. Also I started using retinol and this atopalm cream keeps my skin from drying out and flaking. Excellent stuff</li>
            <li> This cream never makes me break out. It is always soothing and never greasy. The scent is pleasant. My skin is super sensitive, very fair and prone to redness. This is the only cream I use on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> The product was nothing special , have use other cremes  that were better.I have to keep applying it on my body an face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Atopalm for years. I have extremely dry skin and use a different product after cleaning my face, but I always follow up with Atopalm after the first layer soaks in.  Spreading it on feels like I&#x27;m giving my face a drink.  It seals in the moisture for the day, much like vaseline does, but without the greasy, heavy feeling.  I highly recommend for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> My doctor daughter got me started using this amazing cream, so great for dry sensitive skin.  Highly recommend this excellent product.</li>
            <li> This product is rich enough in moisture, without being greasy.  It softens my (over 50 yrs.) skin nicely and can be used as an under makeup moisturizer too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product over 10 years!</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of very expensive moisturizers that didn&#x27;t work.  Atopalm worked for me.  I also liked the under makeup moisturizer for during the day.  My complexion seems to look smoother with fewer lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I may have up to three different moisturizers I use as a night cream - I like to try new products - but one of them is always Atopalm Intensive Moisturizing Cream. Whenever I have a day where my complexion feels particularly &#x27;tired&#x27; or irritated, I turn to Atoplam. It has a cooling effect, is remarkably soothing and an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years.  I have rosacea, and it was the only moisturizer I could find that would prevent breakouts.  Now, however, I think it is causing breakouts.  I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the smell.  Had been mildly scented but now I think it smells like, maybe, eucalyptus.  If the formula has changed, I hope they return to the original one.  The product arrived quickly and was reasonably priced, however I wish for the earlier version.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin even in the summer and have found this to be an extremely effective moisturizer. However, it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side so I&#x27;ll probably not replace until the winter when I am really desperate for relief.</li>
            <li> I have the very frustrating combination of hyper sensitive AND oily skin. This stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use retin a a few times a week and I can use this cream on top if it and my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn, even if my skin is already irritated. I am 45 years old &amp; wish that I knew about this product a decade ago. Better late than never!</li>
            <li> This is a great intensive moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin. My skin tends to misbehave during the winter time and at times can be dry, flaky and rashy. I saw a difference in my troubled skin the moment I used it. A little goes a long way and quick results within a day or so. It has a subtle lemony smell and goes on smooth without that heavy/greasy feeling. I highly recommend this product for dry, sensitive skin types and if you need to switch up your winter skin care regimen (it&#x27;s great to use as a night cream).</li>
            <li> Very nourishing moisturizer for extra dry areas of skin like knees and elbows, would definately recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> This cream is great for dry skin.  It has no parabens which I love and it is a very good night cream for moisturizing and softening facial skin.  I notice that my lines are softer and seem to be lessening.  I&#x27;m 56 and have very dry skin and am out in the sun a lot gardening and playing tennis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for several years now and love it. It&#x27;s a thick cream but not greasy. My skin is normal but I do experience breakouts if I use the wrong thing. This never breaks me out. If I get to aggressive with exfoliation this cream calms the skin. If you have irritated, dry, sensitive skin this would be the one to try.  It&#x27;s a great all around moisturizer that balances the skin and replenishes skin lipids.  This is also the cream I always use if a create any DIY moisturizers.  I usually add niacinamide to it to make my perfect face cream.</li>
