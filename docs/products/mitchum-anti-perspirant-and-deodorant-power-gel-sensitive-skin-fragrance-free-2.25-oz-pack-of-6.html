    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>They&#x27;re wonderful people.  </li>
            <li>Mitchum is one of best off the shelf brands for this purpose.</li>
            <li>and if you sweat a lot you use what works best!</li>
            <li>I consider this the best anti-perspirant &amp; deodorant on the market</li>
            <li>I love it!!!!</li>
            <li>It is the best.</li>
            <li>Then you&#x27;re good to go!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great price and product.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I prefer the unscented gel version because it&#x27;s great with sleeveless dresses or shirts.</li>
            <li>Very effective.  </li>
            <li>It is very nice to order it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AND STILL IS THE BEST FOR MY SKIN TYPE AND BODY PHYSIOLOGY.</li>
            <li>good value for a great product.</li>
            <li>Good for your health and for your clothes.  </li>
            <li>No matter how you sweat, you still get good odor protection.</li>
            <li>It also does a good job of keeping you that way as well.</li>
            <li>I bought them both, and loved them1  </li>
            <li>, yes I use good soap.  </li>
            <li>Mitchum Anti-perspirant &amp; deodorant, of course, is a long-time product with a good reputation.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works really, really good.  </li>
            <li>The deodorant goes on evenly, dries quickly, rarely spots my clothes, and best of all no deodorant smell.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that both Mitchum Sport and Greenwood scents are pleasant and I have tried both with great success.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product if you are looking for a fragrance free deodorant.  </li>
            <li>No rash or reaction of any kind.</li>
            <li>No fragrance of any kind, just effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, my pits smell at the end of the day - this has never happened.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get \\&quot;Fragrance Free.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>so okay for airplane carry-on bags.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like mixing too many conflicting scents.  </li>
            <li>felt the need to elaborate a bit more now that I&#x27;ve had more time to use Mitchum&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Glad to have a formula for those with sensitivity to under arm deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research as no one likes to sweat or smell, and this brand always came out on top.</li>
            <li>Because I get an allergic reaction to most deodorants, I was pleased to find this one.  </li>
            <li>This vendor is outstanding - I literally received the package the day after I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>iI am constantly in search of the perfect product-no matter what it is!  </li>
            <li>Most &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; brands have some sort of added scent that I react to, not this one.</li>
            <li>I love it, and everyone around loves it, too.</li>
            <li>When I originally said in my title that it \\&quot;Works great\\&quot;, that was basically an understatement!</li>
            <li>This deodorant is great, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years after I got a rash from Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As a teenager, I could never get the right kind of deodorant for my pits.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this for years and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I went with another deodorant and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Works just as well as any name brand stick, but it doesn&#x27;t have the perfumes to cover up some of the odor, but that&#x27;s the price you pay if you want something fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Turned a friend onto it who agrees, but we both feel it&#x27;s worth it as nothing works better.</li>
            <li>This the fragrance free version of the product versus the unscented version.</li>
            <li>Then, voila, in searching for a longer-lasting deodorant than I had available at my drugstore, I found on Amazon that Mitchum had a formula for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Good deodorant for sensitive skin, and those with a fragance allergy as well.</li>
            <li>Along with that good reputation was the fact that in doing a good job with underarm odors and perspiration, it was harsh and often caused skin irritation, itching and breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what was advertised!!</li>
            <li>A deodorant/anti-perspirant should fight odors and leave the user feeling clean and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I ordered a package of 6, and was never disappointed with the product.  </li>
            <li>It is not always readily available at local pharmacies (CVS, Rite-Aid), so I was delighted to find it on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>This great product is getting harder to find in stores or online.  </li>
            <li>Would like to see the container really full though, instead of about 1/4 full  </li>
            <li>Kind to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>And if you do, give us fair warning, as I will buy several cases</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more gentle</li>
            <li>I used another type of Mitchum before that seemed to work fairly well, though that was a solid stick.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding it in stores, and it is great that I can order it at Amazon. :-)</li>
            <li>With all the soaps, body washes, colognes, and such I try to keep a nice, light balance.  </li>
            <li>Amazon seems to sell it (lucky them).</li>
            <li>I was so glad to see this product avaible because I have a new fascination perfume.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t want to buy a 6-pack without trying one first, but I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere!  </li>
            <li>I love this particular brand and in particular this fragrance free variation.</li>
            <li>But they are still worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have powerful</li>
            <li>And the product works better than other strong brands out there; and my clothes are not stained.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used different varieties, both solids and gels, scented and non-scented, and have come to the conclusion that gels are far superior when it comes to both longevity of the application and non-streaking performance on my shirts.  </li>
            <li>The service was quick and the price reasonable</li>
            <li>It is very rare to find a deodorant that is actually fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>And to top it all off, it washes away easily in the shower unlike many other ultimate protection deodorants in the market.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Mitchum!</li>
            <li>This has saves SO many of us with the same disorder.  </li>
            <li>This is just about the only deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many)</li>
            <li>this product is the only one that my husband and son are able to use.  </li>
            <li>I regretted this purchase the moment I first tried it.</li>
            <li>It was pretty embarrassing.</li>
            <li>Granted, my parents were the ones buying me the Old Spice (original scents, ewww) or Degree anti-perspirant, but those never seemed to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, this is as convenient and effective a deodorant/antiperspirant as I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum products for a long time and love them.  </li>
            <li>As for scented vs non-scented, I prefer the non-scented variety simply because as a patron of fine smells</li>
            <li>This was very unbecoming for a lad my age</li>
            <li>This product really has no scent at all.  </li>
            <li>I really regret this purchase.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Recommend highly!</li>
            <li>This stuff is nicely-priced, is non-itchy, and it gets the job done very well.</li>
            <li>It seems to work as a deoderant very well .</li>
            <li>I am very thankful this product exists.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>The design actually is very convenient to place in my gym bag.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t do anything overly intense and could feel the perspiration.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you buy this exact one, because even the very similar looking ones by Mitchum are not the same.  </li>
            <li>Mitchum withstands the sweaty and most heated moments of my mature life, just takes a while to dry.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I&#x27;ve noticed however, is that when you get near the end of the stick the deodorant becomes&lt;br /&gt;less effective, and has a little bit of a scent when putting it on.</li>
            <li>far as a balance between odor/sweat stopping power and sensitive-skin friendliness, there is really nothing else out there that compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and so far after about 5 hours it still seems to be controlling odor and sweat pretty well.</li>
            <li>This new brand for us is a keeper.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have a family member who is very sensitive to chemicals/fragrance</li>
            <li>I finally tried this after reading all the positive reviews on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and relatively odor free.  </li>
            <li>It also dries fairly quickly compared to other products.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find, so glad I can bulk order on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used this since I developed a skin reaction to betadine after surgery.  </li>
            <li>Now, my wife has begun using Women&#x27;s Mitchum products as she has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and, so far, has not caused any irritation.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every single deodorant out there, and I keep coming back to this</li>
            <li>4 stars because you must put it on well before shirt as it must dry first.</li>
            <li>Example: several days this week, after putting in a full day at work, my underarms had absolutely NO smell to them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little weak so in hot weather I have to apply more than I would with some other brands, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Love the sensitive version as compared with other brands that there are less&#x27;ingredients/chemicals&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>In the past I haven&#x27;t had much luck with deodorants/antiperspirants (roll-ons and sticks), but I decided to give the Mitchum gel a try after reading the reviews here, and after my first day using it</li>
            <li>Also, it is invisible which is a major plus-</li>
            <li>There is no other product we have found that performs to these standards.  </li>
            <li>When wearing Oldspice my BO would clear a 2000 sq ft room just from daily activities.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product for sensitive skin that works</li>
            <li>All they served to do were give me pit stains and white streaks and make me smell like a musky mature man.  </li>
            <li>I switched to Mitchum years ago and just recently found the sensitive skin product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only deodorant I&#x27;ve found that works on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I found Mitchum sensitive skin deodorant has a different antiperspirant ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I tried using a smaller amount than normal and was still left with that stickiness.</li>
            <li>Not sure why it doesn&#x27;t always feel that way but true.</li>
            <li>Also, they are a lesser amount (2.25 oz.) than others, so they tend to be empty fast.  </li>
            <li>It is the gel type and does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li>As of this writing here and now (Saturday morning), my last application of the Mitchum&#x27;s was yesterday morning, about 27 hours ago, and my armpits still lack any odor whatsoever, and there&#x27;s barely any sweat.</li>

            <li> Other than that, this is as convenient and effective a deodorant/antiperspirant as I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum products for a long time and love them.  </li>
            <li> As for scented vs non-scented, I prefer the non-scented variety simply because as a patron of fine smells</li>
            <li> This was very unbecoming for a lad my age</li>
            <li> This product really has no scent at all.  </li>
            <li> I really regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> This stuff is nicely-priced, is non-itchy, and it gets the job done very well.</li>
            <li> It seems to work as a deoderant very well .</li>
            <li> I am very thankful this product exists.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> The design actually is very convenient to place in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t do anything overly intense and could feel the perspiration.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you buy this exact one, because even the very similar looking ones by Mitchum are not the same.  </li>
            <li> Mitchum withstands the sweaty and most heated moments of my mature life, just takes a while to dry.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I&#x27;ve noticed however, is that when you get near the end of the stick the deodorant becomes&lt;br /&gt;less effective, and has a little bit of a scent when putting it on.</li>
            <li> far as a balance between odor/sweat stopping power and sensitive-skin friendliness, there is really nothing else out there that compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and so far after about 5 hours it still seems to be controlling odor and sweat pretty well.</li>
            <li> This new brand for us is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have a family member who is very sensitive to chemicals/fragrance</li>
            <li> I finally tried this after reading all the positive reviews on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and relatively odor free.  </li>
            <li> It also dries fairly quickly compared to other products.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find, so glad I can bulk order on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this since I developed a skin reaction to betadine after surgery.  </li>
            <li> Now, my wife has begun using Women&#x27;s Mitchum products as she has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and, so far, has not caused any irritation.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every single deodorant out there, and I keep coming back to this</li>
            <li> 4 stars because you must put it on well before shirt as it must dry first.</li>
            <li> Example: several days this week, after putting in a full day at work, my underarms had absolutely NO smell to them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weak so in hot weather I have to apply more than I would with some other brands, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Love the sensitive version as compared with other brands that there are less&#x27;ingredients/chemicals&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> In the past I haven&#x27;t had much luck with deodorants/antiperspirants (roll-ons and sticks), but I decided to give the Mitchum gel a try after reading the reviews here, and after my first day using it</li>
            <li> Also, it is invisible which is a major plus-</li>
            <li> There is no other product we have found that performs to these standards.  </li>
            <li> When wearing Oldspice my BO would clear a 2000 sq ft room just from daily activities.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product for sensitive skin that works</li>
            <li> All they served to do were give me pit stains and white streaks and make me smell like a musky mature man.  </li>
            <li> I switched to Mitchum years ago and just recently found the sensitive skin product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only deodorant I&#x27;ve found that works on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I found Mitchum sensitive skin deodorant has a different antiperspirant ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I tried using a smaller amount than normal and was still left with that stickiness.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it doesn&#x27;t always feel that way but true.</li>
            <li> Also, they are a lesser amount (2.25 oz.) than others, so they tend to be empty fast.  </li>
            <li> It is the gel type and does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li> As of this writing here and now (Saturday morning), my last application of the Mitchum&#x27;s was yesterday morning, about 27 hours ago, and my armpits still lack any odor whatsoever, and there&#x27;s barely any sweat.</li>
            <li> and I mean powerful underarm body odor.  </li>
            <li> Some say it does not last as long as the regular formula--I am not sure that is certain.  </li>
            <li> Another thing, the stick doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that keeps me dry all day and does not stain my shirts.  </li>
            <li> put it on a few minutes before dressing, as they do go on a little wet, but dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have used Mitchum for as long as I could remember but it was always sented which can clash with perfume.</li>
            <li> The deodorant lasts a long time and does not have a smell.  </li>
            <li> We tried several other brands and they did not work with the odor.</li>
            <li> It does take a while to dry, but it&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> that keeps me dry throughout the day.</li>
            <li> However, it takes forever to dry out.  </li>
            <li> This did not keep me dry at all.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry all day and stink</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave white marks in black clothes.</li>
            <li> I want to like it, because it&#x27;s clear and odor-free, and I do still use it when I&#x27;m wearing something that doesn&#x27;t cover my underarms, but feeling sticky all day is really hard to put up with.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for something that didn&#x27;t dry out and cause peeling on my under arms like other brands did.</li>
            <li> - this made me angsty, and I would write unflattering songs about my parents and about how lonely I was.    </li>
            <li> I sweat a lot, and mah pits can start to get a tad odorific--at least so far as I notice, though nobody has ever said anything to me about it.</li>
            <li> Then I went home and did an hour&#x27;s weight-lifting workout, and at the end of it, STILL NO SMELL, and sweat was minimal.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely no irritation either.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer said, the only accommodation you&#x27;ll want to make is to wait a few minutes after application before putting your shirt on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post back if anything changes for the worse, but based on my experience with it so far, I feel it&#x27;s earned 5</li>
            <li> I usually use Gilette clear gel but decided to give this a try because it cost less.</li>
            <li> Odor protection is standard if you can bare the tacky residue it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> Negatives: too small and only</li>
            <li> I will buy NON other than Mitchum unscented.</li>
            <li> other products have resulted in a rash.  </li>
            <li> So anti perspiant is a little weak on this, however,  I do live in Texas</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this item at my local drug store.  </li>
            <li> Really though, you can&#x27;t go wrong with unscented.    </li>
            <li> To conclude, I&#x27;d like to say that I no longer write terrible things about my beloved parents.  </li>
            <li> It dries so slowly that one&#x27;s underarms are left feeling sticky for an unreasonable period of time, and one worries about the integrity and cleanliness of one&#x27;s shirt.</li>
            <li> Calmed things down.  </li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for the product I previously used....</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave a mess on your clothes, which is always a bonus.</li>
            <li> I find myself a little moist not stinky just moist.</li>
            <li> As some have noted, applying this to your pits a few minutes before shirting up will help you not to ruin your shirts.    </li>
            <li> I am a heavy sweater.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> Less checmicals mean alittle safer to our immune system.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it is the gel that doesn&#x27;t work for me, I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> just plain doesn&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li> and it is extrememly hard to find in the stores locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other brands were fairly expensive.</li>
            <li> The problem is, they stopped selling them for some reason, and as other reviewers on amazon have said, it is impossible to find them anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> It works well and doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Any amount of this makes your underarms feel horribly sticky and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> i have tried dozens of deodorants/anti-perspirants/deodorant/antiperspirants, and it is impossible to find anything that either has a nasty smell</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AND STILL IS THE BEST FOR MY SKIN TYPE AND BODY PHYSIOLOGY.</li>
            <li> No rash or reaction of any kind. Very effective.  No fragrance of any kind, just effectiveness.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this since I developed a skin reaction to betadine after surgery.  Calmed things down.  It is not always readily available at local pharmacies (CVS, Rite-Aid), so I was delighted to find it on amazon.com.  Some say it does not last as long as the regular formula--I am not sure that is certain.  It works well.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that truly does not smell of anything.  That&#x27;s what I want.  Note: this is not the same as this company&#x27;s \\&quot;Unscented\\&quot; flavor, which does have a fragrance, which they must judge to be neutral.  Uh-Uh.  Make sure you get \\&quot;Fragrance Free.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product for sensitive skin that works</li>
            <li> Love the sensitive version as compared with other brands that there are less&#x27;ingredients/chemicals&#x27;.  Less checmicals mean alittle safer to our immune system. And the product works better than other strong brands out there; and my clothes are not stained.  Good for your health and for your clothes.  This new brand for us is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. No matter how you sweat, you still get good odor protection. And to top it all off, it washes away easily in the shower unlike many other ultimate protection deodorants in the market.</li>
            <li> I have used Mitchum anti-presperant deodorant for several years.  It&#x27;s the only product that keeps me dry all day and does not stain my shirts.  Now, my wife has begun using Women&#x27;s Mitchum products as she has sensitive skin.  We use the Mitchum deodorant product because it works.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It works well and doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell.  I like the 6-pack because they are under 3oz so okay for airplane carry-on bags.</li>
            <li> As a teenager, I could never get the right kind of deodorant for my pits.  Granted, my parents were the ones buying me the Old Spice (original scents, ewww) or Degree anti-perspirant, but those never seemed to do the trick.  All they served to do were give me pit stains and white streaks and make me smell like a musky mature man.  This was very unbecoming for a lad my age and I was the laughing stock - this made me angsty, and I would write unflattering songs about my parents and about how lonely I was.    However, I started using Mitchum and have been doing so for around five or six years.  I&#x27;ve used different varieties, both solids and gels, scented and non-scented, and have come to the conclusion that gels are far superior when it comes to both longevity of the application and non-streaking performance on my shirts.  As some have noted, applying this to your pits a few minutes before shirting up will help you not to ruin your shirts.    As for scented vs non-scented, I prefer the non-scented variety simply because as a patron of fine smells I don&#x27;t like mixing too many conflicting scents.  With all the soaps, body washes, colognes, and such I try to keep a nice, light balance.  I do have to say that both Mitchum Sport and Greenwood scents are pleasant and I have tried both with great success.  Really though, you can&#x27;t go wrong with unscented.    To conclude, I&#x27;d like to say that I no longer write terrible things about my beloved parents.  They&#x27;re wonderful people.  Thanks, Mitchum!</li>
            <li> This product really has no scent at all.  None.  It also does a good job of keeping you that way as well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave white marks in black clothes. Smells neutral and deodorizes well.</li>
            <li> A deodorant/anti-perspirant should fight odors and leave the user feeling clean and comfortable. This product does the former, without the latter. It dries so slowly that one&#x27;s underarms are left feeling sticky for an unreasonable period of time, and one worries about the integrity and cleanliness of one&#x27;s shirt. Once \\&quot;dry,\\&quot; the product leaves the user with a tacky, gummy feeling. I really regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Unlike the picture and description on here the deodorant that arrived says \\&quot;for women\\&quot; on it. I don&#x27;t know if this is the fault of the seller or Amazon since it&#x27;s fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy sweater. I can sweat profusely under my arms even when I&#x27;m just sitting at my desk at work in the air conditioning. This stuff does not keep me from sweating or stinking. Another thing, the stick doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot, and mah pits can start to get a tad odorific--at least so far as I notice, though nobody has ever said anything to me about it. In the past I haven&#x27;t had much luck with deodorants/antiperspirants (roll-ons and sticks), but I decided to give the Mitchum gel a try after reading the reviews here, and after my first day using it I&#x27;m not disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and so far after about 5 hours it still seems to be controlling odor and sweat pretty well. I&#x27;ll post back if anything changes for the worse, but based on my experience with it so far, I feel it&#x27;s earned 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I felt the need to elaborate a bit more now that I&#x27;ve had more time to use Mitchum&#x27;s. When I originally said in my title that it \\&quot;Works great\\&quot;, that was basically an understatement! Example: several days this week, after putting in a full day at work, my underarms had absolutely NO smell to them. No sweat either. Then I went home and did an hour&#x27;s weight-lifting workout, and at the end of it, STILL NO SMELL, and sweat was minimal. As of this writing here and now (Saturday morning), my last application of the Mitchum&#x27;s was yesterday morning, about 27 hours ago, and my armpits still lack any odor whatsoever, and there&#x27;s barely any sweat. I am super-impressed by this product. There&#x27;s absolutely no irritation either. As another reviewer said, the only accommodation you&#x27;ll want to make is to wait a few minutes after application before putting your shirt on. Other than that, this is as convenient and effective a deodorant/antiperspirant as I have ever seen. I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
            <li> Glad to have a formula for those with sensitivity to under arm deodorants.  Would like to see the container really full though, instead of about 1/4 full  (I know sold by weight not by volume).</li>
            <li> All day production....I don&#x27;t think so.  I would not buy this product again, it does not provide protection and has no scent.  This was a waste of money.  I thought mitchem was suppose to be strong...not the case.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and relatively odor free.  Works just as well as any name brand stick, but it doesn&#x27;t have the perfumes to cover up some of the odor, but that&#x27;s the price you pay if you want something fragrance free.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years after I got a rash from Old Spice. It does take a while to dry, but it&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts. The one thing I&#x27;ve noticed however, is that when you get near the end of the stick the deodorant becomes&lt;br /&gt;less effective, and has a little bit of a scent when putting it on. Not a huge deal, but keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to see this product avaible because I have a new fascination perfume. I have used Mitchum for as long as I could remember but it was always sented which can clash with perfume. I gave this a go and I must say sometime I find myself a little moist not stinky just moist. So anti perspiant is a little weak on this, however,  I do live in Texas so well you know.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying 1 at a time from pharmacy or supermarket. Mitchum is one of best off the shelf brands for this purpose. Only problem is can create a stain on inside of shirts. But I find it works well for me and if you sweat a lot you use what works best!</li>
            <li> I have difficulty finding this product on local cosmetic shelves.  It is very nice to order it from Amazon.  The service was quick and the price reasonable</li>
            <li> Exactly what was advertised!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every single deodorant out there, and I keep coming back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as a balance between odor/sweat stopping power and sensitive-skin friendliness, there is really nothing else out there that compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also doesn&#x27;t leave a mess on your clothes, which is always a bonus.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research as no one likes to sweat or smell, and this brand always came out on top. Also, it is invisible which is a major plus- no marks on clothes. 4 stars because you must put it on well before shirt as it must dry first. Also 4 stars because it occasionally feels tacky. Not sure why it doesn&#x27;t always feel that way but true. Turned a friend onto it who agrees, but we both feel it&#x27;s worth it as nothing works better. Negatives: too small and only Amazon seems to sell it (lucky them).</li>
            <li> Because I get an allergic reaction to most deodorants, I was pleased to find this one.  It works well and, so far, has not caused any irritation.  This vendor is outstanding - I literally received the package the day after I ordered it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have a genetic skin condition exacerbated by sweat....I cannot imagine the state I would be in were it not for Mitchum Gel.  This has saves SO many of us with the same disorder.  I will buy NON other than Mitchum unscented.</li>
            <li> Great price and product.  I consider this the best anti-perspirant &amp; deodorant on the market and it is extrememly hard to find in the stores locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is the only deodorant I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate me and cause a rash.  I have a hard time finding it in stores, and it is great that I can order it at Amazon. :-)</li>
            <li> This great product is getting harder to find in stores or online.  Please keep selling it on Amazon.  Great product.  Stops oder and wetness.  Does not stain or leave residue on clothing.  Kind to sensitive skin.  There is no other product we have found that performs to these standards.  Thank you, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Mitchum is the only product that I use all the time. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum&#x27;s for years. I love this particular brand and in particular this fragrance free variation. The deodorant goes on evenly, dries quickly, rarely spots my clothes, and best of all no deodorant smell. This is just about the only deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many) that keeps me dry throughout the day. Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> When I started getting torturously itchy I realized that I needed to switch to fragrance-free; which is not the same as unscented. Other brands were fairly expensive. This stuff is nicely-priced, is non-itchy, and it gets the job done very well. Hallelujah.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I can use without my armpits breaking into rashes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> The deodorant lasts a long time and does not have a smell.  It is the gel type and does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for years and it works fine.  it&#x27;s not a deodorant though, just an anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> This product has no fragrance at all. There are no masking scents/perfumes added. I have a family member who is very sensitive to chemicals/fragrance and he can tolerate being around it just fine. It seems to work as a deoderant very well . I am very thankful this product exists. This the fragrance free version of the product versus the unscented version. I found out the unscented one has a detectable fragrance.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for the product I previously used....Mitchum withstands the sweaty and most heated moments of my mature life, just takes a while to dry.  I hope this product stays around for a while!</li>
            <li> iI am constantly in search of the perfect product-no matter what it is!  i have tried dozens of deodorants/anti-perspirants/deodorant/antiperspirants, and it is impossible to find anything that either has a nasty smell ( I prefer fragrance-free), is sticky or tacky, or just plain doesn&#x27;t work!  I finally tried this after reading all the positive reviews on Amazon.com. But I didn&#x27;t want to buy a 6-pack without trying one first, but I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere!  Finally, I found a supermarket that had 2 left! I bought them both, and loved them1  They were everything I wanted.  The problem is, they stopped selling them for some reason, and as other reviewers on amazon have said, it is impossible to find them anywhere else.  So I buy several 6-packs at a time from Amazon1  Heaven help us all if they stop carrying them, because otherwise they do not exist.  Advice: put it on a few minutes before dressing, as they do go on a little wet, but dry quickly.  Then you&#x27;re good to go!  Also, they are a lesser amount (2.25 oz.) than others, so they tend to be empty fast.  Sometimes, I feel like I go through one a week (or two).  But they are still worth it.  Just make sure you buy this exact one, because even the very similar looking ones by Mitchum are not the same.  Don&#x27;t ever stop carrying these Amazon!  And if you do, give us fair warning, as I will buy several cases (anyone remember the Seinfeld &amp;#34;Spongeworthy&amp;#34; episode?)</li>
            <li> This Mitchum deodorant is the only one I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Most &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; brands have some sort of added scent that I react to, not this one. Cant find it in stores, even Drugstore.com stopped carrying it for some reason. Happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> this product is the only one that my husband and son are able to use.  other products have resulted in a rash.  this is my second or third order of this item from amazon.  good value for a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weak so in hot weather I have to apply more than I would with some other brands, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you are looking for a fragrance free deodorant.  It is very rare to find a deodorant that is actually fragrance free.  This one is. It also dries fairly quickly compared to other products.  Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have some skin allergies.  This product works very well.  The design actually is very convenient to place in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> I usually use Gilette clear gel but decided to give this a try because it cost less. I regretted this purchase the moment I first tried it. Any amount of this makes your underarms feel horribly sticky and uncomfortable. I tried using a smaller amount than normal and was still left with that stickiness. Odor protection is standard if you can bare the tacky residue it leaves behind. I only had to try it a couple of times to know that I never wanted to use it again. Had to switch back to the Gilette stuff.</li>
            <li> Good deodorant for sensitive skin, and those with a fragance allergy as well. It gives you 24 hour protecion without being sticky or overpowering like others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum products for a long time and love them.  This product is NOT working for me.  Honestly, my pits smell at the end of the day - this has never happened.</li>
            <li> This works well for my MCS, and keeps my odor under control.  However, it takes forever to dry out.  I feel really gross and sticky after I use it.  I want to like it, because it&#x27;s clear and odor-free, and I do still use it when I&#x27;m wearing something that doesn&#x27;t cover my underarms, but feeling sticky all day is really hard to put up with.</li>
            <li> My husband started having a rash with his unscented deodorant. We tried several other brands and they did not work with the odor. This product is alcohol-free and it works!</li>
            <li> I have powerful and I mean powerful underarm body odor.  When wearing Oldspice my BO would clear a 2000 sq ft room just from daily activities.  Yes I shower, yes I use good soap.  I switched to Mitchum years ago and just recently found the sensitive skin product.  It works just like the regular, I can skip a shower here and there without smelling offensive.  It&#x27;s more gentle and I have zero armpit irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy this brand for life.</li>
            <li> Mitchum Anti-perspirant &amp; deodorant, of course, is a long-time product with a good reputation.  Along with that good reputation was the fact that in doing a good job with underarm odors and perspiration, it was harsh and often caused skin irritation, itching and breakouts.  Then, voila, in searching for a longer-lasting deodorant than I had available at my drugstore, I found on Amazon that Mitchum had a formula for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;.  I ordered a package of 6, and was never disappointed with the product.  This week, I received my second order of 6.  I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This did not keep me dry at all. I work in an office building so I don&#x27;t do anything overly intense and could feel the perspiration. It was pretty embarrassing. Luckily, I went with another deodorant and absolutely love it. It keeps me dry all day and stink free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Almay-Anti-Perspirant-Deodorant-Fragrance-2-25-Ounce/dp/B0039YQ8P0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1396214676&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;almay+fragrance+free+deodorant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It is the best. I prefer the unscented gel version because it&#x27;s great with sleeveless dresses or shirts.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I was looking for something that didn&#x27;t dry out and cause peeling on my under arms like other brands did. I used another type of Mitchum before that seemed to work fairly well, though that was a solid stick. I needed something a bit stronger and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;However, now I am stuck with six of these and they do not seem to work at all in controlling wetness. Unfortunate. &#x3D;/ Coupled with the fact that there is no scent or odor control, makes me want to throw them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is the gel that doesn&#x27;t work for me, I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> This product does not cause a rash for me, but does concern me a bit because it appears to still have an aluminum-derived ingredient in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. It&#x27;s the only deodorant I&#x27;ve found that works on sensitive skin. Hard to find, so glad I can bulk order on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it, and everyone around loves it, too.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to regular mens deodorant.  My armpits breakout into a red rash.  I found Mitchum sensitive skin deodorant has a different antiperspirant ingredient.  I have not had a breakout since.  I had a hard time finding this item at my local drug store.  So I buy this six-pack now.  It lasts forever and works.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really, really good.  In response to those comments who report stickiness- it is a gel, not a solid, so they may be over applying it and that is what is causing the stickiness.</li>
