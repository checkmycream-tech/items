            <li>Nice product!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait until I use it on my own hair!</li>
            <li>My hair is curlier, shinier, and more beautiful than ever since I started using this again, and I get compliments every day which is the best. :-)</li>
            <li>Good, but...</li>
            <li>Maybe this product is good for those that do.</li>
            <li>and I am good</li>
            <li>I have to say that even after a windy day I am good to go.  </li>
            <li>Have always loved this product.</li>
            <li>It smells sooooo good.</li>
            <li>Good luck, ladies.</li>
            <li>And he laughed.</li>
            <li>If he likes it, it has to be good.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re worried about the drying effect of silicone, John freida also makes a really good leave-in conditioner spray.</li>
            <li>All in all, a good value for a good product.</li>
            <li>great product love it</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Just wish there was more in the bottle!</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>I love this serum!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d give this more stars if I could!</li>
            <li>Best product for those of us with Curly Hair,  use the entire Curl line and you will have beautiful salon curls,  silky,  touchable hair.  </li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t even notice a smell.  </li>
            <li>This keeps my curls nice and curly</li>
            <li>My wife really liked of the John Frieda</li>
            <li>Honestly, sometimes I look like |I have a hay stack on my head.</li>
            <li>came super quick and in a timely fashion...great for taming the fly aways!</li>
            <li>So far, this is the best product I&#x27;ve found for my hair, but I&#x27;ve never found one that takes all the frizz out like I&#x27;d want.</li>
            <li>That is actually good, because you will have more good hair days using just the right amount.</li>
            <li>As a mom I don&#x27;t have time for all the extra flatiron blow drying curling so this is perfect, no fizz product !</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>So, it makes it behave better, but I cannot use this and expect my hair to behave.</li>
            <li>hair dries with more defined waves then when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>Better than l&#x27;oreal serums.</li>
            <li>I love love it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Excellent, but it looks bigger than it is.</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny and in better shape.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I put about three pumps into my hair after showering.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it more stars if I could...</li>
            <li>Price was just okay</li>
            <li>I love it for my curly hair</li>
            <li>but does the job:)</li>
            <li>Love this product, have used it for years on my wiry hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered and re-ordered many times.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my damaged hair smooth and shiny without making my hair greasy!</li>
            <li>I had to wash twice or more to remove.</li>
            <li>This product did give my hair shine and helped control most of my frizzies.</li>
            <li>However, with the latest version, it appears the company has changed the formula.</li>
            <li>the ends were smoother for sure.</li>
            <li>And I like it even more than the lighter-weight</li>
            <li>However, I still love -- and will continue to buy -- this.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and absolutely love the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Frizz-Ease for 14 years, and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Extra Strength gives me the best curl definition of all the silicone serums I have tried!  </li>
            <li>Works way better for some reason.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll like the results a lot better.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I used this after i tried many products.</li>
            <li>It does :) Can&#x27;t speak for the price</li>
            <li>Okay, so I know they list the amount of ounces.</li>
            <li>However, the packaging makes it look like you are getting a lot more product.</li>
            <li>Surely will buy again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This makes my hair look shiny and smooth !</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use just one \\&quot;push\\&quot; or you will find it too greasy.</li>
            <li>Because it was quite an impressive, frizzy afro (for a white girl).</li>
            <li>I use the serum, the more build-up it creates and</li>
            <li>I still love and use it</li>
            <li>I say it with love.  </li>
            <li>she washes her hair along with a leave in conditioner and the frizz is much, much better.  </li>
            <li>Her curls stay intact longer and look better than they ever have.  </li>
            <li>I am quite glad I bought it and waited for it.</li>
            <li>Also, it helps me control better how I apply it.</li>
            <li>Then you use more and more, as it gets drier and drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it goes on more evenly.</li>
            <li>I still think the product is great, but I don&#x27;t like the new bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this frizz ease product, it works great with my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>The picture on the box made me think I&#x27;d be able to get really smooth frizz-free curls, but I&#x27;m sure the woman in the picture used a curling iron to create her curls</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as effective as having one&#x27;s hair straightened but, then again, it&#x27;s not nearly as expensive either.  :-)  </li>
            <li>I am so glad and happy that I finally purchased it :).</li>
            <li>the more smooth my hair is.</li>
            <li>This product contains some silicones, which I have read are good for straight hair.</li>
            <li>Good Product always reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I spend WAY less time on my hair now and it looks WAY better and stays beautiful ALL day, no matter the weather!!</li>
            <li>I use other products afterward, but no matter what, this goes on first--it greatly helps!</li>
            <li>It dries naturally and always looks good now without any more effort on my part.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works with super frizzy and curly hair, but it is pretty good for my hair type.</li>
            <li>my hairs super frizzy!</li>
            <li>It gave beautiful results, no frizz on the ends and blow drying and flat ironing</li>
            <li>I have noticed since using this product that it helps to calm the frizziness and does give my hair more of a smooth appearance.</li>
            <li>I smooth this serum through my hair after getting out the shower and it makes no difference in the amount of frizz that I have throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Its such a great serum.</li>
            <li>Great quality for such price.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>you honestly don&#x27;t get that much for $8.00</li>
            <li>&quot; part just doesn&#x27;t fit in with my morning schedule.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been available for years--for a reason</li>
            <li>I bought this product primarily to help with tangles, but gave it 4 stars because my hair still had frizz, still felt dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps detangle and smooth split ends.</li>
            <li>I cut and style her hair most of the time and from dealing with it personally,  freshly washed on a windy day</li>
            <li>I have used it only once as of now, but I have a good feeling about this one. :)</li>
            <li>My hair is wild and this does a good job of taming it.</li>
            <li>and now I just shampoo like normal, use the serum when its wet, style it, then rub some of the smoothing creme on and spray with frizz ease hairspray to lock in the AWESOME :)</li>
            <li>The silicone feel is a bit strange, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Frizz Ease serum since the first year it came out, and until now it&#x27;s been one of my favorite styling products.</li>
            <li>Not understanding why the description doesn&#x27;t state that it will not come in original packaging.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to use, massages easily into hair, not oily and my hair feels so soft and light.</li>
            <li>So I honestly wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the results until I finally just happened to have very wet hair at the time of application.</li>
            <li>but as new products come out I have grown to love argon oil better as a right out of the shower hair elixir.</li>
            <li>I have a closet full of products that I bought, tried and stored away for another day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really helps with the frizz, especially on hot humid days.</li>
            <li>But, you have to use a whole lot more than they recommend.</li>
            <li>most people won&#x27;t need as much as me</li>
            <li>She has used regular frizz-ease for years and it works fairly well</li>
            <li>work really well to lump on your hair in a hurry and make it look better.</li>
            <li>This product is EXCELLENT and lasts me at least 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>I also use it near my roots, even though the bottle says not to, because that&#x27;s where most of my frizziness is (right on the top of my head).</li>
            <li>It also looks like it uses a lot more plastic than the previous bottle, which can&#x27;t be a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product to bring back some softness and remove some frizziness from recently permed hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is quick to frizz if I press it with a pressing comb and humidity or sweat makes contact with it.  </li>
            <li>I was hesistant because of the price, but luckily it was on sale today.  </li>
            <li>love this product, my hair is very frizzy especially during the warm months , this product takes care of it.</li>
            <li>My hair is a bit on the coarse side and the ends split easily, and this makes it look much better.</li>
            <li>Great, I use it everyday</li>
            <li>I rarely give 5 stars</li>
            <li>I use Wen hair products and the one they make is far better and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily...</li>
            <li>, the picture is kind of deceptive because only the purple piece holds product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair flat smooth and shiney!!</li>
            <li>but so far have needed to use more than one (mixing Macademia Healing oil, Giovanni&#x27;s Frizz be gone and a heat protectant).</li>
            <li>I prefer to use it directly on my hands and not on the brush, because it seems more economical to me.</li>
            <li>I had previously been using the two-phase, lightweight frizz control serum from John Frieda, and I was pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still gorgeous, obviously, but not as nice as when I&#x27;ve used other products.</li>
            <li>Like the other customer review, Id give it more stars if I could :)</li>
            <li>supplement which is key for many women in growing their hair is Mineral Rich Liquid supplement with or without Aloe.</li>
            <li>I use this right after getting out of the shower, and even though the bottle says to use one pump, I use 3.</li>
            <li>Then it was blow drying for an hour or so to get it to look right -</li>
            <li>All I need to do now to care for my hair is have it cut right and use this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like it that is easy to make my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I researched the best serum for natural african american hair and came across this serum.  </li>
            <li>Quite frankly, I notice a difference when drinking more water (as a general rule and taking supplements.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a bit to heavy for my own for the most part naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li>i really like this product I always put it on after I wash my hair and it leaves my hair looking smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>I live in a very hot, humid area and my hair will stay straight and smooth all day.</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast as well.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ll continue searching, but in the meantime this works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I like John Freida regular strength better.</li>
            <li>Thnks first for sending on time .this</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s on a low setting.</li>
            <li>I used it like 2 or 3 times only and I am mostly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>But I ran out and couldn&#x27;t wait for more to ship, and the local store I shop at didn&#x27;t seem to have any in stock.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from my first year or so, when I was heavy-handed, I don&#x27;t experience build-up in my hair from using this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>It worked very well in my hair!</li>
            <li>First off some information that might be helpful:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I first used this product in 2006 after a friend of mine with armpit length afro hair suggested it to me.</li>
            <li>but this Extra Strength works so much better for her.  </li>
            <li>i wash my hair and it helps with all the frizz, i love it and would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products, CHI Silk Infusion and Aveda Smooth Infusion to name a few</li>
            <li>In my case, it definitely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pump about three pumps&#x27; worth into my hand (I have a lot of hair), rub it between my hands, and apply to lightly towel-dried hair.</li>
            <li>Delighted to find it here as my local Ulta is regularly out of stock.</li>
            <li>SO when I first used this product I was able to just wash my curly hair rub the product through and let it dry curly</li>
            <li>the frizz is really pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>For anyone who needs a real weapon against unwanted curl and or frizz, this is like the magic bullet!!I have tried every thing, this is the only one that really does work.</li>
            <li>I then run a detangling brush through my hair to more evenly distribute the product, and I let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li>was a simple easy process.  </li>
            <li>Silicone-containing shampoos and conditioners have certainly helped me out, so perhaps there is some truth to what I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li>I imagine it would be too thick a product on fine hair, but most of us with curly/wiry hair have the thickness to handle it.  </li>
            <li>I need a whole arsenal of products.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really have a problem with frizz after heat-styling.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would soak into as much hair that way.  </li>
            <li>It helps to keep my hair straight even when i sweat.</li>
            <li>Ths stuff is great even for my thin, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair, this did nothing to help controlte frizz.</li>
            <li>Item was bubble wrapped safely and was just as I expected.</li>
            <li>No serum has worked for me much, but this one worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>I use the whole line though.</li>
            <li>and I run through these on the fast side</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products to defrizz my very curly hair over 30 years.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>I wear it straight.</li>
            <li>The silicones in this product coat the hair and keep it from absorbing moisture, which is supposed to reduce frizz.</li>
            <li>and you wear it straight</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and once the humidity hits it while straight it gets frizzy.</li>
            <li>but now I can&#x27;t wear my hair straight in the summer</li>
            <li>The serum provides shine but not so much for frizz.  </li>
            <li>The bottle emptied fast.  </li>
            <li>I add two pumps to sopping wet hair (important!)</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy and frizzy (but not too much)and this product really get the job done and it is not too greasy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and it helps control the &amp;#34;fly aways.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got real curl this wont help at all..  </li>
            <li>I had a problem with always having really poofy and frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Works really well for me.</li>
            <li>I have tried other more expensive brand serums but this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>So I now use a blob of this ON VERY WET HAIR and when it dries it has a rather nice, shiny, soft consistency.</li>
            <li>I only give this four stars because it is not a healthy product, but it works great for frizz and curls.</li>
            <li>(I have pretty frizzy naturally curly hair.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t have as much volume as it normally does.</li>
            <li>Not worth it with all the more convenient products out there.</li>
            <li>And since it only takes a tiny bit, my $10 bottle has lasted me a good six months of almost daily use.</li>
            <li>It looks great after styling with less time spent on it than before!</li>
            <li>With the new serum, my hair is very &amp;#34;poufy&amp;#34; and the curls don&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
            <li>I have 4C, relaxer free hair that is dry by nature.  </li>
            <li>bottle says to use sparingly, but use more or less depending on hair length and thickness.</li>
            <li>Have been able to grow my hair out the last two years because of it, after having very short hair for almost 20 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless this one bottle I&#x27;ve gotten is mislabeled or defective, I can only guess that the company has changed the amount of one or more  crucial ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this product (or sometimes the yellow bottle if I&#x27;m going to flat-iron my hair), my hair is smooth as glass and soft as silk.  </li>
            <li>My hair is much smoother, plus, I don&#x27;t have to use as much mousse and gel, leaving my hair soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>have really long (waist level), bleached/color treated, fine, thin, straight hair that tangles very easily and feels more dry than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With my first bottle, I always used way too much - my hair was smooth but heavy and dirty/greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way though, and for fine hair you might want to try the original formula first.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this product as an anti-frizz</li>
            <li>I frankly did not have high hopes.</li>
            <li>is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>My hair is so coarse and dry, but this product really makes my hair look so much better.</li>
            <li>IT FEEL SO FREAKIN&#x27; SOFT!!</li>
            <li>After using a blowdryer to straighten, it comes out soft and straight.  </li>
            <li>but is worth the extra $.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling really dry and more brittle.</li>
            <li>I use a little tiny bit on my own hair once in a while</li>
            <li>I can&#x60;t live without this anymore</li>
            <li>So yes I go through this stuff in a hurry but couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve tried using the product in this new style bottle 3 times now, and it doesn&#x27;t work the way it did before.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve tried the new formula (with the silk protein) and the new dispenser.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new serum to replace the one I had been using for 4 years.  </li>
            <li>It did not however, give her a lot of shine, but did make her hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>So this will  be my first and last frizz ease purchase.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well, and the effects last all day.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Using more is not better, you will wind up looking greasy.  </li>
            <li>I already use this product successfully but that ad is scary.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the other product is $4.00 more on Amazon, looks like I just might have to go to the store</li>
            <li>Hubby&#x27;s favorite stuff outside of the $150 a bottle from other names....</li>
            <li>But instead of being able to towel dry my hair (or get a goopy towel) I have to sit there and blow dry forever.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it works well for hair that is slightly fizzy, but for thicker Mediterranean hair, it does nothing to help smooth out.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount each day to keep hair looking nice.</li>
            <li>It stayed flat and straight!</li>
            <li>After that, I have been using two to three pumps right after I shower, waiting for it to dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had coarse, super thick hair that frizzes with or w/o humidity which only gets more so with age.</li>
            <li>I only use a little bit, put in the palm of my hand, and concentrate on my ends, where I get the most Frizz.</li>
            <li>I have crazy curly hair, so this is great.</li>
            <li>My daughter lives it and uses it any day she goes natural.</li>
            <li>No heavy buildup of residue either.</li>
            <li>My hair was flowier than I would like and soft and managable.</li>
            <li>Now I am natural and still use it on my curls.</li>
            <li>I have soft naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>My hair is under control, soft and</li>
            <li>The suggested usage size is far underestimated.</li>
            <li>I put it on a few minutes after combing hair out- works fantastic.</li>
            <li>It did not reduce frizzing and left a very oily-silicone coating on my hands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a naturally curly girl who wears a wash and go 90% of the time,</li>
            <li>I use it on my damp hair after washing, and it dries to natural curls</li>
            <li>it surprised me.</li>
            <li>I have finally found a product that really works for my hair</li>
            <li>When used properly it works really well and takes care of frizz.</li>
            <li>every time it comes on - can&#x27;t turn it off fast enough.</li>
            <li>I have naturally (ringlet)</li>
            <li>and it bans frizz and leaves my hair feeling so moisturized and soft during straightening</li>
            <li>works well against frizz, leaves hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>although because of how thick my hair is I use a bit more than it says you have to in the directions.    </li>
            <li>Purchased this to replace another serum by John Frieda that i loved using ( sadly, it&#x27;s been discontinued).</li>
            <li>Very light formula and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>No more frizz-ease ! :)</li>
            <li>I then use low heat in combination with a detangling brush primarily when very wet.</li>
            <li>I love this product but feel that the packaging is bulky and exorbitant for the very small bottle that it holds.</li>
            <li>For several years after high school, I went curly and tried to do the no-shampoo, no-cone thing</li>
            <li>I use FIVE pumps of this mixed with a tsp of creme conditioner (the kind you leave in after washing, there are several on the market), mixed in my hand then run through my just washed, towel dried hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stick out far enough from the bottle, so the serum dribbles down onto the side of the bottle instead of coming out cleanly.</li>
            <li>I apply when my hair is pretty wet, get out of the shower, squeeze excess water out and apply.  </li>
            <li>Because my hair is color-treated, it tends to be dry; frizz is what happens when dry hair absorbs moisture from the air and Georgia is certainly humid for much of the year.</li>
            <li>It works on my stick straight dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It gets really frizzy in humid climates and when it&#x27;s not frizzy just looks dry.  </li>
            <li>The first time I applied it, I used three to four pumps (I definitely overkilled it), since I figured I had really long hair.</li>
            <li>originally considered this a five star product, although I lowered that to four stars when it was changed a few years ago from pleasantly unscented to unpleasantly scented.</li>
            <li>This stuff actually makes it soft and calms the frizz!</li>
            <li>I can only wash my hair every 5 days or so because its so dry and since using this product, it stays smooth and flat for the entire time.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t believe the instructions when it said it should be applied to very wet hair.</li>
            <li>Once 50% dry, I use the paddle brush to smooth the hair down (in sections).</li>
            <li>My hair is now softer and shinier than ever, and actually stays flat and straight all day, and the frizz is gone.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair, and this product has helped me tame it and redefine its mild curls.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and consequently it&#x27;s also very dry.</li>
            <li>After using this product along with my new HSI flat iron, I have had NO FRIZZ in humid and damp weather.  </li>
            <li>IT also lasts so long, you hardly need any to make it work its magic.</li>
            <li>I was shocked but happy.</li>
            <li>It was the only thing that made my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my hair silky and soft the next day</li>
            <li>Going back to my old products: Be Curly by Aveda followed by a dime-sized squeeze of Sebastian&#x27;s Texturizer.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and silky the next day!</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and after using this, it is so smooth and stays that way for days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, a little greasy, one finished will go back to the other product.</li>
            <li>I thought the only way I could fix my hair was to blow dry it straight and wear it like that or</li>
            <li>since I have super thick hair this surprised me.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that is fine, so I use a small amount after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>As I get older and my hair turns grey, this product offers a solution to that dry, brittle look.  </li>
            <li>I first used John Frieda Frizz-Ease serum in high school, when I was still trying to straighten my thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>After the wash, while damp I use the Extra Strength 6 Effects Serum,  let air dry,  then Spray the Dream Curls Daily Styling Spray,  work through hair and you are ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>I thought this stuff works well enough, but the whole \\&quot;use on soaking wet hair\\</li>
            <li>I have very dry, frizzy hair normally, so I picked this up at Walmart on a whim.</li>
            <li>There is definitely less frizz when I use this serum, but my hair still isn&#x27;t completely tamed, and it still feels pretty dry.</li>
            <li>blow dry, she used high heat with a paddle brush and then used a GHD flat iron.</li>
            <li>My hair is relatively fine and long (below the shoulders) and has a tendency to &#x27;frizz&#x27; with the least bit of humidity.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely calmed down my hair, and when I blowed dryed my hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think this is a 3-star product: it helps with my frizz but doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of it, and my hair feels dry and flatter.</li>
            <li>If you have long thick hair.... and are looking for smooth, silky and heat protected hair....</li>
            <li>but it works extremely well for my hair which is very long and fine with a slight wave.</li>
            <li>I have coarse frizzy hair and it really tames it down.  </li>
            <li>I took off one star for price because I think its a little much for what you get.</li>
            <li>A little too much can make the hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>Following this, I use my GHD or High Shine Remington Flat Iron (no higher than 190C) and do this process only once a week - 2 weeks.</li>

            <li> Just wish there was more in the bottle!</li>
            <li> I just love it!</li>
            <li> I love this serum!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d give this more stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Best product for those of us with Curly Hair,  use the entire Curl line and you will have beautiful salon curls,  silky,  touchable hair.  </li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t even notice a smell.  </li>
            <li> This keeps my curls nice and curly</li>
            <li> My wife really liked of the John Frieda</li>
            <li> Honestly, sometimes I look like |I have a hay stack on my head.</li>
            <li> came super quick and in a timely fashion...great for taming the fly aways!</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best product I&#x27;ve found for my hair, but I&#x27;ve never found one that takes all the frizz out like I&#x27;d want.</li>
            <li> That is actually good, because you will have more good hair days using just the right amount.</li>
            <li> As a mom I don&#x27;t have time for all the extra flatiron blow drying curling so this is perfect, no fizz product !</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> So, it makes it behave better, but I cannot use this and expect my hair to behave.</li>
            <li> hair dries with more defined waves then when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> Better than l&#x27;oreal serums.</li>
            <li> I love love it.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Excellent, but it looks bigger than it is.</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny and in better shape.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I put about three pumps into my hair after showering.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it more stars if I could...</li>
            <li> Price was just okay</li>
            <li> I love it for my curly hair</li>
            <li> but does the job:)</li>
            <li> Love this product, have used it for years on my wiry hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered and re-ordered many times.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my damaged hair smooth and shiny without making my hair greasy!</li>
            <li> I had to wash twice or more to remove.</li>
            <li> This product did give my hair shine and helped control most of my frizzies.</li>
            <li> However, with the latest version, it appears the company has changed the formula.</li>
            <li> the ends were smoother for sure.</li>
            <li> And I like it even more than the lighter-weight</li>
            <li> However, I still love -- and will continue to buy -- this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and absolutely love the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Frizz-Ease for 14 years, and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Extra Strength gives me the best curl definition of all the silicone serums I have tried!  </li>
            <li> Works way better for some reason.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll like the results a lot better.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I used this after i tried many products.</li>
            <li> It does :) Can&#x27;t speak for the price</li>
            <li> Okay, so I know they list the amount of ounces.</li>
            <li> However, the packaging makes it look like you are getting a lot more product.</li>
            <li> Surely will buy again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This makes my hair look shiny and smooth !</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use just one \\&quot;push\\&quot; or you will find it too greasy.</li>
            <li> Because it was quite an impressive, frizzy afro (for a white girl).</li>
            <li> I use the serum, the more build-up it creates and</li>
            <li> I still love and use it</li>
            <li> I say it with love.  </li>
            <li> she washes her hair along with a leave in conditioner and the frizz is much, much better.  </li>
            <li> Her curls stay intact longer and look better than they ever have.  </li>
            <li> I am quite glad I bought it and waited for it.</li>
            <li> Also, it helps me control better how I apply it.</li>
            <li> Then you use more and more, as it gets drier and drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it goes on more evenly.</li>
            <li> I still think the product is great, but I don&#x27;t like the new bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this frizz ease product, it works great with my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> The picture on the box made me think I&#x27;d be able to get really smooth frizz-free curls, but I&#x27;m sure the woman in the picture used a curling iron to create her curls</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as effective as having one&#x27;s hair straightened but, then again, it&#x27;s not nearly as expensive either.  :-)  </li>
            <li> I am so glad and happy that I finally purchased it :).</li>
            <li> the more smooth my hair is.</li>
            <li> This product contains some silicones, which I have read are good for straight hair.</li>
            <li> Good Product always reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I spend WAY less time on my hair now and it looks WAY better and stays beautiful ALL day, no matter the weather!!</li>
            <li> I use other products afterward, but no matter what, this goes on first--it greatly helps!</li>
            <li> It dries naturally and always looks good now without any more effort on my part.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works with super frizzy and curly hair, but it is pretty good for my hair type.</li>
            <li> my hairs super frizzy!</li>
            <li> It gave beautiful results, no frizz on the ends and blow drying and flat ironing</li>
            <li> I have noticed since using this product that it helps to calm the frizziness and does give my hair more of a smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> I smooth this serum through my hair after getting out the shower and it makes no difference in the amount of frizz that I have throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Its such a great serum.</li>
            <li> Great quality for such price.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> you honestly don&#x27;t get that much for $8.00</li>
            <li> &quot; part just doesn&#x27;t fit in with my morning schedule.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been available for years--for a reason</li>
            <li> I bought this product primarily to help with tangles, but gave it 4 stars because my hair still had frizz, still felt dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps detangle and smooth split ends.</li>
            <li> I cut and style her hair most of the time and from dealing with it personally,  freshly washed on a windy day</li>
            <li> I have used it only once as of now, but I have a good feeling about this one. :)</li>
            <li> My hair is wild and this does a good job of taming it.</li>
            <li> and now I just shampoo like normal, use the serum when its wet, style it, then rub some of the smoothing creme on and spray with frizz ease hairspray to lock in the AWESOME :)</li>
            <li> The silicone feel is a bit strange, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Frizz Ease serum since the first year it came out, and until now it&#x27;s been one of my favorite styling products.</li>
            <li> Not understanding why the description doesn&#x27;t state that it will not come in original packaging.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to use, massages easily into hair, not oily and my hair feels so soft and light.</li>
            <li> So I honestly wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the results until I finally just happened to have very wet hair at the time of application.</li>
            <li> but as new products come out I have grown to love argon oil better as a right out of the shower hair elixir.</li>
            <li> I have a closet full of products that I bought, tried and stored away for another day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really helps with the frizz, especially on hot humid days.</li>
            <li> But, you have to use a whole lot more than they recommend.</li>
            <li> most people won&#x27;t need as much as me</li>
            <li> She has used regular frizz-ease for years and it works fairly well</li>
            <li> work really well to lump on your hair in a hurry and make it look better.</li>
            <li> This product is EXCELLENT and lasts me at least 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I also use it near my roots, even though the bottle says not to, because that&#x27;s where most of my frizziness is (right on the top of my head).</li>
            <li> It also looks like it uses a lot more plastic than the previous bottle, which can&#x27;t be a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product to bring back some softness and remove some frizziness from recently permed hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is quick to frizz if I press it with a pressing comb and humidity or sweat makes contact with it.  </li>
            <li> I was hesistant because of the price, but luckily it was on sale today.  </li>
            <li> love this product, my hair is very frizzy especially during the warm months , this product takes care of it.</li>
            <li> My hair is a bit on the coarse side and the ends split easily, and this makes it look much better.</li>
            <li> Great, I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I rarely give 5 stars</li>
            <li> I use Wen hair products and the one they make is far better and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily...</li>
            <li> , the picture is kind of deceptive because only the purple piece holds product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair flat smooth and shiney!!</li>
            <li> but so far have needed to use more than one (mixing Macademia Healing oil, Giovanni&#x27;s Frizz be gone and a heat protectant).</li>
            <li> I prefer to use it directly on my hands and not on the brush, because it seems more economical to me.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using the two-phase, lightweight frizz control serum from John Frieda, and I was pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still gorgeous, obviously, but not as nice as when I&#x27;ve used other products.</li>
            <li> Like the other customer review, Id give it more stars if I could :)</li>
            <li> supplement which is key for many women in growing their hair is Mineral Rich Liquid supplement with or without Aloe.</li>
            <li> I use this right after getting out of the shower, and even though the bottle says to use one pump, I use 3.</li>
            <li> Then it was blow drying for an hour or so to get it to look right -</li>
            <li> All I need to do now to care for my hair is have it cut right and use this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like it that is easy to make my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I researched the best serum for natural african american hair and came across this serum.  </li>
            <li> Quite frankly, I notice a difference when drinking more water (as a general rule and taking supplements.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a bit to heavy for my own for the most part naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li> i really like this product I always put it on after I wash my hair and it leaves my hair looking smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> I live in a very hot, humid area and my hair will stay straight and smooth all day.</li>
            <li> It arrived very fast as well.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ll continue searching, but in the meantime this works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I like John Freida regular strength better.</li>
            <li> Thnks first for sending on time .this</li>
            <li> sure it&#x27;s on a low setting.</li>
            <li> I used it like 2 or 3 times only and I am mostly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> But I ran out and couldn&#x27;t wait for more to ship, and the local store I shop at didn&#x27;t seem to have any in stock.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from my first year or so, when I was heavy-handed, I don&#x27;t experience build-up in my hair from using this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> It worked very well in my hair!</li>
            <li> First off some information that might be helpful:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I first used this product in 2006 after a friend of mine with armpit length afro hair suggested it to me.</li>
            <li> but this Extra Strength works so much better for her.  </li>
            <li> i wash my hair and it helps with all the frizz, i love it and would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products, CHI Silk Infusion and Aveda Smooth Infusion to name a few</li>
            <li> In my case, it definitely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pump about three pumps&#x27; worth into my hand (I have a lot of hair), rub it between my hands, and apply to lightly towel-dried hair.</li>
            <li> Delighted to find it here as my local Ulta is regularly out of stock.</li>
            <li> SO when I first used this product I was able to just wash my curly hair rub the product through and let it dry curly</li>
            <li> the frizz is really pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> For anyone who needs a real weapon against unwanted curl and or frizz, this is like the magic bullet!!I have tried every thing, this is the only one that really does work.</li>
            <li> I then run a detangling brush through my hair to more evenly distribute the product, and I let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> was a simple easy process.  </li>
            <li> Silicone-containing shampoos and conditioners have certainly helped me out, so perhaps there is some truth to what I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> I imagine it would be too thick a product on fine hair, but most of us with curly/wiry hair have the thickness to handle it.  </li>
            <li> I need a whole arsenal of products.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really have a problem with frizz after heat-styling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would soak into as much hair that way.  </li>
            <li> It helps to keep my hair straight even when i sweat.</li>
            <li> Ths stuff is great even for my thin, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair, this did nothing to help controlte frizz.</li>
            <li> Item was bubble wrapped safely and was just as I expected.</li>
            <li> No serum has worked for me much, but this one worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I use the whole line though.</li>
            <li> and I run through these on the fast side</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products to defrizz my very curly hair over 30 years.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li> I wear it straight.</li>
            <li> The silicones in this product coat the hair and keep it from absorbing moisture, which is supposed to reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> and you wear it straight</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and once the humidity hits it while straight it gets frizzy.</li>
            <li> but now I can&#x27;t wear my hair straight in the summer</li>
            <li> The serum provides shine but not so much for frizz.  </li>
            <li> The bottle emptied fast.  </li>
            <li> I add two pumps to sopping wet hair (important!)</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and frizzy (but not too much)and this product really get the job done and it is not too greasy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much and it helps control the &amp;#34;fly aways.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got real curl this wont help at all..  </li>
            <li> I had a problem with always having really poofy and frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Works really well for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried other more expensive brand serums but this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> So I now use a blob of this ON VERY WET HAIR and when it dries it has a rather nice, shiny, soft consistency.</li>
            <li> I only give this four stars because it is not a healthy product, but it works great for frizz and curls.</li>
            <li> (I have pretty frizzy naturally curly hair.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t have as much volume as it normally does.</li>
            <li> Not worth it with all the more convenient products out there.</li>
            <li> And since it only takes a tiny bit, my $10 bottle has lasted me a good six months of almost daily use.</li>
            <li> It looks great after styling with less time spent on it than before!</li>
            <li> With the new serum, my hair is very &amp;#34;poufy&amp;#34; and the curls don&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
            <li> I have 4C, relaxer free hair that is dry by nature.  </li>
            <li> bottle says to use sparingly, but use more or less depending on hair length and thickness.</li>
            <li> Have been able to grow my hair out the last two years because of it, after having very short hair for almost 20 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless this one bottle I&#x27;ve gotten is mislabeled or defective, I can only guess that the company has changed the amount of one or more  crucial ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this product (or sometimes the yellow bottle if I&#x27;m going to flat-iron my hair), my hair is smooth as glass and soft as silk.  </li>
            <li> My hair is much smoother, plus, I don&#x27;t have to use as much mousse and gel, leaving my hair soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> have really long (waist level), bleached/color treated, fine, thin, straight hair that tangles very easily and feels more dry than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With my first bottle, I always used way too much - my hair was smooth but heavy and dirty/greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way though, and for fine hair you might want to try the original formula first.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend this product as an anti-frizz</li>
            <li> I frankly did not have high hopes.</li>
            <li> is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> My hair is so coarse and dry, but this product really makes my hair look so much better.</li>
            <li> IT FEEL SO FREAKIN&#x27; SOFT!!</li>
            <li> After using a blowdryer to straighten, it comes out soft and straight.  </li>
            <li> but is worth the extra $.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling really dry and more brittle.</li>
            <li> I use a little tiny bit on my own hair once in a while</li>
            <li> I can&#x60;t live without this anymore</li>
            <li> So yes I go through this stuff in a hurry but couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve tried using the product in this new style bottle 3 times now, and it doesn&#x27;t work the way it did before.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve tried the new formula (with the silk protein) and the new dispenser.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new serum to replace the one I had been using for 4 years.  </li>
            <li> It did not however, give her a lot of shine, but did make her hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> So this will  be my first and last frizz ease purchase.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well, and the effects last all day.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Using more is not better, you will wind up looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> I already use this product successfully but that ad is scary.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the other product is $4.00 more on Amazon, looks like I just might have to go to the store</li>
            <li> Hubby&#x27;s favorite stuff outside of the $150 a bottle from other names....</li>
            <li> But instead of being able to towel dry my hair (or get a goopy towel) I have to sit there and blow dry forever.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it works well for hair that is slightly fizzy, but for thicker Mediterranean hair, it does nothing to help smooth out.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount each day to keep hair looking nice.</li>
            <li> It stayed flat and straight!</li>
            <li> After that, I have been using two to three pumps right after I shower, waiting for it to dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had coarse, super thick hair that frizzes with or w/o humidity which only gets more so with age.</li>
            <li> I only use a little bit, put in the palm of my hand, and concentrate on my ends, where I get the most Frizz.</li>
            <li> I have crazy curly hair, so this is great.</li>
            <li> My daughter lives it and uses it any day she goes natural.</li>
            <li> No heavy buildup of residue either.</li>
            <li> My hair was flowier than I would like and soft and managable.</li>
            <li> Now I am natural and still use it on my curls.</li>
            <li> I have soft naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair is under control, soft and</li>
            <li> The suggested usage size is far underestimated.</li>
            <li> I put it on a few minutes after combing hair out- works fantastic.</li>
            <li> It did not reduce frizzing and left a very oily-silicone coating on my hands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a naturally curly girl who wears a wash and go 90% of the time,</li>
            <li> I use it on my damp hair after washing, and it dries to natural curls</li>
            <li> it surprised me.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a product that really works for my hair</li>
            <li> When used properly it works really well and takes care of frizz.</li>
            <li> every time it comes on - can&#x27;t turn it off fast enough.</li>
            <li> I have naturally (ringlet)</li>
            <li> and it bans frizz and leaves my hair feeling so moisturized and soft during straightening</li>
            <li> works well against frizz, leaves hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> although because of how thick my hair is I use a bit more than it says you have to in the directions.    </li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace another serum by John Frieda that i loved using ( sadly, it&#x27;s been discontinued).</li>
            <li> Very light formula and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> No more frizz-ease ! :)</li>
            <li> I then use low heat in combination with a detangling brush primarily when very wet.</li>
            <li> I love this product but feel that the packaging is bulky and exorbitant for the very small bottle that it holds.</li>
            <li> For several years after high school, I went curly and tried to do the no-shampoo, no-cone thing</li>
            <li> I use FIVE pumps of this mixed with a tsp of creme conditioner (the kind you leave in after washing, there are several on the market), mixed in my hand then run through my just washed, towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick out far enough from the bottle, so the serum dribbles down onto the side of the bottle instead of coming out cleanly.</li>
            <li> I apply when my hair is pretty wet, get out of the shower, squeeze excess water out and apply.  </li>
            <li> Because my hair is color-treated, it tends to be dry; frizz is what happens when dry hair absorbs moisture from the air and Georgia is certainly humid for much of the year.</li>
            <li> It works on my stick straight dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It gets really frizzy in humid climates and when it&#x27;s not frizzy just looks dry.  </li>
            <li> The first time I applied it, I used three to four pumps (I definitely overkilled it), since I figured I had really long hair.</li>
            <li> originally considered this a five star product, although I lowered that to four stars when it was changed a few years ago from pleasantly unscented to unpleasantly scented.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually makes it soft and calms the frizz!</li>
            <li> I can only wash my hair every 5 days or so because its so dry and since using this product, it stays smooth and flat for the entire time.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t believe the instructions when it said it should be applied to very wet hair.</li>
            <li> Once 50% dry, I use the paddle brush to smooth the hair down (in sections).</li>
            <li> My hair is now softer and shinier than ever, and actually stays flat and straight all day, and the frizz is gone.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair, and this product has helped me tame it and redefine its mild curls.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and consequently it&#x27;s also very dry.</li>
            <li> After using this product along with my new HSI flat iron, I have had NO FRIZZ in humid and damp weather.  </li>
            <li> IT also lasts so long, you hardly need any to make it work its magic.</li>
            <li> I was shocked but happy.</li>
            <li> It was the only thing that made my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps my hair silky and soft the next day</li>
            <li> Going back to my old products: Be Curly by Aveda followed by a dime-sized squeeze of Sebastian&#x27;s Texturizer.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and silky the next day!</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and after using this, it is so smooth and stays that way for days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, a little greasy, one finished will go back to the other product.</li>
            <li> I thought the only way I could fix my hair was to blow dry it straight and wear it like that or</li>
            <li> since I have super thick hair this surprised me.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is fine, so I use a small amount after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> As I get older and my hair turns grey, this product offers a solution to that dry, brittle look.  </li>
            <li> I first used John Frieda Frizz-Ease serum in high school, when I was still trying to straighten my thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> After the wash, while damp I use the Extra Strength 6 Effects Serum,  let air dry,  then Spray the Dream Curls Daily Styling Spray,  work through hair and you are ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> I thought this stuff works well enough, but the whole \\&quot;use on soaking wet hair\\</li>
            <li> I have very dry, frizzy hair normally, so I picked this up at Walmart on a whim.</li>
            <li> There is definitely less frizz when I use this serum, but my hair still isn&#x27;t completely tamed, and it still feels pretty dry.</li>
            <li> blow dry, she used high heat with a paddle brush and then used a GHD flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is relatively fine and long (below the shoulders) and has a tendency to &#x27;frizz&#x27; with the least bit of humidity.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely calmed down my hair, and when I blowed dryed my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think this is a 3-star product: it helps with my frizz but doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of it, and my hair feels dry and flatter.</li>
            <li> If you have long thick hair.... and are looking for smooth, silky and heat protected hair....</li>
            <li> but it works extremely well for my hair which is very long and fine with a slight wave.</li>
            <li> I have coarse frizzy hair and it really tames it down.  </li>
            <li> I took off one star for price because I think its a little much for what you get.</li>
            <li> A little too much can make the hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> Following this, I use my GHD or High Shine Remington Flat Iron (no higher than 190C) and do this process only once a week - 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tame all of the frizziness on very humid days</li>
            <li> I am african American with natural hair and all I have to do is useca little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure you can use too much.</li>
            <li> I apply this serum after straightening my 3b/3c hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> and when I flat iron it.     </li>
            <li> I have long hair and only use a pump or two max.</li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning I apply this product blowdry and flat iron.</li>
            <li> And it does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> I apply it before I use a flat iron and.....</li>
            <li> I usually use it with the serum since my ends can get pretty dry as my hair is so long.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair since I color it, and this seems to put some moisture back into it.  </li>
            <li> (Not sure of my exact &amp;#34;hair rating&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m a 4A or 4B, and have extremely frizzy</li>
            <li> See that little purple vial INSIDE the clear part?</li>
            <li> I used it on my little girl&#x27;s hair who has natural 4a textured hair.  </li>
            <li> I used this before and after I flat iron, blow dry, or curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not African-American, just a white chick with very curly/frizzy hair, which is also thick and very dry.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair least frizzy unlike so much products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Some products if you use too much make your hair look greasy or feel icky, not this stuff.</li>
            <li> One thing is make sure you do not get this on your roots, it makes your hair greasy and sometimes feel really dirty.  </li>
            <li> For a long period of time I used Sebastian Laminates.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after my shower, and my hair is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long wavy/curly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, so a squeeze about the size of a quarter on my palm, rub both palms together then just use my hands and combs to distribute throughout my hair.  </li>
            <li> Long term use of silicones has a drying affect on ones hair.</li>
            <li> But I have been using it long term for 4 months on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it is a nightmare.</li>
            <li> Because this is the extra strength serum, you definitely only need less, but it works so well.</li>
            <li> Especially if you dont have time to straighten, use a half a dime size and it will defrizz in an instant.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally wavy or curly hair and you want to tame it or flatout straighten it, you need this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair that I struggled with when I was younger.</li>
            <li> Even put on dry hair i have not came across any excess weight.</li>
            <li> I then let my hair air-dry and brush it after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> You can leave it till dry or you can style it.</li>
            <li> Apply liberally and if you&#x27;re going to blow dry - make</li>
            <li> I even used it to blow dry my daughters hair and</li>
            <li> If your hair is color-treated or otherwise dry</li>
            <li> I do air dry my hair almost always now because of an injury and even with air drying this product make all the difference.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to allow my hair to air dry for about 5 mins after applying the leave ins.</li>
            <li> and this doesnt do anything but dry it out like blowing tumbleweed....  </li>
            <li> Works well for my dry, processed hair.</li>
            <li> I live in a pretty cold climate which requires me to have dry hair before I walk out the door.  </li>
            <li> so my only complaint is that the bottle isn&#x27;t big enough!  </li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering this product from Amazon, and I am not happy with the fact that it was shipped out of the box, in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> This extra strength seems to weigh my hair down, causing greasy strings.</li>
            <li> My hair definitely doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down or greasy</li>
            <li> Still, I like it and it lasts a long time because you only need a little dot of product.</li>
            <li> I have thick, unmanageable hair which frequently becomes dry and frizzes up all the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I won&#x27;t be using this any more, this next comment won&#x27;t affect me, but I also have to say the new packaging is awful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey for the tiny bottle, but it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> I think next time I&#x27;ll try towel-drying my hair a little before I use the product, and then brushing it to help distribute the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I save a little and have a regular source.</li>
            <li> I apply Frizz-Ease after towel drying and combing out my hair and my hair silky and contained - not straight, the wavy curl is now defined and I can style it</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product a few years back</li>
            <li> You want your hair between damp and wet.</li>
            <li> nothing I tried it on my wet curly hair</li>
            <li> I do have to use a lot of this stuff, but that&#x27;s to be expected with my hair length.</li>
            <li> , go ahead and go with the wet hair thing.</li>
            <li> This works well when your hair gets wet from the rain as well as out the shower.  </li>
            <li> There is a fight for the remote</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, but be careful.</li>
            <li> I Have really thick, coarse, wavy hair and this product only helped if I used a bunch at one time.</li>
            <li> my only other option was to have it curly but keep it in a tight ponytail or else</li>
            <li> I use about a nickel-sized amount (my hair is very long, it reaches the small of my back) and divide my hair into sections to apply it</li>
            <li> It definitely helps tame my flyaway ends.  </li>
            <li> My Mom has natural, extremely curly, thick hair that loves to frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that I will no longer be able to use this product, and will now have to spend the time and money to try out new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried numerous other products to tame the Frizz</li>
            <li> Price decent but not great.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and for a girl with curly hair, it&#x27;s been a lifesaver.  </li>
            <li> I searched for this everywhere and didn&#x27;t realize they&#x27;d changed the bottle until I went to a past order and saw that this was the same thing.</li>
            <li> My hair gets extremely frizzy and I have issues with fly-aways.</li>
            <li> I got rid of my other serums.</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t speak for other hair types.)</li>
            <li> Ditto with the other two John Frieda products I wrote about.</li>
            <li> How ever I have drifted off and tried other serums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for other alternative leave ins</li>
            <li> I used to spend a long time trying to tame my hair</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave hair looking greasy or dirty - just natural, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Other products would either weigh down my curls or leave them looking greasy or feeling crispy.</li>
            <li> Small amount used and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Also this is something I just am weird about I dont really like putting this on my hands and then finger combing it through my hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle says something about applying it to wet or TOWEL DRIED hair</li>
            <li> I have found no better product to tame my coarse frizzy hair than John Frieda Frizz-Ease.</li>
            <li> It holds the frizzes down.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with the Frizz-Ease Wind Down Relaxing Cream.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t usually blow dry my hair), and then brushing it with ease.</li>
            <li> I tried applying less</li>
            <li> It just cost less.</li>
            <li> Cant tell if it works or there is less humidity</li>
            <li> It was getting to the point of frustration going into work with my hair looking like a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is not sweet smelling like a lot of products.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick, wavy hair, and this is my #1 product.  </li>
            <li> It all depends on the weather and how it is dried as to the end product, but the frizz is dramatically cut down with the use of Frizz-Ease.  </li>
            <li> I have curly wavy thick dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair just comes out like a shapeless mess.</li>
            <li> A little goes a lonnngggg way.</li>
            <li> With a little practice, I got the hang of</li>
            <li> a little straw-like.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get product out without it running down the side, and it&#x27;s a bit top-heavy due to the design.</li>
            <li> You should not have to filled this stupid box out.  </li>
            <li> No need for harsh styling products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> remains touchable, can run your hands through your hair without destroying the style.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t done the towel dried way yet.  </li>
            <li> Then I put on my towel turbie for a few minutes to soak up some of the water, apply some mousse, and then use my hair dryer and diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed \\&quot;heavy hair\\&quot; or greasy hair.  </li>
            <li> plus it is a waste of money DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> a few times before I had that &amp;#34;ah-ha&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This stuff dries the hair out with its harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I used this everyday to tame the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this serum would behave if I were to straighten my hair with an iron, I haven&#x27;t tried it because I know my hair becomes a mess at the slightest modification of air humidity.</li>
            <li> So if your looking for something to tame your hair keep frizz out</li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> My wife has a hard time keeping the frizz down in her hair.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I had a bad frizz problem and this and the conditioning spray took care of it.  </li>
            <li> Just rub a little on your hands, then through hair and voila!</li>
            <li> and I was frizz city as usual.</li>
            <li> I don’t like that it&#x27;s small however,</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that is hard to tame.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t very thick, but it does go down to about mid-back, and when I used one or two pumps</li>
            <li> Usually I try and keep at least two bottles on hand at all times, because I never want to run out.</li>
            <li> I just dont like the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; texture...but once on the hair ts not sticky or hard or anything.     </li>
            <li> My daughter uses this all the time and had a hard time finding it.</li>
            <li> well at least not on mine or my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I use at least 6 pumps every time</li>
            <li> We are going to return to at least the no-chemical part of the curly girl method.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have frizzy and thick, wavy, hair.</li>
            <li> The problem with that is that God gave me some really thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Works very nicely on thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> But for thick hair with frizz, perfection.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for her, but that don&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> I mean this is a very small tube that works off a pump</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair that comes just past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last and that&#x27;s too bad.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have frizz, I don&#x27;t have dry ugly ends.  </li>
            <li> After awhile I was sick of straightening my hair day after day, it was time-consuming not to mention all the heat from the tools I was using were giving my hair a dry and fried look and feel.     </li>
            <li> Thanks in advance for removing this stupid and senseless requirements!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works for everyone as I have friends that are not happy with it</li>
            <li> His hair curly, getting thin at 69.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product another try recently and hated it--again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of wasting plastic containers and unnecessary boxes!</li>
            <li> I tried this product, and once again another failed trial.</li>
            <li> I have weird curly/</li>
            <li> I was in horrible humid conditions, and my hair didn&#x27;t get big!</li>
            <li> A very poor product design.</li>
            <li> It just gives some body to my very thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Reading all the bad reviews, I have a feeling people are using it wrong.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with the classics!</li>
            <li> The pump is almost impossible to use.</li>
            <li> (if that sounds like an outrageous amount, keep in mind that my hair is very thick and reaches my mid-back after curling up).  </li>
            <li> it makes your hair smell bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in Houston and the humidity is horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I definitely can tell a difference when I use this product. As a mom I don&#x27;t have time for all the extra flatiron blow drying curling so this is perfect, no fizz product !</li>
            <li> Best product for those of us with Curly Hair,  use the entire Curl line and you will have beautiful salon curls,  silky,  touchable hair.  No need for harsh styling products.&lt;br /&gt;I use the shampoo, conditioner. After the wash, while damp I use the Extra Strength 6 Effects Serum,  let air dry,  then Spray the Dream Curls Daily Styling Spray,  work through hair and you are ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Hair remains touchable, can run your hands through your hair without destroying the style.&lt;br /&gt;Have used these products for years and would  Not use anything else....</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. It is a godsend for my hair. It only takes a tiny amount and my hair is sleek,smooth and shiny all day. I don&#x27;t think it works for everyone as I have friends that are not happy with it but it works extremely well for my hair which is very long and fine with a slight wave.In Europe you can buy purse size bottles and I wish I could find them in North America.</li>
            <li> Good, but...I have frizzy and thick, wavy, hair. So, it makes it behave better, but I cannot use this and expect my hair to behave. I need a whole arsenal of products.</li>
            <li> I have finally found the product that works for my hair!  The price and product are great.</li>
            <li> I am African American and have wavy to curly hair. I smooth this serum through my hair after getting out the shower and it makes no difference in the amount of frizz that I have throughout the day. The picture on the box made me think I&#x27;d be able to get really smooth frizz-free curls, but I&#x27;m sure the woman in the picture used a curling iron to create her curls and I don&#x27;t really have a problem with frizz after heat-styling. Maybe this product is good for those that do.</li>
            <li> A great product for curly hair that can be out of control without product.  Small amount used and lasts a long time. My daughter lives it and uses it any day she goes natural.</li>
            <li> I first used John Frieda Frizz-Ease serum in high school, when I was still trying to straighten my thick, curly hair.  It was the only thing that made my hair soft.  For several years after high school, I went curly and tried to do the no-shampoo, no-cone thing a la [[ASIN:076115678X Curly Girl: The Handbook]], but my hair never looked that great.  Now I wear it curly all the time, never shampoo it, and use silicone-based products like this one without any problems.  This extra-strength version of the serum is the rock of my hair-care regimen.  I use six pumps of it every day (if that sounds like an outrageous amount, keep in mind that my hair is very thick and reaches my mid-back after curling up).  My hair never feels heavy or greasy unless I use way too much.  My hair is curlier, shinier, and more beautiful than ever since I started using this again, and I get compliments every day which is the best. :-)</li>
            <li> Great for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this product.  I have very thick wavy hair that comes just past my shoulders.  I gave up on straightening it and decided to just go with what God gave me.  The problem with that is that God gave me some really thick hair.  I have a closet full of products that I bought, tried and stored away for another day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works wonders if you follow the directions on the box and not the ones on the bottle.  I can&#x27;t even guess why the directions are different but there you have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my bottle in the shower.  After I squeeze my hair out I flip it over and get two pumps, or a dime size amount, rub my hands together and scrunch it all over from the ends up.  The bottle says something about applying it to wet or TOWEL DRIED hair but I haven&#x27;t done the towel dried way yet.  I don&#x27;t think it would soak into as much hair that way.  Then I put on my towel turbie for a few minutes to soak up some of the water, apply some mousse, and then use my hair dryer and diffuser.  80% drier and I am good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair dries with more defined waves then when I don&#x27;t use it.  I have to say that even after a windy day I am good to go.  I haven&#x27;t noticed \\&quot;heavy hair\\&quot; or greasy hair.  I honestly didn&#x27;t even notice a smell.  I wouldn&#x27;t even consider using this product alone.  I think that you need something else to help your hair out and even John Frieda suggests their mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Dream curl product by them for my \\&quot;second day hair\\&quot;.  I find that it helps \\&quot;reset\\&quot; or redefines the waves after a night of sleeping on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years and it still does what it states. I tried numerous other products to tame the Frizz but John Frieda&#x27;s product beats them all. No heavy buildup of residue either.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best product I&#x27;ve found for my hair, but I&#x27;ve never found one that takes all the frizz out like I&#x27;d want. (I have pretty frizzy naturally curly hair.)  So, I&#x27;ll continue searching, but in the meantime this works pretty well. It&#x27;s a little pricey for the tiny bottle, but it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> Its such a great serum. I apply this serum after straightening my 3b/3c hair with a flat iron. It fixes dryness and keeps the hair together and doesn&#x27;t let it poof up. It helps to keep my hair straight even when i sweat. Adds a beautiful shine to my hair. It smells GREAT! Better than l&#x27;oreal serums. I love love it. Definitely going to continue using and buying this product. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ths stuff is great even for my thin, wavy hair. I&#x27;ve tried many products, CHI Silk Infusion and Aveda Smooth Infusion to name a few and none came close to this one. Even put on dry hair i have not came across any excess weight. My hair was flowier than I would like and soft and managable. Great quality for such price.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product. I am African American and I used to straighten my hair with a relaxer. I used this after washing and conditioning and it helps keep the moisture in my hair. After using a blowdryer to straighten, it comes out soft and straight.  Now I am natural and still use it on my curls. They are soft after adding it to my wet hair and it retains the curls and coils I have. Nice product!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. It holds the frizzes down. I used this before and after I flat iron, blow dry, or curl my hair. Your hair stays in place. It leaves your hair nice and smooth.I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair, this did nothing to help controlte frizz.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm… keeps frizz in place</li>
            <li> I like John Freida regular strength better. This extra strength seems to weigh my hair down, causing greasy strings. I tried applying less but I got the same result. For a long period of time I used Sebastian Laminates. It&#x27;s a bit priceier(is that even a word?} lol. but is worth the extra $.</li>
            <li> I have soft naturally curly hair and as I age its gotten frizzy when it dries.  I apply Frizz-Ease after towel drying and combing out my hair and my hair silky and contained - not straight, the wavy curl is now defined and I can style it easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff</li>
            <li> It makes my hair least frizzy unlike so much products I&#x27;ve used. I have crazy curly hair, so this is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as effective as having one&#x27;s hair straightened but, then again, it&#x27;s not nearly as expensive either.  :-)  A friend recommended this product a few years back and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  My hair is relatively fine and long (below the shoulders) and has a tendency to &#x27;frizz&#x27; with the least bit of humidity.  It doesn&#x27;t tame all of the frizziness on very humid days but it definitely helps reduce some of it.  I rarely give 5 stars but this product deserves all of them!</li>
            <li> I searched for this everywhere and didn&#x27;t realize they&#x27;d changed the bottle until I went to a past order and saw that this was the same thing.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product to bring back some softness and remove some frizziness from recently permed hair.  I haven&#x27;t found any product that works as well.  I use it in conjunction with the Frizz-Ease Wind Down Relaxing Cream.  It only takes a small amount each day to keep hair looking nice.</li>
            <li> Item was bubble wrapped safely and was just as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have thick, unmanageable hair which frequently becomes dry and frizzes up all the time. No serum has worked for me much, but this one worked like a charm. My hair is under control, soft and the frizz is really pretty much gone. I have used it only once as of now, but I have a good feeling about this one. :)</li>
            <li> I have to say the Frizz Ease line of products have been a dream for me!! I have only been using it for about a week now, but I get complimented all the time and I feel great after doing my hair!! It looks great after styling with less time spent on it than before! I used to spend a long time trying to tame my hair and now I just shampoo like normal, use the serum when its wet, style it, then rub some of the smoothing creme on and spray with frizz ease hairspray to lock in the AWESOME :) I spend WAY less time on my hair now and it looks WAY better and stays beautiful ALL day, no matter the weather!! I use the whole line though. I think its amazing and will continue to use it and recommend it! Like the other customer review, Id give it more stars if I could :)</li>
            <li> My hair gets extremely frizzy and I have issues with fly-aways. It was getting to the point of frustration going into work with my hair looking like a frizzy mess. I have noticed since using this product that it helps to calm the frizziness and does give my hair more of a smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, frizzy hair normally, so I picked this up at Walmart on a whim. There is definitely less frizz when I use this serum, but my hair still isn&#x27;t completely tamed, and it still feels pretty dry. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t have as much volume as it normally does. I use this right after getting out of the shower, and even though the bottle says to use one pump, I use 3. My hair isn&#x27;t very thick, but it does go down to about mid-back, and when I used one or two pumps I felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting enough product in my hair. However even with the three pumps, I don&#x27;t feel any residue. I also use it near my roots, even though the bottle says not to, because that&#x27;s where most of my frizziness is (right on the top of my head). I then let my hair air-dry and brush it after it&#x27;s dry. I think next time I&#x27;ll try towel-drying my hair a little before I use the product, and then brushing it to help distribute the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a 3-star product: it helps with my frizz but doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of it, and my hair feels dry and flatter. It&#x27;s still gorgeous, obviously, but not as nice as when I&#x27;ve used other products.</li>
            <li> Excellent, but it looks bigger than it is.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps tame my flyaway ends.  My hair looks shiny and in better shape.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I put about three pumps into my hair after showering. I have extremely curly hair that I struggled with when I was younger. I thought the only way I could fix my hair was to blow dry it straight and wear it like that or my only other option was to have it curly but keep it in a tight ponytail or else it would get frizzy and out of control. After awhile I was sick of straightening my hair day after day, it was time-consuming not to mention all the heat from the tools I was using were giving my hair a dry and fried look and feel.     I was looking for something that would allow my to just have my hair be curly. SO when I first used this product I was able to just wash my curly hair rub the product through and let it dry curly and I LOVE it. This keeps my curls nice and curly there is no frizz and it keeps my hair silky and soft the next day and when I flat iron it.     I took off one star for price because I think its a little much for what you get. I mean this is a very small tube that works off a pump you honestly don&#x27;t get that much for $8.00 and I run through these on the fast side although because of how thick my hair is I use a bit more than it says you have to in the directions.    Also this is something I just am weird about I dont really like putting this on my hands and then finger combing it through my hair. I just dont like the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; texture...but once on the hair ts not sticky or hard or anything.     So if your looking for something to tame your hair keep frizz out this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I use Wen hair products and the one they make is far better and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily... This one didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> I have used it for years - recommend it to all my curly-haired&lt;br /&gt;friends and relatives - even those without.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Thnks first for sending on time .this is the best Product that I ever used for my fuzzy hair. You use on your damp hair . You can leave it till dry or you can style it. Both ways you see how easier and smoother you can style your hair</li>
            <li> Reading all the bad reviews, I have a feeling people are using it wrong. The suggested usage size is far underestimated. You want your hair between damp and wet. Apply liberally and if you&#x27;re going to blow dry - make sure it&#x27;s on a low setting. Overall, this is the only serum that&#x27;s kept my hair from flailing allover the place and looking like a hay stack. I&#x27;d give it more stars if I could... My hair always gets complimented on now. I&#x27;m a guy.</li>
            <li> I use this whenever I wash my hair and it works wonderfully.  I have thick curly hair and after using this, it is so smooth and stays that way for days.  I can only wash my hair every 5 days or so because its so dry and since using this product, it stays smooth and flat for the entire time.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I Have really thick, coarse, wavy hair and this product only helped if I used a bunch at one time.</li>
            <li> I thought this stuff works well enough, but the whole \\&quot;use on soaking wet hair\\&quot; part just doesn&#x27;t fit in with my morning schedule.  I live in a pretty cold climate which requires me to have dry hair before I walk out the door.  But instead of being able to towel dry my hair (or get a goopy towel) I have to sit there and blow dry forever.  It adds about 5 minutes to my morning routine.  Not worth it with all the more convenient products out there.</li>
            <li> No way does this stop frizz well at least not on mine or my daughter&#x27;s hair. I even used it to blow dry my daughters hair and nothing I tried it on my wet curly hair and I was frizz city as usual. The best I can say is that it&#x27;s give you shine but I can get that from almost anywhere. So this will  be my first and last frizz ease purchase.</li>
            <li> I Really loved this serum makes my hair be shining,strong and no frizz!! Soooo good!! I can&#x60;t live without this anymore</li>
            <li> Smells great! Price was just okay, the picture is kind of deceptive because only the purple piece holds product. Still, I like it and it lasts a long time because you only need a little dot of product.</li>
            <li> I like it that is easy to make my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this product. ..I love it for my curly hair ans somtimes I placace it on Grady</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair and I have used this product for years.  Would not consider washing my hair without it</li>
            <li> my hairs super frizzy! but does the job:)</li>
            <li> If you have long thick hair.... and are looking for smooth, silky and heat protected hair.... this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> Love this product, have used it for years on my wiry hair.  I imagine it would be too thick a product on fine hair, but most of us with curly/wiry hair have the thickness to handle it.  Price decent but not great.</li>
            <li> Great price and results.  The silicone feel is a bit strange, but it works great.  I can finally just wake up in the morning and brush my curly hair, knowing a dab of this will make my hair silky and shiny.  I will say though that the packaging isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> I only give this four stars because it is not a healthy product, but it works great for frizz and curls. I put it on a few minutes after combing hair out- works fantastic.</li>
            <li> It smells sooooo good. I used it like 2 or 3 times only and I am mostly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Really helps with the frizz, especially on hot humid days.</li>
            <li> My wife has a hard time keeping the frizz down in her hair. I tried this product, and once again another failed trial. It didn&#x27;t work for her, but that don&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> I used this everyday to tame the frizzies.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it everyday after my shower, and my hair is incredibly soft. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  I&#x27;ve ordered and re-ordered many times.  It works on my stick straight dry hair.  Lots of volume for me</li>
            <li> love this product, my hair is very frizzy especially during the warm months , this product takes care of it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my damaged hair smooth and shiny without making my hair greasy! You don&#x27;t need a lot. I take what&#x27;s left on my hands and use it to soften my skin. I got rid of my other serums. Just wish there was more in the bottle!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it&#x27;s been available for years--for a reason, it&#x27;s great!  A little goes a long way, and for a girl with curly hair, it&#x27;s been a lifesaver.  I always put this on shortly after getting out of the shower.  I use other products afterward, but no matter what, this goes on first--it greatly helps!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products to defrizz my very curly hair over 30 years. I gave this product another try recently and hated it--again. It did not reduce frizzing and left a very oily-silicone coating on my hands I had to wash twice or more to remove. Going back to my old products: Be Curly by Aveda followed by a dime-sized squeeze of Sebastian&#x27;s Texturizer. Good luck, ladies.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for this stuff I&#x27;d have to have very short hair. I&#x27;ve always had coarse, super thick hair that frizzes with or w/o humidity which only gets more so with age. This stuff actually makes it soft and calms the frizz! But, you have to use a whole lot more than they recommend. I&#x27;m not sure you can use too much. Some products if you use too much make your hair look greasy or feel icky, not this stuff. Currently my hair length is midway between my shoulders and ears. I use FIVE pumps of this mixed with a tsp of creme conditioner (the kind you leave in after washing, there are several on the market), mixed in my hand then run through my just washed, towel dried hair. So yes I go through this stuff in a hurry but couldn&#x27;t live without it. Have been able to grow my hair out the last two years because of it, after having very short hair for almost 20 years. Wish they had an economy size!!</li>
            <li> I use this daily with my curly hair.  Keeps my hair curly vs. frizzy.  I also like that it is not sweet smelling like a lot of products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and am very happy with it.  Just rub a little on your hands, then through hair and voila! frizz is gone.</li>
            <li> This product did give my hair shine and helped control most of my frizzies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Frizz Ease serum since the first year it came out, and until now it&#x27;s been one of my favorite styling products. However, with the latest version, it appears the company has changed the formula. The same ingredients are listed on the package in the same order. But I&#x27;ve tried using the product in this new style bottle 3 times now, and it doesn&#x27;t work the way it did before. With the new serum, my hair is very &amp;#34;poufy&amp;#34; and the curls don&#x27;t hold at all. My hair just comes out like a shapeless mess. (Not sure of my exact &amp;#34;hair rating&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m a 4A or 4B, and have extremely frizzy hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless this one bottle I&#x27;ve gotten is mislabeled or defective, I can only guess that the company has changed the amount of one or more  crucial ingredients. I&#x27;m very disappointed that I will no longer be able to use this product, and will now have to spend the time and money to try out new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I won&#x27;t be using this any more, this next comment won&#x27;t affect me, but I also have to say the new packaging is awful. The pump is almost impossible to use. It doesn&#x27;t stick out far enough from the bottle, so the serum dribbles down onto the side of the bottle instead of coming out cleanly. What a mess! A very poor product design. It also looks like it uses a lot more plastic than the previous bottle, which can&#x27;t be a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally considered this a five star product, although I lowered that to four stars when it was changed a few years ago from pleasantly unscented to unpleasantly scented. Now I can only give it one star, sigh, and move on to another product.</li>
            <li> I only use a little bit, put in the palm of my hand, and concentrate on my ends, where I get the most Frizz. It absolutely calmed down my hair, and when I blowed dryed my hair the ends were smoother for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for decades. It&#x27;s the only product that works for my curly hair. Other products would either weigh down my curls or leave them looking greasy or feeling crispy. Just don&#x27;t use too much.  A little goes a lonnngggg way. I have long hair and only use a pump or two max. I also use it to finish my style when I straighten my hair to try to avoid frizz.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using the two-phase, lightweight frizz control serum from John Frieda, and I was pretty happy with it. But I ran out and couldn&#x27;t wait for more to ship, and the local store I shop at didn&#x27;t seem to have any in stock. They did have this, though, so I figured I would give it a try. And I like it even more than the lighter-weight product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waist-length color treated hair. I wear it straight. This product contains some silicones, which I have read are good for straight hair. Silicone-containing shampoos and conditioners have certainly helped me out, so perhaps there is some truth to what I&#x27;ve read. (I can&#x27;t speak for other hair types.) Because my hair is color-treated, it tends to be dry; frizz is what happens when dry hair absorbs moisture from the air and Georgia is certainly humid for much of the year. The silicones in this product coat the hair and keep it from absorbing moisture, which is supposed to reduce frizz. In my case, it definitely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pump about three pumps&#x27; worth into my hand (I have a lot of hair), rub it between my hands, and apply to lightly towel-dried hair. I then run a detangling brush through my hair to more evenly distribute the product, and I let my hair air dry. I do have to use a lot of this stuff, but that&#x27;s to be expected with my hair length. My hair is now softer and shinier than ever, and actually stays flat and straight all day, and the frizz is gone. If your hair is color-treated or otherwise dry and you wear it straight, I highly recommend this product as an anti-frizz measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/1/14: I&#x27;ve tried the new formula (with the silk protein) and the new dispenser. I still think the product is great, but I don&#x27;t like the new bottle. It&#x27;s hard to get product out without it running down the side, and it&#x27;s a bit top-heavy due to the design. However, I still love -- and will continue to buy -- this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.. My hair is curly and once the humidity hits it while straight it gets frizzy. Tried this product along with fructis anti humidity spray and my hair was silky and flowing in the wind. It works! I was shocked but happy. I&#x27;m in Houston and the humidity is horrible but now I can&#x27;t wear my hair straight in the summer</li>
            <li> If only this came in gallon bottle sizes! I love this product but feel that the packaging is bulky and exorbitant for the very small bottle that it holds. John Frieda, Make this in larger bottles for those of us that go through 1+bottle a month. I&#x27;m tired of wasting plastic containers and unnecessary boxes!</li>
            <li> The serum provides shine but not so much for frizz.  I&#x27;m a naturally curly girl who wears a wash and go 90% of the time, applying on damp hair it does nothing for frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and absolutely love the product.  I use when I want to wear my hair curly and its great to help define the curls without frizz.  I apply when my hair is pretty wet, get out of the shower, squeeze excess water out and apply.  I&#x27;ve found even towel drying before applying reduces the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve begun using this religiously every time I wash my hair.  I have dry hair since I color it, and this seems to put some moisture back into it.  When I first started using it, I had a bad frizz problem and this and the conditioning spray took care of it.  I use at least 6 pumps every time so my only complaint is that the bottle isn&#x27;t big enough!  I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The best produkt for frizz hair</li>
            <li> My hair is quick to frizz if I press it with a pressing comb and humidity or sweat makes contact with it.  After using this product along with my new HSI flat iron, I have had NO FRIZZ in humid and damp weather.  Also, my hair did not &#x27;swell up&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that is hard to tame. This works pretty well, and the effects last all day. This was my first time ordering this product from Amazon, and I am not happy with the fact that it was shipped out of the box, in a plastic bag. Not understanding why the description doesn&#x27;t state that it will not come in original packaging.</li>
            <li> please do not buy this it makes your hair smell bad plus it is a waste of money DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Frizz-Ease for 14 years, and love it.  With my first bottle, I always used way too much - my hair was smooth but heavy and dirty/greasy looking.  The bottle emptied fast.  With a little practice, I got the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick, wavy hair, and this is my #1 product.  I section off my hair into 4 parts.  I place a dime(ish)-sized amount of product in my palm and rub my hands together to coat them evenly, then distribute the serum through the section.  Any product left in my hands gets rubbed into the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product (or sometimes the yellow bottle if I&#x27;m going to flat-iron my hair), my hair is smooth as glass and soft as silk.  I don&#x27;t get the wiry puffy blow-outs, I don&#x27;t have frizz, I don&#x27;t have dry ugly ends.  This is not a one-stop product though - no serum is.  I still use hairspray, pomade, etc., as needed.  This just preps my hair for styling, making it look and feel healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from my first year or so, when I was heavy-handed, I don&#x27;t experience build-up in my hair from using this product.  I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair if I&#x27;m blowing it out.  I give bottles away as gifts.  I love this stuff, and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff. I use 4 pumps every day for my curly hair...most people won&#x27;t need as much as me but it is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> This is the best serum I&#x27;ve used, well, tied with Got To Be.  I have weird curly/wavy/straight in the front hair.  It gets really frizzy in humid climates and when it&#x27;s not frizzy just looks dry.  I use this serum and it makes a noticeable difference.  The reason it is not 5 stars is that halfway through the day, the frizz returns with a vengeance.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It helps keep the fuzz away</li>
            <li> I use this on my child&#x27;s curly hair to reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> Great, I use it everyday</li>
            <li> The only thing going for this product is that it is inexpensive.  Maybe it works well for hair that is slightly fizzy, but for thicker Mediterranean hair, it does nothing to help smooth out.  Left my hair looking a little straw-like.  Tried it several times with varying amounts, then ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> I have 4C, relaxer free hair that is dry by nature.  Frizz-Ease Extra Strength gives me the best curl definition of all the silicone serums I have tried!  I add two pumps to sopping wet hair (important!) and I get days of bungee curls when I use it with my Wen leave in.</li>
            <li> Can this be used as a serum after i blowdry my hair? Will it have the same effect?</li>
            <li> It worked very well in my hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this all the time and had a hard time finding it.</li>
            <li> Ditto with the other two John Frieda products I wrote about.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and consequently it&#x27;s also very dry. So I now use a blob of this ON VERY WET HAIR and when it dries it has a rather nice, shiny, soft consistency. At first I didn&#x27;t believe the instructions when it said it should be applied to very wet hair. I&#x27;m stubborn like that. So I honestly wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the results until I finally just happened to have very wet hair at the time of application. Well whaddya know. Yep. Works way better for some reason. Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line, go ahead and go with the wet hair thing. You&#x27;ll like the results a lot better. And I put it on my Subscribe and Save thing so I save a little and have a regular source.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that works for me. I&#x27;m not African-American, just a white chick with very curly/frizzy hair, which is also thick and very dry. I tried straightening it when I was younger, but finally  gave up and just cut it short. Then it was blow drying for an hour or so to get it to look right - which only lasted a day or two and made my hair drier. Frizz-Eaze serum is great stuff! It&#x27;s silicone not grease, so it doesn&#x27;t leave hair looking greasy or dirty - just natural, soft and shiny. I use it on my damp hair after washing, and it dries to natural curls (yay!) not frizz. All I need to do now to care for my hair is have it cut right and use this stuff. It dries naturally and always looks good now without any more effort on my part. Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years! How ever I have drifted off and tried other serums. Nothing else works as great as this one!! I have curly wavy thick dry hair. After washing and conditioning I apply this product blowdry and flat iron. WOW! It leaves my hair flat smooth and shiney!! Not to mention I fights humidity! I was in horrible humid conditions, and my hair didn&#x27;t get big! It stayed flat and straight! I&#x27;m never trying anything else again!</li>
            <li> I used this after i tried many products. I frankly did not have high hopes. it surprised me. It works wonders after taking a bath.</li>
            <li> I love this frizz ease product, it works great with my naturally curly hair. It arrived very fast as well. I recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and frizzy (but not too much)and this product really get the job done and it is not too greasy. I don&#x27;t know how it works with super frizzy and curly hair, but it is pretty good for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Very light formula and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new serum to replace the one I had been using for 4 years.  I researched the best serum for natural african american hair and came across this serum.  I was hesistant because of the price, but luckily it was on sale today.  I used it on my little girl&#x27;s hair who has natural 4a textured hair.  This stuff is a miracle in the bottle - it&#x27;s a keeper.  It gave beautiful results, no frizz on the ends and blow drying and flat ironing was a simple easy process.  It did not however, give her a lot of shine, but did make her hair very soft.  I can&#x27;t wait until I use it on my own hair!</li>
            <li> I have gone off and on using this to see if it actually makes a difference. It does :) Can&#x27;t speak for the price but I will likely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I know they list the amount of ounces. However, the packaging makes it look like you are getting a lot more product. See that little purple vial INSIDE the clear part? No, that&#x27;s not a label. It&#x27;s actually a container that holds the product. And it does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  It leaves your hair feeling silky without a greasy buildup.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Use serum as directed but still can get frizz on the sideof my head. Lots of the product stays on your hands for some reason.</li>
            <li> This works well when your hair gets wet from the rain as well as out the shower.  It is not too greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does what it says.</li>
            <li> Good Product always reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and swear by it.  I have fairly long wavy/curly frizzy hair.  It all depends on the weather and how it is dried as to the end product, but the frizz is dramatically cut down with the use of Frizz-Ease.  I do air dry my hair almost always now because of an injury and even with air drying this product make all the difference.  One thing is make sure you do not get this on your roots, it makes your hair greasy and sometimes feel really dirty.  I try to keep it below my ears and definitely away from the scalp.  I also like the formula that is for heat use and sun protection.  Usually I try and keep at least two bottles on hand at all times, because I never want to run out.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a product that really works for my hair I just love it! The price and product is great I am so glad and happy that I finally purchased it :).</li>
            <li> works great! Smooths out the hair and makes it manageable.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Not the lightest product around, but it does what it says.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I have used store to salon brands. This one beats them all! I use this product after straighten my hair twice a week. Its very easy to use, massages easily into hair, not oily and my hair feels so soft and light. Wish I found this brand sooner!</li>
            <li> Because this is the extra strength serum, you definitely only need less, but it works so well. Definitely tames those flyaways.</li>
            <li> First off some information that might be helpful:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really long (waist level), bleached/color treated, fine, thin, straight hair that tangles very easily and feels more dry than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for any shampoos/conditioners to help me deal with tangles since I would be pulling out tons of hair while brushing every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says to use sparingly, but use more or less depending on hair length and thickness. The first time I applied it, I used three to four pumps (I definitely overkilled it), since I figured I had really long hair. It left my hair feeling really dry and more brittle. After that, I have been using two to three pumps right after I shower, waiting for it to dry (I don&#x27;t usually blow dry my hair), and then brushing it with ease. It definitely took care of the tangles. My hair definitely doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down or greasy (it took a bit of trial and error with the pumps, but I got there lol). There&#x27;s no scent left on my hair. My hair also feels softer after use. I bought this product primarily to help with tangles, but gave it 4 stars because my hair still had frizz, still felt dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Got rid of tangles, softer hair, lightweight&lt;br /&gt;CONS: still some frizz, did not improve pre-existing dryness</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with the classics! When used properly it works really well and takes care of frizz.</li>
            <li> My wife really liked of the John Frieda Frizz-Ease Extra Strength Serum because it met your expectations! Surely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Like the product but can make your hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using frizz ease for years now and would not switch to another brand.  I have coarse frizzy hair and it really tames it down.  I still have to use a curling iron to remove my mass of curls, but it does keep the frizzies in check.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT. LO still buy, EXCELLENT QUALITY AND CAME TO THE SHIPPING TIME.</li>
            <li> Yes, they changed the container.  I had to pass over it a few times before I had that &amp;#34;ah-ha&amp;#34; moment.  If you have naturally wavy or curly hair and you want to tame it or flatout straighten it, you need this stuff.  My hair is long, so a squeeze about the size of a quarter on my palm, rub both palms together then just use my hands and combs to distribute throughout my hair.  I haven&#x27;t found anything that comes this darn close to taming your &#x27;do.  Using more is not better, you will wind up looking greasy.  That is actually good, because you will have more good hair days using just the right amount.</li>
            <li> I have found no better product to tame my coarse frizzy hair than John Frieda Frizz-Ease. Delighted to find it here as my local Ulta is regularly out of stock.</li>
            <li> For anyone who needs a real weapon against unwanted curl and or frizz, this is like the magic bullet!!I have tried every thing, this is the only one that really does work.</li>
            <li> As I get older and my hair turns grey, this product offers a solution to that dry, brittle look.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and it helps control the &amp;#34;fly aways.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great for frizzy hair, i use it after drying my hair and it takes off the frizz, which makes my hair easier to comb.</li>
            <li> Works very nicely on thick wavy hair. I always had the problem with fizziness so this was a great find for me !&lt;br /&gt;This makes my hair look shiny and smooth ! No more frizz-ease ! :)</li>
            <li> I first used this product in 2006 after a friend of mine with armpit length afro hair suggested it to me. She would probably have 3c type hair. She would use it in combination with Redken Anti-snap. I do not know the details of what shampoo or conditioner she used.&lt;br /&gt;To blow dry, she used high heat with a paddle brush and then used a GHD flat iron. I prefer to allow my hair to air dry for about 5 mins after applying the leave ins. I then use low heat in combination with a detangling brush primarily when very wet. Once 50% dry, I use the paddle brush to smooth the hair down (in sections). Following this, I use my GHD or High Shine Remington Flat Iron (no higher than 190C) and do this process only once a week - 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve been looking for other alternative leave ins but so far have needed to use more than one (mixing Macademia Healing oil, Giovanni&#x27;s Frizz be gone and a heat protectant). I tried Aphogee&#x27;s Leave In Spray and Neutrogena Triple Silk Leave in and they did nothing for my head of hair. Quite frankly, I notice a difference when drinking more water (as a general rule and taking supplements. I would say drinking 2-3 L of water a day (under a gallon) is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;One supplement which is key for many women in growing their hair is Mineral Rich Liquid supplement with or without Aloe. Minimize your processed sugar/carb content and watch the difference in your hair.</li>
            <li> It was the same as stores. It just cost less. Great product and I would recomend it to me friends</li>
            <li> I have been using this foryears on my straight, thin hair and it works really well. Especially if you dont have time to straighten, use a half a dime size and it will defrizz in an instant. IT also lasts so long, you hardly need any to make it work its magic.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use one \\&quot;squirt\\&quot; and comb it through my hair with my fingers before blow drying.  It just gives some body to my very thin hair.  Be sure to use just one \\&quot;push\\&quot; or you will find it too greasy.</li>
            <li> WHO is that model on the TV ADS currently running?? I don&#x27;t think that is even a girl. Looks like some guy out of a horror show with wig(s). I already use this product successfully but that ad is scary. There is a fight for the remote every time it comes on - can&#x27;t turn it off fast enough.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. But I noticed it contains a blend of silicones. An ingredient I have been trying to avoid. Long term use of silicones has a drying affect on ones hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great!, thumbs up! would definitely buy again! came super quick and in a timely fashion...great for taming the fly aways!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, but be careful. A little too much can make the hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful that my coarse, wiry, moderately curly hair would be tamed enough with this product to not need mousse and gel products anymore. So I used about 16 squirts (instead of 1 as per the instructions) and let my hair air-dry. Then I showed my husband and said, \\&quot;Look, it&#x27;s not frizzy anymore.\\&quot; And he laughed. Because it was quite an impressive, frizzy afro (for a white girl). My results were not at all as pictured.    So I&#x27;m back to mousse and gel, but I continue to use the serum (just 4 drops at a time, though). My hair is much smoother, plus, I don&#x27;t have to use as much mousse and gel, leaving my hair soft to the touch. And it seems the longer I use the serum, the more build-up it creates and the more smooth my hair is. I&#x27;ll continue to use it, but I might not buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Cant tell if it works or there is less humidity</li>
            <li> very good, I use it for 15 yrs.</li>
            <li> I apply this while still in the shower. My hair feels so soft and silky the next day! A total keeper!!!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> great product love it</li>
            <li> I have naturally (ringlet) curly hair and this doesnt do anything but dry it out like blowing tumbleweed....  If you&#x27;ve got real curl this wont help at all..  Unless you want to walk around like a 50&#x27;s grease head</li>
            <li> I used to say I would marry John Frieda for inventing this product. I still love and use it but as new products come out I have grown to love argon oil better as a right out of the shower hair elixir. But I still use this on my frizziest parts of my hair. Which is in the back and underneath. My hair is wild and this does a good job of taming it.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is fine, so I use a small amount after I get out of the shower. It helps detangle and smooth split ends.</li>
            <li> My Mom has natural, extremely curly, thick hair that loves to frizz. I cut and style her hair most of the time and from dealing with it personally,  freshly washed on a windy day she looks like she put her finger in an electric socket.  I say it with love.  I found this for her by accident. She has used regular frizz-ease for years and it works fairly well but this Extra Strength works so much better for her.  She uses it ever time she washes her hair along with a leave in conditioner and the frizz is much, much better.  Her curls stay intact longer and look better than they ever have.  I use a little tiny bit on my own hair once in a while and it&#x27;s a bit to heavy for my own for the most part naturally straight hair. But for thick hair with frizz, perfection.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace another serum by John Frieda that i loved using ( sadly, it&#x27;s been discontinued). Works well for my dry, processed hair.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair, and this product has helped me tame it and redefine its mild curls. I am quite glad I bought it and waited for it. I prefer to use it directly on my hands and not on the brush, because it seems more economical to me. Also, it helps me control better how I apply it. I&#x27;m not sure how this serum would behave if I were to straighten my hair with an iron, I haven&#x27;t tried it because I know my hair becomes a mess at the slightest modification of air humidity. I don’t like that it&#x27;s small however, it doesn&#x27;t last and that&#x27;s too bad.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is the only serum that&#x27;s kept my hair from flailing everywhere. Honestly, sometimes I look like |I have a hay stack on my head. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d give this more stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Frizz ease and No Frizz work really well to lump on your hair in a hurry and make it look better. But I have been using it long term for 4 months on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it is a nightmare. This stuff dries the hair out with its harsh chemicals. Then you use more and more, as it gets drier and drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s hair looks so frizzy, it&#x27;s pitiful. We are going to return to at least the no-chemical part of the curly girl method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, this stuff is flammable and not water soluble, a bunch was dumped on her hair things and they are ruined. I can&#x27;t get the oil out of them.</li>
            <li> You should not have to filled this stupid box out.  Thanks in advance for removing this stupid and senseless requirements!</li>
            <li> i use this everytime i wash my hair and it helps with all the frizz, i love it and would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, a little greasy, one finished will go back to the other product. The only problem is that the other product is $4.00 more on Amazon, looks like I just might have to go to the store</li>
            <li> i really like this product I always put it on after I wash my hair and it leaves my hair looking smooth and straight. I had a problem with always having really poofy and frizzy hair and this solved my problem.</li>
            <li> My hair is so coarse and dry, but this product really makes my hair look so much better. I have been using this product forever. I have tried other more expensive brand serums but this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I am african American with natural hair and all I have to do is useca little and it bans frizz and leaves my hair feeling so moisturized and soft during straightening</li>
            <li> works well against frizz, leaves hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel so soft. I apply it before I use a flat iron and.....IT FEEL SO FREAKIN&#x27; SOFT!! Just one pump is enough....since I have super thick hair this surprised me. This product is EXCELLENT and lasts me at least 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Hubby&#x27;s favorite stuff outside of the $150 a bottle from other names....His hair curly, getting thin at 69.  If he likes it, it has to be good.</li>
            <li> Works really well for me. I live in a very hot, humid area and my hair will stay straight and smooth all day. My hair is a bit on the coarse side and the ends split easily, and this makes it look much better. A little goes a long way though, and for fine hair you might want to try the original formula first. I use about a nickel-sized amount (my hair is very long, it reaches the small of my back) and divide my hair into sections to apply it so it goes on more evenly. And since it only takes a tiny bit, my $10 bottle has lasted me a good six months of almost daily use. If you&#x27;re worried about the drying effect of silicone, John freida also makes a really good leave-in conditioner spray. I usually use it with the serum since my ends can get pretty dry as my hair is so long. All in all, a good value for a good product.</li>
