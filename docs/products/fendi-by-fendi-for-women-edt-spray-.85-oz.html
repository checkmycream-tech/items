            <li>my sister is jumping for joy she loves it</li>
            <li>Warm, spicy and expotic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most beautiful smelling scent ever!</li>
            <li>Came within a good time limit.</li>
            <li>Service was good tho.</li>
            <li>Great scent and not too floral or over the top &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love Fendi!</li>
            <li>then follow with just one dab of the tea rose.....</li>
            <li>but when I am wearing it I feel more confident, taller and sexier.</li>
            <li>I love it now.</li>
            <li>The scent was not the one that I had come to love.</li>
            <li>I WANT MORE OF THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>...am so pleased with it I have almost gotten over Fendi not being produced now.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorites and i was not disappointed !</li>
            <li>I have been with the original Fendi since 1987!  </li>
            <li>It was a bit strong to my usualy liking, but guess what, when it dries up it transformes into warming, sort of velvet and sexy scent.</li>
            <li>rose by perfumers workshop spritz on the AE first..</li>
            <li>It has a good fragrance to it that is soft and mellow- just not the one that I am use to smelling before Fendi decided to discontinue making this brand for women.  </li>
            <li>mas tenho a impressão que o que recebi não é original.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the original several years ago.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the large cologne, and have not been able to find it in 3 years.  </li>
            <li>I wondered if it really was/is original Fendi.</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received it as a gift and didn&#x27;t like it at first.</li>
            <li>I was able to obtain my favorite perfume but the size is to small for the cost.</li>
            <li>I would love a bigger jar but not so costly</li>
            <li>it will smell exactly like Fendi..</li>
            <li>THE REAL FENDI</li>
            <li>but my FENDI is not the same notes as the original.</li>
            <li>I thought it was the larger size I originally bought.</li>
            <li>I cannot understand why twice as much of something used to cost me half as much - but I love the product</li>
            <li>and I was lucky enough to find a bottle.</li>
            <li>This second bottle is NOT the same original scent that I first purchased.</li>
            <li>Please pass on to Fendi that everyone is quite upset that the new Fendi does not smell like it did in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I now have one more small bottle of &amp;#34;MY SCENT&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell the same when I first apply it</li>
            <li>Love it, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find.</li>
            <li>It either smells old or the scent has changed.</li>
            <li>This bottle had a different fragrance -- it may be that it was old stock since it is not in production.  </li>

            <li> I was VERY disappointed when I compared it to my other bottles of the same.</li>
            <li> This is a weird description</li>
            <li> fake,fake fake don&#x27;t buy it</li>

            <li> Not as good as the original several years ago. Smells musty</li>
            <li> I have been a lover of this perfume for years and this is definitely not it is fake,fake fake don&#x27;t buy it you are going to be disappointed and out of  your money</li>
            <li> Total rip off. I wore Fendi for years and the scent in this bottle is diluted home cleaner with sandalwood. So disappointing, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time when it was expected.  The bottle is a little small for the price. Also it is not the same fragrance smell that I remember.  It has a good fragrance to it that is soft and mellow- just not the one that I am use to smelling before Fendi decided to discontinue making this brand for women.  But I will keep it so that I can have a different fragrance in my collections of perfumes.  It is a keeper</li>
            <li> I love Fendi! I was so saddened that it was discontinued, but you can find it occasionally and I was lucky enough to find a bottle. Warm, spicy and expotic! It&#x27;s the most beautiful smelling scent ever!</li>
            <li> Please pass on to Fendi that everyone is quite upset that the new Fendi does not smell like it did in the 80&#x27;s. It either smells old or the scent has changed. PLEASE MAKE IT THE WAY IT USED TO SMELL. I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING IT UNTIL I KNOW IT HAS CHANGED BACK!</li>
            <li> It was definitely not genuine...just the wrong scent in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I WANT MORE OF THIS PRODUCT AND I LOVE THE SMELL FENDI PLEASE KEEP THIS PRODUCT ON THE MARKET........... THE REAL FENDI I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> if you are a fendi lover...do this buy a bottle of aromatics elixer by clinique buy a bottle of tea rose by perfumers workshop spritz on the AE first..then follow with just one dab of the tea rose.....ps just bought a bottle of Estee lauder wood mystique. ...am so pleased with it I have almost gotten over Fendi not being produced now. it will smell exactly like Fendi..I did it and it does actually compare.</li>
            <li> I have been with the original Fendi since 1987!  Every time I wear this fragrance, everyone asks me what it is.  This is my signature fragrance.  It is subtle, not floral, and lasts forever.  The only problem seems to be is that it is scarce to purchase.  I have been looking for the large cologne, and have not been able to find it in 3 years.  Does anyone else know where to find it?&lt;br /&gt;It is the best fragrance I&#x27;ve ever used!!!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it should.</li>
            <li> does not smell  the the same</li>
            <li> O produto é ótimo, mas tenho a impressão que o que recebi não é original. Chegou com a caixa entre aberta e o spray não tem pressão.</li>
            <li> I cannot understand why twice as much of something used to cost me half as much - but I love the product so don&#x27;t mind being gouged......</li>
            <li> Item opened, no shrink wrap, smelled diluted.</li>
            <li> my sister is jumping for joy she loves it</li>
            <li> Met all expectations.</li>
            <li> Thank God I now have one more small bottle of &amp;#34;MY SCENT&amp;#34; . I have used it for about 20+ years, cannot find it anywhere from Bannf, Canada to MS, LA, ALA. This second bottle is NOT the same original scent that I first purchased. I am so disappointed. The box looks the same but my FENDI is not the same notes as the original.</li>
            <li> Love this. Shipped super fast and was exactly what I was looking for. Great scent and not too floral or over the top &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> Came within a good time limit. I thought it was the larger size I originally bought. Doesn&#x27;t smell the same when I first apply it but in an hour it tones down. I wondered if it really was/is original Fendi. Service was good tho.</li>
            <li> I have used orginal Fendi by Fendi for years.  This bottle had a different fragrance -- it may be that it was old stock since it is not in production.  I was VERY disappointed when I compared it to my other bottles of the same.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed because the smell of the Fendi almost had the old smell to it!</li>
